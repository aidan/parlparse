 Turkey&#146;s recent parliamentary and presidential elections have delivered a strong popular mandate to the AK party to continue with a programme of reform and economic development in that country. That has sent out a strong signal about Turkey&#146;s commitment to democracy both in Turkey and elsewhere in the Muslim world. When I went to Turkey on 5 September I made it clear that the UK remains committed to supporting Turkey&#146;s modernisation and its EU accession. I am confident that the new Turkish Government will be positive partners for the UK and the EU.</p>

 I am happy to confirm that the British Council is active in Ankara and across Turkey; when I was there, I participated in a seminar that it organised. I think that the school twinning is now supported by the Department for Children, Schools and Families, which has a special website for international twinning operations. The increasing engagement of Turkish business with business across the EU and indeed globally is a positive sign. I might add in parentheses that Turkey&#146;s commitment to helping to support the development of a stable and peaceful Iraq is also an important indication of the way in which Turkey wants to fulfil its international responsibilities.</p>

 I find that a peculiar question, given that we have just been through a referendum&#151;<i> [Laughter.] </i>That is the next question. We have just been through an election campaign in Turkey&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I do not want hon. Members to use their best lines before a later question. We have just been through an election campaign in Turkey, in which PKK terrorism was a serious threat to southern Turkey, and the governing party&#146;s restraint in refusing to undertake the sort of activities to which the hon. Member for Louth and Horncastle (Sir Peter Tapsell) referred was a marked feature of that campaign. Although he talks about the imminence of some sort of Turkish invasion of northern Iraq, it would be better to commend the Turkish Government on their restraint and say that we want to work with them, and that we want the Iraqi Government to work with them and to make sure that we crack down on that dangerous terrorism in northern Iraq.</p>

 Obviously, I discussed relations with Cyprus when I was in Turkey. The fairest thing to say is that there are responsibilities on both sides. My hon.

The 8 July UN process that has now been started needs to be followed through, with responsibilities on both the Turkish and Cypriot sides.</p>

 When I was in Turkey I talked with the Turkish Government about the terrorism that they face; we all know about the Istanbul bombing, which claimed many lives. The political implications are twofold. First, we need enhanced security co-operation, including with the Turks, and that is taking place. Secondly, we need to send out a very strong message that those who would seek to plant bombs anywhere in Europe will affect people of all religions and none, and that is why it is in all our interests to make sure that we work together against them.</p>

 Unusually, the hon. Gentleman gives good advice from a sedentary position. There is a sentence that needs to be changed, and I have spoken to the chief executive of UKTI about that. However, many British and European companies in Iran are trading within the law imposed by sanctions. UKTI gives them advice and tries to help them to ensure that they do not encroach beyond the law, which is an important function. I quite agree, however, that the regime in Tehran is obnoxious, and we must do everything that we can to put pressure on it to ensure that it changes those policies.</p>

 We have always maintained diplomatic relations with Iran, unlike the United States. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has met the Iranian Foreign Minister, and we have had many discussions with the Iranians. The E3 plus 3 has made offers to Iran which, by any definition, are very generous and sensible. We have offered, for example, to help them with a civil nuclear programme, but they have rejected those offers. They have constantly played for time, and they are developing&#151;as far as I believe on the intelligence that we have been given&#151;a nuclear bomb programme. They have enriched uranium with that in view, which is something that we cannot ignore&#151;it is extremely important. In my view, it is one of the most serious difficulties that the world faces at the moment, because if the Iranians develop a nuclear bomb, there will be proliferation across the world, as others will want to develop nuclear bombs.</p>

 At the centre of this debate is the status of the charter of fundamental rights. The timely and useful report from the European Scrutiny Committee raises a number of issues about it.

On reflection, does the Foreign Secretary believe that the current text is robust enough? Will he ensure that we get a stronger set of words before the final treaty is developed?</p>

It is extremely important that we pay attention to that, and I think that we have a good record of trying to do so. However, we can introduce any plan for economic reconstruction that we like, but if we cannot get the politics fixed, we will never build a house or a road in Gaza, or do any of the things for the infrastructure that we want to do.

 The Government&#146;s case relies almost entirely on the effectiveness of the red lines, but today&#146;s report from the European Scrutiny Committee makes it clear that there may well be an argument that the charter of fundamental rights will apply to the UK.

That is a very strong legal protection indeed.</p>

 Sorry about that, but my point of order related to the fact that the documents to which I referred were not in the Vote Office yesterday, and they were not there before Prayers today. They should be available so that we can quiz the Foreign Secretary tomorrow afternoon, not only in the Chamber but in the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. Will the Minister ensure that the legislation on this is not so narrowly drawn and crafted that we cannot table an amendment that is acceptable to the Table Office relating to the ability to have a referendum?

 On the specific point about publications and paperwork being available, it is certainly my understanding, and that of the Foreign Secretary, that that material was placed in the Libraries of the House of Commons and the House of Lords on Friday last week, when it became available. I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that, throughout this process in recent months, we have shared with his Committee and others all the material as it became available. On his wider point about the breadth of the Bill, the House has a long tradition of enabling European Bills to be amended in relation to calls for a referendum. After all, one third of those currently on the Conservative Front Bench voted against such a referendum on Maastricht. As I have said before, and am happy to say again, it would certainly be our intention&#151;with your permission, of course, Mr. Speaker; it is entirely a matter for your discretion&#151;to craft the Bill widely enough so that an amendment calling for a referendum on the reform treaty could take place.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary was recording a statement of fact. The Select Committee report was drafted and went to publication before the legal text was available. That was my right hon. Friend&#146;s point. The differences between the old constitutional treaty and the reform treaty are very clear. Every member state has moved away from the old constitutional approach and it is quite clear that it is the end for those who had a federalist dream or a federalist vision for Europe.

 My hon. Friend is giving yet another reminder of why he left the Opposition Benches and joined us. Opposition Members scowl and dismiss. Euroscepticism is now a mainstream ideology for the Conservative party. The reform treaty provides, for the first time, an opportunity to unblock decision making. It will give the United Kingdom and the European Union the capacity to deliver change and effective improvements on one of the biggest issues facing the EU. That is one of the important parts of the reform treaty. It is one of the reasons why Labour Members support it so wholeheartedly.</p>

<a name="ordayhd_0"><a name="71009-0004.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="07100936000421"><h5 align="left">3.31 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o111"><a name="07100936000162"><a name="71009-0004.htm_spmin0"><a name="07100936000547"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Alistair Darling):</b>
 Today I can present the pre-Budget report and the conclusions of the comprehensive spending review. The background to this year&#146;s report and spending review is a time of increased international economic uncertainty and a more fragile global environment which has already seen turbulence in America, Asia and Europe. The theme of this year&#146;s pre-Budget report is that, provided we maintain the course for economic stability that we have set, we can respond to that global environment. We will do so by taking no risks with stability and no risks with unaffordable promises that put the public finances at risk. We can respond as well to the rising aspirations of the British people, and we can do that by taking the right long-term decisions for our country. Today I will set out how we will maintain that stability and strong economy, meet our international obligations, improve our public services and invest more in the highest standard of education and health care, and equip our country for the future as we meet these new global challenges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07100936000163">Let me start with the economic figures. In March, inflation had risen to over 3 per cent. but decisive action has brought it down to below our target of 2 per cent., and I am able to forecast that inflation will again be on target next year and the year after. We are determined to hold firm to our economic framework, which has proved resilient over the past 10 years and which we can be confident will do so now and in the future. While this year growth in America is expected to be 2 per cent., in Japan 2.3 per cent. and in the euro area 2.6 per cent., growth in Britain&#151;with exports and investment rising and employment at record levels&#151;is expected to be 3 per cent. this year: Britain, the fastest growing major advanced economy in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07100936000164">That underlying strength of the economy will stand us in good stead as we face the current international instability that started in the American mortgage market and has now spread across the world. The full impact of turbulence in the international financial markets is as yet unclear. The House will rightly want to discuss in some detail the current international instability and its effect on Northern Rock, and I intend to make a full statement to the House later this week. The International Monetary Fund has said that this international uncertainty will have an effect on growth right across the world, and independent forecasters expect growth next year in America, the euro area and Japan to fall to 2 and 21/2 per cent. In those circumstances, it is right that we, too, are cautious. So my forecast for growth next year is also 2 to 21/2 per cent. <i> [Interruption.] </i>But because of the strength of our economy, our commitment to openness and liberalised trade across the world&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2007 : Column 168</b><br>
here at home, that my forecast for growth in 2009 and 2010 is 21/2 to 3 per cent., in line with the economy&#146;s trend rate of growth and in line with the Budget forecast.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07100936000167">We can afford sustained investment in our priorities only because of our two fiscal rules that ensure sound public finances. I can report that last year, borrowing was 2.3 per cent. of national income&#151;&#163;4 billion less than forecast. I can also report that debt was 36.7 per cent., also less than forecast. Over the past 10 years of this economic cycle, borrowing and debt in Britain have been lower than in Japan, the euro area, America and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development area as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07100936000168">I can tell the House that we are meeting our first fiscal rule with the current budget and surplus over the cycle. In the previous economic cycle, from 1986 to 1997, that rule was missed, with a deficit of &#163;240 billion. But over this cycle, with a current budget deficit last year lower than forecast, we have a surplus of &#163;18 billion and we are therefore meeting our first fiscal rule. Even taking into account the impact of what is happening in the financial markets, we have a current balance going forward of minus &#163;8 billion this year, then minus &#163;4 billion, then surpluses of &#163;3 billion, &#163;9 billion, &#163;14 billion and &#163;20 billion by 2012-13. So we will meet our rule in the next cycle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07100936000169">We will also meet our second rule that net debt should be at a sustainable level. In America, debt is 44 per cent. It is 49 per cent. across the euro area, 86 per cent. in Japan and 94 per cent. in Italy. The figures in Britain are 37.6 per cent. this year and then 38.4 per cent., 38.8 per cent., 38.9 per cent., 38.8 per cent., and 38.6 per cent. in 2012, so meeting our second fiscal rule. Debt interest was 31/2 per cent. of national income in 1997. Next year, it is expected to be just 2 per cent. That low debt allows more investment in front-line services. Net borrowing is forecast to fall from 2.7 per cent. this year to 1.3 per cent. in 2012, compared with a peak in 1993 of almost 8 per cent.&#151;the equivalent of &#163;110 billion today. The measures that I am taking in this pre-Budget report allow fiscal policy to support the economy while ensuring that the fiscal rules are met. As a result, net borrowing is forecast to fall from &#163;38 billion this year to &#163;23 billion in 2012.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07100936000170">In this cycle and the next we are meeting both our fiscal rules: borrowing not for current consumption, but for investment in Britain&#146;s priorities. As the Prime Minister made clear in the Budget earlier this year, this spending review is tighter for many Departments&#151;all the more reason to identify increased efficiencies and savings. The spending review has identified substantial savings that can be made by Departments. Building on the &#163;20 billion already achieved, Departments will save a further &#163;30 billion by 2010. That is money available for reinvestment in public services. In addition to that, asset sales in four years&#146; time will have reached &#163;36 billion, reducing debt and releasing further resources. Departmental plans will be published, setting out in detail how these savings will be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07100936000171">We are also seeing the rewards that can come from a successful economy and record levels of employment. Just under a decade and a half ago, as much as three quarters of all new public spending was spent on debt and social security costs. The figure for this spending review will be a third of that. Today I can announce that, because unemployment continues to fall, we will  <br>

spend &#163;400 million less than forecast in each year of the spending review on the costs of economic failure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07100936000172">Those three elements&#151;a strong economy, sound public finances and efficiencies&#151;make possible the investment that I can announce today. Departmental spending will rise from &#163;345 billion this year to &#163;397 billion in 2010. Departmental spending is published today; investment will be matched by reform and clear objectives, set out in new public service agreements, which we are also publishing today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07100936000173">Let me now turn to our proposals. The foremost duty of any Government is protecting our country. The whole House will want to join me in acknowledging the dedication and courage of our armed forces in action overseas, including in Iraq and Afghanistan. To support our armed forces and all that they do, I am today allocating an additional &#163;400 million for operations this year. That is on top of the increase in the defence budget to &#163;37 billion by 2010 that will provide over &#163;500 million-worth of investment for improvements in accommodation for members of the armed forces and their families. In the mid-1990s, defence spending was cut by 20 per cent. This settlement is the longest period of rising investment in the defence of our country for almost 30 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07100936000174">Matching our commitment to international security with international diplomacy, we will increase the Foreign Office budget, including spending &#163;460 million in 2010 on the British Council, the BBC World Service and the launch of the BBC Farsi and Arabic TV channels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07100936000175">The terrorist attacks in July 2005 and the attacks since remind us all of the constant threat to our security here in Britain, and of the critical importance of our police and security services. Since 2001, spending on security and intelligence has more than doubled to &#163;21/2 billion a year. I can now announce a new single budget that brings together the work of the police, the security services and all parts of the Government responsible for addressing the threat from terrorism. The budget for the intelligence agencies will continue its historic real-terms growth since 2001, with real growth over this period of 9.6 per cent. a year. I can announce that the single budget will rise every year over the next three years&#151;a rise of &#163;1 billion in total, to &#163;31/2 billion a year in three years&#146; time. That is a trebling in cash terms in a single decade. It also includes &#163;700 million over the next three years for the Home Office for its work in combating the terrorist threat. Overall, I am allocating additional resources to the Home Office and Ministry of Justice that will now rise to &#163;20 billion by 2010, as we guarantee neighbourhood policing in every community, build 9,500 extra prison places and finance over &#163;400 million in technology to strengthen our border security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07100936000176">Our ability to compete and succeed in the global age will depend on our competitiveness and continuing investment in our economy. Britain&#146;s future success will depend on investment not just in physical capital but in skills, innovation and intellectual property. I am publishing today a new analysis which shows that Britain could now be investing as much in those areas as the United States of America. That means that almost &#163;250 billion a year&#151;up to a quarter of today&#146;s income&#151;is being invested in the priorities essential for securing tomorrow&#146;s prosperity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07100936000177">Lord Sainsbury&#146;s science review reported last week, and I can confirm that investment in science and university research will rise to over &#163;6 billion a year in three years&#146; time. That will help to ensure that British research and industry are brought closer together to develop the new products and services that the world wants to buy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07100936000178">Britain has more Nobel prize winners than any country outside the US. Yesterday, another prize was awarded for medical research, and that is testament to Britain&#146;s continued scientific success, which is recognised across the world. So that more British medical discovery can be translated into new health drugs, treatments and preventions, I can today announce that I am funding in full the recommendations of Sir David Cooksey&#146;s review. We will expand the single fund for health research to &#163;1.7 billion by 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07100936000179">In the past, we paid a heavy price as a country for failing to invest when it was necessary, particularly in transport. We are putting that right and will double investment. By 2010, it will rise to &#163;141/2 billion a year, providing extra money for strategic road schemes such as the widening of the M1 and M6, and &#163;1.3 billion a year for improving local and regional transport across the country. In addition, we will double the amount that we spend over the next two years on upgrading the national rail network, ahead of a further &#163;15 billion for railways over the following five years. This also provides for the construction of Crossrail, which will be the largest transport project since the channel tunnel and essential for the competitiveness of not just the City of London but the whole country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para15"><a name="07100936000180">However, because transport requires investment year after year and decade after decade, I am extending to 2018 the long-term funding guideline of annual growth of 21/4 per cent. above inflation. That is possible only because of our commitment and ability to fund those long-term improvements. I am also today publishing proposals to give local authorities the power to set a business rate supplement for investment and local economic development, so that with their support they can provide opportunities for business expansion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para16"><a name="07100936000181">Making Britain one of the best places in the world to do business also demands a modern tax regime based on three clear principles: that our system is competitive, simple and fair. I confirm that the main rate of corporation tax will be cut by 2p to 28p next year. That is the lowest in the G7.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para17"><a name="07100936000182">Working with business, we need to do more. I am announcing three reviews proposing simplification to the tax system that will let 3 million self-employed people pay their tax and national insurance contributions more easily and 500,000 businesses reduce their paperwork by removing a separate payroll. Taken together with other measures that I am proposing today, that will save British business up to &#163;100 million a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para18"><a name="07100936000183">The capital gains tax regime here has continued to encourage investment and enterprise.

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para19"><a name="07100936000184">I can tell the House that the changes that I propose to capital gains tax also, taken together with the tax loopholes that I am closing, will ensure that those working in private equity pay a fairer share. So from April next year I will withdraw the capital gains tax taper relief and in its place there will be just one rate of 18 per cent.&#151;one of the most competitive single rates of any major economy. I am also proposing measures to combat income shifting, vehicle excise duty evasion, and to tackle the exploitation of national insurance exemptions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para20"><a name="07100936000185">I believe that it is right that everyone who lives and works here should pay their fair share. I therefore propose to close a number of loopholes which have allowed some people to avoid taxes that everyone else has to pay. Non-domiciled taxpayers already pay about &#163;4 billion on their earnings. Any proposal for change has to be fair, workable and affordable. I can tell the House that I have examined proposals to impose a flat-rate annual charge of &#163;25,000 on 150,000 non-domiciled taxpayers, which it is claimed would raise &#163;31/2 billion. There are in fact only 115,000 registered non-domiciles. I can tell the House, too, that if the charge of &#163;25,000 were imposed, only an estimated 15,000 of those would earn sufficient money abroad to make it worth while to maintain non-domiciled status.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para21"><a name="07100936000186">As a result, the combined effect of people paying this charge or changing their tax status would be revenue not of &#163;3.5 billion but of only &#163;650 million a year at most&#151;a shortfall of more than &#163;2 billion. In addition to that, such a charge could discourage men and women&#151;doctors and nurses, business men and women&#151;from coming to this country in the short term. Such men and women do pay tax on their earnings here, and do contribute to the country&#146;s wealth, and we do not want to turn them away. So I will now consult with a view to early legislation on an alternative route. As a first step, we will introduce a charge after seven years, then a higher rate after 10. We will prevent people claiming that they are out of the country when they are actually here, from disguising income as capital and from claiming in effect two allowances; and for completeness we will introduce a flat-rate charge for everyone. Those measures will raise an average of &#163;650 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para22"><a name="07100936000187">The two great challenges for this generation are the need to tackle climate change and poverty across the world. So alongside the pre-Budget report I am publishing the next stage of the implementation of the Stern review, setting out how Britain is meeting its environmental obligations. We are the only country to have met our Kyoto obligations. We have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by almost a fifth since 1990.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="71009-0004.htm_para23"><a name="07100936000188">Next month, when the climate change Bill comes before the House, we will become the first country to introduce legislation on binding carbon targets. I am today increasing the budget for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to &#163;4 billion in three years&#146; time to help us tackle climate change and protect the countryside. I can confirm that that includes provision of &#163;800 million a year by 2010 for flood defences. We now need to move further and faster on the next stage of the European emissions trading scheme. As part of that, we propose to increase significantly the use of the auctioning of carbon allowances, as we move further towards a low-carbon future.</p>

I will bring forward proposals in the Budget, after Professor King&#146;s final report, on ways to encourage the next generation of cleaner cars and incentives for people to buy them.</p>

In 1997, we devoted just &#163;2 billion&#151;a quarter of 1 per cent. of our national income&#151;to development aid. That figure today is over &#163;5 billion, and today I can announce that overseas aid will rise again to &#163;9 billion by 2010. In doing so, we will meet our commitment to double multilateral and bilateral aid to Africa from 2004 to 2010. That puts us on course to meet our European commitment of 0.5 per cent. of national income devoted to development aid by 2010; and then to meet our commitment to achieve, for the first time, the United Nations goal of 0.7 per cent by 2013.

We believe that helping people into work is the best way of cutting child poverty and providing opportunity, which is why we shall continue to support the new deal. For the first time in 30 years, the number of people on incapacity benefit is falling, with almost 100,000 people taken off the incapacity benefit roll in the past two years.

In respect of capital gains tax, there is currently transferability between spouses, to recognise the fact that capital assets are built up jointly over a lifetime. In inheritance tax, there is currently 100 per cent. spouse relief over a lifetime, but there is no transferability of allowances. I want to ensure that husbands and wives can benefit from each other&#146;s unused inheritance tax exemptions, so I will raise the total amount of inheritance for married couples on which no tax is paid, and this will apply to civil partnerships, too. I can announce that, from today, the combined tax-free allowance for their estates will not be the current &#163;300,000, but up to &#163;600,000. By 2010, the combined tax-free allowance for couples will rise to &#163;700,000.

If I was to raise the inheritance tax threshold to &#163;1 million, it would cost a further &#163;2 billion. I found that, under that proposal, &#163;1 billion would go to estates worth more than &#163;950,000&#151;the top 1 per cent.&#151;only.

Instead, I am able to raise the inheritance tax allowance and invest more in schools and hospitals for the British people. That means, in education, helping to build a new primary school in every local area by 2010. In health, when added to its budget, this will deliver 20 new hospitals, 140 new walk-in centres open seven days a week, and 100 new GP practices.

From this day on, let there be no doubt about who is winning the battle of ideas in Britain. If the Prime Minister wants to debate our policies, and if he wants to challenge the independent experts who support our costings, he should have the courage to call a general election, but he will not. This Prime Minister&#146;s name may appear on the cover of books about courage, but it is never likely to appear in the index.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="71009-0005.htm_para19"><a name="07100936000215">These cynical stunts should not distract us from the fact that today was the day when the economic chickens came home to roost. Britain needs a Government who prepare us for the new economic revolution by freeing our economy, reforming public services and putting us on the path to lower taxes. Instead, we got a speech that boils down to this: growth is down, borrowing is up, the spending rate is down, and overall taxes are likely to go up. What a mess after 10 years in office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="71009-0005.htm_para20"><a name="07100936000216">The real charge against the Prime Minister is not just that he got his growth forecasts for the next year wrong, although he did. The real charge against the Prime Minister is, first, that he should have prepared the public finances for a slowdown in the economy, and he did not; and secondly, he should have prepared the public services for a slowdown in spending, but he did not do that, either. The pre-Budget report is the opposite of what a sensible, prudent Government should do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="71009-0005.htm_para21"><a name="07100936000217">Let us look at the public finances. After 15 years of global growth, we should be running a surplus in this country. Instead, we are entering what the Chancellor himself admits are difficult times, with Government borrowing out of control. The Prime Minister told us in last year&#146;s Budget that 2007 was the year when the finances would move into the black. Then, in this year&#146;s Budget he told us that he was wrong, but that at least borrowing would fall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="71009-0005.htm_para22"><a name="07100936000218">Today the Chancellor admitted that borrowing is going up again. Total borrowing this year is now expected to be &#163;4 billion higher than forecast. We all waited for the moment when, as the former Chancellor used to do, he would rattle off the borrowing figures for the years afterwards, but he entirely missed them out&#151;talk about burying bad news! Indeed, the annual deficit, which he did mention, will be &#163;4 billion higher in the current year. The real tragedy is that the Government should not have borrowed in a boom; they should have saved. Now there is nothing left to prepare Britain for the rainy days that may lie ahead.</p>

He did not tell us that the estimates for the growth of disposable income for millions of families have also fallen sharply from 21/2 per cent. to 11/2 per cent. this year. Why did he hide those figures? He should be blaming his predecessor, not copying him.</p>

When the more gullible Labour Members cheered, perhaps they did not realise that the Chancellor is cutting the spending growth rate of education in half. The real tragedy is that the Government failed to use the boom years to reform education and prepare it for this slowdown. The building schools for the future programme, which the former Chancellor used to boast about, is now in such a mess that just 14 of the 100 schools that were supposed to open this year will do so. The &#163;1 billion spent on tackling truancy has led to a 45 per cent. rise in it. The question people are asking is simple: where has all the money gone? <i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

 I might try that again: where has all the money gone in health? Why does not the Chancellor be honest with the public about what this health settlement means? The growth of health spending is set almost to halve in the next three years, so a health service that is already seeing maternity wards closing, accident and emergency wings shutting and staggered pay awards for nurses will now have to make do with a much slower rate of spending growth.

We heard all the talk about inheritance tax and so on, but I see that in 2010-11 there will be a &#163;1.4 billion rise in taxes as a result of the measures that he announced from the Dispatch Box just a few minutes ago.</p>

Now, next week and during the next few months, we shall continue to ask the Conservatives whether they are prepared to meet our commitment on health and education.

There is a suggested question on this and, by the way, I have all the suggested questions. [Hon. Members: &#147;Answer!&#148;] I intend to answer the question that they have for me in the document.

the United States, to which we are closely linked,Alan Greenspan estimated that the risk of a recession approaches 50 per cent. What is the Chancellor&#146;s assessment of the risk of a recession in Britain&#151;50 per cent., 30 per cent., 20 per cent., 10 per cent.? It is an important question because factors that could precipitate a recession in the United States&#151;personal debt and a bursting bubble in the housing market&#151;are even more extreme in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="71009-0006.htm_para5"><a name="07100936000241">Let me put to the Chancellor a question that I posed to his predecessor four years ago. I asked,</p>
<a name="71009-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="07100936000417"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;is not the brutal truth that...the growth of the British economy is sustained by consumer spending pinned against record levels of personal debt, which is secured, if at all, against house prices that the Bank of England describes as well above equilibrium level?&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, </i>13 November 2003; Vol. 413, c. 397.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="71009-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07100936000242">In the subsequent four years, every one of those indicators has deteriorated. Cannot the Chancellor bring himself to accept that millions of families are being squeezed by a combination of reducing disposable income and higher interest rates as a result of moving from fixed-rate mortgages in the next few months? Does not he accept that there is a major vulnerability in the UK economy?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="71009-0006.htm_para7"><a name="07100936000243">The slowdown has major implications for the spending review, which makes grim reading for many Departments. The Chancellor has promised the largest increase in health spending. As I understand it, he said today that health spending will grow by 4 per cent. Will he confirm that the Wanless report argued that 4.4 per cent. growth was the absolute minimum required to sustain improvements in patient care? That assumed that the maximum amount of health service reform was achieved, which has clearly not happened. Will he confirm that, when we consider all the spending commitments, the growth that he suggests&#151;I believe that it is 1.9 per cent. a year&#151;is only fractionally higher than that achieved in the 18 years of Conservative government?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="71009-0006.htm_para8"><a name="07100936000244">Will not local government now take the biggest hit? Something that did not appear in the statement but is buried in the report is the fact that council tax is due to rise by 5 per cent. a year throughout the UK. That tax bears disproportionately on low-income families and pensioners. At a time when the Chancellor is scrambling to catch up with the Conservatives on inheritance tax, why has he paid no attention to a report and an analysis conducted over four years on the need for reform of that hated and regressive form of taxation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="71009-0006.htm_para9"><a name="07100936000245">On poverty more generally, has the Chancellor made time today to glance at the parliamentary ombudsman&#146;s report on tax credits, which has the wonderful, evocative title, &#147;Tax Credits: Getting It Wrong?&#148;? Is he willing to be a little more open-minded than his predecessor and consider the parliamentary ombudsman&#146;s recommendations for simplifying and making a great deal fairer that hopelessly overcomplicated system?</p>

have got only themselves to blame for their current position with regard to non-domiciled investors. Five years ago, they commissioned a report, which was suppressed under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The data were released only a few days ago. However, I agree that there is little merit in the idea of a poll tax on non-domiciled investors. It would be unfair to many immigrant workers of modest means and a fleabite to the super-rich. For the Abramovichs of this world, a &#163;25,000 charge is roughly the equivalent of what they would spend on a day out at Stamford Bridge. For the noble Lord Ashcroft, &#163;25,000 is roughly the equivalent of one marginal seat.</p>

We know from the press releases that he advised the Prime Minister against a dash to the polls and to stay the course. In the light of the gloomy outlook for the British economy, whatever else one says about the Chancellor, he is a very brave man.</p>

 First, may I apologise if we sent a series of blank sheets of paper to the Liberals&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;You always apologise.&#148;] Well, I will apologise, but it did enable the hon. Gentleman to jot down today&#146;s Liberal party policy. Rather like the Conservatives, he overlooks the fact that over the past few years we have established a strong and stable economy, which will enable us to deal with the uncertainty that we face today. As I have said to the House and as I said last week, the reason we have adjusted our growth figures is that it is sensible in the light of what people are saying&#151;that the uncertainty will have an effect not just here but across the world&#151;to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="71009-0006.htm_para12"><a name="07100936000251">If I understood the hon. Gentleman correctly, I agree with him that there ought to be more fixed-rate mortgages. Indeed, I said that during my statement and I said it just a few weeks ago. I would like people to be able to fix their mortgage rates for a lot longer, not just because that would be good for them, but because it would be good for the country as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="71009-0006.htm_para13"><a name="07100936000252">I am not sure that I follow the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point in relation to the Department of Health. We have been able to increase the amount of money being spent on health over the past few years. There is a further 4 per cent. real-terms increase, which will enable us not only to build more hospitals and provide new GP practices, but to provide health check-ups for individuals, which is important. It has never been clear to me whether the Liberals want to spend more on health or less&#151;it really depends on what day we are listening to them. What I do know, having looked at the Liberals&#146; proposals on tax, which cost around &#163;18 billion a year, is that it is not clear where they are going to get the money from even to finance a small part of what we believe is necessary in public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="71009-0006.htm_para14"><a name="07100936000253">The hon. Gentleman talks about poverty. I strongly believe that we need to do more to reduce pensioner poverty and child poverty. Today I announced proposals to take another 100,000 children out of poverty. However, the Liberals&#146; proposals on income tax would actually disproportionately benefit people with higher incomes, so I do not think that he is in a particularly strong position to lecture us on that.</p>

 I agree with my right hon. Friend. As the Chairman of the Treasury Committee, he knows a great deal about the subject. In particular, he knows that it is essential that the Government stick to the position that they have followed over the past few years. It was our strength and stability that meant that we dealt with the problems that arose after the collapse of the Asian stock market in the 1990s and of the American stock market in the early part of this decade. We have been able to do that precisely because we have not made promises on tax and spending that cannot be financed. As I said earlier, it is striking that the shadow Chancellor made little attempt to defend his position or to explain how he would fill that black hole.</p>

Does he not think that, when he announces that he is obliged to halve the rate of growth in public spending, compared with the rate that we have experienced for the past six or seven years, such an announcement should be combined with measures to indicate how reform can be accelerated, productivity improved and choice and competition actually delivered, in order to get a better quality of service for the money? With respect, his statement was devoid of any such measures. So far as he was concerned, this was the end of the party conference season. Does he not acknowledge that he will have to do some serious work over the winter if he is to retain even the modest levels of economic growth that he announced?</p>

In relation to spending, I think that he was complaining that we were not spending enough, yet I had always understood that his party&#146;s position was that we were spending too much. The amounts of money that we are spending on public services such as health and education are considerably more than was the case 10 years ago when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, as he well knows.</p>

London this morning, and saw an excellent example of the way in which such collaboration is producing treatments and diagnostic skills that simply were not there just a few years ago. It is not only cutting the amount of time for which patients have to be in hospital to receive their treatment, but enabling more effective treatment to be provided. Yes, the Cooksey budget was identified as being a separate budget, and I think it very important for that to be the case.

 The gloom that was evident on the faces of the Members behind the Chancellor today when he talked about the pre-Budget report will be reflected in Northern Ireland.

That will have an impact on the economy. In light of that, will the Chancellor consider proposals to change fiscal policies, for example, in Northern Ireland, which will help the Northern Ireland Executive to grow the private economy to fill the gap left by the reduction in public spending?</p>

The devolved Administrations all have their Barnett entitlement in full. There have been no changes to the basis on which that is calculated. They get the money as they always have done.

He will also know that we asked Sir David Varney, who has been working on his report, to look at those things. However, a lot of things in Northern Ireland need to be looked at to encourage investment. One in particular is education and skills. When we ask business people in Northern Ireland what they want, they say that they want to ensure that when they set up businesses, they have the work force with the necessary skills, as well as investment, infrastructure and other factors.</p>

Doing that as a matter of routine seems to be eminently sensible, not just for them but for the good of the country as a whole.

 Why was more not made today of efficiency gains? Since 2001, the Public Accounts Committee has made some 2,500 recommendations in more than 300 unanimous reports. Most of those recommendations have been accepted by the Government, but many of the lessons are not being applied across Whitehall. In the light of the sheer size of the Government budget, does the Chancellor accept that an efficiency gain of just 2 per cent. in the use of resources would generate &#163;8 billion-worth of savings every year? That would be enough to lead not only to increased spending on priority areas, but to a real reduction in the overall burden of taxation.

 It is funny that the hon.

Following the Gershon report, &#163;20 billion has already been saved; I have not the slightest doubt that all Government Departments, and the public sector generally, can always do more, and the pressure that the hon.

 Let me respond to the various points the hon. Gentleman makes. First, most people might think that an increase of the budget in Scotland to &#163;30 billion was not only the right thing to do, but that it also provided the Scottish Executive&#151;even one currently led by somebody whose ambitions far exceed his ability to deliver them&#151;with sufficient resources to spend on health, education, transport and many of the other things that Scotland needs. Scotland got its full share of Barnett expenditure; absolutely nothing has changed in relation to that. That means, for example, that Scotland&#151;as well as Wales and Northern Ireland&#151;also got its Barnett share of the expenditure on Crossrail. Although Crossrail is largely a railway line and tunnel in the middle of London, Scotland got the Barnett consequentials of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="71009-0007.htm_para9"><a name="07100936000301">I would have thought that the nationalists&#151;whose own policy would mean that the sums would not be available, because of all the disruption that would be caused to Scotland by tearing it away from the rest of the United Kingdom&#151;would be able to see that, on any view, the settlement is very good, especially when they consider the amount of public spending per head of population in Scotland compared with that in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="71009-0007.htm_para10"><a name="07100936000302">I shall say one other thing. As an Edinburgh MP, I follow closely what is happening in the Scottish Executive.

I have raised it in the House on many occasions, but it has become increasingly clear that UK regulations that comply with the habitats directive need to be put in place. Under such regulations, the implications&#151;and, if necessary, the public-interest arguments&#151;of the firth of Forth scheme and similar proposals could be fully considered.</p>

Currently, 85 different pieces of legislation govern activities in Scotland&#146;s seas. That legislation needs to be consolidated and brought up to date if we are to protect our marine wildlife and our coastal communities.</p>

At present, ship-to-ship oil transfers can be carried out within a harbour authority area if that harbour authority has in place an approved oil spill contingency plan that covers such activities. The underlying principle is that ship-to-ship transfers in harbour authority areas should take place only where there is a fully worked-up oil spill contingency plan, with trained personnel&#151;and the necessary equipment for responding to a spill&#151;close at hand.</p>

The coastline stretches from Cockburnspath north to Musselburgh, and its beauty is valued by locals and visitors alike. The coastline also has nine designated bathing waters from Seton Sands down to Thornton loch, and anyone travelling on the east coast main line will see its breathtaking beauty at first hand.</p>

Lothian, and that investment should never be put at risk. Hon. Members might ask whether there is a genuine risk from the proposal for ship-to-ship transfer of oil. The answer is absolutely yes. The potential hazards include oil spills, vessel collision, fire and explosion, environmental emissions, damage to coastal and sea bed habitats, damage to tourism and damage to fishing. It is an accident waiting to happen. I, for one, do not want to trust and hope that, if such an oil spill were to occur in the firth of Forth, the contingency plans would preserve the integrity of the coastline and nature conservation sites. I am introducing this ten-minute Bill because I remain of the view that the current legislation has the balance right between protecting the environment and allowing the port authorities to facilitate commercial and economic activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="71009-0008.htm_para6"><a name="07100936000321">There is some provision to regulate and, if necessary, prevent ship-to-ship transfers in the Forth. Those functions are vested in Forth Ports, which has power under byelaws enacted under local legislation to regulate whether vessels can anchor to transfer cargo. As a competent port authority under the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994, Forth Ports must have regard to the requirements of the habitats directive. The amendments to the habitats regulations in Scotland are very good, and adequate to deal with the European wildlife sites dimension of projects in the Forth. They were passed with all-party support in the Scottish Parliament. The detailed process for consent to plans and projects set out by the current regulations does not deal specifically with, or apply to, oil transfers, however. Unlike other types of port development, programmes of ship-to-ship transfers are not subject to environmental impact assessment regulations either in Scotland or in the rest of the UK, regardless of their frequency or volume.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="71009-0008.htm_para7"><a name="07100936000322">The missing link in the legislative framework is a sensible set of UK regulations controlling ship-to-ship transfers in UK waters. The absence of clear national consenting mechanisms for marine plans or projects and for ship-to-ship cargo transfers in particular has led the firth of Forth to a highly unsatisfactory default position. The consent for a major oil handling project must be determined by the board of directors of a public limited company, the share price of which seems inevitably to be affected by that decision. That seems an invidious position for Forth Ports plc. Meanwhile, UK and Scottish Ministers have no power of veto. Ship-to-ship transfer as an activity slips through the net and the public are denied a voice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="71009-0008.htm_para8"><a name="07100936000323">No wonder there exists a widely and strongly held perception of a conflict of interest on the part of statutory harbour authorities when they are also by nature public limited companies with duties to their shareholders. Surely this is at odds with the need for impartial regulation and with the spirit, if not the letter, of the habitats regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="71009-0008.htm_para9"><a name="07100936000324">In East Lothian, for instance, there is a perception of a reluctance on the part of the harbour authority to address the legitimate concerns of local communities  <br>

and others, and that has resulted in an unfortunate amount of mistrust and ill feeling. The mistrust is exacerbated by the difficulty experienced by members of the public in gaining access to environmental information gathered by the harbour authority. This fuels accusations of secrecy and questions the impartiality of the harbour authority. How can a body that may benefit financially from granting consent be seen to regulate the activity transparently and without prejudice? These issues could be addressed by incorporating into new regulations for ship-to-ship transfers a clear process to be followed by harbour authorities. The authority to consider that falls wholly within Westminster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="71009-0008.htm_para10"><a name="07100936000325">The Bill seeks, by regulating the activities that can be undertaken in UK ports, the provision for transfers to be prohibited or consented to only subject to strict conditions. Regulation of the activities that can be undertaken in UK ports under the Bill should avoid the potential conflicts of interest for bodies that currently act both as the competent authorities and the financial beneficiaries of such transfers. The Bill would ensure that harbour authorities are more clearly accountable to the public for their environmental responsibilities and in carrying out their statutory functions. The decision-making process in relation to ports&#146; development is complex and often less than transparent. There must be scope for simplification and regulation in particular if the habitats directive does not fully meet the requirement to protect our waters from the impact of such proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="71009-0008.htm_para11"><a name="07100936000326">A common approach from the Government and the devolved Administration to work with the industry and other interested parties to simplify and rationalise the procedures is now required. Successive Governments have sought to separate regulation from those with a commercial interest in consents. For example, the water industry is regulated by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the forestry industry by the Forestry Commission, and town and country planning proposals in which the local planning authority stands to benefit may be called in by Ministers.</p>

During my now three months in office, I have met many of them both at home and abroad, including in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I have heard first hand their views about their equipment and the way in which it is supported. Everywhere that I have been, I have been immensely impressed and inspired by their dedication and bravery and by the professionalism of our personnel. Although the debate is about procurement, the House need not be told that our equipment is only as good as the people who use it and that those people still make the difference.

That new organisation provides a unified approach to our procurement and support functions. It will deliver better value and greater effectiveness for the &#163;16 billion that we spend each year. The defence industrial strategy also set industry a challenge to transform itself. A good example of how industry is rising to that challenge is shown in VT and BAE Systems; they are forming a joint venture for future shipbuilding and support.</p>

On such occasions, the UOR process is ideal and essential so that we can manoeuvre and get more money into the system to meet the changing threat.

 That is true, but we need a range of vehicles to meet the requirements, and the demand from the front line must always come first.

Those ships have three times the displacement of our current carriers. They will bring a step change in our maritime capability and contribute to the biggest naval shipbuilding programme for over 20 years. The new carriers, to be named HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, will be the largest vessels ever operated by the Royal Navy.

 I begin by associating myself with the Minister&#146;s comments about our armed forces, especially those who have fallen in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The sacrifices that they made should focus our minds on the issues before us. It is worth reminding ourselves, at the beginning of this debate on equipment, that without the professionalism, bravery and commitment of our armed forces, the whole debate would be pointless. Indeed, there are many who make a false distinction between procurement and welfare issues. Procurement is a welfare issue. For our servicemen and women and their families, there are few issues as important as whether they have the equipment to maximise their safety and ensure the success of the tasks that they undertake in our name.</p>

project management. As a share of total Government spending, defence expenditure has fallen from 7.8 per cent. in 1998 to 6.1 per cent. in 2006, despite the fact that we are involved in two wars&#151;in Iraq and Afghanistan&#151;with the inevitable reduction in the life expectancy of much of the equipment involved. Funding from the Treasury reserve for urgent operational requirements&#151;UORs&#151;does nothing to diminish an ever-increasing liability that must be met, in terms of equipment, at some point. In that context, we must look at Ministers&#146; boasts that they will achieve a 1.5 per cent. annual real-terms increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="71009-0010.htm_para1"><a name="07100950000004">The last settlement that was trumpeted in similar terms to this one resulted in three infantry battalions being cut and the loss of three destroyers and three frigates. What are the likely casualties this time round? If the rumours and leaks circulating in the Ministry of Defence are anything to go by, we could lose a further five frigates and destroyers and two submarines, up to 6,000 personnel from the Army and two squadrons of Tornado GR4 attack aircraft, cutting the RAF&#146;s front-line squadrons from eight to six. Perhaps the Ministers will take the opportunity of this debate to snuff out those rumours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="71009-0010.htm_para2"><a name="07100950000005">My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) made a point about the Navy earlier. This is not a question of a change in our assumptions about the Navy&#146;s numbers. The Government presented the strategic defence review, in which they said that they required two carriers and 32 destroyers and frigates. When the Government&#146;s security Minister was the First Sea Lord, he said that we could not get by with fewer than 30 destroyers and frigates. If the Minister thinks today that we can get by with a lower number, let him justify that to the House. We want to know what has changed in the strategic assumptions that would allow that to happen. The argument that we are normally given is that we do not require platform numbers because we have increased capabilities, but that argument cannot be deployed indefinitely. We cannot keep cutting platform numbers while saying, &#147;Because they can do more, we require fewer of them.&#148; Ships cannot be in two places at once. If the Government intend to make further cuts to the Navy, they must explain to the House, to the Navy and to the country what strategic changes have taken place that will allow them to move from the plans that they brought to the House of Commons in recent years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="71009-0010.htm_para3"><a name="07100950000006">All these elements occur against the Government&#146;s poor record of managing the defence budget. In September this year, the Public Accounts Committee outlined the Government&#146;s performance. In 2005-06, 19 of the major equipment projects, excluding the Typhoon aircraft, were forecast to cost &#163;27 billion, some 11 per cent. over the approved budget, and had been delayed by a further 33 months. Indeed, the Department&#146;s performance against its key user requirements is worsening, with only 17 projects being expected to achieve all requirements&#151;one fewer than in 2004-05.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="71009-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07100950000007">As usual with anything run by the current Prime Minister, we have to read the small print to understand the true picture. Some of the procurement reforms of recent years might have helped to stop procurement costs spiralling entirely out of control, but substantial capabilities have been sacrificed to achieve that. The number of Type 45 destroyers being procured has  <br>

fallen from 12 to eight, and possibly as few as six. There have been reductions in the number of guided multiple rocket launch systems, Brimstone missiles and recovery vehicles being procured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="71009-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07100950000008">The Public Accounts Committee reported that the MOD had previously said that it had carried out a departmental review that came up with 44 ways to reduce the forecast cost of these projects by &#163;781 million, or 3 per cent. of the total. Yet, on closer examination, it was discovered that &#163;91 million represented a rebate and exemption from Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, and a further &#163;448 million did not represent real savings at all, as the Department transferred the expenditure to other budgets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="71009-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07100950000009">The real effect of this mismanagement has been on the operational efficiency and safety of our armed forces.

The assistant coroner said that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="71009-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07100950000011">Then there was the utterly inexcusable and, in my view, inexplicable decision in 2004 to cut the FRC helicopter budget by some &#163;1.4 billion. At a time when our troops are facing a shortage of lift capacity in both Iraq and Afghanistan, that decision was astonishingly complacent, if not downright incompetent. The consequence has been a chronic shortage of helicopters in both theatres and, although we welcome the procurement of the Merlins and the eventual conversion of the Chinooks, that has all happened far too late in the day, as my colleagues who have had experience in Iraq and Afghanistan will attest.</p>

 My hon. Friend is describing the procurement of helicopters, and the implied costs involved. Is it worth considering the fact that one can often rent helicopters at a far lower price and therefore get far more of them to use in theatre? That would allow us to provide them much more quickly than the very expensive procurement process does.</p>

 The aim must always be to give our troops the equipment that they require, when they need it. However, we must also take into account the fact that many of the helicopters that are available commercially might not carry the defensive aids and equipment that we take for granted in some of the helicopters that we procure. If the necessary protection could be guaranteed, it would make perfect sense to get them as quickly and cheaply as possible. It is not only right for the Government to do that; it is their duty to do so wherever possible.</p>

offered, rather than our having to scrounge around. That is the reality: we have been let down by our partners. Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that they should take up some of the weight that has been placed on our shoulders?</p>

<p><a name="st_o218"><a name="07100950000015"><a name="71009-0010.htm_spnew3"><a name="07100950000065"><b>Dr. Fox:</b>
 It is not often that I am happy to have words put into my mouth, especially by Members on the other side of the House, but the hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct. Some of our NATO partners have to understand that being in an alliance means having to do the things that they do not want to do, as well as doing the things that they do want to do. In Afghanistan in particular, the heroic efforts of the Canadians and the Danes, and to a certain extent the Dutch, alongside ourselves and the United States, are an example to the other members of NATO. Security is not optional. If they want to enjoy global security, there is a price to be paid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="71009-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07100950000016">I have criticised the MOD&#146;s management of the defence budget , but it should not shoulder the entire blame. The just-in-time approach to procurement is entirely Treasury led. The Minister and I have served on opposite sides on a Finance Bill and we both know exactly how the Treasury operates in the United Kingdom. The Treasury approach has resulted in an increasingly difficult procurement environment. Given the strategic uncertainty and constantly evolving operational environment, it is extremely important that we give personnel the flexibility of equipment choices to enable them to perform their tasks successfully. Despite Treasury resistance, UORs have proved vital, which is why I believe that Members on both sides of the House will find it extremely disappointing that <i> Defence News</i> last month stated that</p>
<a name="71009-0010.htm_brev1"><a name="07100950000057"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;industry sources say that Treasury officials appear to be tightening up the approval process and seeking to ensure that only truly urgently needed equipment is obtained from UORs.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="71009-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07100950000017">Indeed, sources say that Treasury officials might suspect that not everything ordered via UOR was really urgent. I would be grateful if the Minister, in winding up the debate, dealt with this question; it is a fundamental issue, not simply a theoretical one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="71009-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07100950000018">The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson), who is no longer in his place, made an important point about the need for better parliamentary scrutiny of major procurement programmes. That need not impede the MOD; in fact, it could eventually help to reduce cost and time overruns. We in the House of Commons simply do not have sufficient access to the details of equipment programmes and do not know how projects will fit into the defence budget in the years ahead. It is difficult not only for MPs but for the military to judge the Government&#146;s plans sufficiently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="71009-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07100950000019">The Prime Minister says that he wants new politics, so perhaps the Minister will assure Parliament that Members will have a chance to look at the 10-year funding forecast for major procurement projects. For example, in the years of the comprehensive spending review and beyond, we would like to see how much is allocated in each year for spending on aircraft carriers, the future rapid effect system, the replacement of the nuclear deterrent or the defence training review. Unless we know that, we can make no sense of whether the  <br>

Government&#146;s proposed allocations are realistic or simply a wish list. The House operates in the dark, which other elected assemblies simply would not accept.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="71009-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07100950000020">Although we have welcomed the carrier announcement, a number of concerns and unresolved issues remain. The in-service dates are now 2014 and 2016 and the cost will be &#163;3.9 billion, but in which years will the costs be borne? Will the Minister update us on contract negotiations?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="71009-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07100950000021">Some progress has been made with FRES, but medium-weight armoured vehicle procurement has been badly handled, and we should be much further ahead than we are. Nine years after the Government announced their intention to procure new vehicles, we have not completely reached main gate, which is unacceptable. As the Defence Committee said:</p>
<a name="71009-0010.htm_brev2"><a name="07100950000058"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This is a sorry story of indecision, constantly changing requirements and delay. We are concerned that the FRES requirement may simply be unachievable without a major technical breakthrough. The tension between the survivability and deployability is particularly acute. Satisfying both requirements may prove impossible. It is high time the MoD decided where its priorities lay&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="71009-0010.htm_para15"><a name="07100950000022">Despite that, we still get procrastination. Similarly, with the replacement of our nuclear deterrent and the defence training review, we need to know where the potential costs will manifest themselves in the actual budget; otherwise we can make no sense of any of the Minister&#146;s promises today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="71009-0010.htm_para16"><a name="07100950000023">The fact that our procurement process too often produces long delays and budgetary overruns is hardly a bone of contention. The consequences are that we often pay too much for things that are almost out of date by the time we get them. That makes no sense. It provides neither value for money for the taxpayer, nor a predictable equipment flow for the armed forces. However, it would be churlish not to acknowledge the efforts made to improve the situation, not least by the noble Lord Drayson. Whatever its merits, the defence industrial strategy needs to be refined further. We need a more rigorous assessment of what constitutes sovereign capability and whether we are willing fully to support it through our economic and procurement policies. At the same time, we need to be frank about where we are beginning projects that are either duplicating work undertaken elsewhere or are unlikely ever to come to fruition. Better project management is essential to achieving better value for money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="71009-0010.htm_para17"><a name="07100950000024">We must also recognise that if we want British defence jobs to be protected&#151;and they are a vital part of our economy, as well as an essential part of our defence infrastructures&#151;we need to expand British defence exports. We intend to begin a consultation with our defence industries to see how a future Conservative Government might best achieve that. Stronger exports are, in the longer term, the best way to create entrepreneurship in the defence sector and secure defence jobs. That will be taken up by my Front-Bench colleague in his wind-up speech. The Minister and I have already exchanged views on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="71009-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07100950000025">All these issues may sound technical, which probably explains the lack of attendance in the House today, but what might sound technical in the comfort of the House of Commons is of vital importance to the safety and well-being of our armed forces personnel and the adequate protection of our country.

the detail. There is no inherent reason why there should be a difference between the parties on that issue, but the House of Commons must be given a greater role because too many of the Government&#146;s failures are having a negative impact on our armed forces and our ability properly to defend our country&#146;s interests, which is simply unacceptable.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox), who made a good speech. He often makes good speeches on this subject, and I have no doubt about the knowledge and commitment that he and his colleagues on the Opposition Front Bench bring to defence matters. When I sat on the Conservative Benches, I often found myself agreeing with them on defence matters. However, it was always difficult to get them to live up to their rhetoric. They were continually saying, as they have said today, that the Government were not procuring enough helicopters, frigates or submarines. There is always a good case to be made for procuring things that are not procured at the moment. There is always a good case to be made for going back to some previous target for procurement of a particular type of equipment. Whenever I asked what the Conservative Front Benchers proposed to do about the problem, however, I always got the same answer that we have heard this afternoon. No, they were not committed to spending any more money. They would either reduce their commitments, or if not, they might think a bit more about it&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Does the hon.

 Any simple housewife will tell the hon. Gentleman that the important thing is not what one spends, but how one spends it. The money wasted on the defence budget could have provided much more equipment. Questions have been raised about those matters, and I suggest that the hon. Gentleman do his homework before speaking on this subject.</p>

 I am coming on to that. As a matter of fact, Defence Equipment and Support&#151;the new version of the Defence Procurement Agency, merged with the Defence Logistics Organisation&#151;has an extremely good and improving record of dealing with these issues. I am afraid to say that the Conservative party, in simply saying that it can identify and reverse a lot of waste, will have no credibility unless it is prepared to be specific about how it is going to save the money. It is no good the Conservatives saying that if the commitments are too great they will cut them back, unless they are prepared to answer the question that they have never answered, as they have not answered this afternoon: what specific commitments are they going to cut in the present context? They can see the challenges that the country faces as well as Labour Members can, so which particular commitments are they going to cut? There is always a silence on that.</p>

I base my judgment on the findings of the Select Committee on Defence, an entirely objective body, which found that the Defence Procurement Agency achieved 100 per cent. of its targets in its last year before the merger. Those targets are rigorous; I will not go through them as I do not have time, but anyone with any background in the subject knows how extremely difficult it is to achieve those targets. Yet 100 per cent. achievement was reached, against the background of appalling cost and time overruns in the past. Some of us thought that we would never get the operation to succeed as it has.</p>

The standard cost-plus model was universal in the world until the 1980s, but economically it was clearly an extremely wasteful and damaging process. The defence industry had no incentive to keep its costs down, unlike any industry operating in normal market conditions. Ultimately that is very bad for an industry, because it prevents it from becoming as efficient and innovative as it should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="71009-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07100950000042">We took the first steps in moving away from that model under Peter Levene, now Lord Levene, when he became chief of defence procurement. We moved to a competition-oriented model, with which we encountered great difficulties, because when major projects involve major technology risks, people are not prepared to quote a fixed price. That makes it necessary to return to a system of contractual arrangements under which much of the risk is taken by the procurer, who must do a deal at a very early stage with the supplier, and as a result it is not possible for competition to operate effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="71009-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07100950000043">We then moved to the smart procurement system, which we used until fairly recently. Its main aims were to prevent a confrontational relationship between the supplier and the purchaser, to ensure that one did not try to cheat the other, and to give an incentive for everyone with expertise and answers to bring them to the table. The insight was relevant, and there is no doubt that smart procurement has produced some great successes&#151;along with some very difficult problems, some of which have been mentioned today. However, we have all found that it is not the whole answer, because it, too, does not allow us to benefit fully from competition. There is always a tendency to oppose the forming of an initial partnership solely with the prime contractor and favour letting in parts of the supply chain to gain the real benefit and the real ideas, and that means a diminishing of competition throughout the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="71009-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07100950000044">Now we are moving to a system that was called DPA Forward, until the two agencies were merged. I think we will all be very interested to see how it works and what it consists of, but my view is that where smart procurement needs to be tweaked, modulated or reviewed, the main purpose should be to ensure that we can benefit more from competition. There are a number of problems, one of which is that there is a limited amount of competition within the frontiers of the United Kingdom. As some of my colleagues have pointed out, there is competition in shipbuilding, between companies such as Vosper Thornycroft and BAE Systems, and that is fine; but in some areas it is impossible to benefit from competition without going outside the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="71009-0011.htm_para4"><a name="07100950000045">In the United States it will almost always be possible to meet defence requirements by buying something off the shelf, but that would probably be the last contract that the buyer would ever let, because we would no longer have any capability of our own. Next time around we would be entirely dependent on an American supplier. Not only would we have no leverage in terms of price and normal commercial negotiations, but we might well find ourselves in precisely the difficulty that we have  <br>

experienced with the joint strike fighter. We might not get the necessary technology, or the Americans might try to sell us something slightly sub-standard that did not involve the latest technology. We cannot put ourselves into such a position.</p>

That is more competition within the European Union. It has been established for a long time that that would be desirable if it could be achieved, and there have been various attempts to achieve it. It is also generally recognised that the old system of joint procurement that was used for the Tornado was hopeless because it was based on the principle of juste retour, which means that every country that is part of the consortium involved must receive a proportion of procurement equivalent to the proportion of the funds that it contributed to the initial development and research costs. That was a very inefficient and anti-competitive system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="71009-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07100950000047">We then established OCCAR&#151;the Organisation for Joint Armament Co-operation&#151;a joint procurement agency based in Paris, which is another bureaucracy. I do not wish to run the agency down, for it has done some good work, but it has also experienced some problems. I do not think that the A400M, for instance, has been a brilliant success so far. That system does not strike me as ideal. It is very bureaucratic; it is not competition, or the use of markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="71009-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07100950000048">We have a market&#151;the single market&#151;which has been outstandingly successful in every other area of economic activity that anyone cares to mention. Let me make a suggestion. I am not advocating this, because I do not know enough about it&#151;I have not done enough of the homework to be sure that I want to advocate it&#151;but I am sure that we ought to consider systematically an option that will no doubt shock a number of Opposition Members. I believe that we should consider simply getting rid of the special protection for the defence industry that exists in the single market legislation&#151;I cannot remember which clause in the treaty contains it&#151;and extend the single market, in the form of the public procurement directive, to defence procurement. We should make it the rule, not the exception, that when we have a defence procurement opportunity we entertain bids from countries throughout the European Union, on a reciprocal basis. Because of the legal and enforcement structures in the EU, everyone else would have to observe the same rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="71009-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07100950000049">Of course there would be certain cases in which individual British companies thought they had lost out, but I am tempted to believe, at least on a preliminary basis&#151;I stress that I am speaking on a preliminary basis&#151;that we would be the net gainers. We have an enormous number of very successful businesses. Some of them are niche businesses&#151;avionics businesses, for example&#151;and some are producing larger platforms, but we benefit from considerable expertise. I also believe that, in practice, we are always slightly more inclined than most of our continental partners to be open-minded, liberal and in favour of open markets. In practice, we have opened our defence markets where other countries have not.</p>

Thus there has been no competition at all in that direction, although we have engaged in some competition in procuring from the EU. That is a foolish situation in which to be&#151;or, at least, it would be foolish of us to resist the idea of opening up the market completely, given the assurances provided by the treaty, the legislation, the European Court of Justice and the European Commission that such a change would be enforceable and that there would be a genuinely free market in defence equipment.</p>

If we can save money in defence procurement, we shall be able to buy more and better kit, we may be able to provide more training, and we shall be able to buy all sorts of support that our military personnel not only deserve but desperately need. Therefore, the overriding obligation in defence procurement is to ensure that we are being as efficient as possible, and that we do not get carried away by simple lobbying by defence suppliers to serve their own individual ends. The purpose of the operation is to provide what our military needs at the lowest price, to enable us to procure more. More competition is the way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="71009-0011.htm_para14"><a name="07100954000003">It is intriguing that we are having this debate on the same day that we have had the comprehensive spending review, confirming as it did the defence spending figures for the next three years. Having had the opportunity to look at those, we can see that, from this year, expenditure of &#163;32.6 billion will go up over three years to &#163;36.9 billion, an increase of &#163;4.3 billion. The Government were spinning that in July as &#163;7.7 billion. The hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) and I have memories of such Government accounting from when we served our parties on health: increases in health spending were accounted in the same way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="71009-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07100954000004">As we have heard, it all boils down to an increase year on year averaging 1.5 per cent. above inflation. Incidentally, most of it, if we look closely, is in the third of the three years. For the first and second year, we will barely even keep up with inflation. That means that the pattern of increases that has obtained in recent years will continue. The message seems to be business as usual. In the light of the concerns that I alluded to a moment ago about the problems that overstretch is creating, I have to ask whether that is going to be good enough. When the Ministry of Defence looks at the settlements that some other Government Departments have been given, I think that it will breathe a sigh of relief, as things could have been even worse. However, when we look at the scale of the challenges, we will have to probe over the years how things are going to work.</p>

However, if it is going to do that sincerely, and I believe that it will, many of the programmes that we see looming on the horizon are going to stretch further to the right or to be scaled down.</p>

 I see the Minister hovering and his arm coming out. I know what he is going to ask and I will give him the opportunity to do so. However, as the hon.

How can I possibly answer that when he does not give us the basic figures with which we could begin to make a case of that sort?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman lays out the pressures and the difficulties. He is right: the question is extremely predictable but it still has to be asked. It is the same question that I asked the Conservatives. It is all right saying that an increase of 1.5 per cent. above inflation is not enough, but the pattern is a 10-year growth in spending on defence. If that is not enough, what would the Liberal Democrats commit to? It is no good him saying that he cannot see the figures. Of course, we can improve our scrutiny and all the rest of it, but what above that would the Liberal Democrats like us to spend?</p>

 As I go through my remarks, I will look at the various procurements that are stretched out before us and we will have to address which of them are likely to be the casualties and what the implications of any delays and stretches to the right will be. Something or other has to give. The Government have not as yet cancelled any of the big procurements that we await. They have not as yet announced any downscaling of them. It is not simply the Liberal Democrats saying that we cannot get all that out of the budget on the scale that has been laid out. Many independent observers are making the same point, including the International Institute for Strategic Studies. From memory, Dr. Lee Willett, director of the Royal United Services Institute, was saying the same thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="71009-0011.htm_para17"><a name="07100954000010">We already have a seriously overheated equipment plan. The costs&#151;the military inflation&#151;grow year on year, so we see a shift of those programmes to the right. They get delivered in stages, or&#151;this is all too common&#151;the numbers, the size and the capability get scaled back. Eventually, having been state-of-the-art technology at the outset, they arrive years out of date. A good example of that would be the Eurofighter or Typhoon programme, which from memory was signed off by John Nott when he was Secretary of State. It has only come into service in the past couple of years.</p>

 We accept that the Government are maintaining a permanent information advantage over Parliament. If the Government say that they are setting aside &#163;5 billion for housing improvements or &#163;110 million for new Mastiffs, we cannot tell whether they are squeezing other things out of the budget, because we do not know what the procurement figures are in which years. Only the Government know that. That is an example of the Executive maintaining an advantage over Parliament and Parliament therefore being unable properly to scrutinise the Executive.</p>

 I agree. I agree also with those who have said that proper parliamentary scrutiny could improve the procurement process. Some of the inherent flaws in that process contribute to the unfortunate outcomes to which I have referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="71009-0011.htm_para18"><a name="07100954000013">In 1998, the Government conducted a strategic defence review. It is broadly correct to say that there was all-party consensus on its big-picture conclusions at that time and that that has continued, but the world has changed a great deal in that time. The events of 9/11 and their aftermath mean that the world that we are looking at now, that we are planning for in the years to come and for which procurements are to be prepared, is very different. The time is now overdue for another strategic defence review.</p>

It is time that we undertook such a review again; it is overdue. Through such a review, we can decide which of the various procurement plans that are stretched out before us will be appropriate to meet the challenges that we will face. We must plan our procurement on the basis of the strategic environment that we face now and that we expect to face in the years to come. We must have a flexible response. Of course, we cannot  <br>

 The hon.

However, the Treasury is now sabre rattling to the effect that it will not continue to bless the recent scale of procurement that has taken place through the UOR system, and there has been media comment that it is becoming a significant part of the procurement process. That further underlines the need both for a review of the strategic environment and for the overall planning methodology that we use for our procurement processes to be improved. We cannot continue to get away with plugging the gaps on such a scale through the UOR or a similar system. We have also heard warnings from within the armed forces.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that when a war is fought on two fronts, there is no alternative to a system such as the UOR because procurement requirements become urgent in the light of the circumstances faced by the troops on the ground? We will never be able to do away with the UOR; it is an important and effective part of the procurement system.</p>

 I certainly agree with that, and I have said that the UOR has been vital in saving the day on a number of occasions. I am not suggesting that the Treasury should be allowed to have its way, but I am simply flagging up a point that has already been made: that the Treasury appears to be getting agitated on this matter. I should also refer to various Defence Committee reports; it has repeatedly expressed worries that the MOD initial budgeting processes do not seem to be all that they should be, and that supplementary estimates are produced later. That is symptomatic of the same situation.</p>

I welcome last week&#146;s announcement, but trumpeting the fact that the announcement is two months early rather ignores the fact that it has taken nine years to get to where we are now. This particular announcement might have been two months early but, overall, it is running long behind the curve.

have alluded will not have an impact on the FRES programme&#146;s time scale or capability. I gather that the plan now is to get the first vehicles operational by 2012. That is welcome in the sense that the situation could have been a great deal worse, but there is a need here and now for this sort of generation of vehicles. The deployment of some Mastiffs is welcome; but, again, they are clearly plugging a gap. It is also hard to understand quite how the number of Mastiffs that is now being talked about will fit into the future overall inventory.</p>

To turn to a point made by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), we must at all times be concerned about the waste of public money. It is essential to the troops that we get what they need to them as quickly as we can, but it is also essential to taxpayers that we drive a better bargain for their money than we have done on all too many occasions. The culture of delay that has developed over the years is not only to the detriment of the armed forces, but it also costs taxpayers dearly. The fact of the matter is that we end up spending more than we should, getting less for our money than we wanted, and getting it later than we should have done&#151;and its capability is often not appropriate for modern circumstances and is a pale imitation of what was originally planned.</p>

That is an unacceptable situation. <i> [Interruption]</i>.<i> </i>It is all very well for the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) to say that that is not true, but serving members of the armed forces have talked to me and other Members about that&#151;those serving members have said that that is their view.

 The hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position that they are not, but serving members of the armed forces look me straight in the eye and tell me that they are, for the reason I have given.

 In light of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments about individual soldiers being driven to purchase kit, perhaps I could refer him to the diaries of Private Clay of the 3rd Foot Guards&#151;probably the finest regiment in the British Army. In his diaries at the battle of Waterloo, he mentions exactly the same problem of the inadequacies of his kit and that he was forced to purchase a new knapsack. It is not uncommon for individual soldiers to buy personal equipment, but I have never met a soldier who was driven to buying a larger piece of equipment, such as a tank.</p>

It was a subject that was always very dear to the late Lord Tim Garden who, tragically, died in the summer. He is unable to continue to make his point, so I do it in his stead. The helicopter situation in both operational theatres is desperate. In both those theatres, they are indispensable, but there are still too few. Those that there are have restricted flying times and operational constraints that affect their support role in both medical and military missions.</p>

Years after the Chinooks were first ordered, the same problems continue to plague them. They lack airworthiness. The forces have not had the helicopters that they need at their disposal. I will be interested to hear from the Government about their plans for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="71009-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07100954000035">My hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) asked the Minister about the partnering agreement with AgustaWestland in respect of the Future Lynx programme. That, of course, has been signed and there is an anxiety that the Government may not follow it through on the scale or time scale that the armed forces need. Beyond the issue of the Future Lynx is the serious issue of what will replace the Sea Kings and Pumas&#151;they are antiquated. Sea Kings should not be used in anything like the circumstances in which they are, years after they were built for a completely different purpose. If we are looking ahead, we must have clarity about the Government&#146;s longer-term intentions on that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="71009-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07100954000036">There is a strong correlation between, on the one hand, poor equipment and vital shortages and, on the other, the toll being taken on the armed forces and the overstretch about which we are all so concerned. We have heard about the widely reported and speculated-about cuts in the naval fleet. The Government need to come to the Dispatch Box and clarify their intentions in that regard; it is simply unacceptable that such reductions in our capability should be made by what is frankly a stealth process. The Minister needs to clarify the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="71009-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07100954000037">The aircraft carriers have been announced and that is welcome. The hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) asked me about Eurofighters, but the issue of what will fly off the aircraft carriers is a long way from being clear. It is time that the Government started to indicate what they anticipate will fly off the carriers, particularly as the joint strike fighter, which had been predominant in the Government&#146;s thinking on the issue, is itself stretching further off to the right and is certainly further to the right than the now announced and expected deployment dates for the two aircraft carriers. Whether those dates will be achieved is another issue altogether, but there is clearly a time gap between the two things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="71009-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07100954000038">The defence industrial strategy is a brave attempt to improve our procurement processes. I am pleased that Lord Drayson is still in position and is able to try to pursue the new approach. However, it is important, in identifying head contractors and the operators with whom the Government are going to deal, that the interests of small and medium-sized companies are not forgotten. When the Government make their key decisions about suppliers for the FRES project, that should be one of the key criteria by which they should be judged. What will be the role of small and medium-sized firms in that provision? There will be other considerations, such as what capacity there will be for putting new capabilities on to the vehicles as time goes on; inevitably, whatever they were designed for initially will need to change as the years go by.  <br>

 May I first warmly welcome the Minister for the Armed Forces, who is no longer in his place but who opened the debate tonight? He performed gallantly when dropped, as <i> The Sun</i> so charmingly put it this morning, deep into &#147;the Brown stuff&#148; last week, when the Prime Minister made an announcement in Basra about force levels and the number of those returning to this country, without first having told the Secretary of State that he was going to make it. I wish to place it on record that the Prime Minister&#146;s actions in that regard and many others in the past week were absolutely contemptible and unforgivable, and that he took advantage of his position by being among our troops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="71009-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07100954000041">My speech will be brief. I want to ask a number of questions in no particular order. First, I am told that the Fleet Air Arm would prefer to have the Super Hornet maritime strike attack aircraft, which it could buy off the shelf, instead of the joint strike fighter. I would be glad if the Minister could let me know the position on that matter. Has that been or is that being considered, given the escalating costs of the JSF?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="71009-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07100954000042">Secondly, I am anxious to know what the Army is doing about recruiting. How does the recruiting stand? Many regiments are having to go on operations with composite squadrons and companies; that, of course, is of great concern. The lack of manpower is leading to serious overstretch at a time when we are fighting in two different theatres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="71009-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07100954000043">Thirdly, will the Minister see what he can do to try to improve on the Ministry of Defence&#146;s dismal performance in respect of telling the story of the astonishing achievements and activities of British troops on operations? The continual bleating about nobody knowing what the Army is doing on operations is entirely the fault of the structures to promote such stories. There is no reason on earth why well informed, well told stories that give away nothing, but enable people here to get some comprehension of the astonishing challenges and remarkable achievements of our troops, should not be told. It is incumbent on Ministers to review the situation and see what they can do to drive it forward. At the Ministry of Defence, in both military and civilian bureaucracies, there is a sort of leaden resolve to say no to everything. I urge the Minister to improve on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="71009-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07100954000044">Fourthly, I should like to make the general point that now is no time to reorganise the head office of the Ministry of Defence, although I understand that that is to take place under the Cabinet Office changes.

such a thing is madness when we are operating at war in two theatres&#151;one very, very demanding and the other just very demanding. It is folly to take our eye off the ball because of such a major change at the very top of the Ministry of Defence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="71009-0012.htm_para11"><a name="07100954000045">Next, I want to raise a question that I know my hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth), who knows so much about such matters, will also raise. It is about the treatment of the Defence Export Services Organisation, which was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox). As my hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot wrote in an admirable letter to <i> The Daily Telegraph</i>, it is extraordinary that</p>
<a name="71009-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="07100954000096"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;just 10 days before scrapping it, the Government placed an advertisement in a Sunday newspaper for a new head of the DESO, under the job description: &#145;This is a vital role supporting defence objectives and contributing to wider national interests.&#146; &#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="71009-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07100954000046">Scrapping DESO is an act of bovine stupidity, engineered by some communist woman at the Treasury, I understand, who decided that it would be in the interests of the United Kingdom to do away with one of the most effective organisations in this country for promoting British commercial interests. When I was a Minister in the Ministry of Defence, I worked alongside two DESO chief executives and I have only the highest admiration and regard for everyone in that organisation, which has done so much to raise this country&#146;s defence export sales. Our defence products are admired all over the world and are a very important part of our commercial life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="71009-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07100954000047">Next, the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey) was right to say that the real increase in defence spending is about 1.5 per cent. year on year. It is futile for the Government to keep asking Conservative Members, &#147;What would you do?&#148; We are not in government: we will have to deal with such questions when we are in government, but military funding cannot remain at the current low level when we are fighting two wars. We are doing that on a peacetime budget, but Ministers must understand that the result is that there has been a split in the armed forces. I have never known such bitterness and inter-service rivalry as exists now in our armed forces. The three services are having to fight for the very poor assets that are available, and I believe that the chiefs must be feeling the strain very seriously. All that is happening at a time when we can least afford it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="71009-0012.htm_para14"><a name="07100954000048">I shall end with two brief points. The first is that we cannot fight the wars that we are fighting unless the money available to meet the here-and-now requirements of our forces is increased. For instance, we urgently need more helicopters. There is no argument about that, and I was delighted by the Prime Minister&#146;s announcement yesterday that, not before time, an order was to be placed for 140 Mastiff patrol vehicles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="71009-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07100954000049">In that regard, I should like to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton) on doing so much to bring home to colleagues in the House how serious is the problem of the lack of protection available to our soldiers. Some of the hazards that they face are very grave. The vehicles referred to yesterday by the Prime Minister should have been ordered at least 18 months ago and, although I am pleased that the order has been made, we cannot afford to put our entire future capability at risk. That means that we must pay for the wars that we fight in a realistic way.</p>

It is probably somewhat outside today&#146;s discussion, but in my view it is essential that the next Chief of the Defence Staff is not chosen from among a group of nominees put forward by each service in a manner that, as it were, resembles Buggins&#146;s turn. I believe that the next CDS should be chosen from the entire pool of four-star officers in all three services, as that would broaden the talent pool in a way that is very important in today&#146;s armed forces.</p>

 It is always a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames), who speaks with inimitable knowledge, determination and commitment. His remarks stand in stark contrast to those of the Minister, who said that he had waited four years to speak. We might have had a more coherent presentation of the Government&#146;s procurement policy if he had waited a little longer. He meandered through a sort of shopping list of what was being bought but, as the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey) noted, without any sort of context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="71009-0012.htm_para17"><a name="07100954000052">I mention that because, when I speak in these debates, I normally launch straight into a series of points relating to the aerospace industry and to the BAE Systems plant at Wharton in my constituency. However, the importance of identifying the threats that face us and, therefore, what we should procure to deal with them was brought home to me when I spoke recently to officers from 2nd Battalion the Rifles. They had recently returned from Iraq, and they told me that what had struck them was the paucity of the basics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="71009-0012.htm_para18"><a name="07100954000053">For example, when those officers left Iraq, the tourniquets used by soldiers to treat field injuries had to be handed in, and they described how a man held a box for their collection. One officer told me that his body armour, sweaty after six months of brave service, also had to be handed in so that somebody else could use it. If equipment is to be handed on in that way&#151;it is almost like hot-bedding&#151;it is clear that something is wrong, and that there are serious pressures on some of the basics. When one speaks to brave soldiers who have faced sophisticated roadside bombs which might have emanated from countries such as Iran, one wonders why the Government have said nothing about the investment made in defence technologies aimed at dealing with that very real threat to our soldiers every hour of every day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="71009-0012.htm_para19"><a name="07100954000054">The debate will be the poorer for the lack of a wider context for the shopping list enunciated by the Minister, because we must be certain that we have got our procurement priorities right. The programmes are very long term, but the correct balance must be struck between the short-term interests of the infantry soldier on the ground and the longer-term strategic interests of force deployment and the ability to provide minute-by-minute air defence capability. The importance of that capability was demonstrated by the recent resumption of Russian military flights over the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="71009-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07100954000055">I turn to an article published in the October edition of the magazine<i>  Aerospace International</i><i> . </i>It said:</p>

It is worth looking at the sort of equipment produced there, as it includes the SU35&#151;an aircraft that is not dissimilar to the joint strike fighter. The same article says that an element of commercialism is creeping into the Russian aerospace industry, which is using its export arm to develop markets for affordable but high-performance modern aircraft. Those markets include India, and one cannot but wonder what we might be up against if such equipment were to be deployed.</p>

<p><a name="st_o255"><a name="07100954000057"><a name="71009-0012.htm_spnew10"><a name="07100954000128"><b>Mr. Hoyle:</b>
 The right hon. Gentleman is right to say that India is looking for aerospace technology. In fact, it is already building the Hawk aircraft, and it is still building Jaguars. Britain is one of the countries in the fly-offs to provide the future needs of the Indian air force. Does he agree that hon. Members of all parties should do everything in their power to support BAE Systems&#146; Typhoon aircraft, and to ensure that India looks to BAE Systems for its future needs, rather than to Russia?</p>

I suggest that he reads the magazine article to which I have referred, as it will expand his understanding and education by demonstrating exactly what we are up against. We are in a highly competitive world, and it sends a shiver down my spine to discover that the Russian aerospace industry once again is trying to compete for the sort of business that we want to secure.

The Minister did not mention the closer working relationship between the Saudi Arabian and United Kingdom aerospace industries, not just on development of Typhoons but on other air systems and perhaps in other areas of mutual defence interest. I regard that as very important. My first question is whether, against a background still of Government silence on tranche 3 of the Eurofighter Typhoon, the 72 aircraft will be net extra to the project or a trade-off between those aircraft which the United Kingdom have already decided to buy within the envelope of an overall purchase of 232. There seems to be a great deal of speculation on exactly what is happening with the third tranche of the Eurofighter Typhoon. I accept that a final decision will not have to be taken for probably another 12 months, but it would be helpful if the Minister could say something about the process to determine just how many of those aircraft will be bought.</p>

Lord Drayson made it clear that there was a plan B if the United States did not tangibly open the books to the United Kingdom aerospace industry and the United Kingdom Air Force on an equal basis and share that technology. What progress has been made? Have there been any tangible signs? If not, why not? If not, what does the Minister intend to do about the decisions that ultimately have to be taken about which aircraft are to be deployed on the carrier?</p>

 Perhaps not, but the purpose of the debate is to find out answers to some of these important questions. It is great to see BAE Systems recruiting 1,000 people this year and 1,000 next year of the right skills mix, but those people want to know whether they have a long-term future in the industry and they want answers to these questions, particularly against a background of press reports. A final assembly and check-out facility has been agreed for joint strike fighter with the Italians, when the Government said in the Rand Europe report that they were considering it. Again, they have gone quiet on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="71009-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07100954000077">As for conventional aircraft, perhaps the Minister could say something about the state of play for Nimrod. The Government announced about a year ago that they were talking about purchasing up to 12 MRA4 maritime patrol aircraft. Certainly, test flying has shown that its capability is much admired, not just in this country but by competitors. However, the Government are vacillating over the three prototype aircraft, notwithstanding the nine that I hope they will buy. The Minister should bear in mind the growing importance of long-range maritime patrol and land-based patrol aircraft. The Nimrod is an ideal solution to both those challenges, and it would be useful to know precisely the Government&#146;s position on these matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="71009-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07100954000078">The Minister glossed over the question of unmanned air vehicles. He seemed surprised when I asked him about the operational capabilities of the HERTI aircraft, which has been deployed in Afghanistan. The Government have, in fairness, provided some &#163;50 million for a demonstrator project from BAE Systems&#151;the Taranis project. I am delighted to hear that, but it would be helpful to know from the Minister some more about the time scale for that project, and whether the demonstrator will lead to more interest in different types of unmanned air vehicles. Without doubt, when one comes to look to the future, it will be important to strike the right balance between manned and unmanned air vehicles in facing the threats before us.</p>

or 30 years&#151;the United Kingdom Government could not see their way to being involved in any more fast jet project development. Given that competitors are now enhancing their technological capability, perhaps the Minister can say whether the Government plan to review that very definite statement in order to make certain that we do not fall behind in our technological capability.</p>

Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) mentioned the lack of specificity by the Government about the sovereign technologies that we need. The reason why we are involved in joint strike fighter is that short take-off and vertical landing capability and our manufacturing capability were the jewels in the aerospace crown that were put on the joint strike fighter table. If we are not involved in major projects in the future, the United Kingdom will develop its technologies, but on a jobbing shop basis. We will no longer be absolutely at the forefront of technological and material development. I should like to hear some reassurance from the Minister that the Government regard in the same way as they do our nuclear capability, our shipbuilding capability and our encryption capability, the capability to be at the forefront of aviation technology. Without those skills, given the importance of air power to meet a range of threats, we will flip backwards and become dependent on other people&#146;s technology at a time when we need sovereign capability.</p>

 I begin with an apology, or rather an explanation, to those on the Opposition Front Bench. It was no discourtesy that I was absent during the Opposition&#146;s opening speech, but defence debates often take place on days when the Select Committee on Defence has commitments. The hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key) and I were attending a meeting with the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice), to consider an issue that strikes a particularly important chord with all Members who represent defence constituencies: the arrangements for coroners&#146; courts and inquests following the repatriation of bodies from theatres abroad. I congratulate the hon. Member for Salisbury, who may well speak about such matters a little later in the debate&#151;I will leave that to him&#151;on his diligent campaign to bring these matters to the attention of the appropriate Ministers.</p>

we previously experienced. Babcock has formed Babcock Marine, the headquarters of which will be based in Plymouth. We look forward to working with the company, and we hope that, having acquired the significant additional base of Devonport, it will be able to use the new arrangements as a springboard to become a major marine defence company in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="71009-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07100954000084">The dockyard and the naval base activities are closely linked, and we were very pleased with the outcome of the review, which found a role for all three bases. The Minister and members of the Defence Committee are certainly familiar with the peaks and troughs of submarine maintenance work in Plymouth. The investment of &#163;150 million in the nuclear infrastructure to meet, quite rightly, the ever more stringent safety case and to enable those involved to undertake decommissioning work on the older classes of submarine was also very welcome and certainly answered some of the great concerns that we have expressed over recent years. Nevertheless, there will still be some challenges for the new company. The base porting of ships at Devonport remains a very important issue, on which we hope to get some clarification in the near future. If there is one issue on which the Minister&#146;s clarification would be appreciated, it is that there will be no further haemorrhaging of Devonport&#146;s role as a base port for ships in service.</p>

From discussions that I and the other Plymouth MPs&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck) and the hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)&#151;had with him, I know that he is familiar with those arguments and, indeed, will meet all three of us again tomorrow to continue the discussion. From his participation in the Thursday war, I am sure that he will have seen for himself that there is far less congestion in Plymouth than there is in the busy Portsmouth facilities. Nevertheless, we have the capacity to offer significant savings to the naval base review budget, especially through the innovative land release model that is under discussion.</p>

As chair of the strategy group that has been looking at the work load issues, the change in ownership and the naval base review since December 2005, I want to tell my hon. Friend the Minister how important we consider it to be to conclude the work that we began during the naval base review and to state clearly the comparative socio-economic impacts of a reduction in activities at the different naval bases on the savings that will need to be made.</p>

First, the recent &#163;30 million work package for HMS Ocean is certainly welcome, although of course we look forward to more of the allocated non-competitive work load coming our way. We have also become used to filling those troughs with luxury yacht work.

Friend the Minister mentioned in his opening speech. That will take a little bit of getting used to in Plymouth, which has been so strongly identified as a naval port for many years, but we hope that it heralds further contracts coming Devonport&#146;s way from that very big&#151;I think that it is worth &#163;16 billion&#151;programme of FRES vehicles, albeit perhaps not all of it. That would be a little greedy, but if we can perform with the skill for which the Devonport work force are so well known and deliver value for money, on time and to the right quality, Plymouth might well become known for that in future years&#151;as well as for its very strong association with naval matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="71009-0013.htm_para17"><a name="07100954000089">In the last defence debate, I spoke about increased investment in Defence Estates and single living accommodation, including Project Armada in Devonport, and improvements to service family properties. Since then, the Defence Committee has produced a report on the issue, and as part of our ongoing work we will look closely at the Government&#146;s response to the serious issues about the pace of change that we raised in our report. The investment announced in the Chancellor&#146;s statement earlier today is very welcome, but it is clear from our report that change and investment are greatly needed if we are to achieve the standard of accommodation that we would wish for all our service families within the foreseeable future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="71009-0013.htm_para18"><a name="07100954000090">A number of hon. Members mentioned helicopters.

We will consider the lessons of the urgent operational requirements, particularly in respect of the defence industrial strategy. The right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) expressed concern about whether the priorities were being configured correctly. I am not sure how welcome he would have found the remarks that the Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Richard Dannatt, made in his speech to the Royal United Services Institute in September. The key points that he attempted to lay before us, which will no doubt preoccupy us as we approach the forthcoming defence industrial strategy, is that basic equipment procurement has suffered as the UK has focused on the acquisition of advanced technologies, and that, as we heard in the Minister&#146;s opening remarks, the urgent operational requirements process, on which we now spend &#163;2 billion, has been instrumental in developing forces and their equipment.</p>

the great improvements that have been made, and not only in respect of the Mastiff vehicles. He particularly referred to the role of dismounted close-combat units. He compared the infantry unit of two years ago to one of today, and said that people</p>
<a name="71009-0013.htm_brev2"><a name="07100954000100"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;would be surprised at the difference between personal equipment, weapons vehicles and overall capability&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="71009-0013.htm_para22"><a name="07100954000094">We are experiencing continuous change in the culture of researching and developing new equipment, but there are also ongoing, major procurement changes to the partnership between industry and Government. The Select Committee will shortly return to consider the progress that has been made since the first defence industrial strategy, which of our recommendations have been taken up, the need to invest substantially in research and development if we are to keep ahead and are to be in the right place in 20 years&#146; time, and the issue of the small and medium-sized enterprises that the hon. Member for North Devon mentioned. I notice that Christianne Tipping of the Royal United Services Institute, who comments on such matters, says that she is unsure whether that issue is being followed up in the way that we on the Defence Committee would expect, and that the second defence industrial strategy might well suggest that that role needs to be formalised.</p>

Decisions are still being made, not only about up-front acquisition costs but about through-life cost, and that is one of the most difficult areas of defence procurement to take on. It has been said that it will take a brave individual to follow that through to its conclusion, but I hope that we on the Defence Committee can support those who are trying to do that.</p>

I served between 1979 and 1990. The wounds that I got were nearly always the result of being on the wrong end of a cricket ball; it was a rather different age from the one that my former colleagues are now living through in the Army. Indeed, I had to become a special adviser, and then a politician, to find people firing in my general direction. It is humbling to talk to my former colleagues, given what they have just gone through in six months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="71009-0013.htm_para26"><a name="07100960000004">I want to place on record my tribute to Lieutenant-Colonel Angus Watson, who has just brought the Light Dragoons battlegroup back. One of its squadrons, B Squadron, has just over 24 hours left in theatre on operations before it comes back. So far, the Light Dragoons have managed to get through without sustaining a fatality. That in itself is a great achievement. As I have family in the United States army who are serving in Baghdad and in Afghanistan, I know about the thoughts and prayers of everyone who is waiting for their loved ones to come home, and about the anxiety that families go through when their loved ones are deployed on operations. Tragically, Colonel Watson&#146;s battle group had six fatalities among members of the other sub-units that were part of his battle group. That is part of the pattern of operations, and it shows the intensity of the operations that we are now dealing with in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="71009-0013.htm_para27"><a name="07100960000005">We should reflect on the quite remarkable achievements of our young men and women on operations; in the case of the Light Dragoons, we are talking about young men. The Playstation generation is doing our country proud. They are 18, 19 and 20-year-old young men, and the calm, unassuming and humane way in which they have conducted themselves while on operations in Afghanistan is a great tribute to them&#151;a tribute that belies their age, and the expectations that even their parents had when their sons went into training with the Army. It is a remarkable achievement. In six months, B Squadron of the Light Dragoons has had 40 contacts with the enemy, and they range from 30 minutes to seven hours in contact with the enemy, including a full replenishment of ammunition in contact. One or two of my hon. Friends who have served in the Army, including my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames), will have some idea of what that means. What we have expected of them is remarkable.</p>

That small gesture from a local authority means a great deal to the regiments coming home; it shows that their contribution has been recognised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="71009-0013.htm_para29"><a name="07100960000007">We should not confuse our admiration for the magnificent way in which our young soldiers are carrying out their duties with a consideration of the wider merits of their task. It remains our duty constantly to assess whether the task that they are doing collectively on behalf of the United Kingdom serves British interests, and wider western liberal democratic national interests. That is a matter that we must constantly keep under review, and we should never confuse the fact that our soldiers are performing magnificently with the fact that what they are being asked to do might not be wholly helpful to our wider objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="71009-0014.htm_para0"><a name="07100960000008">Let me turn my attention to how the CVRT&#151;combat vehicle reconnaissance (tracked)&#151;has done on operations. I recall that when I joined the Army 27 years ago, the vehicles were six or seven years old. They were deployed in the primary role of the British Army of the Rhine, which was there to face our principal threat: invasion of Germany by the Soviet Union and the Warsaw pact countries. In a subsidiary role in Cyprus, where I was posted for six months, we had the delight of travelling around in Ferret scout cars and Saladin armoured cars, and those vehicles were laughably old. They were way older than anyone who was invited to crew them. They were products of the 1950s, but in a sense that did not matter, because that was a subsidiary role for the British Army; the principal question was where the new equipment ought to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="71009-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07100960000009">Today the CVRT is 34 years old, and it is deployed on our principal operational requirements in Afghanistan. It has undergone a number of updates. In the 1990s, when we acquired the Challenger 2 tank, we were in a ludicrous position. The reconnaissance at the front could not keep up with the armour that was supposed to follow it up, so there was a mid-life update of the CVRT, which resulted in a new diesel engine, suspension and power traverse. I am pleased to say that the urgent operational requirements that became apparent in the Balkans following the tragic loss of Lieutenant Richard Madden&#151;his vehicle hit a mine in Bosnia&#151;have resulted in mine blast protection that has saved the lives of at least two vehicle commanders whose vehicles hit mines in the past six months in Afghanistan.

 I will not give way to the hon. Gentleman. He should read the report, because it is a priceless exchange. I commend the hon. Member for North Durham on not losing any of his edge since we served on that Committee together. The people responsible for putting the programme together have told us that it will be ready in 2017. However, in 2003 the Chief of the General Staff gave evidence to the Defence Committee in which he suggested that it would be ready in 2009. Four years later, the programme has slid eight years to the right. At that rate of progress, in four years&#146; time we will be told that the programme will not be ready for another 12 years. All the time, the soldiers of the Light Dragoons&#151;my former colleagues&#151;are invited to continue to fight and work with the CVRT system in service. We owe them a great deal better than that, and I sincerely hope that the Department can address that. I have no confidence, however, that that will be the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="71009-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07100960000024">This is an enormous programme, and the whole future of the Army is bet on it. If we cannot put our Army in the field with the 3,000 vehicles that will be produced as a result, we are in trouble as a country. What is the context in which the Department was invited to fund the programme? The MOD has a budget settlement of 1.5 per cent. in real terms, which was produced at the same time as the Defence Secretary came to the House to trumpet the acquisition of aircraft carriers and the aircraft that will go on them. If I remember the exchange at the time, he was not prepared to put a price on the whole programme, but what is absolutely clear to anyone who understands even a limited amount about defence economics is that the current position is completely unsustainable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="71009-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07100960000025">The Government came to office in 1997. In 1998, after a strategic defence review, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer wanted to take &#163;1 billion a year out of the defence programme. That was reduced, after the intervention of the Chief of the Defence Staff, to &#163;0.5 billion a year. In the charming way in which the now Prime Minister counts these things, &#163;4.5 has been stripped from the defence budget as a result of that decision in 1998. It does not behove Ministers&#151;I cite the Minister for the Armed Forces as yet another example&#151;to criticise the Conservatives for their defence expenditure. Those Ministers inherited the defence expenditure plans of the Conservative Government in 1997, and they chose to cut that budget. Since then, they have been driven by operational requirements that have smashed any set of defence assumptions made in 1998.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="71009-0014.htm_para10"><a name="07100960000026">Ten years later, the armed forces are exhausted, and warrant officers do not take up commissions in regiments, because they do not want to go back to Iraq and Afghanistan yet another time. Young NCOs who have got married have been there, got their medal and been through an amount of military contact that puts most second world war veterans in the shade. There is a limit to their endurance, and to the endurance of their equipment. CVRT is one illustration of good kit that has been well maintained by dedicated people. I am sure my former colleagues would want me to put on record a tribute to the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers who are out there fighting alongside them, keeping that equipment in the field and doing a magnificent job in fitter sections alongside the fighting echelon.</p>

The most important thing is that we recognise that the Royal United Services Institute estimates that the defence budget is underfunded by &#163;15 billion if it is to match the commitments set out by the former Prime Minister.</p>

Harmony guidelines are regularly breached for a large proportion of our soldiers. That is exacerbated by poor retention levels and often increases reliance on our reserves. It is a vicious cycle&#151;fewer troops leads to over-use of those troops, which leads to a greater exodus, which leads to a greater reliance on ever-decreasing numbers. Defence planning assumptions have been breached for the past seven years at least. The over-commitment and under-resourcing has a dramatic effect on equipment as well. Little funding for new equipment results in greater reliance on old equipment, which is over-used in Iraq and Afghanistan. Heat and over-use leads to more breakdown, which leads to greater reliance on a smaller pool of equipment, and so on.</p>

Rosyth will play an important role in the final commissioning of these massive structures, which will be the biggest and most complex construction projects ever on the Forth, even compared with the iconic Forth bridge. We are looking forward to the massive increase in employment in Fife.

recess. This remarkable book, which is called &#147;East and West of Suez: the Retreat from Empire&#148;, was written by Tom Pocock in 1986. It talks of the great days of the British Navy and the 1953 Spithead review. He talks about the celebrations that took place:</p>
<a name="71009-0015.htm_brev0"><a name="07100960000136"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Foremost among them was to be the traditional naval review at Spithead off Portsmouth, when, tricked out with fluttering bunting and burnished brass and to the sound of bugles and saluting guns, the British displayed the realities of power. Two hundred warships of the Royal Navy lay at anchor, including the beautiful battleship <i> Vanguard</i> and seven aircraft carriers, while three hundred naval aircraft waited at airfields ashore to fly overhead as the royal yacht steamed between the long lines of grey ships.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="71009-0015.htm_para11"><a name="07100960000063">He then points out that there was a lot of fighting between the defence chiefs:</p>
<a name="71009-0015.htm_brev1"><a name="07100960000137"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Board of Admiralty was demanding a yet more generous share of the defence budget for research and development, aircraft production and ship-building. This brought them into conflict with the Air Council which was bidding for a force of long-range jet-powered bombers to drop the atomic bombs which were now being delivered to the RAF. The air marshals were allowed their bombers, which were to be called the Valiant, the Victor and the Vulcan and, collectively, the V-bombers, but the admirals were disappointed. True, eight aircraft carriers were under construction but work was proceeding slowly on three cruisers, which had been laid down about ten years before, and the Admiralty maintained that at least seventeen were needed.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="71009-0015.htm_para12"><a name="07100960000064">Some might say those were the days, but the only reason why those things happened was that the British public&#151;the electors&#151;knew that they needed such a scale of armament and those procurement programmes. We seem to have forgotten all that in the intervening years. We tend to think of high-intensity conflict as a very important subject, but we do not actually think of what is needed. After all, the traditional reasons for going to war have changed dramatically. We are not looking after territorial advantage now, or aiming for territorial expansion. We are not setting up new empires around the world. We are far more interested in acquiring armoured vehicles, guns or aircraft&#151;platforms, as we must now call them&#151;and systems to go with them because we are more interested in homeland defence and security. We are no longer concerned with the threat of invading armies; we are more interested in cyber warfare. Peace enforcement is a crucial part of the operation of the forces, as is guarding against terrorism, and deterring and defeating it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="71009-0015.htm_para13"><a name="07100960000065">However, there is also the matter of our country&#146;s need for global trade and travel. That is what we have done for hundreds of years, it is a legacy of empire and Commonwealth, and it is very important today. Owing to the fact that 90 per cent. of our trade is carried out by ship, we need a long reach to protect that trade.</p>

However, we are talking about things that touch the lives of every citizen every day, but they do not realise it.</p>

I am very grateful to them for allowing us to have such a debate&#151;it does not happen very often&#151;but the House should be packed on such an occasion and it is not. Whether we are talking about importing Fairtrade bananas from the Windward islands, fridges from China, television sets from Taiwan or cars from Japan, we are talking about the need for a global reach to defend our trade, our standing of living, our quality of life, our influence in the world and the British national interest. That is what is at stake, which is why we still need to procure such very expensive systems. It is why we shall continue for a long time&#151;indeed, for ever&#151;to need an Army, a Navy and an Air Force. There is much loose talk around to the effect that we will not need an Air Force when we have unmanned aerial vehicles. We will. We shall need expertise to operate those platforms whether they are manned or not, and we shall need the Navy because we must have global reach to protect our British interests and our alliances around the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="71009-0015.htm_para16"><a name="07100960000070">We will need an Army, of course, to help in the defence of the homeland, but also to ensure that we can project our standards of life, our morality and our ethical stance in the world, and so that we can look after humanitarian aid and carry out peace enforcement and peacekeeping as well as high-intensity warfare when the need arises. If we can explain that to the taxpayer&#151;indeed, if we could explain it to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the shadow Chancellor and the 620 Members of Parliament who are not here&#151;the defence budget might rise up the political agenda, and more people might share my view that, over a 10-year period, we should in the national interest double the defence budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="71009-0015.htm_para17"><a name="07100960000071">The usual suspects from all parties are debating, with great expertise, the need to hold the Government to account on the issue of particular procurement programmes, but that misses the main point: in a democracy such as ours&#151;an international country&#151;that is at the cutting edge of military capability, we still need to persuade the taxpayer that procurement matters. For people to go to Tesco, the Navy, Army and the Air Force must ensure that all the products can get there and be safe once they do so. It is as simple as that. However, we do not make that effort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="71009-0015.htm_para18"><a name="07100960000072">The Defence Committee has spent six months going to all the major NATO countries&#151;it is off to Georgia and Turkey next week&#151;and they all say that the public are not prepared to pay. The American public are prepared. The British public pay for more than anyone else in Europe, but other nations apparently do not think that that is important. It is important, and we need to convince the taxpayer of that, not by obscure arguments about whether one version of FRES is better than another or about who will win the contract for the next big order, but in relation to where the national, personal and family interests lie in having the best equipment and the best conditions for armed services personnel. If we can argue the case in such a way, the British taxpayer will realise its relevance, and then the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the shadow Chancellor might agree that we should double the defence budget over a 10-year period.</p>

 It is a great privilege to follow the hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key), who spoke so eloquently. He dwelt on slightly bigger themes, and I shall try to make various points in a similar vein.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="71009-0015.htm_para19"><a name="07100960000074">The UK spends &#163;32 billion a year on defence&#151; 2.5 per cent. of our GDP. That might be half the proportion of the mid-1980s, but in gross terms it is the fifth highest such spend in the world. It should be enough to maintain a substantial force, but we struggle. Our defence procurement system is not good at turning tax pounds into the equipment our armed forces need. Bluntly, the UK&#146;s defence procurement budget is spent more in the interests of a few privileged defence contractors than it is in the interests of our armed forces. An ineffective Ministry of Defence pays wildly high prices for kit that it suits the contractor to provide. The MOD pays double, or even triple the price, for what are often inferior products. I could talk at length about the catalogue of incompetence, but I shall confine my comments to helicopter procurement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="71009-0015.htm_para20"><a name="07100960000075">Sensibly, a decision was made to buy Apache helicopters, which are a good piece of American kit. However, in order to preserve jobs, or perhaps award large contracts to privileged suppliers, it was decided to assemble them in the UK. The cost of that protectionism has been vast, and is still being paid in Afghanistan today. Our UK-assembled Apaches cost approximately &#163;40 million each&#151;three times what the Israelis paid for theirs. Worse, by not buying directly off the shelf, we have ensured that only a handful of Apaches can serve in Helmand. Parts from the unused fleet in the west country are being cannibalised to keep our few Apaches in Helmand airborne. If we had bought directly from Boeing, we would have more Apaches&#151;more of those decisive, battle-winning weapons&#151;in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="71009-0015.htm_para21"><a name="07100960000076">I say to those who perceive defence procurement as an exercise in job creation rather than war winning that, if we had bought directly from Boeing, we could have given the 755 employees of Agusta &#163;1 million each and still saved &#163;1 billion. As a job preservation scheme, such protectionism was ludicrous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="71009-0015.htm_para22"><a name="07100960000077">Protectionism also explains why our armed forces do not have enough transport helicopters. The Ministry of Defence placed a &#163;1 billion order for the new Lynx at &#163;14 million each. The problem is that they will not be ready for several years. When I was at the air base in Kandahar, I saw an ancient, grounded Lynx, which the new Lynx is supposed to replace. It was designed for the cold war and is simply not operating in Afghanistan as it should. Next to it, I saw row after row of unused United States Black Hawks. They would cost only &#163;6 million each and could be available in months if only we were not so protectionist. Thanks to the Ministry of Defence, we spend twice as much on buying an inferior helicopter, which will not be available for years, from an Italian company. Similar points could be made about Merlin and<i> </i>the Chinook.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="71009-0015.htm_para23"><a name="07100960000078">Not only the taxpayer pays the price for that decision. In Iraq and Afghanistan, helicopters save lives. Every helicopter means fewer road journeys, fewer targets for improvised explosive devices, fewer bombed and broken troop carriers and fewer casualties. We pay a high price for the protectionist defence procurement policy.</p>

When Brigadier Ed Butler arrived back from Afghanistan, he was asked what piece of equipment he most needed. &#147;Helicopters&#148;, he said. I do not recall his specifying that they had to be built by Finmeccanica.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="71009-0015.htm_para25"><a name="07100960000080">The defence industrial strategy claims to be about providing the armed forces with the equipment that they require on time, and at best value for money for the taxpayer, but saying it does not make it so. The defence industrial strategy is based on the flawed premise that we need sovereignty of supply. That is lobbyist speak for, &#147;The defence procurement budget must go to a privileged few.&#148; Sovereignty of supply is a superficially attractive argument, but it is idiotic, not patriotic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="71009-0015.htm_para26"><a name="07100960000081">The premise is flawed because one simply cannot buy an exclusively British jet fighter, helicopter or missile; such equipment is too sophisticated. Sovereignty of supply is an argument for protectionism. One might as well argue that the UK needs self-sufficiency in food production. Doubtless it could be done with a massive protectionist effort. Doubtless a case could be made that, if we did not become self-sufficient, we could be starved out. However, most people recognise that that does not wash. For centuries, we have imported food&#151;and provisions for our armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="71009-0015.htm_para27"><a name="07100960000082">In what sense are the privileged few companies from which we are obliged to buy our defence kit British? Is Finmeccanica, maker of the new Lynx, British? Now that BAE has sold off Airbus, in what sense does awarding Airbus the &#163;2.5 billion contract to deliver the A400M transport planes preserve British jobs? With so many contracts outside the UK, why continue to treat BAE as a British company?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="71009-0015.htm_para28"><a name="07100960000083">The sovereignty of supply argument is about preserving the privileged status of a tiny handful of defence contractors. The defence industrial strategy is about maintaining a guarantee that some contractors will have a permanent income stream from British taxpayers. It is no surprise that the biggest supporter of the defence industrial strategy is BAE.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="71009-0015.htm_para29"><a name="07100960000084">Protectionism and the defence industrial strategy are wrong not because other companies cannot get a fair crack at supplying business but because our armed forces do not get the equipment that they need when they need it. It is not patriotic, but idiotic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="71009-0015.htm_para30"><a name="07100960000085">The farce continues because there is no effective accountability for defence procurement. As an aspect of public policy, it is no longer settled by those whom we can elect at the ballot box. Regardless of which Member of Parliament is the departmental mouthpiece, the defence contractors get the contracts that they want and our armed forces do not get the kit that they need. Civil servants escape censure for monumental inefficiencies; the Member of Parliament who happens to serve as the departmental mouthpiece loyally and faithfully recites the line that Sir Humphrey gives him. Remote officials make the decisions and our armed forces take the rap. No one is accountable and no one is sacked. That is how our defence procurement works today.</p>

avoid revealing the truth. I know from first-hand conversations with officials that the competitive procurement process for the new Lynx took place in name only. The process was made to fit the outcome. Yet, unlike our armed forces in Afghanistan, senior officials in the Ministry of Defence can simply avoid the consequences of the appalling failure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="71009-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07100960000087">In the House, it has become the Table Office&#146;s default setting to refuse to accept questions about BAE and its Saudi dealings, despite the existence of sufficient evidence to warrant such legitimate questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="71009-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07100960000088">While Members of the legislature are no longer able to hold the Executive to account, a sophisticated lobbying exercise aims at shutting down the debate. How many Members of Parliament who, like me, have taken part in the armed forces parliamentary scheme know that it is funded by the same contractors as the defence industrial strategy privileges? I suspect that the answer is not many, because the armed forces parliamentary scheme refuses to open the books.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="71009-0016.htm_para3"><a name="07100960000089">I raised the subject of defence contracts and procurement after my visit to Afghanistan and I was directly pressurised by the organisers of the armed forces parliamentary scheme for asking such questions. Without accountability, the defence industrial strategy will remain unchallenged. Its retention will maintain the near monopoly of BAE and a handful of others. As long as BAE remains the monopoly supplier, we will not get value for money. For all the management consultant speak about smart procurement and through-life contracts, basic economic literacy shows that, in defence as elsewhere, a near monopoly provider means that the buyer gets a poor deal. When there is a constraint on supply, the seller sets the terms of trade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="71009-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07100960000090">Recently, BAE was handed another &#163;124 million contract to build an unmanned aerial vehicle that we should have bought off the shelf. If one is in Helmand and one needs a UAV that works, one does not care where it is built.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="71009-0016.htm_para5"><a name="07100960000091">We do not merely need to buy off the shelf; we need to break the monopoly of the few suppliers. If we did that, we might buy the kit that we need instead of waiting until BAE is ready to supply what it is willing to provide. We might supply our armed forces with the best kit available. If we did that, we might well have less outmoded kit&#151;fewer anti-Soviet tanks, less submarine-hunting kit, fewer Eurofighters to defend the skies over the north German plain, fewer old-style frigates ready to take on the communist navy in the north Atlantic&#151;and more of the kit that our armed forces need to fight the wars to which we send them.</p>

I want to pay special tribute to the 4 Rifles Battle Group and Colonel Patrick Sanders, its commanding officer, who gave one of the most moving eulogies on youth when he spoke of the courage and valour that young men and women are showing in theatres today. Many people outside the House do not fully grasp that those people are every bit as brave and courageous as their grandparents and great-grandparents were. We should be proud of that, and it is a theme that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) developed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="71009-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07100960000095">I hope that the Minister will take on board the point that my hon. Friend made about the sometimes leaden approach of the Ministry of Defence, particularly by those responsible for the media unit, who sometimes sing a very different tune from, for example, the one that the Minister sang in his welcome words of support for Help for Heroes, a charity of which I shall be honoured to be a trustee. I hope that the Minister will convey his view to those who are sometimes obstructive. I speak from personal experience, as someone who successfully managed to arrange a day out at Newbury races for wounded armed servicemen. I came up against the media unit at the Ministry of Defence and, frankly, I found it pretty obstructive. The unit let the servicemen go, but it was no mean battle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="71009-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07100960000096">I also pay tribute to the mayor of Newbury, who is an excellent man. He has taken up Sir Richard Dannatt&#146;s invitation to pay tribute to our local regiment, the Royal Engineers, by giving a reception. His attitude contrasts with that of the leader of Newbury town council, who said that he wanted nothing to do with the occasion because he did not support the war in Iraq. I cannot condemn enough the failure to make the not-too-intellectual leap of separating whatever one might think about our deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq and paying tribute to our armed forces. I hope that the views of the leader of Newbury town council will be treated with the contempt that they deserve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="71009-0016.htm_para10"><a name="07100960000097">The main theme of my speech was also touched upon by my hon. Friend&#151;the extraordinary decision to axe the Defence Export Services Organisation. One of the great success stories in the past 40 years has been the joint working between Government and industry to co-ordinate and support our defence exports. DESO is a child of Labour. It was created by Denis Healey in 1966 and is the envy of the world. It has contributed to our being second to the United States in defence exports. We have to ask not only why the decision was taken, but why it was done in such a cack-handed and arbitrary fashion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="71009-0016.htm_para11"><a name="07100960000098">We know that the decision was taken by the Prime Minister. He produced a statement to Parliament on the day Parliament rose for the summer recess. I have a minute from the DESO team briefing on 29 August, at which the second permanent under-secretary said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="71009-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07100960000099">I should say so, when I can show clearly the level of unpreparedness across government, as they sought to cope with a decision that was kept so close to the Prime  <br>

Minister&#146;s inner circle. What consultation took place across the Government when the decision was taken? Was the Secretary of State informed? Was Lord Drayson informed? Was Lord Jones informed&#151;the former Digby Jones, who as the Minister responsible for UK Trade and Investment will, we are led to believe, take responsibility for whatever emerges from the debacle? He has been quoted in the industry press as saying that the decision was bonkers. He needs to convey that clearly to the Prime Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="71009-0016.htm_para13"><a name="07100960000100">DESO employs&#151;or did&#151;around 250 people. In defence terms, it costs a paltry &#163;16 million a year and supports and co-ordinates exports worth &#163;500 million to our balance of payments. DESO is the envy of the world and is being copied by countries that want to emulate our success in defence exports. It is worth looking briefly at what exactly happened. The night before the statement was presented to Parliament and the staff at DESO were informed, the permanent under-secretary was summoned to No. 10 Downing street, where the Prime Minister informed him that the decision had been made to axe DESO. The permanent under-secretary informed the outgoing director of DESO, who got the staff together the next morning so that the permanent under-secretary could tell them the bad news. The director of DESO then said the memorable words&#151;I might not be quoting him exactly&#151;&#147;Well, ladies and gentlemen, I think it&#146;s time that you went and started looking for jobs&#148;.

I would love to have the time to debate that issue with them here and now, but I do not. One of the rumours going round Whitehall is that it was to appease an individual or a group of individuals in his inner circle. I would suggest, however, that this was a typical new Labour cock-up: there are a few negatives out there, BAE Systems and the al-Yamamah project&#151;what shall we do? We should do something dramatic, then we can park it. If anyone raises defence exports, we can say, &#147;Look, this is what we&#146;ve done.&#148; Of course, al-Yamamah and anything else to do with Saudi Arabia is dealt with by the MOD Saudi Arabia project; it has nothing to do with DESO. But that does not matter; it is on the spin grid, and the Government have something that they can say.</p>

 I start by paying tribute to the armed forces who, as we speak in today&#146;s debate, are serving on Britain&#146;s behalf across the world. No one has any idea of the level of operations that they are engaged in today; it is probably a level that has not been seen since the second world war. That has a tremendous impact on the lives of the individual soldiers and their families, on their equipment, and, indeed, on the collective psyche of the armed forces. We should not underestimate that what they are doing now&#151;whether it all finishes next year in Iraq or whether it finishes in Afghanistan in 10 years&#151;will live with us for decades to come. It will live with us in their families, and in the equipment that we will have to replace. It will also live with the taxpayer and the electorate; as my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Robert Key) rightly pointed out, they will have to recognise and contribute to this effort, through the ballot box perhaps, as part of the responsibility that they hold towards our armed forces.</p>

it can shape our military doctrine for the future&#151;rightly or wrongly&#151;and leave many of our troops with the wrong equipment in the wrong place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para1"><a name="07100964000006">Defence procurement is a misunderstood subject. It often gets a bad press, involving the use of terms such as &#147;overspend&#148; and &#147;late delivery&#148;. However, the story of the small defence contracts and procurement processes going on every day&#151;whether through urgent operational requirements or planned projects&#151;that are delivered on time and on budget, and greatly welcomed by our armed forces, often goes untold. Yes, the large projects get a bad press. However, I was the overseas director of QinetiQ before coming into the House, and a soldier before that, and in my experience, delays in defence procurement are often the fault of the politicians of the day interfering because they feel that something needs to change, or of a strategic defence review of the threat to our forces resulting in the doctrine changing direction. Those factors inevitably have a cost impact. We should remember that they often arise for the right reasons, but they do cost money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para2"><a name="07100964000007">The other thing is that we need to lance a few of the boils that we hear about in connection with defence procurement. One is obviously the great &#147;off the shelf&#148; argument that my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell) referred to. According to that argument, it is easy to nip down to Battersea heliport and procure a few helicopters for our armed forces. However, procuring a helicopter from wherever we can get it is of course not the whole story. In fact, it is probably only about 10 per cent. of the story. First, we have to see whether the helicopter can actually take the weapons systems that we want to put on it to protect it. Then we have to ensure that the helicopter has the guidance systems suitable for the interoperability needs of our armed forces. There is no point putting on to a helicopter a compass or a radar system that is fit for the armed forces of the US, the Australians or the Germans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para3"><a name="07100964000008">There is an interesting anecdote here. The US exported a number of F-22s to be stationed and used in Japan. The problem was that the GPS system did not recognise the international dateline, so half way through flying across the Pacific to get to Japan, the planes had to turn back and have the whole system reprogrammed. We have to ensure that our equipment fits our needs and our doctrines. We have to recognise that helicopters bought off the shelf might not fit the configuration of our platoons, which might carry more or less equipment than the host nation from which we buy the helicopters. The deployment of our soldiers into more hostile areas may mean that our helicopters need more protection. That takes time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para4"><a name="07100964000009">In the case of the Apache, for example, it is totally misleading to say that if we were to buy from the US, all would be well. Let us remember that we buy from other countries and we wait in line. Why should the US say, &#147;Oh, don&#146;t worry, UK, you can jump the queue with the Apaches&#148;? Just tell the US marine corps, a much larger customer, that it can wait for its 500 helicopters! We would probably be told to come back in two or three years.</p>

 I am grateful, but my understanding of the Mastiff project is that it has been delivered because we put some of the assembly and final production in the UK. My hon. Friend the Member for Harwich objected earlier that we should not manufacture or produce in the UK unless necessary. Mastiff has been a successful procurement, delivered on time, but that was partly because the US had the force level required at the time in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para5"><a name="07100964000012">Another example is the FRES programme. Production of serious and complicated large bits of equipment does not happen every day. Production lines are not running all the time all over the world, churning out armoured personnel carriers. In fact, I believe that at the moment there are only two production lines in the west where armoured vehicles are being made. One is in Switzerland&#151;General Dynamics&#151;and there is another plant in Canada. The Vickers plant in Newcastle is not doing that job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para6"><a name="07100964000013">This is not like buying a mini or a car from Volkswagen. There are no production lines that just carry on through the years and the decades. They come together, produce the order, and very often, if the export sales cannot be found, they stop. People should remember that when they say, &#147;We don&#146;t need a FRES. Let&#146;s just buy them off the shelf.&#148; There are only two production lines capable of producing what we want; they are not in our possession at the moment and we do not have the ability to deliver. Secondly, there are no alternatives to what we want to fit into our military doctrine, so pulling off the shelf would not solve that problem. If we do not sometimes&#151;not necessarily always&#151;develop and make our own weapons systems, we do not have the ability to resell them or to generate income to share the development costs and perhaps profit from them. One of the most successful artillery pieces in the world is made by BAE Systems in Barrow. The British do not buy it, but it is incredibly profitable because it spreads the cost across the world. Should we decide to buy it, the unit cost would be very cheap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para7"><a name="07100964000014">What is more, our defence no longer uses the technology of 1945; its technology is highly complex. One of the reasons why we have smaller forces is the punch that our platforms can now give. They need source codes, for example, and the ability to service and upgrade throughout their lives. That means that we need control. Those who buy off the shelf may get their equipment cheap up-front, but the equipment must last for 30 or 40 years, and when it comes to an urgent operational requirement, Boeing will be waiting with a big fat invoice, and we will not have a skills base.</p>

It is important to national security&#151;and yes, jobs are important. Defence procurement, and Government procurement, are not a fantasy or dream of the capitalist world, because there is not a level playing field in most countries. As overseas director at QinetiQ, I regularly came up against other European or United States defence contractors. I can tell the House that the British defence market is the most open, probably the most transparent and probably the fairest in the world&#151;and we do not get much thanks for that from our competitors. If we let it all go, we will have very little security of supply and very little ability to develop our own way of thinking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para10"><a name="07100964000019">People say that we will all be allies together. Will we?

We should not forget that countries such as China and Iran that could become our rivals&#151;I think that a more civilised term than &#147;enemies&#148;&#151;are procuring and spending as if there were no tomorrow. We must always anticipate whatever threats are around the corner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para11"><a name="07100964000020">The reason why we can produce the UOR&#151;urgent operations requirement&#151;equipment that saves British lives every day is the skill base that we have here, at home. When people say that it was possible to protect the Warrior from the RPG29 or from some other threat, it generally turns out that it was done by means of a telephone call to some of our engineers in what is often little more than a shed. In the greatest British tradition, the engineers came up with the ideas and the equipment was on the front line within days or weeks. That capability is something that we should not give away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para12"><a name="07100964000021">I want to record my appreciation of what Lord Drayson has done. I believe that, as a procurement Minister, he has done an awful lot of good in putting Ministry of Defence procurement on the right track. However, I feel that there have been a few weaknesses in today&#146;s debate. I was disappointed by the Minister&#146;s opening speech. There are many big questions to be answered about the joint strike fighter, the third tranche of Typhoon and the update of the air tanker: where is it? There is also the question of the Defence Export Services Organisation, which my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon) rightly raised. I used DESO in my business. It was excellent, and if we lose that expertise, British defence industry&#151;small or big&#151;will be the worse for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para13"><a name="07100964000022">If anyone wants to know the difference between DESO and the DTI, let me explain that in my sector we used to call the DTI &#147;Deter Trade International&#148;. Its ability to secure straight answers, quick decisions and a knowledge of the market was as far removed from that of DESO as chalk is from cheese.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para14"><a name="07100964000023">I was amazed that the Minister did not mention the defence trade co-operation treaty. That treaty, between the United Kingdom and the United States, was laid before the House two weeks ago yesterday, and is incredibly important to the United Kingdom defence industry and the United Kingdom and United States armed forces. It is about our sharing with our closest ally technologies that save our soldiers&#146; lives every day. That treaty is sitting on the table, but it has not been mentioned.</p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Harwich has talked of public accountability for defence procurement&#151;and if he wants to see how that can go badly wrong, I suggest that he take a trip to Congress and see how pork-barrel politics often destroys a cohesive defence doctrine in the Pentagon. It is an important lesson. We as politicians and the Ministry of Defence can take long-term defence procurement decisions in the national interest without being too hamstrung by elections every other year.</p>

 I understand that we lost the TRACER&#151;tactical reconnaissance armoured combat equipment requirement&#151;programme because a congressional sub-committee put a line through the programme in Congress, against the wishes of the Pentagon.

 My hon. Friend is correct. I think that a recent United States defence budget had 9,000 tags, or attachments, when it went through the appropriations committee; members of Congress were deciding that their naval base needed a new set of front gates, and the ejector seat for the new aircraft should be cancelled. That is not the way to go about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para16"><a name="07100964000027">We needed some clear answers from the Minister. The debate is about procurement. There were many opportunities for him to update us. The fact that he missed out the defence trade co-operation treaty is important. Inevitably, it will come before the House for a vote. This might have been an opportunity to flag it up. I want to place on record my appreciation of the work of Andrew Radford and the British embassy in Washington. He has done an amazing job in negotiating that treaty with the US State Department. It is a very good document. I hope that the House will support it when it goes through. It is good news for us and for the US.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para18"><a name="07100964000029">We could use some good examples from the future rapid effect system about how we need to push forward. I am worried about FRES. It started with a weight requirement of 17 tonnes and the No. 1 priority of being air-mobile and of being able to go back in the A400M. The weight requirement has recently changed: it is now up to 27 tonnes. In our procurement of the A400M, we seek a lift capability of only 26 tonnes. The Germans have gone for 30. Currently, therefore, we could be on course to lose that air mobility. Another thing about FRES could have been clarified. It was supposed to be manufactured in the United Kingdom. That was one of the main issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para19"><a name="07100964000030">If the FRES project means that our vehicles can no longer be air-mobile, we may have to get into the realms of answering the question: what will the Conservatives do when it comes to finding money for defence projects?  <br>

There was the mess of spending &#163;190 million on the TRACER programme and the multi-role armoured vehicle project from 1998. That was just a waste. Two projects&#151;one a United States project and one a European consortium project&#151;have been cancelled, and it has cost the taxpayer &#163;190 million. Perhaps we could talk about the mistakes made with the SA80 rifle, or the brand-new chairs for the MOD headquarters. There are examples within the MOD budget that show a woeful lack of accounting. That could be improved.</p>

I would like the Minister to come back and tell me what steps the MOD intends to take to ensure that the structure of the aircraft carrier ordering programme is devised in such a way that opportunities for subcontracting are maximised, so that local firms in the areas of the yards involved are able to participate. We do not want the subcontract blocks to be so large that local firms cannot tender for work and it therefore has to go abroad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para22"><a name="07100964000034">Similarly, I hope that the Ministry of Defence will work in Scotland with local colleges and Scottish Enterprise in its various manifestations to ensure that, across the country, adequate training is provided for both adults and youngsters so that we maximise the number of people taken into employment in the shipyards and the subcontracting industries, rather than simply having imported labour. We are worried about the skills shortage in the west and east of Scotland and we do not want the jobs simply to be filled by immigrants from eastern Europe or elsewhere. The Prime Minister has spoken of British jobs for British workers; I want these jobs to go to people who are currently unemployed or under-trained, and we now have an opportunity to focus on achieving that.</p>

inviting him&#151;although, given the Conservatives&#146; record in Scotland, I might hold back from doing so. However, I take his comments in the spirit in which he intended them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para23"><a name="07100964000037">We will have a robust discussion in Scotland about whether the Scottish nationalist-led Scottish Executive are prepared to put the necessary money into training to ensure that industries such as defence, which depend on the UK Government for their orders, are adequately staffed and provided for. That will be one of the most important political debates in Scotland over the next year or so, and I intend to participate in it. I have done all that I can to ensure that my constituents are aware that the placing of the orders for the aircraft carriers has come about as a result of Scotland&#146;s membership of the United Kingdom. My constituents are under no illusions. If there were an independent Scottish navy, it would not be ordering two aircraft carriers on its own.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para24"><a name="07100964000038">Let me return to the thrust of my remarks. The MOD has been working constructively and positively with the shipbuilding industry to try to provide a degree of forward planning to ensure that we avoid the peaks and troughs of demand that have caused such havoc in the lives of many of that industry&#146;s work force, who have had to be repeatedly laid off and then rehired. When skilled staff in industries such as shipbuilding get laid off, many of them find other jobs and never return. We cannot simply turn such a labour force on and off like a tap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para25"><a name="07100964000039">Given that context, I particularly welcome the Government&#146;s commitment in principle that the peaks and troughs in the shipbuilding orders for the frigates and aircraft carriers will be evened out by sequencing the placement of the MARS programme&#151;the military afloat reach and sustainability fleet tanker programme&#151;and making sure that it meshes in. I was therefore extremely concerned when representatives of the industry informed me that the MARS commercial manager recently wrote to a number of suppliers suggesting that it was the Government&#146;s intention that the fleet tanker programme should be progressed under the EC public procurement regulations. If that were to happen, and if the competition for the fleet tankers were to be open to European companies, it would presumably go to the lowest bidder, and therefore the opportunity that we have to adjust the timing of the flow of work through the shipyards to take account of peaks and troughs would be lost. We ought at the very least to delay that until the forthcoming MARS industry day has taken place on 24 October.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="71009-0017.htm_para26"><a name="07100964000040">In the longer term, we should delay the programme until such time as we are able to ascertain exactly what the shipyards&#146; flow of work under the aircraft carrier order will be. As I understand it, simply to issue an advert for the procurement process through the <i> Official Journal of the European Union</i> would commit us to that process at an early stage. We would not then be able to claw it back.</p>

that can be exempted from the EU procurement process under article 296 of the treaties that established the European Union?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="71009-0018.htm_para1"><a name="07100964000042">In the past, we have argued that, in some circumstances, vessels should be designated &#147;grey ships&#148; and therefore not have to go down the open procurement route. Given what the specification for the ships is likely to be, it is my view that they clearly fall under that exemption and that the MOD is therefore not required to go for open procurement. As I understand it, the range of military capabilities and standards detailed in article 296 is substantial. There is a classification against Lloyd&#146;s register naval ship rules, rather than merchant ship rules. There is a specification about naval helicopter operating, support and maintenance facilities and one in respect of secure military communications systems, which will be in the contract. There will also have to be naval-replenishment-at-sea equipment, and firefighting and security arrangements that exceed merchant navy practice. Similarly, there will have to be manoeuvring, stability and sea-keeping requirements in excess of merchant standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="71009-0018.htm_para2"><a name="07100964000043">All that makes me believe that it is not necessary for the MOD to go to European open procurement. Also involved will be the ability to transit out of nuclear, biological and chemical contamination areas, having survivability, vulnerability and shock standards in excess of commercial standards and having operating patterns with warships. Such patterns would inevitably put the vessels in harm&#146;s way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="71009-0018.htm_para3"><a name="07100964000044">In such circumstances, how can the MOD say that those are not military ships and are eligible to be put out for open procurement? I want the Minister to be clear about whether the MOD has thought through what the consequences of such open ordering might be. If the prime contract were won by a foreign supplier, it is entirely likely that that supplier would use its own supply chain. That would cut directly across the MOD programme to develop British supply chains in shipbuilding and elsewhere. I find it difficult to believe that the MOD would draw up a specification that gave the prime contracting role to a foreign supplier, yet not allow that supplier to choose its own sub-suppliers. If the supply chain were dictated from the United Kingdom, that would be a recipe for chaos, with a different prime supplier not using its normal supply routes. I hope that the Ministry of Defence and the Minister will consider the whole issue again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="71009-0018.htm_para4"><a name="07100964000045">Finally, on behalf of the trade union movement in the yards of my constituency and elsewhere, I pay tribute to the excellent work that Lord Drayson has done. He has established a relationship with the trade unions far better than those of many of his predecessors, largely because he has been consistently open and straightforward with them. They genuinely believe that they can trust him; it has to be said that they are not always happy with what he tells them, but they have always accepted that he is simply giving it to them straight. Similarly, I have found him to be somebody with whom it is a pleasure to deal. As many Members know, when it comes to reform of the House of Lords, I am in favour of the &#147;one Lord, one lamp post&#148; solution. However, I want it made clear that that would not all happen simultaneously and would be done in tranches. Lord Drayson would certainly be towards the end of that queue.</p>

The way in which the situation around the world has changed makes holding a regular review of our defence posture something that the House should consider very seriously. However, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that we will also be calling it to the attention of our friends and colleagues that the Liberal Democrats have called for a windfall tax on the defence companies. I am sure that they will be interested to hear about that policy.</p>

I have served as his deputy in the House, and he is a wonderful man to work for. No one has the interests of the armed services closer to his heart than he&#151;and, my goodness, this House knows that he has a very big heart. He made a number of very good points, especially about the under-reporting of the positive achievements of our armed forces on operations. Something that is gaining common ground on both sides of the Chamber is that members of the armed forces often complain, when we visit them in theatre, that the media do not report the positive things that they are doing. They want to know why that happens, and they will say so even when the media are there with them. The media need to look to their own responsibilities not only to the wider British public but to the armed forces themselves.</p>

It is an extremely critical component in Britain&#146;s defence capability, and we should pay tribute to it. We should pay tribute to all Britain&#146;s defence companies, whether large or small, for the incredible job that they do. We are a small country. We are a fifth of the size of the United States yet, as several of my hon. Friends have pointed out, we are the second largest exporter of defence equipment in the world. We owe that to the professionalism and innovation of our scientists and engineers. Far from decrying them, I pay them the warmest possible tribute.

Of course, that exchange led to the decision by the Ministry of Defence to remove any requirement on the part of the Government to give in-service dates, largely because they were completely incapable of meeting in-service dates.

Without that home base here, it would not have been able to achieve what it has achieved in the United States. His suggestion that we should simply buy off the shelf was effectively refuted by my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace).

In the same vein, having been instrumental in persuading Rushmoor borough council to put up some fantastic 20 ft banners in Aldershot a couple of weeks ago that said, &#147;Aldershot welcomes home the Grenadier Guards&#148;, I should like to see what he has done in Newbury and to tell the House that Aldershot Town football club has tonight opened its doors to the Grenadier Guards and others who have recently returned from operations and invited them to the game against Ebbsfleet&#151;a game that I am sure everyone will rush to watch on the television, as soon as the debate is over&#151;and they are being welcomed in free. That should be done much more often across the country. I will return to the subject of the Defence Export Services Organisation, because my hon. Friend made some important points.</p>

He is not the product of some sort of party political research organisation and the hothouse of politics. As well, of course, as his distinguished record of service in the military, he has been on the front line, fighting for British interests commercially. He made an extremely important speech. I was pleased to be in Washington with him earlier in the summer, where on a cross-party basis with a number of Labour Members we tried to persuade the Americans that our not getting access to the technology for the joint strike fighter would be a potential show-stopper. We must be able to operate that aircraft autonomously. He was right to mention the defence treaty; I hope that the Under-Secretary will refer to that in his winding-up speech, and tell us when it will come before the House.</p>

Why would they feel valued and why should they put their life on the line if those in charge of policy fail to give them proper and sufficient equipment to do the job? The Minister for the Armed Forces listed new projects that have recently been delivered or ordered, and we welcome them, not least the Supacat, which I mentioned, and the Mastiff, which I have seen in operation in theatre, and which is unquestionably a splendid piece of equipment, although it should have been in service much sooner. However, that is the least that should be expected of a Government who have decided to embark on two major military operations simultaneously, exceeding the planning assumptions set out in their strategic defence review of 1998.</p>

shortages to which hon. Friends have drawn attention. The RAF continues to operate old transport aircraft that the Government intend to replace by means of one of the most absurd procurement private finance initiatives yet invented. It is scandalous that the Royal Air Force is no nearer to getting its hands on the future strategic tanker aircraft than it was two and a half years ago, yet the first aircraft was due to be in service this year.

That chaotic situation is set against a background where everyone knows that we face an increasingly uncertain world, with Russia engaged in sabre rattling, as my right hon.

In the meantime, China has invested heavily in building its military capability and rogue states have threatened to acquire lethal long-range weapons.

The whole procurement process has failed to adjust to the new world order. As the head of Thales, Mr. Denis Ranque, said to me when I met him in Paris on Thursday, we need to devise a new procurement strategy that reconciles the need for agility in meeting rapidly changing threats with the need for a longer-term programme into which the short-term requirements can fit.</p>

 It is an honour and a privilege for me to work with our armed forces and veterans. I join the rest of the House in paying tribute to their courage, determination and professionalism. We are well aware of their bravery and the task that they are undertaking in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world.</p>

Service personnel and taxpayers have a vested interest in procurement, and it is our duty to ensure that we have the right policies and processes in place to help British armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para11"><a name="07100964000094">The debate was wide ranging and included some very good contributions. We heard from my hon.

the Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson). I shall try to deal with as many of the issues raised during the discussion as I can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para12"><a name="07100964000095">I was surprised that the first item of procurement that was brought up was British lamb. The hon. Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin) is not present, but I understand that the figure that he quoted is not correct. It is not 3 per cent. of our procurement&#151;13 per cent. of the lamb procured for the armed forces is of British origin and we would like to improve that, but various issues such as availability and price must be taken into account. Where we can source British produce and meat, we will do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para13"><a name="07100964000096">As Defence Ministers, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I regularly visit our armed forces personnel in the UK, in operational areas and elsewhere. The hon. Member for North Devon mentioned kit. One of the first questions that we ask our armed forces personnel wherever we are, particularly in Afghanistan and Iraq, which I visited three weeks ago, is what they think of their personal equipment. Perhaps I am hearing a different story from the one the hon. Gentleman hears, but the overwhelming view is not only that it is good, but that it is the best personal kit that they have ever had. That view has been put across to us from all ranks. As Ministers, we want to know if there are problems that we can deal with. From time to time there are issues&#151;we heard about boots, for example&#151;but the message that we get is as I have described it. A great deal of investment has been put into talking to our armed forces personnel about what they need and into the work that has been taking place in the MOD and the armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para14"><a name="07100964000097">Let me give an example. As the House knows, I have responsibility for Defence Medical Services. When I was out in Camp Bastion a few weeks ago, the message coming across to us from our medics throughout the Defence Medical Services was that the personal equipment that they have, particularly the body armour, is saving lives that would not have been saved just a couple of years ago. That is an important point to make, and I reject the Opposition&#146;s accusation that we are not spending to support our armed forces at home and abroad and to give them the best possible protection. I refute that, and I shall return to the issue later.</p>

<p><a name="st_o311"><a name="07100964000098"><a name="71009-0019.htm_spnew0"><a name="07100964000183"><b>Dr. Fox:</b>
 One of the consequences of improved body armour is fewer fatalities but a higher number of casualties who survive serious injury. I shall ask the Minister something that I have asked his predecessors about for more than a year. One of those consequences will be an increase in concussion-type injuries resulting in traumatic brain injury. The Americans have already instituted protocols for their servicemen and servicewomen in theatre, but we have not. When will that be done? We are constantly told that the Government will evaluate the information, but it is now some 18 months since this was begun in the United States, so when will we get it for our armed forces?</p>

<p><a name="st_o312"><a name="07100964000099"><a name="71009-0019.htm_spnew1"><a name="07100964000184"><b>Derek Twigg:</b>
 I have told the hon. Gentleman that we are examining this. Let me make it clear that when I was talking about this issue at Headley Court a few months ago, there was a difference of opinion about how it should be addressed. The Americans have a view  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="9 Oct 2007">

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2007 : Column 266</b><br>
about how they want to pursue it. We are listening to that and we shall be talking to them&#151;we have a liaison officer out there. It is important that we get the medical opinion right. When we reach a conclusion, we shall make a statement in the House on our approach to this type of injury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para15"><a name="07100964000100">The hon. Gentleman is right that the way in which we look after people and injuries is a crucial part of the whole process. I hope that he will now accept that what is happening at Selly Oak, Headley Court and our regional rehabilitation centres is world class in terms of saving lives and allowing many people to be rehabilitated and, in some cases, to go back to service in greater numbers than they have before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para16"><a name="07100964000101">The hon. Member for Newbury takes a great interest in this because of his regimental connections and the casualties that his regiment has suffered. I praise him for his work in taking service personnel to Newbury. I know that that was a very good day out and that they greatly enjoyed it. He put a lot of effort into it, and I wish to put that on the record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para17"><a name="07100964000102">We need to judge the success of our procurement policy by the success of our military operations. We are clearly seeing success. Recently, when I was in Afghanistan, I found a great feeling that much has been achieved. There is much more to do, but people felt a great sense of achievement in doing something that was right and proper. That message came across from all ranks. There can be little doubt that our forces are demonstrating in Iraq and Afghanistan that they have behind them a robust and effective procurement infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para18"><a name="07100964000103">We have changed the infrastructure in recent years, most notably through the formation of Defence Equipment and Support and the implementation of the defence industrial strategy. Two years on, it is clear that the DIS is working and has made an impact. It is embedded in our culture and the way we do business, and it is driving better partnerships between the MOD, as customer, and industry. Clarity and transparency are the cornerstones of the strategy, building strong foundations for an equipment programme that is stable and affordable and has the flexibility to respond to changing operational requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para19"><a name="07100964000104">I want to echo an important point made by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex: the fact that what our armed forces are doing in Iraq and Afghanistan is not getting wider recognition in the press and elsewhere. General Dannatt has also recently raised this issue, and we share those frustrations. Reporters are embedded in both theatres and, as the hon. Gentleman will know, there are opportunities to talk to our armed forces personnel. They could also go to Headley Court, where on two or three occasions I have spoken to them. There are plenty of opportunities to do more and plenty of information exists. A number of documentaries have been made and there have been TV involvements, but I agree that more should be done, and I urge those in the media to do more to publicise the fantastic bravery of our armed forces. My hon. Friends and I will continue to do as much as we can to ensure that the message about the bravery and professionalism of our armed forces gets across, but we cannot force people to print something or to show something.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para20"><a name="07100964000105">Two years on, it is clear that the defence industrial strategy is working and has made an impact. It is a blueprint for change and a plan of action. It is about  <br>

robust project management, proper deadlines and driving forward through life capability, making sure our forces get the kit that they need when they need it. Of course, innovation is at the heart of this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para21"><a name="07100964000106">In order to face the defence challenges of the future, we must maximise our benefits from advancing technologies. Last autumn, we launched our defence technology strategy, which outlines the research and development agenda over the next decade. The right hon. Member for Fylde raised a particular issue about the strategy&#146;s future and I hope that we will be able to deal with that. Innovation and a focus on emerging technologies will be a clear priority. That has provided the direction for both the MOD and industry about where we need to retain UK-owned capability to ensure operational sovereignty and national security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para22"><a name="07100964000107">This nation has a strong science and technology base. UK scientists claim about 10 per cent. of the major international prizes every year. By 2014, the Government plan to increase investment in research and development to 2.5 per cent. of gross domestic product. Every year, the Department spends about &#163;2.5 billion on research and development, and we are committed to pushing through our ideas into commercial spin-offs. We have steadily opened up our research programme to competition in recent years. We are well placed to reap the benefits of this process and the defence technology strategy sets the agenda on how we will go about that. Five major initiatives were launched through the DTS: the Grand Challenge; the Competition of Ideas; increased emphasis on science and technology research; engagement with industry on future investment in defence research and development; and investment in skills, about which my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West made a point earlier. Those strands work together to ensure that the UK has the best people, skills, knowledge and industry it can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para23"><a name="07100964000108">The Competition of Ideas proved to be extremely successful in reaching out to the wider scientific and engineering community to find solutions for the new challenges we face. I am delighted to have the opportunity to announce the very first award. The Competition of Ideas recently saw its first contract awarded to Plextec Ltd, which will research improvements in communications between vehicles and convoys. That is the kind of creative application from a small company&#151;several issues have been raised today about the importance of small companies to defence&#151;that has the potential to make a vital contribution to this country&#146;s defence effort. I commend my noble Friend Lord Drayson for his work in this area. It is widely accepted that he has done a magnificent job and made many major improvements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para24"><a name="07100964000109">Many hon. Members referred to the importance of the defence industry to this country, and it is a vibrant and thriving sector. It supports more than 300,000 private sector jobs and produces revenue of around &#163;13 billion per year. I pay tribute to it; it is crucial to this country and the defence effort. It is imperative that we get it right by ensuring the best deal for the front line and the taxpayer, and building capability throughout our armed forces is crucial to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para25"><a name="07100964000110">We talked about naval capability, but I would like to cover a few other areas. The capability of the Navy has improved demonstrably over the last decade. The Sea King Mk 6 anti-submarine warfare helicopter has been replaced by the new Merlin aircraft, which I saw recently  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="9 Oct 2007">

during my visit to RNAS Culdrose. It is capable of significantly greater detection ranges and a faster cruising speed, and it is able to cover eight times more sea space, which represents a quantum leap in capability. Looking to the future, the maritime afloat reach and sustainability class of afloat support ships will replace the current group of ageing auxiliary fleet support helicopter ships. That will strengthen the Navy&#146;s ability to sustain an extraordinary expeditionary capability well into the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para26"><a name="07100964000111">Much has been said today about capabilities, and as has been highlighted before, the responsiveness of our UOR programme. We have heard about the range of equipment now in theatre, and it is important to make the point that the UOR process has continued to deliver more than &#163;1 billion of force protection&#151;approved for Afghanistan and Iraq. It continues to deliver for our front line armed forces. To go further, as of August 2007, 91 per cent. of equipment procured under the UOR process was deemed either highly effective or effective by our troops, which is an improvement. The Viking, supplemented by UORs for a desert environment, has been praised by the Royal Marines operating in theatre. To quote one Marine:</p>
<a name="71009-0019.htm_brev6"><a name="07100964000152"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Enemy mortars landed just two metres away from my Viking the other week and there wasn't even a scratch on her. Small arms fire rounds just bounce off her like stone chippings.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para27"><a name="07100964000112">Recently we have seen the deployment to Afghanistan of the guided multiple launch rocket system, or GMLRS, which has a precision strike ability of up to 70 kilometres. It has proved itself to be a remarkable asset to the Royal Artillery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para28"><a name="07100964000113">Air capability also plays a crucial role in the success of our operations. We are in the final stages of gaining airborne stand-off radar, or ASTOR. It is a ground surveillance system designed to provide information regarding the deployment and movement of enemy forces. With contract costs of approximately &#163;800 million, the ASTOR system comprises five aircraft and eight ground stations, together with comprehensive training and maintenance facilities at the main operating base, RAF Waddington. Clearly, the up-to-the-minute information this technology can deliver will be of exponential benefit to commanders on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para29"><a name="07100964000114">As I think was mentioned earlier, the procurement includes the future strategic tanker aircraft, which will replace the RAF&#146;s VC10s and TriStar fleets. The new platform will perform air-to-air refuelling and air transport roles. We are proceeding with a private finance initiative and aim to have the capability by 2011. We have already invested &#163;25 million in this project&#151;a figure that is likely to increase as we place orders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="71009-0019.htm_para30"><a name="07100964000115">I shall briefly deal with several other points, especially those about helicopters. The hon. Member for North Devon spoke about the future of the Lynx helicopter. The project remains within its approved performance time and cost targets. The &#163;1 billion cost that was announced in 2006 referred only to the contract with AgustaWestland for the development and manufacture of 70 aircraft. The overall approved cost is &#163;2 billion, which includes significant elements outside the AgustaWestland contract, as well as VAT and the compound effect of inflation. We are committed to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="71009-0020.htm_para0"><a name="07100964000116">Helicopters, including the number that we need and the so-called shortfall, have been mentioned several times in the debate. We acknowledge that we need to do more. We have referred to the decision to purchase six Danish Merlins. We are currently converting eight Chinook mark 3 helicopters, the first of which will be available for operations in 2009. We are investing &#163;4.5 billion in helicopters in the next 10 years, a considerable proportion of which will be used to enhance current fleets, such as the Puma and the Sea King, and to increase the flying hours for the Chinook and the attack helicopter in Afghanistan. We therefore expect further improvements in logistical support. We are making important improvements, not simply sitting around and accepting the situation. Making improvements is part of our overall strategy.</p>

<p><a name="st_o313"><a name="07100964000117"><a name="71009-0020.htm_spnew0"><a name="07100964000185"><b>Dr. Fox:</b>
 I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s admission that the Government must do more. However, why, with two conflicts raging, did they cut the future rotorcraft capability budget in 2004, thereby removing &#163;1.4 billion of funding for future helicopter improvement?</p>

<p><a name="st_o314"><a name="07100964000118"><a name="71009-0020.htm_spnew1"><a name="07100964000186"><b>Derek Twigg:</b>
 When I say that we must do more, we are clear about the need for that. We have always considered ways of improving matters for our front-line service personnel and we will continue to do that. We do not rest on our laurels and simply say, &#147;Everything&#146;s okay today.&#148; We are always looking to improve our capability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="71009-0020.htm_para1"><a name="07100964000119">The future rapid effect system&#151;FRES&#151;has been mentioned several times. We announced the acquisition strategy at the end of last year when we committed ourselves to holding utility vehicle trials this summer. They have taken place and it is planned to announce the result next month. Last week, we made an announcement about the system of systems integrator&#151;SOSI&#151;two months early. FRES is at the heart of procuring the Army&#146;s equipment, as the hon. Member for Reigate mentioned, and will underpin the development of the capable and highly deployable medium-weight force. FRES will deliver armoured vehicles with enhanced survivability and improved deployability, and grow potential for the future. We selected the vehicles that are participating in trials with the FRES utility design and, on 5 October, we announced the preferred bidder for the SOSI role. That is a clear sign of the Ministry&#146;s commitment to driving the FRES programme forward. The Ministry is also running a competition to select the company for the utility vehicle integration work.</p>

 Let me complete the point that I wanted to make. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford made some important points. The Conservative party expresses much criticism of what we do or do not do and the resources that we invest. There has been a massive increase in resources and improvements in equipment and support for our armed forces. Those improvements have occurred not only in equipment but in welfare and elsewhere. The key point is that Conservative Members will not say what they would reduce, where they would put extra money or where they would find it. They continue to say that they are not the Government. They have no credibility. As my hon. Friend said, when he asked such questions, they did not comment about where they would spend more money. That simply did not happen; they did not have such a debate. Their comments are therefore about making cheap political shots, not having a debate about increasing support for our armed forces.</p>

 This is the second time that there has been a debate on the Floor of the House about the case of my constituent Mr. Paul Edwards. The previous debate was held in May 2002 by my predecessor, Mr. Andrew Hunter. In that debate, Mr. Hunter most precisely and eloquently put forward to the then Minister for Sport, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn), the case of my constituent Mr. Edwards, who was banned from competing in athletics for the rest of his life as a result of a drugs test in June 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="71009-0020.htm_para8"><a name="07100964000133">In that debate Mr. Hunter detailed deep concerns about the validity of the tests that had been undertaken. In his response, the then Minister came forward with some practical and helpful suggestions about procedures that my constituent could follow to have his case reviewed and try to ensure a satisfactory outcome. The fact that we are here again, some five years on from that debate, suggests that the course of action put forward by the then Minister has not brought the matter to a satisfactory conclusion. However, I hope that the Minister today will follow in his predecessor&#146;s footsteps, by responding positively to the debate and again offering some practical advice and support for my constituent, so that we can end almost a decade of uncertainty surrounding the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="71009-0020.htm_para9"><a name="07100964000134">I asked for this debate because in September 2005 new and critical information was obtained by my constituent under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. When examined by six independent toxicological experts, that information confirmed that there were clear grounds to call for a re-examination of the 1997 decision to ban Paul Edwards from competing in athletics. This newly disclosed evidence was never considered as part of the original disciplinary hearings, or of the appeal. I wrote to the then Minister asking him to outline the procedure that my constituent should follow in the United Kingdom to ensure that the new evidence could be assessed, so that a view could be taken based on the strength of the evidence as to whether the case could be reopened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="71009-0020.htm_para10"><a name="07100964000135">In his letter of 9 May 2006, the then Minister said that I should write on my constituent&#146;s behalf to the International Association of Athletics Federations&#151;the IAAF&#151;to ask for an appeal. Indeed, the Minister indicated that he understood that the case was already under review. I followed his advice and duly wrote to the IAAF. Some time later&#151;I have to say that it took about three months&#151;I received a reply from Mr. Pierre Weiss, the general secretary of the IAAF, stating that there were no provisions under IAAF rules to allow for the reopening of Mr. Edwards&#146; case, even though there was the potential for important new evidence to be presented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="71009-0020.htm_para11"><a name="07100964000136">I was somewhat surprised by that response, given that the then Minister had clearly stated that the procedure for seeking such an appeal was to write directly to the IAAF. I therefore wrote to him again, but I did not receive an explanation of why the initial guidance from the Department appeared to be incorrect. This time,  <br>

however, the right hon. Gentleman suggested that I contact the World Anti-Doping Agency&#151;the organisation responsible for monitoring the appeals processes of international federations, including the IAAF&#151;which I duly did. The reply that I received from the agency stated that issues such as this were simply not within its jurisdiction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="71009-0020.htm_para12"><a name="07100964000137">So I contacted the then Minister&#146;s office for a third time, explaining that his new suggestion, too, had proved somewhat unfruitful. Again, I did not really get an explanation of why it had not worked, but it was suggested that I contact the Court of Arbitration for Sport to ask whether it might review the case. Dutifully, I did so, and in February this year&#151;about a year and four months after my constituent had uncovered important, previously undisclosed evidence&#151;I received a reply stating that the court was not in a position to review its own decisions, and that the only entity entitled to review the case and possibly reduce the sanction was, yes, the IAAF, the organisation that had stated that it had no provision in its rules to reopen cases that it viewed as closed, even when there was new evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="71009-0020.htm_para13"><a name="07100964000138">After almost two years of correspondence&#151;and, some might say, going round in circles&#151;I have come to the House today simply to ask the Minister to clarify once and for all the UK procedures for dealing with cases such as my constituent&#146;s, in which compelling new evidence is available that might call into question previous decisions to ban sportsmen and women from taking part in competition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="71009-0020.htm_para14"><a name="07100964000139">The Minister who is here today, in his role at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, is responsible for ensuring that we have a workable anti-doping policy for the UK, and within that, the disciplinary procedures and appeals processes that are an important part of the process set out in the world anti-doping code and set out locally in the UK national anti-doping policy adopted in May 2005. Although the implementation and management of that policy is, rightly, delegated to UK Sport, the responsibility to ensure that UK athletes and other sportsmen and women have fair and transparent access to drugs monitoring, enforcement and disciplinary procedure rests with the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="71009-0020.htm_para15"><a name="07100964000140">My constituent Mr. Edwards has had the freedom to compete in athletics taken away from him for the rest of his life. Competing in sport was the centre of his life, and receiving a lifetime ban has had a profound effect on both him and his family. The new evidence that he obtained in September 2005 has never been reviewed by a sporting body or considered by any tribunal, although it has been carefully scrutinised by six independent toxicology experts. All six agree that the information provides firm grounds to require the 1997 decision to ban Paul Edwards from competing in athletics for life to be reconsidered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="71009-0020.htm_para16"><a name="07100964000141">It is not for me, or for this House, to judge the merits of that evidence, but it is the Government&#146;s responsibility to ensure that a fair, transparent and equitable appeals process is available to athletes such as Paul Edwards. I am therefore hoping that the Minister will outline the procedure that should be open to Mr. Edwards to ensure that this new evidence can be fully considered. Perhaps the Minister will tell us how best to proceed on this matter. What can the Minister  <br>

It would appear that European bodies such as the IAAF, the World Anti-Doping Agency and the Court of Arbitration for Sport do not operate as the Minister&#146;s office and his Department think they do. If that is the case, can the Minister be really sure that the UK system is as fair to athletes like Paul Edwards as I am sure he wants it to be?</p>

 First, I congratulate the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) on securing the debate. I also congratulate her on her steadfastness in representing her constituent, Mr. Edwards, which she has done to a very great extent. I want to assure her from the start that I have looked into the case in great detail. As she said, there is a lot of correspondence and many issues have been raised previously. I shall discuss the Government&#146;s overall position on doping in sport. Tonight provides a great opportunity to consider it in detail. I will come to the particular case of Mr. Edwards at the end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="71009-0020.htm_para18"><a name="07100967000002">Doping undermines the integrity of sport. To those watching sport and to the young people seeking to emulate them, athletes are seen as role models. It is very important to me that those people believe that their role models are competing in an event, race or game free from the spectre of drugs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="71009-0020.htm_para19"><a name="07100967000003">The anti-doping movement is entering a particularly important time, with the coming months pivotal in the development of the future landscape of anti-doping internationally. November will see the culmination of the World Anti-Doping Agency&#146;s wholesale review of its world anti-doping code at the world conference on doping in sport. I look forward to representing the UK Government there in Madrid. That conference will draw to a close 18 months of intensive consultation during which WADA has&#151;successfully, in my opinion&#151;sought the views of Governments, anti-doping organisations, international federations covering all of the Olympic and Paralympic sports and the majority of professional sports from all around the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="71009-0020.htm_para20"><a name="07100967000004">That has been no mean feat. I know that a huge amount of work went on here in the UK to ensure that the views of this Government, UK Sport and our national governing bodies were listened to by WADA, and I am pleased to say that, on a number of issues, it has done that. I pay tribute to UK Sport&#146;s hard work in consulting all the governing bodies. We have come a long way in a short time, and the House should remember that WADA came into being only eight years ago in November 1999. The importance of this review cannot be underestimated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="71009-0020.htm_para21"><a name="07100967000005">The first world anti-doping code was introduced back in 2004 and, at that time, it represented a watershed in the fight against those who would seek to cheat by  <br>

doping. This review gives us the opportunity significantly to improve the code, based on the knowledge that sports&#146; governing bodies and anti-doping organisations have developed after three years of practical implementation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="71009-0020.htm_para22"><a name="07100967000006">Alongside the code, a number of other significant developments are worthy of mention. The first is the ratification and coming into force of the UNESCO convention against doping in sport. The genesis of the convention was the Copenhagen declaration, signed by Governments at the last world conference on doping in sport in 2003, signalling their support for the measures being taken to harmonise the approach to doping in sport through the code. The UK is signatory to the Copenhagen declaration and was one of the first countries formally to ratify the UNESCO convention in April 2006. This was a legally binding document, mandating Governments to take action to fight doping. The convention came into effect in record time, again showing the priority afforded to anti-doping by this Government and other Governments around the world. The United Kingdom is already compliant with the convention, but, as the hon. Lady said, our important role as host nation for the London 2012 games requires us to be sure that we are doing all we can to stop athletes from doping, and to be seen as a world leader.</p>

 I have met ministerial colleagues at the Home Office to discuss ways of strengthening our approach across government. I look forward to a further meeting on 7 November with a range of colleagues to seek ways of making further progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="71009-0020.htm_para25"><a name="07100967000010">Anti-doping has been the subject of two Select Committee inquiries&#151;by the Culture, Media and Sport Committee in 2004 and by the Science and Technology Committee in 2006. The Government welcome the valuable contributions that those Committees have made to consideration of the UK&#146;s approach to doping in sport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="71009-0020.htm_para26"><a name="07100967000011">Let me return to the subject of the code. That brings us to the athlete&#146;s right to a fair and transparent hearing, and the right of that athlete to appeal. Those rights are clearly embodied in the code and, to my mind, that is absolutely as it should be. The code and the supporting international standards provide a blueprint setting out the roles and responsibilities of the various agencies involved when an athlete is found to have committed a doping offence. It is within that framework that the United Kingdom&#146;s national anti-doping policy has been developed by UK Sport, supported by a set of model rules that stipulate the clear process under which athletes who are found to have taken a doping substance can expect their cases to progress.</p>

an independent review and a disciplinary hearing was conducted by the then British Athletics Federation in 1998, followed by an appeal hearing by the BAF in 2000. Those processes were in line with the requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="71009-0021.htm_para1"><a name="07100967000013">Mr. Edwards has seen three further reviews of his case&#151;by UK Sport in 2002, 2004 and 2005, drawing on advice from those with scientific expertise in the area of anti-doping&#151;and the International Amateur Athletics Federation considered his case in 2006. Moreover, as the hon. Lady said, the case was debated in the House back in 2002, in another Adjournment debate. I shall do my best not to repeat what was said then, as it is already on record.</p>

<p><a name="st_o324"><a name="07100967000014"><a name="71009-0021.htm_spnew0"><a name="07100967000028"><b>Mrs. Miller:</b>
 May I remind the Minister of the letter that I received from his colleague on 9 May 2006? Far from suggesting that the door had shut, it suggested that the case was still under review, and advised me on how to support my constituent. I understand what the Minister is saying, but it seems to be slightly at odds with what his colleague told me.</p>

<p><a name="st_o325"><a name="07100967000015"><a name="71009-0021.htm_spnew1"><a name="07100967000029"><b>Mr. Sutcliffe:</b>
 As I told the hon. Lady earlier, I have examined the case in great detail. I am trying to set out clearly what we believe to be the route that must be followed. She is right about the way in which some organisations have dealt with the issue, but I am talking about what happened in Mr. Edwards&#146;s case. It is a complex case, which has been the subject of a great deal of correspondence between the hon. Lady and her predecessor and my predecessor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="71009-0021.htm_para2"><a name="07100967000016">The hon. Lady has referred to the scientific evidence and arguments behind the case. I am not a scientist&#151;I do not know whether the hon. Lady is&#151;and we have to rely on the experts who examine such cases day in, day out. My role as a Minister responsible for sport is to ensure that the correct structures, programmes and processes are in place to ensure that our athletes compete in a drug-free environment, and, when that is found not to be the case, to ensure that they have recourse to a fair appeal. Fundamental to any anti-doping programme are three key elements: robustness, consistency and fairness. In looking at Mr. Edwards&#146;s case, I am convinced that those three elements have been met. As the hon. Lady will have heard my predecessor say, it is not the role of the Minister for Sport to intervene in individual doping cases. When an athlete is found to be in violation of the anti-doping code, it is the responsibility of that athlete's national governing body and the international federation to decide what action to take, in line with the procedures set out in the world anti-doping code, and in the UK's national anti-doping policy. Again, I understand that the correct processes have been followed in this case. I have no remit to act outside of those, as has been set out in my previous correspondence. There is no mechanism by which we can become involved.</p>

Lady&#146;s constituent. That advice was also given in the previous Adjournment debate in 2002. Therefore, I am a little surprised that Mr. Edwards has not taken the opportunity to go to that court.</p>

 I thank the Minister for giving way; he is being very generous. He may recall from my earlier remarks that I wrote to the Court of Arbitration for Sport to ask whether it was able to review the case. It said that it was not within its jurisdiction to do that. In the letter that I received from his predecessor, the indication was that the process is to go to the International Association of Athletics Federations, but the IAAF does not agree with the Government that that is the process. Going back to the Minister&#146;s earlier remarks about there being procedures in place, it seems not to be a strong argument. I am not sure that he is right.</p>

 I am trying to go through the matter in great detail. I have asked for the details of the case to see what could be done and if anything needed to be done, but I have been assured that the processes that have been in place have given Mr. Edwards every opportunity under the existing codes and guidelines to put his case. I am advised that the Court of Arbitration for Sport is the final route. Clearly, the hon. Lady has had a different view from the court. If we need to pursue that, I give her the undertaking that that is what we will do to clarify the route. It is not for a Minister to act on behalf of an individual. I understand that it is not just a letter that needs to be sent; the details of the appeal have to be sent, too. We are saying that that is the final route that Mr. Edwards has to go through.
