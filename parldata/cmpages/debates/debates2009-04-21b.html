 My hon. Friend makes some very pertinent points about the funding of local government. Local authorities have to be aware of the costs of council tax to their residents, absolutely rightly, but they also provide a whole range of really important services, whether in adult social care, education, or recycling and the environment.

How can that be justified alongside the experience of my constituent, Miss Tina Johnston, in neighbouring Box, who is not a Gypsy but lives in a caravan on her farm? She has recently been thrown off the farm because she does not have planning permission; meanwhile, down the road, the Gypsies are being allowed to stay on the site because they are Gypsies.

There is one law for this country, and it is applied equally to Gypsies and Travellers and to the settled community. On the specific example that he gives, he will realise that, because of the Secretary of State&#146;s role in the planning process, I cannot possibly comment.

It is in no one&#146;s interests for Gypsies and Travellers to be set against the settled community. We need a comprehensive range of accommodation needs assessments in place to ensure that authorised sites are brought forward; otherwise, we will have community tensions and increased enforcement costs for local authorities and taxpayers.

substance. All I would say to him is that only the Conservative party would think that a proposal that attracts the support of 80 per cent. of the mortgage market is a proposal without substance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="90421-0002.htm_para0"><a name="090421101000070">When my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced our plans to go ahead with the scheme, he was extremely anxious, as was I&#151;the hon. Gentleman will recall this, if he casts his mind back&#151;to stress how important it is for people, first, to recognise that help can be made available; secondly, to go to their lenders for advice; and thirdly, to take independent financial advice. We thought it right then&#151;and we think it right now&#151;to draw people&#146;s attention to those issues and, in particular, to the fact that there are already four or five other means of help available, but only to quite a narrowly defined group of people. That is why we thought it necessary to introduce the scheme, but of course it takes time to work up such details.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="90421-0002.htm_para1"><a name="090421101000071">I am not familiar with the figures that the hon. Gentleman quotes, but they must, I think, be wrong. My understanding is that&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Well, they bear no comparison with any figures that have come from anyone else. I would simply say to him, first, that about 50 per cent. of mortgage lenders are participating directly in the scheme that the Government are offering and are able to take advantage of the guarantee that the Government have put in place. Secondly, in total 80 per cent. of mortgage lenders are either in the Government scheme or are offering provisions comparable to it. That is why we believe that it will be able to help many tens of thousands of people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="90421-0002.htm_para2"><a name="090421101000072">Finally, the hon. Gentleman, like the right hon. Member for Bracknell (Mr. Mackay), called on me to apologise to those who, despite the help that the Government have already made available, have lost their homes in the interim period. I am extremely sorry that those people lost their homes. As the House will know, in every year there are repossessions, despite, in this instance, help being made available by the Government. However, I am lost in admiration for the sheer gall of the Conservatives, who did not lift a finger to help a single family during the recessions of the &#146;80s and &#146;90s. All they did was to offer funds to buy up houses that had been repossessed, so we really do not need any lectures from them.</p>

 I very much welcome the scheme and the fact that it will help many thousands of people who otherwise might lose their homes. I also welcome the commitment to give publicity through the lenders, but could we also ensure that local councils are encouraged to give publicity? Finally, could we have a comprehensive monitoring arrangement put in place to look at the various schemes that help people in mortgage difficulties, and see whether some people might still fall through the various nets that are available, particularly private tenants, whose tenancies are put at risk when the owner of the property defaults on their mortgage?</p>

Friend&#146;s view: we are very concerned and we are continuing to pursue the issue, especially the problem of tenants who may well be continuing to pay their rent in the proper way, but whose landlord may be defaulting on the mortgage. We have already put provisions in place whereby there should be a greater period of notice, but I take the view&#151;I am confident that my hon. Friend, and perhaps the whole House, will share it&#151;that although having seven or eight weeks&#146; notice to quit because the landlord has not paid the mortgage is better than two weeks, it still means that the person is without a home. We are looking as a matter of urgency to see whether more can be done here.</p>

 My hon. Friend is entirely right. In so far as one can assess these matters, we believe that the average time of about 100 weeks for major applications should come down to about 35 weeks.

 The hon. Gentleman is correct in saying that he has raised the issue before. I am delighted to be able to tell him about the range of work that has been done in the last 12 months. First, extensive guidance was published for all local authorities in June last year, setting out exactly the criteria according to which groups should be funded. We fund groups that stand up to tackle violent extremism and uphold our shared values. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that following a point of order raised by the hon.

More than 100,000 businesses have taken advantage of that. My hon.

 My hon. Friend has a very impressive record in being prepared to say sometimes difficult things on this agenda and I am proud of her for doing that. She will know that the National Muslim Women&#146;s Advisory Group is comprised of feisty, challenging women from all over the country, and they are absolutely determined that they will take their rightful place in the governance of mosques and the leadership of community organisations. My hon. Friend also makes the point that such values should be reflected in the groups that we sponsor and support through our funding. She is absolutely right.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will know that I am quite a fan of direct elections, and I am certainly keen to ensure that there is as much democracy as possible in our political system. I have never believed that direct democracy is somehow challenging to other organisations. Having said that, I am sure that there will be debate about membership of the national parks organisations. I will certainly examine the issue to see whether it is possible to have more direct democracy in those organisations.</p>

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="90421-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="090421101000277"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require insolvency practitioners to provide information regarding redundancies to employment agencies when a company goes into administration within a specified period; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para1"><a name="090421101000153">At a time of global recession, and its effect on our economy and our people, this Bill aims to improve the relationship between insolvency practitioners and employment agencies, especially Jobcentre Plus. At present, when a company goes into liquidation there is no duty on the administrator to inform Jobcentre Plus of redundancies. I believe that to be wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para2"><a name="090421101000154">To be fair, some administrators inform Jobcentre Plus and allow access, but not on all occasions. Employees should have access to the help Jobcentre Plus can offer as soon as possible, and it should not be denied. My Bill calls for a requirement to be placed on administrators to inform Jobcentre Plus of a redundancy situation as soon as possible, and invite the agency to meet those facing unemployment when the company is going into liquidation. It is all about putting people first in difficult times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para3"><a name="090421101000155">Earlier this year, Jobcentre Plus was informed by a company in my constituency that it was going into liquidation. The company informed the redundancy manager at Jobcentre Plus of the insolvency practitioner involved. A series of phone calls took place between the redundancy manager and the practitioner, in which the Jobcentre Plus representative requested access to the employees to issue redundancy packs. The practitioner said they did not want Jobcentre Plus on the site in case it inflamed the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para4"><a name="090421101000156">The redundancy manager was on standby to go to the factory because information had been received that the administrator was holding a meeting with staff on that day. The redundancy manager called the administrator on several occasions only to be told that the meeting had taken place at 8 o&#146;clock that morning and that 175 staff had been made redundant, the majority of whom had been sent home. On hearing that, the redundancy manager immediately went to the site in question and managed to catch between 15 and 20 staff. Redundancy information packs were issued to them and the administrator gave an assurance that it would send the remaining packs to the rest of the work force. When I heard that, the words &#147;stable doors&#148; and &#147;horses bolting&#148; came to mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para5"><a name="090421101000157">The majority of staff at the factory had not been made aware before they left the site of the support and services available to them. Many of those made unemployed had worked for more than 20 years and were unaware of the processes and conditions for claiming benefit; nor were they aware of the redundancy support available to them through the rapid response service. Jobcentre Plus was left with the task of trying to identify those customers as they made claims for benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para6"><a name="090421101000158">In another part of the north-east, another company went into liquidation. Staff were not even able to get on to the site to clear their personal effects, as the gates  <br>

were locked. Jobcentre Plus found out the name of the administrator only through the pages of the local newspaper, and the insolvency practitioner could not help because the staff had all gone home. However, Jobcentre Plus tells me that on other occasions elsewhere in the region it has received excellent support from administrators. They hold joint meetings with employees to talk them through the situation and set out how they can be helped through redundancy. On occasion, redundancy information packs have even been delivered by hand. Those are obviously examples of good practice; if a redundancy situation arises, that is how we would like it to be handled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para7"><a name="090421101000159">We need to iron out the inconsistencies across the piece, not only among insolvency practitioners, but perhaps at the Jobcentre Plus and Insolvency Service end, too. Between April 2008 and March 2009, there were 3,555 redundancies in County Durham. Of those, 513 were caused by company liquidations. Nationally, the figure stands at over 112,000. I want all those people to be treated the same&#151;with respect, not as another commodity that needs to be sorted out, like a piece of machinery left on the site. We are talking about human beings, many with families, all with hopes and aspirations. The Bill will, I believe, go some way towards ensuring that they are treated with dignity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para8"><a name="090421101000160">How would such a Bill work in practice? It would oblige the insolvency practitioner to inform Jobcentre Plus of the situation as soon as possible, but before the liquidation is announced, where there are more than 20 employees involved. There will be an obligation on the administrator to work with Jobcentre Plus to prepare employees for redundancy. The employment service can then act in the most professional way possible and use its expertise to help the employees through the most difficult of times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para9"><a name="090421101000161">Those words and sentiments may be fine, but we need to provide further assistance to insolvency practitioners, Jobcentre Plus and the Insolvency Service. Their relationship needs to be better co-ordinated on the ground. That is why I have already met, both separately and jointly, Jobcentre Plus and R3, the insolvency practitioners&#146; trade body. I intend to meet the Insolvency Service soon. The Department for Work and Pensions needs to provide R3 with hotline telephone numbers, so that administrators have one point of contact in a region. R3 needs to inform Jobcentre Plus of its major practitioners, so that high-level contact can be maintained at all times. The DWP should issue a rapid-response toolkit to insolvency practitioners, so that they can fully engage with the employees and Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para10"><a name="090421101000162">It is to the credit of Jobcentre Plus, the Insolvency Service and R3 that they are ready to look at the problem and to try to resolve it. R3 has assured me that it will work closely with Jobcentre Plus to ensure that people who face redundancy are offered the support and advice that they need. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs has offered me the opportunity to meet the Insolvency Service to discuss the best way of ensuring that insolvency practitioners are aware of their responsibilities and act on them. I know that he has already written to insolvency practitioners, through the Insolvency Service, about  the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para11"><a name="090421101000163">The main players&#151;the DWP, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and insolvency practitioners&#151;are nearing the same page, but I want to  <br>

see them on the same page; that is why the Bill is important. I want the sentiments that I have set out to be put into action. A code of conduct needs to be drawn up, and there should be regular meetings between the partners to ensure that the code of conduct is implemented by all parties. The trade unions agree with the move, too. There must be a role for them in the process, so that the whole architecture of the Bill is based on partnership. I welcome my right hon. Friend&#146;s assurance that his Department will look into introducing trade unions into that partnership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para12"><a name="090421101000164">I believe fundamentally that the Bill would close a loophole&#151;an important loophole at that&#151;in the Government&#146;s approach to helping the unemployed back into work. It is a well-known fact that the sooner someone who is out of work contacts Jobcentre Plus, the sooner they can access work. Today, as a result of the Government&#146;s proactive approach to getting people off the dole, 75 per cent. of those out of work still find a job within 6 months. By comparing my experience of this global recession with my experience of the home-grown recessions of the &#146;80s and &#146;90s, I hope to give extra impetus to the passage of the Bill, and give the Government confidence that our approach, which is to help those who are out of work, instead of leaving them to their own devices, is right. Doing nothing is not an option.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para13"><a name="090421101000165">Unemployment in Sedgefield went up from 1,077 in February last year to 2,456 in February this year. The rate of increase has been rapid, but started from a low base. Even with that rate of increase, the present situation does not compare with the recession of the early &#146;90s, and especially not with that of the 1980s. In January 1986, unemployment in Sedgefield hit 5,346. Of those people, more than 2,000 had been out of work for 12 months or more. Today, only 70 people in Sedgefield have been out of work for 12 months or more. The last time unemployment in Sedgefield was about 2,500 was in 1996. Almost 600 of those people&#151;more than one in five&#151;had been out of work for over 12 months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para14"><a name="090421101000166">Every person made unemployed is not only an economic tragedy but, more importantly, a personal tragedy for  <br>

the individual and family concerned. That is why the Government have learned the lessons of the 1980s and 1990s. People who find themselves unemployed cannot be left behind. That is why access to Jobcentre Plus is imperative. In February some 250,000 people left jobseeker&#146;s allowance and found another job. This proves three things to me: people have better skills sets than they once did, Jobcentre Plus is doing its job by finding jobs for people, and the Government&#146;s economic strategy is beginning to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para15"><a name="090421101000167">The response that I have received from Ministers, Jobcentre Plus, R3 and others to the issues outlined in my Bill prove that the Government are not complacent and are putting hard-working families at the centre of their actions. My Bill will build on the Government&#146;s proactive approach, and will go some way towards ensuring that those made redundant have the earliest possible access to the services provided by Jobcentre Plus. The Government are doing their best to treat those out of work with dignity. The Bill proposes to do the same.</p>

 I welcome you to the Chair, Sir Alan, for the Committee stage of our proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para24"><a name="090421101000177">Clause 1 amends the cumulative limit on the financial support for business under section 8 of the Industrial Development Act 1982. I accept that, as such, it does not authorise actual expenditure, but can the Minister confirm that authorisation for the orders involved, under the new wording, will be made by affirmative resolution? Furthermore, does he accept that it would be good practice that when each order is submitted for debate, it should be accompanied by a detailed update as to the range of schemes involved and their current funding levels?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para25"><a name="090421101000178">At present, the Government publish only an annual report, which is often unrelated to the issuing of the orders in question. It would be more helpful if we in the House had the chance to consider the current schemes at the time when we debate the Government&#146;s request to increase their funding limits. I would be grateful if the Minister would consider that carefully and make a specific response in his reply to the debate, should he catch the Chairman&#146;s eye.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para26"><a name="090421101000179">On Second Reading the Minister cited as one of the main reasons for moving to a higher limit of &#163;12 billion the Government&#146;s wish to switch away from grants and to increase the proportion of support in the form of loans and loan guarantees. Will he therefore tell us what proportion of the current &#163;6 billion is in grants and what proportion is in loans and loan guarantees?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para27"><a name="090421101000180">Overall, the Opposition agree that loans and loan guarantees are often a better form of business support than grants. After all, money for loans can be recycled, but loans are also treated differently by their recipients. When I ran my business a few years ago, I was also a mentor for the Prince&#146;s Youth Business Trust, helping young people to start up businesses. I saw then how the provision of loans motivated a start-up firm far more than a grant did. It is not that surprising; one is far more likely to try to maximise the value of funding if one knows that the money has to be paid back, than if one knows that it has been gifted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para28"><a name="090421101000181">On the whole, therefore, the Opposition support a shift in the balance of financial support. However, it would be helpful, not least in considering the clause, to understand better the current balance. Indeed, of the future &#163;12 billion, and the potential &#163;16 billion that the  <br>

Government expect the Bill to cover, what proportion do they expect to take the form of a loan over the next five years?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para29"><a name="090421101000182">Further, the Minister on Second Reading failed to inform us of the balance of the schemes and their exact proportion of the total. He mentioned a list of different schemes, and we have debated them on numerous occasions, but he has not told us which are the most important. So, in reply to this debate, will he tell us the five most important schemes by value under the clause, their current value and by how much he expects their value to increase with the new total of &#163;12 billion? That will enable us better to understand the direct impact not only on small, medium and large enterprises, but on different business sectors, which I know he is keen to be seen to support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para30"><a name="090421101000183">Finally, on clause 1, the Minister mentioned on Second Reading that the Bill&#146;s remit includes funds for the post office network, and I am delighted to see the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs in the Chamber. Will the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, the Minister responsible for the Bill, tell us how much has already been allocated to the scheme, and how much has been paid out to date?</p>

 I shall be brief, Sir Alan, as most of what I want to say will come towards the end of our proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para31"><a name="090421101000185">On Second Reading, the Minister described a wide range of schemes that the legislation will cover, and the Liberal Democrats, too, welcome the emphasis moving from grants to loans and loan guarantees, because it creates a fairer playing field for industry generally and should constitute better value for money for the taxpayer. We welcome also the increase to &#163;12 billion and the potential increase to &#163;16 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="90421-0004.htm_para32"><a name="090421101000186">We appreciate that to elicit the loan guarantees, companies must undertake proper due diligence. However, hon. Members in all parts of the House have criticised the fact that the release of funds to companies, especially to small companies that are not seeking to borrow vast sums, is taking an inordinately long time. Will the Minister comment on the steps that are being taken to expedite the due diligence? The Government quite properly require it, but it can slow things up and is putting small businesses, in particular, which need help fast, beyond the reach of the schemes that were designed to help them.</p>

 Clause 1 is essential to enable the section 8 power of the Industrial Development Act 1982 to continue to be used to give financial assistance to industry for the purposes specified in that Act. It is necessary to continue to strengthen the provision of support for businesses so that they come through stronger from the current global economic downturn. The Bill seeks to amend the cumulative limit on financial assistance that may be provided under section 8 to an initial ceiling of &#163;12 billion, which can be increased by four orders of up to &#163;1 billion each to make an overall limit of &#163;16 billion. We have proposed the &#163;12 billion limit as it restores the ceiling to more or less the same proportion of GDP as was the case when the original Act came into force.</p>

The Bill retains the accountability to Parliament contained in the existing legislation, and I can confirm that that is through the need for affirmative orders of the Commons, which would replace the existing limits with new, higher ones, reflecting the need for continuing support for industry when necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="90421-0005.htm_para3"><a name="090421101000191">We have maintained the &#163;10 million limit for the referral of single expenditure schemes back to the House. As the hon. Gentleman said, an annual report will continue to be published in the Commons Library, setting out how single projects are funded. Combined, the measures provide an appropriate balance between accountability and providing the Government with the legal power to respond to business need.</p>

 The annual report can be helpful, but as the Minister will understand and Members on both sides of the House will appreciate, when we are considering an order for an increase of the not insubstantial sums identified in clause 1, it will be helpful if we can see the current point when we debate the issue in Committee, rather than just having the annual report. That was what my point was about. Does the Minister not accept that that would improve the quality of scrutiny in the House?</p>

 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point and I undertake to consider it. If we lay affirmative resolutions, we want to be able to give the reason why they are necessary. Obviously, that would relate to the spend or potential liabilities as a result of Government commitments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="90421-0005.htm_para4"><a name="090421101000194">The hon. Gentleman asked specific questions about the top five schemes. He can see them in the annual report. They include the grant for business investment&#151;previously called &#147;selective financial assistance&#148;&#151;the enterprise finance guarantee scheme and the Post Office reinvention programme; those would account for the bulk of it. The hon. Gentleman specifically mentioned the Post Office reinvention programme and, as he will be aware, we have made a commitment to the programme of &#163;1.7 billion over the years 2006 to 2011. At this point, I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an actual  <br>

expenditure figure, although I am sure that some of that information can be made available. However, it is clear that there is a programme of spending going on over a five-year period, and that that spending will take place at the appropriate time for the business.</p>

<p><a name="st_o96"><a name="090421101000195"><a name="90421-0005.htm_spnew2"><a name="090421101000408"><b>Mr. Prisk:</b>
 The Minister tells us that the three principal schemes include the Post Office reinvention programme. Some Members will be surprised that that comes ahead of, for example, the automotive assistance package, which they might assume would be larger. Is he telling us that that package is not even one of the most important packages in the total number?</p>

<p><a name="st_o97"><a name="090421101000196"><a name="90421-0005.htm_spnew3"><a name="090421101000409"><b>Ian Pearson:</b>
 No, I am not saying that. I want to draw a distinction between schemes that have been in the annual report previously and new schemes that the Government have introduced. As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, the automotive assistance programme was launched as recently as on 27 January this year. It is a new scheme and, as with all new schemes, it had to go through a process of securing EU state aid approval, which was granted on 27 February. We are in detailed discussions with several automotive companies about the programme. He will be aware of the recent announcements made under the European Investment Bank element of the programme whereby Jaguar Land Rover and Nissan have been offered loans by the EIB. We will want to report to Parliament on the automotive assistance programme and on other programmes in due course, because we believe that there should be full accountability in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="90421-0005.htm_para5"><a name="090421101000197">The hon. Gentleman will also be aware that the enterprise finance guarantee scheme, which replaced the small firms loan guarantee scheme, is now very much up and running. It is spending significant sums of money, to the tune of about &#163;30 million in loans offered every week. The latest figures that I have seen show that well over 2,000 businesses have made applications to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="90421-0005.htm_para6"><a name="090421101000198">I think that it is now time for the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Solihull to welcome the new scheme and to recognise that the Government have introduced it in a remarkably short period, and that it is providing valued support to companies and helping to make a difference to those that are receiving it.</p>

 I am sure that all Members welcome any funding that is finally trickling through to business. The Minister mentioned Jaguar Land Rover. Its assistance under the EIB element has not yet materialised, as it is still waiting for the Government&#146;s due diligence to take place. It is obviously important that due diligence takes place, but it appears to be taking a long time. Why is that?</p>

 Let me clarify the situation. Jaguar Land Rover has successfully applied to the EIB for a loan to undertake a number of green projects, and it will be up to the Government to provide a guarantee for that loan. That is part of the package of support that Jaguar Land Rover will need to secure its long-term future. We are in discussions with the owners of JLR, as well as its management and its banks, about a package to ensure that it can continue to develop its model programme and have a secure future. The hon. Lady knows JLR well because of her constituency connections. She will be aware that as a west midlands MP, I am also fully aware of its strategic importance not only to the  <br>

west midlands economy but more generally to the automotive industry in the United Kingdom. We need to continue the discussions that we are having. However, I emphasise the fact that JLR is a successful company that, as with all motor companies, is suffering from the severe economic downturn, which has affected its business just as other businesses in the automotive industry have been affected. However, it was making good profits in the period January to June 2008, and there is absolutely no reason why it cannot do so in future. We need to continue to consider what is the appropriate role for Government in providing support to JLR, and we are doing that in the discussions that we are taking forward with it at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="90421-0005.htm_para7"><a name="090421101000201">The other point that I want to make about clause 1 is related to the request from the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford that we seek to break down how much has been provided in grants and how much will potentially be provided in loans and loan guarantees. I do not have those figures to hand, but clearly expenditure, whether in the form of grants, loans or loan guarantees, all contributes to the need for an authority to spend. We are seeking through the Bill an increase in the limits. However, I will reflect on whether we can provide more and better information, not just in the form of an annual report but on a slightly more regular basis. It would not be appropriate to have a running commentary every week or month, but I recognise that it is not unreasonable to want some more detail about spending progress.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister, not least for being generous in giving way. I return to my original point. He highlighted the fact that the annual report, for example, showed a certain balance of schemes, and now events have changed. He is right, and we understand that that will continue to be the case. It seems to me that a logical pattern would be that when the Government need to come forward with a request for an additional increase over and above the existing limit, that is the obvious moment at which we in the House would benefit from being able to see the current snapshot of the balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="90421-0005.htm_para8"><a name="090421101000203">I am slightly disappointed that the Minister does not have the figures on the balance between loans and grants, but I wonder whether he will ensure that at least some information can be provided to Members. We will not have the chance to consider this further, as this is the last day on which we will have the opportunity to discuss the Bill. Given the fact that Ministers cited the balance between grants and loans as the principal reason for change, it would be helpful if we could at least have the evidence of what the current balance is and what the Government&#146;s expectation of change is. Does the Minister accept that, and will he undertake to provide it?</p>

 I certainly accept that the reason why we need to increase the limits is that a lot of the programmes that we have looked to introduce have been guarantee schemes. Whether the headline guarantee figure is &#163;1.3 billion for the enterprise finance guarantee or &#163;2.3 billion for the automotive assistance programme, it all contributes to the need for the authority to incur expenditure. In that sense, I have given the hon. Gentleman  <br>

some of the key figures. I shall happily write to him and put a copy of the letter in the Library, explaining a further detailed breakdown of the schemes as far as I can.

Clause 2 will amend the Export and Investment Guarantees Act 1991, which governs the Export Credits Guarantee Department&#146;s remit, so that the ECGD can provide financial backing for exports that are already under way. My concern is that that will allow for the possibility that the ECGD&#146;s business principles governing environmental standards, sustainable development impacts and corruption will be circumvented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="90421-0005.htm_para12"><a name="090421101000209">It is important that the Government do what they can to support British business in a time of recession. However, there is widespread agreement that such support needs to be sustainable and as green as possible, and that it does not do more harm than good. The worry is that the ECGD could, if it supports exports that have already been supplied without the usual due diligence, inadvertently support projects that have a negative impact on developing countries and add to their unjust and unpayable debt burdens. Civil society groups already have serious concerns about the role of the ECGD in supporting investments that have been linked to human rights violations, corruption, environmental damage and increased debt in poor countries. There needs to be an improvement in the ECGD&#146;s involvement rather than a reduction of the existing standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="90421-0005.htm_para13"><a name="090421101000210">Transparency International UK says that there is no evidence that the Government have consulted interested civil society organisations or the Export Guarantees Advisory Council. Given the speed with which the amendment to the 1991 Act has been drafted and the lack of consultation, the consequences are potentially serious and need to be tackled. We are concerned that there is no safeguard for applying the business principles and anti-bribery provisions. To satisfy the ECGD&#146;s business partners&#146; need for certainty and ensure speed of decision making, the business principles and due diligence procedures may be watered down. Many sectors with which the ECGD has the greatest involvement are historical hotbeds of corruption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="90421-0005.htm_para21"><a name="090421101000220">At the heart of clause 2 is the Minister&#146;s stated wish to update the facilitating role of the Export Credits Guarantee Department, notably, as we have heard from hon. Members on both sides, with more challenging export and overseas projects. The Government are right to say that the way in which high-value capital goods are transacted today has changed considerably since the original Export and Investment Guarantees Act 1991 was passed. Conversely, the scope for social, ethical and environmental due diligence by the Government has, for all the best reasons, increased over that period quite significantly. The net result can be, although not in all cases, to slow the ability of the ECGD to keep up with modern business timetables. There is therefore a case for trying to enable British exporters to trade, while not reducing our national approach towards ethical and environmental standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="90421-0005.htm_para22"><a name="090421101000221">That is why clause 2 has the support of the CBI and, quite rightly, the British Exporters Association. It is also why we support the Government&#146;s aims in making such a change. After all, it is vital, as the right hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley) rightly pointed out, that we ensure that businesses can compete in a modern economy, now more than ever. However, there are reasonable questions about the effect of the clause, especially in the minority of cases where projects may have an important ethical or environmental consideration. As the hon. Member for Solihull rightly pointed out, the World Wildlife Fund has rightly set out questions about how projects might be underwritten retrospectively and about how the Government will ensure that they have not breached human rights or created unacceptable environmental damage. Other people are also concerned about the potential problem of bribery in those areas where corruption is rife.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="90421-0005.htm_para23"><a name="090421101000222">Large-scale infrastructure projects would be especially challenging to police or to audit retrospectively. Equally, if a substantial contract&#151;perhaps for a new dam or a bridge&#151;is commenced, what is the likelihood of the ECGD subsequently withholding support, given the likely economic, employment or political difficulties in such a case? Those are reasonable questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="90421-0005.htm_para24"><a name="090421101000223">Furthermore, as I understand it, the ECGD currently conforms to the standards set by the World Bank. I have tried to consider those and, as I see it, the standards clearly require assessments to be completed before financing is agreed. If that is true, does clause 2 not breach World Bank standards? It would be helpful if the Minister could confirm or clarify that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="90421-0005.htm_para25"><a name="090421101000224">For both those reasons we support amendment 1, which has been tabled by the hon. Member for Solihull. I hope that, in his response, the Minister will clearly set out the Government&#146;s policy and assure us that their standards will not be diluted as a result of clause 2.</p>

 I can indeed assure the Committee that there is nothing in clause 2 that dilutes the high environmental standards or the policies against bribery and corruption that are adopted by the Government. Let me respond to the debate by saying some words about the reason for clause 2. I apologise if I go slightly broader than amendment 1, but other hon. Members have done so, and it seems appropriate for me to do  so, too.</p>

Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk) rightly raised the issue of the problem of using the word &#147;facilitating&#148; when it comes to the supplies of goods or services. That has created difficulties for British exporters, because the Export Credits Guarantee Department cannot facilitate exports if they have already been supplied. As the hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out, and as I did on Second Reading, there are two main reasons why the problems occurred and why this amendment to the ECGD&#146;s current powers was proposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para1"><a name="090421101000227">The first reason is the way in which the high-value capital goods market now works, which often means that requests for ECGD support are made later in the process of export. Buyers or overseas project sponsors rather than the exporters often approach the ECGD for support and buyers seek support only after the exports have been procured and some of the relevant goods or services have been supplied. In many cases with these products, a process of supply takes place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para2"><a name="090421101000228">Secondly, the ECGD&#146;s decision-making processes have evolved in recent years to implement wider Government policy on corruption and on environmental and social impacts. I think that all Members will very much welcome that fact. These are directed by the ECGD&#146;s business principles and involve rigorous due diligence. Of course, that can take time and can delay the ECGD&#146;s ability to make a decision until the supply has been completed. The amendment would allow the ECGD to support exports that have already been made by the time the ECGD has completed its due diligence, but I want to assure this Committee of the whole House that clause 2 does not in any way detract from the rigorous standards that we want to apply to any export that the ECGD is considering exporting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para3"><a name="090421101000229">Amendment 1 concerns the application of the ECGD&#146;s environmental policies, I re-emphasise the fact that the clause does not alter the ECGD&#146;s business principles or the triggers for their application to cases. If there were to be a change to the ECGD&#146;s practices in that regard, ECGD&#146;s business principles themselves state that the ECGD will consult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para4"><a name="090421101000230">I also report to the Committee that, as my noble Friend Lord Mandelson announced yesterday in the White Paper &#147;New Industry, New Jobs&#148;, the ECGD will in the weeks ahead consult on ways of further supporting levels of credit for UK exporters. The Government will ensure that the support offered by the ECGD plays a significant role in supporting UK exporters when demand picks up. It is right to consider at this time a wider role for the ECGD in providing support, but we will consult on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para5"><a name="090421101000231">I invite the Committee to reject the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt), for three reasons. I do not believe that it is necessary, appropriate or workable, so let me try to explain why. The amendment is based on the assumption that clause 2 will somehow weaken the ECGD&#146;s application of its business principles. As I have been at pains to make out, that is not the case. The assumption is mistaken. Clause 2 allows the ECGD to provide support for British supplies that have been made by the time assessments have been completed. It makes no change whatever to the business principles. The only difference is that the circumstances in which the ECGD may consider giving support have been   <br>

extended to include supplies already being made. It is thus the Government&#146;s strongly held view that the amendment is simply unnecessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para6"><a name="090421101000232">I believe that the amendment is also loosely drafted. It is not clear whether the requirement to carry out a case impact assessment is intended to apply to all exports supported by the ECGD or just to a sub-set of them, such as exports completed before it makes the decision to provide support or exports completed before the Bill comes into force and before the ECGD makes the decision to provide support. One interpretation of the amendment might be that a case impact assessment is required only in relation to exports completed prior to the Bill&#146;s coming into force and/or to exports completed prior to the ECGD making a decision to provide support. It seems odd to require a case impact assessment for a sub-set of the ECGD&#146;s business only.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para7"><a name="090421101000233">The amendment could also be interpreted more widely to apply to all exports supported by the ECGD. A statutory obligation would be imposed on the ECGD to conduct a case impact assessment before entering into any arrangements in connection with exports under section 1 of the ECGD&#146;s governing Act. That would represent a change in the ECGD&#146;s policy in a way that is not within the scope of the Bill, and it would not be appropriate to change the ECGD&#146;s environmental policy by statute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para8"><a name="090421101000234">I assume&#151;although it is not made clear&#151;that the amendment is intended to enshrine in statute the ECGD&#146;s case impact assessment as it exists today, and to give statutory force to the assessment. I believe that that would be largely unworkable. The ECGD&#146;s application of its business principles, including those that govern when a case impact assessment must be carried out, is a matter of publicly stated policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para9"><a name="090421101000235">Maintaining the business principles as a policy allows them to be adapted to take account of changes in international standards: for example, to reflect new recommendations and common approaches issued by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on bribery and corruption, sustainable development or the environment. If the business principles or any aspect of them were enshrined in statute, it would be much more difficult for the ECGD to comply with its international undertakings, as primary legislation would be required on each occasion to allow it to adapt the relevant business principles to reflect changes in international agreements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para10"><a name="090421101000236">Similarly, primary legislation would be required for any increase in the rigour of the business principles, and I do not think that some of the groups mentioned by the hon. Lady would want that to happen. We want the ECGD to maintain high standards, but I do not think that enshrining the business principles in statute and having to pass primary legislation every time we wanted to change them represents a good use of parliamentary time. Given that&#151;as Members will know&#151;the OECD is currently discussing changes in some of these areas, I do not think that that would be workable in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para11"><a name="090421101000237">My main point, however, it that the amendment is unnecessary. I can give the hon. Lady the assurance that she seeks: no watering down is taking place. The ECGD&#146;s business principles will continue to apply&#151;on bribery and corruption, sustainable development and the environment&#151;and the ECGD will continue to apply  <br>

 I am grateful to the Minister for his thorough explanation, and for all his technical explanations of why the amendment is not entirely appropriate. I think that it has achieved what it set out to achieve: to have placed on the record assurances from the Government that there will be no watering down and no circumvention of the business principles.

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para18"><a name="090421101000246">This is a small Bill with just three clauses, but as the House agreed when we considered it at an earlier stage, it is vital that we continue to help businesses as much as we can in these exceptional economic times. The Bill proposes two amendments to the Industrial Development and the Export and Investment Guarantees Acts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para19"><a name="090421101000247">The first clause is essential to enable the section 8 power of the Industrial Development Act 1982 to continue to be used to give financial assistance to industry for the purposes specified in that Act. That is necessary to continue to strengthen the provision of support for businesses so that they can come through the global economic downturn stronger. As has previously been explained, the Bill seeks to amend the cumulative limit on financial assistance that may be provided under section 8 to an initial ceiling of &#163;12 billion increasable by four orders of &#163;1 billion each to an overall limit of &#163;16 billion. We have previously discussed this measure, and I think there is widespread support for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para20"><a name="090421101000248">The new forms of support that the Government have been seeking to provide for industry have principally been loan guarantees or loans, and I think there has been acceptance on both sides of the House that that is an appropriate policy intervention. That is why we propose today to increase the limits. Let me offer the example of the enterprise finance guarantee scheme, which has been providing real help to viable businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para21"><a name="090421101000249">Since the launch of the scheme in January, almost &#163;270 million-worth of eligible applications have been granted or processed or assessed from more than 2,300 firms. On 31 March, we announced the solutions for business portfolio, which makes it simpler for businesses to access the support they need. For the first time, all Government help for business, including section 8 support schemes, now share an easy, identifiable banner and can be accessed through Business Link. That has been welcomed by a wide range of business organisations, including the British Chambers of Commerce and the CBI, but without the introduction of the new limits, the legislative basis for those proposals under section 8 would be exceeded on reaching the limit of &#163;6.1 billion allowed by the Industrial Development (Financial Assistance) Act 2003. We therefore need the new powers to ensure that viable businesses continue to receive the support they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para22"><a name="090421101000250">Clause 2 has also been welcomed by the CBI, and I hope that environmental groups and groups that are active in the field of ensuring that the UK has high standards in combating bribery and corruption understand the points I was making in response to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) about the Government intending to continue to maintain high standards and their business principles when looking at large capital goods exports. The Export and Investment Guarantees Act 1991 governs the work of the Export Credits Guarantee Department, a Government Department that reports to the Secretary of State. As I have said, we have had difficulties with the facilitating of supplies and clause 2 seeks to address that. The high-value capital goods market works very differently now from the way in which it did a number of years ago, and the measure essentially clarifies and legitimises ECGD support, rather than in anyway diluting the standards that would apply when assessing individual applications for high-value capital goods; I am happy to confirm that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para23"><a name="090421101000251">If that amendment were not made, British exporters would continue to risk discrimination from overseas project sponsors, because ECGD would not be able to give the type of support that sponsors want. Other export credit agencies in competitor nations are not restricted in the same way in supporting exports that have already taken place, and without this change ECGD support would be reduced as a result of the increasing number of applications that are made to it at too late a stage in the project for its support to be given. That, of course, would be the position in any circumstances, but in the current economic circumstances support for British exports is particularly important. Over recent months, interest in ECDG support and applications for its assistance have, unsurprisingly, increased significantly. The export industry has made it clear that it feels that the problems that we are addressing through clause 2 are serious for it, which is why it has welcomed the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para24"><a name="090421101000252">As I have made clear, the special interest groups that are concerned about this amendment can be reassured by the fact that the criteria applied to projects where the export has been completed will not be altered or made less stringent. The business principles, whether they relate to the environment or to bribery and corruption, are not weakened as a result of the amendment&#151;indeed, it meets a recommendation of the Environmental Audit Committee that would, in the EAC&#146;s view, strengthen the ECDG&#146;s environmental scrutiny. A report on the ECDG and sustainable development that the Committee published last year recommended the following:</p>
<a name="90421-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="090421101000282"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;No offer of support should be made, whether actual or provisional, until ECDG&#146;s Business Principles Unit has completed its assessment&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para25"><a name="090421101000253">of the project for which the exports are destined. Although I do not agree that the ECDG&#146;s environmental scrutiny might be compromised by provisional offers of support, the Bill allows the ECGD to implement the EAC&#146;s recommendation. Its environmental scrutiny can now be completed, and a final offer of support made thereafter, without regard to the timing of the delivery of the export.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para26"><a name="090421101000254">We face a unique set of economic challenges. I am pleased that hon. Members from all parts of the House have recognised the need for these additional powers and have been supportive of the main aims of the Bill, and I am grateful for the constructive approach that Opposition Members have taken. This Bill may not  <br>

have had a lengthy passage&#151;it has indeed been a short one&#151;but there has been a proper opportunity for scrutiny on Second Reading and in Committee. These important measures will help to deliver the real assistance and support that business needs at these difficult times, and I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

 I thank the Minister for the courteous way in which he deals with my many and often detailed questions. I hope that they keep him and his office busy, but my intention is to ensure that the House&#146;s scrutiny is thorough. He is always courteous in how he handles it, despite being on a sticky wicket, and he defends his position with patience and a degree of calmness that I suspect others would not achieve; I appreciate that, as I am sure the House does. May I also take the opportunity at the beginning of Third Reading to thank the Clerks for their support, because the legislation of this House makes progress only with the aid of their efficiency and effectiveness? We rarely commend and thank them, but we should do so more often; I just wanted to put that on the record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para27"><a name="090421101000256">The Minister has alluded to the fact that the passage of this Bill has been brief, and that brevity belies the huge sums attached to it. After all, it is not every day that three clauses equate to &#163;16 billion. Conservative Members support raising the upper limits, and we are satisfied that the House will have the appropriate opportunity to scrutinise the process. We also recognise the need to update the law on exports and for Government to help British business to remain competitive. We, along with other Members, have raised our concerns in respect of ensuring that ethical and environmental standards are maintained, and I accept the assurances that the Minister has given.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para28"><a name="090421101000257">Our concern lies not so much with the legislation or the intentions that it will enact, but with the wide gap between Ministers&#146; rhetoric and the speed and effectiveness of their actions. As with the Chancellor&#146;s Budget tomorrow, it will not be the words expressed from the Dispatch Box that will lead this country out of recession but how effective Ministers are in delivering real help. On that, this Government&#146;s record has been at best slow, at worst inadequate and all too often incompetent. For the sake of hundreds of firms and thousands of workers, we need change and we need it now.</p>

 As the Minister said in his opening remarks, this is a small Bill of huge importance to industry and the future prosperity of this country. It is certainly big on cost, with financial assistance of &#163;6 billion which could be increased to a total of &#163;16 billion. It is also big on help for our exporters. In 2007-08, &#163;1.8 billion in export loans was guaranteed. It is also big in its implications for Britain&#146;s reputation overseas on the environment, human rights and sustainable development, as well as potential corruption and how we deal with it. So it is a big Bill, although it has not received great scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para29"><a name="090421101000259">We support the first clause, and we agree on the emphasis on a shift from grants to loans and to loan guarantees.

Stortford (Mr. Prisk), I feel that the gap between Government announcements and the provision of real money is still too great. Earlier, I asked the Minister whether he could comment on why due diligence was taking such a long time, and whether other issues were hampering the provision of financial help to companies through the Government schemes that have already been announced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para30"><a name="090421101000260">The Minister was good enough to mention Jaguar Land Rover and the &#163;350 million European Investment Bank funding under the clean transport facility loan. That brings me on to green issues and the assistance provided by Government loans and guarantees. JLR is the leading automobile research and development company in Britain, so any help is well merited. We welcome the announcement of the &#163;5,000 to be given towards the purchase of electric cars from 2011, but why were electric vans not included? I have in mind LDV, which has electric vans ready to roll off the production line. If we are talking about reducing carbon emissions, it would be hugely beneficial to substitute many of the vans on the roads today with electric vehicles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para31"><a name="090421101000261">On Second Reading, the Minister did not answer three of my questions, so I shall give him the opportunity to respond to them now. I asked him about help for lease financing companies, which have not been included in the banking industry support schemes although those companies afford tremendous help to small businesses that are arguably the most vulnerable in these difficult economic times. On the issue of the small business automatic rate relief, I suspect that the Minister will tell me off and suggest that I wait until tomorrow. I hope that we will hear some good words from the Chancellor on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para32"><a name="090421101000262">I also floated a minimal cost idea, which involved a register of administrations and the publication of whether a proposed customer has a history of liquidating companies. It would be relatively easy to see what sort of relative risk would be afforded if one went into business to supply a company whose directors had a history of liquidating companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="90421-0006.htm_para33"><a name="090421101000263">We support the scheme in clause 2 in principle, with the provisos that the Minister has already given to us in amendment 1. However, it is worth looking at who benefits. I looked up the Export Credits Guarantee Department&#146;s annual review and resources account for 2007-08. What did I find? Of the total business support of &#163;1.8 billion, more than &#163;500 million went to Airbus, whereas &#163;750 million went to BAE Systems and was spent on defence&#151;</p>

 I am grateful for your guidance, Madam Deputy Speaker. I was merely trying to talk about what the Bill will achieve in terms of supply and about where guarantees paid for out of taxpayers&#146; money are being directed. We have a worry&#151;there was a conversation on this subject earlier in the debate&#151;about the proportion of supply that went to smaller companies and to larger companies. My point was that the huge companies seem to be swallowing the guarantees while a relatively small amount of money goes to smaller exporters.</p>

 This is rather like old times, I suppose, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The business before the House tonight consists of two revival motions, and I know that you would take a dim view were I to stray beyond the arguments in favour of or, indeed, against revival. The debate is clearly narrow, and I hope that, on that basis, it can be short and succinct.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="90421-0007.htm_para9"><a name="090421131000006">It is worth reminding the House that the revival of this type of private Bill has been common practice for a long time, and I am told that opposition to revival motions is relatively unusual in the annals of the House. In that context, and given that the Bills that received a Second Reading on 29 October 2008 passed that stage so recently, and that the other Bills that we will discuss did not have the chance of being given a Second Reading even though there was lengthy debate, I want to establish that, after less than six months, it would be almost absurd for the House to refuse the revival motion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="90421-0007.htm_para10"><a name="090421131000007">In that spirit, I hope that I can say confidently to the Chamber that the revival ought to go ahead. It is up to those who oppose it to put, with your permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, their narrow and brief case as to why it should not.</p>

 Surely the hon. Gentleman needs to address the fact that, since the Bills came before the House, the Durham university report has been published. I am sure he will accept that it throws considerable doubt on many assertions in the promoters&#146; statements.</p>

 For the record, the Durham university study does not show that. For example, it said that, even to a sceptical inquirer, it was clear that there were circumstances in which such legislation would be important to certain local areas. I speak from the point of view of Manchester, but I am sure that my colleagues from Leeds and Nottingham, who are alongside me, and those from Canterbury, Reading and Bournemouth, who are also present, share the same sentiments in respect of their own localities. That is an important point. In any case, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument about detail and the study&#146;s merits, while fascinating and worthy of debate, would be better conducted when those Bills that have received a Second Reading move into Committee. Indeed, with your agreement, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and if we can secure the revival motion for those Bills that have not yet had a Second Reading, we might debate the merits of the Durham study during their Second Readings, too.</p>

It is only a matter of months since the Bills were debated, and it was clear at the time that, barring a small fringe, a majority of the House massively supported them. It would be contemptuous of the House not to accept the spirit and, indeed, the letter of the revival. In that context, I support the first and, by reference, second motions, on private business which appear on the Order Paper tonight.</p>

 I welcome this debate because it should give the promoters of these Bills the opportunity to show cause as to why they should have leave to proceed with them in the current Session. The provisions of Standing Order No. 188B, which relates to the revival of Bills, make it clear that there is no right to have a Bill revived and that it is a matter of discretion for the House. It is therefore relevant to look at the history of the Manchester City Council Bill and the Bournemouth Borough Council Bill, which goes back to 22 January 2007, when they were originally introduced in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="90421-0007.htm_para12"><a name="090421131000012">Since then, much has happened that renders the Bills, particularly in so far as they relate to pedlars, no longer appropriate. I have particular reason to be concerned about clause 5 of each Bill. A Select Committee in the other place scrutinised the Bournemouth Borough Council Bill in detail in 2007. One of its conclusions was that it had</p>
<a name="90421-0007.htm_brev4"><a name="090421131000386"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;strong reservations about the use of piecemeal private legislation to remedy perceived problems in national legislation.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="90421-0007.htm_para13"><a name="090421131000013">The justification given by the promoters for continuing to proceed with the Bills was that nothing was happening through national legislation and that therefore local solutions were needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="90421-0007.htm_para14"><a name="090421131000014">However, the caravan has moved on. As a result of pressure from both sides of the House, the Government agreed last summer to commission research from Durham university on the application and perception of local authority controls and pedlar legislation. I opposed the Second Readings of these two Bills&#151;because, among other reasons, I regarded them as premature. I argued that we should await the publication of the Durham university report. For the same reason, I objected to the Bills&#146; being carried over into this Session. The Government provided no time to debate those carry-over motions before Prorogation last November. That, in turn, resulted in the promoters seeking the indulgence of the House to allow them to revive the Bills in this Session.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="90421-0007.htm_para15"><a name="090421131000015">I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd): the two Bills that we are considering both received a Second Reading in the House. However, they received it before the Durham university report had been published. I do not know whether you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, have had the chance to look at the report, but I should say that it extends to 97 pages and, in my submission, represents an important and timely contribution to the debate on these Bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="90421-0007.htm_para16"><a name="090421131000016">The report was published by the Government earlier this year and because of its findings I had expected the hon.

including clause 5 in his Bill. I shall expand on this in connection with the other Bills, but I should tell him that I have had discussions with two of the local authorities concerned in this private legislation&#151;those discussions continued today&#151;and I have to report their willingness to be much more receptive to the clear evidence of the Durham university study. It is a matter of regret to me that in his short introduction to tonight&#146;s proceedings, he did not refer to that important report. Among other things, the report draws attention to the fact that there have been only five convictions in the whole of Manchester in the period 2002-06&#151;hardly indicative, one might think, of a really serious issue that needs to be addressed by this House, and has so far been addressed at considerable length.</p>

 That is absolutely fundamental. What has happened in this case is a change of circumstances. Where there is fresh evidence, it behoves Members of this House to consider the new situation. The Durham university report makes it clear that if a local authority wishes to use private legislation to change the law in this respect, it needs to have strong evidence&#151;the very last statement made in the report; I do not quote it exactly but summarise, I think fairly. If that is so, it is all the more incumbent on the promoters of the Bill to address the issues contained in that report, particularly the finding, which we were never able to get out of them in the debate in June last year, that in the period 2002-06 there were only five guilty verdicts in Greater Manchester and only three in Dorset&#151;of course, those are the two areas affected by the Bills that we are discussing.

introduction of a complete change in the law with new private legislation?&#148; This is new evidence before the House that was not available to us when we considered the matter previously, and that needs to be taken into account.</p>

 This debate is about the revival of the Bill. Could not the Government have found time for a carry-over motion in the previous Session? The only argument from the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd) as to why this revival should take place was that revivals usually take place, which does not seem a very powerful case.</p>

<p><a name="st_o123"><a name="090421131000024"><a name="90421-0007.htm_spnew11"><a name="090421131000414"><b>Mr. Chope:</b>
 I am not sure that revivals normally take place; it is a question of judgment. I think that there is a precedent, which has been cited, to the effect that if a Bill has not received its Second Reading during the whole of one of our parliamentary Sessions, it would prima facie not be right for that Bill to be the subject of a carry-over motion or a revival motion. I accept that that constraint does not apply to these two Bills, although it may have some relevance to the subsequent debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="90421-0007.htm_para17"><a name="090421131000025">It is quite clear from examining the private business Standing Orders that this is a matter of discretion for the House. You may recall, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that I objected to the carry-over motion that was put forward at the end of the last Session in respect of the Northern Bank Bill. I objected to the Bill and made it clear to its promoters that it was not going to be a straightforward tick-in-the-box procedure, and they decided to withdraw it. They recognised that it had not made any progress during the Session, and implicitly recognised that they needed to go back to the drawing board to see whether the Bill was still relevant.</p>

 Members on both sides of the House have now said that this is a matter for the discretion of the House. Perhaps I am not as well versed as the hon.

 I do not think that anybody is ruling out the possibility that there could be a vote on this issue, and then we could find out the view of the House. However, it is a pretty novel proposition that we should not have any debate in this House about the motions that are before us. I happen to think that it is a pity that there was so little debate on the previous business this afternoon that the sitting had to be suspended for more than two hours, at a time when the way in which we conduct ourselves is very much in the public eye, but that is another issue and I will not go down that route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="90421-0007.htm_para18"><a name="090421131000028">One of the major findings of the Durham university report was:</p>

Indeed, consumers valued their presence in town centres and regarded buying from pedlars as a positive experience.&#148;</p>

pedlars, the report&#146;s producers commissioned research in two city centres. One was Edinburgh and the other was actually Manchester. There is a detailed set of findings in the Durham university report on the views of the public in Manchester, which are that there is no great problem with pedlars. The public think that pedlars add to the character of the neighbourhood and they enjoy using their services. Of course, we have made the point before that it is not compulsory to use their services, but the public enjoy their availability and recognise that they make a major contribution to Manchester&#146;s entrepreneurial flair, which has national renown.</p>

That point was made a lot, but the hon. Member for Manchester, Central, my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill), whom I am delighted to see in his place, and others disputed it hotly. However, we now have objective evidence from the Durham university study that shows that the evidence that local authorities submitted conflated illegal street trading with the activities of genuine pedlars. According to the report, the promoters of the Bills and their supporters showed confusion about the different identities of pedlars, illegal traders and rogues, just as the Durham university researchers found that local authorities generally had done.</p>

 As so often in the House, my hon. Friend makes a compelling statement of what most people would regard as common sense.

 My hon.

If they decide that they want legislation that goes beyond what the Government eventually propose, they will have to start all over again.

 Order. For the guidance of the House, it is fairly plain that we have a motion before us for carry-over. It is the merits of that motion that the House is now obliged to consider, rather than the motivation that might lie behind it. The motion is here and it is being debated.

 My hon. Friend makes a very fair point. One of the questions that we must consider in deciding whether we wish to revive the Bills this evening is whether they have been so discredited as a result of the latest findings and so upstaged by the Government&#146;s announcements to which I have referred that they are now almost redundant and will not make any progress.</p>

into account the use of the House&#146;s time, the burden placed on those participating in Committee and whether that Committee stage will be worth-while, having regard to the constraints to which I have already drawn attention and the possibility that when the matter gets to Report, the Government might seek major amendments to the Bills&#151;with or without the support of Opposition Members and others who are concerned about ensuring the future of pedlary in this country. I have been unable to tease out from the promoters of the Bills their response to the Durham university report. In my submission, it is not an academic matter; it goes to the heart of whether or not these Bills should be revived.</p>

To go back to the point raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight), it would mean that these Bills could go through very quickly because there would effectively be no opposition to them. What could be more reasonable and sensible than that? To adopt what is tantamount to a heads-in-the-sand approach should give us all great cause for concern, not least because such stubbornness will inevitably result in an elongation of proceedings.</p>

That is a new development since the last debate on these matters and is a relevant factor in considering whether it is appropriate to allow these Bills to be carried over.</p>

The question is: how many prosecutions have been brought and have resulted in convictions? That task is normally given to street trading officers and local authority enforcement rather than the police. However, my hon. Friend is right to draw attention to the new information that there have only been three convictions in Dorset in the last period for which figures are available&#151;a period of four years between 2002 and 2006.</p>

 My hon. Friend has considerable knowledge of this subject. In his discussions with the promoters of the private Bills we are debating, has he addressed the fact that we now have considerable experience of Bills that have been passed by this House, notably those in respect of the city of Westminster in 1999, Newcastle in 2000, London in 2003, Medway in 2004 and Maidstone, Leicester and Liverpool in 2006?

 My hon. Friend raises an important point. Obviously, I have not been able to do my own direct research on this matter. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> My hon.

 That is a statement of self-evident common sense. It is particularly important to pay regard to the costs involved in all this, as this is not a cost-free area of operation. Introducing private Bills costs money, and that burden falls directly on the local taxpayer. I know from my discussions with some of the councils that are concerned about this that they have to evaluate the costs and the benefits of particular courses of legislative action. It is a pity that there has not so far been any evidence that either of the Bills that we are discussing has been the subject of concern expressed at local council level as to whether they will continue to provide good value for money, having regard to all other possibilities.</p>

 The short answer is that I have not estimated how much the cost would be to this House. These two Bills have had their Second Readings so if they are revived, they would need to go into Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West will know what the possible timetable is, but I imagine that there would be a separate Committee for each Bill, because separate interests are involved, and that the councils involved would face costs for dealing with those proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="90421-0008.htm_para13"><a name="090421131000080">Much of the content of the two Bills is relatively uncontroversial. The point I am making is that if their promoters were saying that the very controversial bits and the bits that are now contradicted by the evidence from Durham university were to be taken out of the Bills, there would not be an argument against allowing them to be revived. When I came into the Chamber this evening, I hoped that I would hear from my hon. Friend or from the hon. Member for Manchester, Central that, in the light of the evidence, there was to be a modification. It may be that in due course such a modification will be made, but we have to judge the situation on the evidence before us at the moment. That evidence suggests that there is no willingness on the part of the promoters to compromise or to reflect upon the findings of the exhaustive study carried out by Durham university.</p>

Friend is noted for his contrariness on such occasions, and it is important that that point should be put on the record&#151;it does not appear that anyone else was intending to refer to it. My response would be that the relatively small fees associated with the placing of a private Bill in Parliament are modest compared with the costs of giving evidence and providing support during the Committee stage in respect of parts of the Bill that subsequently come to be regarded as redundant or incapable of achieving enactment.  <br>

I should also make it clear that, following the custom, the Government do not take any view on the content or progress of private Bills&#151;that is a matter for Parliament.</p>

As the hon. Gentleman suggested, we agree with the main conclusions from the research findings. First, there is scope for a more flexible enforcement regime in respect of unlicensed street trading, including the possibility of less burdensome options to criminal prosecution. Secondly, there would be support from Government for national guidance on the meaning and application of the current arrangements, which contain ambiguities, the interpretation of which varies across the country, as the research found. Thirdly, we accept too that there is scope for modernising the Pedlars Act 1871, for example by updating and standardising the pedlar&#146;s certificate to enable easier identification of genuine certificates and to clarify the definition of permitted activities of certified pedlars, among other things. I also want to acknowledge that the Government accept that, in some areas and on some occasions, there might be a reasonable case for additional restrictions.</p>

Last month, my officials met representatives from the local authorities whose Bills are under discussion tonight. Hon. Members might wish to note that that this summer, my Department will be issuing a consultation document and will seek views from as wide a constituency as we can on the findings of the research and on possible ways forward.</p>

 As my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) said, the genesis of these revival motions was as long ago as 22 January 2007. We had a considerable debate on this matter on Second Reading on 2 June 2008, there was a further debate on 29 October 2008, and here we are today with these revival motions. The private Bills that we are seeking to revive all do much the same thing&#151;that is, they try to incorporate the definition in clause 3 of the Pedlars Act 1871 into schedule 4 to the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="90421-0009.htm_para9"><a name="090421131000105">Much of the debate about the Bill does not focus on the true problem of what a pedlar is. Does he go from door to door, or occupy the same spot in a market square every day? It is a debatable point. To be totally clear, the House needs to hear again how chapter 96 of the 1871 Act defines a pedlar. Clause 3 states:</p>
<a name="90421-0009.htm_brev1"><a name="090421131000393"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The term &#145;pedlar&#146; means any hawker, pedlar, petty chapman, tinker, caster of metals, mender of chairs, or other person who, without any horse or other beast bearing or drawing burden, travels and trades on foot and goes from town to town or to other men&#146;s houses, carrying to sell or exposing for sale any goods, wares, or merchandise, or procuring orders for goods, wares, or merchandise immediately to be delivered, or selling or offering for sale his skill in handicraft&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90421-0009.htm_para10"><a name="090421131000106">It is obvious that a pedlar is very different from a street market trader, who is covered by different legislation. The legislation covering pedlars requires them to go to the local police for a certificate, which they can usually obtain for about &#163;12 or &#163;15, whereas a street market trader has to obtain a licence from the local authority that costs in the region of &#163;500 to &#163;1,000. That is a different order of cost.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I shall be brief, as I do not want to encourage long speeches. Will he confirm that what he said is not absolutely accurate, in that to obtain a pedlar&#146;s licence a person does not have to go to the local police force in the area where he or she intends to peddle? The licence can be obtained from any force, even though its officers know nothing about the area where the purported trade might take place.</p>

area where legislation does not prohibit him from doing so. At the moment, therefore, he can trade in Manchester, Bournemouth, Canterbury or any other area of the country, provided that he has that certificate.</p>

Anyone interested in the subject should read that study&#151;or at least its summary, opening remarks and some of its evidence on prosecutions and complaints&#151;as I think that the problem may have been exaggerated around the country. I think that, on the whole, the perceived problem is much greater than the actual problem because, on the whole, pedlars are law-abiding people who go about their business peacefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="90421-0009.htm_para12"><a name="090421131000112">The main complaint is about competition, given the procedure that I described: pedlars can buy a certificate for &#163;12 or &#163;15, whereas a street trader has to pay between &#163;500 and &#163;1,000. Street traders object to pedlars trading alongside them&#151;sometimes with exactly the same sort of goods, be it balloons, trinkets, bits of jewellery or whatever&#151;because there is unfair competition. That is where some of the complaints stem from.</p>

 My hon. Friend has great mastery of the subject and of the Durham report. May I draw to his attention an extract from page 66? It states:</p>
<a name="90421-0009.htm_brev2"><a name="090421131000394"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Street traders on the whole do not sell the same goods as pedlars, nor do they compete directly for customers. One Street trader did express a view of lost earnings to illegal street traders selling inferior goods, but overall levels of competition were low.&#148;</p>

 My hon. Friend usefully draws attention to that paragraph, but somewhere else the report notes that competition is one of the causes of complaint. On the whole, the number of complaints in any local authority area is fairly low, so it seems to me that every sponsor of such a Bill&#151;the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd) has spoken in support of his Bill&#151;has to make a crystal-clear case as to why their Bill should be revived.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="90421-0009.htm_para13"><a name="090421131000115">Like the Government, the Opposition have no particular view officially about whether the Bills should be revived. I have no problem if they are revived; if the House in its wisdom votes in favour of their revival and they go into Committee, I have no problem with that. Even if they go through Committee, pass their other stages and are enacted I shall have no problem with it. However, when we discussed the matter on 12 June 2008 I argued from the Opposition Benches that we should have a national study. We now have such a study and on the whole it concludes that there are special circumstances in each local authority area. On the whole, contrary to what I argued on 12 June 2008, the Durham report seems to make it clear that each local case should be taken on its merits, although whether that will continue to be the prevailing view I do not know.</p>

That is really important. Evidence is the key to the whole matter.

 I am delighted to hear that intervention from the hon.

We had a long argument about that in the previous debate on the subject, and I do not want to go over that again. There may be a residency requirement, but as the hon. Member for Manchester, Central, made absolutely clear, the person concerned does not have to go to his local police force. A person from Manchester can go to a police force in London, for example, to obtain a certificate. Although he needs to prove residency and prove a good character through the CRB records, there is no local knowledge of his character. That is a flaw in the argument. Some argue&#151;indeed, in the Durham report it is argued&#151;that the local authority should be the licensing authority, so that the provisions are coterminous with those in the street trading legislation.

is difficult to get a private Bill through the House, and it is expensive and time-consuming for a local authority. I therefore maintain my position, despite what the Durham report says. That is why I shall be very interested to see what happens. If we come into government after the next election, we will certainly continue the Government&#146;s process of gathering evidence, producing guidance and considering whether the national legislation needs to be altered.

brought back, because the process would not exist if Parliament thought they should automatically be brought back. The argument is a technical one about whether the promoters have made the case that there is an exceptional reason to bring the Bills back, and whether anything has changed. The Minister put the Government&#146;s case succinctly. Clearly, things have changed and there may well be national legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="90421-0010.htm_para1"><a name="090421131000129">Would the promoters of the Bills lose out by not having them revived tonight? We heard that the cost of bringing the Bills back at a later stage would not be significant, but that proceeding with the Bills now in Committee would be very expensive for the councils. Is it possible that taxpayers in those areas would say, &#147;If my council had only waited a little while, there would have been national guidelines and a national process, and we needn&#146;t have wasted that money&#148;? On balance, the case for revival has unfortunately not been made strongly enough for me to support it.</p>

Although they are all included in one motion, Mr. Deputy Speaker, you will know that one of them, the Canterbury City Council Bill, has already received a Second Reading and is therefore, it might be argued, in a category more similar to the other two Bills. On the other hand, one might say that during that previous debate there was unfinished business between my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) and me, and that there would be an opportunity to develop the arguments as to why the situation in Canterbury warrants a revival. The difference between the Canterbury Bill and the Manchester and Bournemouth Bills is that the Canterbury Bill has not yet been to the other place and is therefore on a slower time scale than the other two. Therefore, the arguments that were deployed in the previous debate for giving the promoters a chance to rethink their strategy in light of the Durham university report weigh more strongly against the case for Canterbury&#146;s revival than in respect of Manchester and Bournemouth.</p>

Of course, the Nottingham City Council Bill, the Leeds City Council Bill and the Reading Borough Council Bill did not receive a Second Reading in the last Session, so they are completely de novo and would need a Second Reading in this Session. The question one asks is why, if they did not make any progress in the last Session, they should be allowed to be revived at this stage.</p>

 I hope that my hon. Friend will forgive me if I am asking a foolish question as a relative novice at these procedural matters. Is it not odd that although the Bills whose revival we are discussing reached different stages of their lives in the last Session, they should all be brought together in a single revival motion? It is a sort of hybrid motion, bringing together some rather good things that are more advanced in their considerations with some things that are bad. Procedurally, would it not have been better had the promoters brought forward different motions so that it was possible to consider each Bill separately?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a very fair point, but I am in no position to comment, because the decision on how this business should be dealt with was taken by the Chairman of Ways and Means, and the decision was to have all four Bills put together. In fairness, if my hon. Friend or myself had wanted to table an amendment, for example to delete one or more of the Bills from the motion, we would probably have been able to do so and have it debated. His point may give grounds for seeking from you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, a ruling as to whether there could be separate Divisions on each individual Bill, or on the Bills that are in separate categories with separate arguments relating to them. My hon. Friend would probably have to raise that with you on a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>

why should they be able to crave the indulgence of the House to have it carried over or revived in a second? Where is the evidence that they will be able to make any more progress in that Session? Does there come a stage when what is happening is a bit of an abuse of the process and procedures of the House? In the previous debate I cited the example of what happened with the Northern Bank Bill, which was a private Bill in the previous Session. It did not make any progress and was blocked at the end of the Session. As a result, the promoters of the Bill had second thoughts and decided to withdraw it.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I would be grateful for your guidance on the procedural matter that my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) has been roaming around a little bit. I am sure that he is not calling into question the way in which the Chairman of Ways and Means brought forward the motion, which of course was perfectly proper. However, the point that my hon. Friend is making, as I understand it&#151;forgive me if my knowledge of procedure is not all that it might be&#151;is that there are differences between the various Bills that the motion would revive. Some might be better than others and some have gone further than others in their process through Parliament. I am not sure whether it is allowable under the procedures, but would it not be sensible to allow several Divisions on the four Bills that we are considering?</p>

 The short answer is no. In the revival motion, there is no distinction between the Bills that we are discussing. Everything has been done in order. As the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) said, the Chairman of Ways and Means agreed that the motion should go forward. Everything is in order, and I suspect that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points are debating points.</p>

 I do not believe that anyone is suggesting that what we are doing is not in order. I was trying to explain that there are distinctions between the four Bills, which are grouped together, in that only one has had a Second Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="90421-0010.htm_para10"><a name="090421135000024">Another distinction is worthy of the House&#146;s attention. The promoters of two of the Bills that have not had a Second Reading have said in discussions and in writing to me&#151;and, we can infer, to other hon. Members who are concerned about the Bills&#151;that they are willing to compromise significantly about the content of the clauses in the respective measures on pedlary. If the promoters of those two Bills have expressed a willingness to compromise on the main subject of my objections  to the measures collectively, might not it possible to examine the two Bills separately from the others in the group? If the promoters of two measures are prepared to compromise, thereby shortening the Committee proceedings and possibly Second Reading, through responding to concerns and the findings of the Durham  <br>

 To revert to a point that I tried to make earlier, is not it the case that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s discussions with Reading borough council about the activities of pedlars who act effectively as stallholders&#151;the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) mentioned that&#151;showed that the council was prepared to negotiate and be flexible? That is an argument not for opposing the revival motion, but for allowing it to go forward so that we can reach Committee as soon as possible.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman anticipates my point, which I am getting around to raising with you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. If the two councils&#151;Reading and Leeds&#151;are prepared to compromise, to respond to public opinion, as reflected in the Durham university report, and to council tax payers&#146; concerns about possible abortive costs incurred, and to consider amending clause 5 of the respective Bills, should not they be given preferential treatment, compared with councils that still have their heads in the sand, believing that they can carry on regardless, as though the Durham study had never been conducted, there were no findings in its 90-odd pages and no issues had arisen from it? The Minister said in the previous debate that the Government acknowledged that the study raised issues which merited their attention and would be subject to consultation.</p>

 My hon. Friend will have to answer to the people of Leeds. Two officers travelled to London from Leeds today specifically to have a meeting with me to discuss the issue. I would assert strongly that the expenditure involved in travelling to that meeting was properly incurred, because as a result they may be able to get their legislation on to the statute book in a way that they would be content with and rather sooner than councils that continue to defy the objections of those of us who are keen to protect the rights of pedlars.</p>

We do not know whether that will lead to legislation, but given the present rate of progress, I see little prospect of the Bills that we are considering tonight&#151;whose Second Readings must still be debated in the Chamber, and whose merits must be voted on if they are revived&#151;arriving on the statute book, having been dealt with by this House and the other place, before time runs out for this Government and there must be a general election.</p>

City Council and Bournemouth Borough Council Bills took place in June last year, were adjourned, and were resumed in October. Those of us who were involved in those debates may like to take some credit for the fact that our actions deterred a lot of the other councils, to which my hon. Friend refers, from bringing forward their private Bills, no doubt much to the relief of the Chairman of Ways and Means and the Private Bill Office, because they wanted to reflect on what was happening, not least in terms of the Durham university report, the response of this House to that report, and now the Government response.

At present, each individual police force is responsible for licensing shotguns that can then be used anywhere in the country, but they have a common system for doing that, and I think there is a lot to be said for having a similarly common system for the licensing of pedlars.</p>

What I know is that a significant police operation took place in Reading. It was called Operation Ontology and it was an operation with the council and the Border and Immigration Agency police command team. It targeted immigration offending and criminality by pedlars in Reading town centre. The operation was conducted by local Thames Valley police officers, supported by the neighbourhood policing team and conducted after consultation with Reading borough council licensing department. The purpose of the operation&#151;this is yet another reason for supporting the Bill&#151;was to identify all the pedlars operating in the town centre of Reading during the period of the operation and where necessary to record details, to locate and identify any immigration offenders among the pedlars, to arrest suspected immigration offenders to be dealt  <br>

This matter was alluded to by not only the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), but the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt). In many cases these are not pedlars under the definition of the 1871 Act, and the Bills merely seek to bring a piece of legislation that was framed in 1871 up to date to reflect modern circumstances and modern pressures.</p>

I find it strange that hon. Members from the party that supports business and enterprise appear to be setting themselves against ensuring fair competition and an even playing field. I find it even more surprising that arguments are coming from those on the Conservative Benches against the Cameronian notion of localism; we appear to be hearing arguments for the nationalisation of the regulation of pedlars. That runs contrary to the thrust of the new modern Conservatives and it is frankly illogical, and I find it strange that the Conservative Front-Bench team has not sought to make that point.</p>

Let us consider Reading&#146;s Harris arcade or what is commonly known as &#147;smelly alley&#148;&#151;Union street in Reading. The total cost of rent, rates and overheads for the small units located there probably works out at about &#163;15,000 a unit. One of these Mickey Mouse stalls being erected on the basis of a pedlar&#146;s certificate costing &#163;12.50 can immensely damage the business of legitimate traders who are paying up to &#163;15,000 a year purely for rent, rates and overheads.

 I did not think that my hon. Friend would answer my question. The hon. Member for Reading, West succinctly said that the essence of this measure is the fact that illegal street trading is carried out under the flag of convenience, as he put it, of touting. I asked my hon. Friend to explain how he could distinguish between pedlars and illegal street trading&#151;nobody in this House wants to attack pedlars who are not involved in illegal street trading&#151;but he said that it would be out of order to answer that point. However, it would not be out of order and, as on so many occasions, he has failed to answer my question.</p>

I hope that it will be possible, when the House authorities consider the arrangements for Committee, for the Canterbury City Council Bill to be grouped with the other two Bills that have already received their Second Reading, because that is the only substantial difference.</p>

Member for Reading, West, but it would be scandalous at any time for struggling honest businesses to be ruined by small numbers&#151;or, in Canterbury&#146;s case, by relatively large numbers&#151;of people using peddling licences to act as street traders. It is not only the legitimate street traders, paying their &#163;800 a year, who are affected, but the shops next door, which are also being wrecked by those people. It really is extraordinarily bad news in the current recession. It is no exaggeration to say that businesses in Canterbury will go to the wall because this measure has not gone through, and that greatly saddens me. It is why I ask the House to revive the Bill. My final point is that in his remarks, my hon. Friend&#151;</p>

 My hon. Friend has repeated his allegation again, so it is clearly on the record twice. To establish his point, he needs to show a point where one of the promoters of the Bills has conflated the two things. There is no point in going back to the Durham report for it. The plain fact is that all the way through these proceedings the MPs supporting the promoters of these Bills have sought to explain that nobody wants to attack genuine pedlars&#151;people who go from place to place, selling their wares. He has accused us again of conflation, and the record will show that, but the problem is pedlars who act as illegal street traders and can hide behind their pedlars&#146; licences. The kind of inflammatory statement that he quoted from the Durham report may well be dug out in relation to some councils, but I have heard nobody in the various debates&#151;I have been here for them all, except for part of the last one&#151;who has conflated the two groups in the way that he suggests.</p>

It puzzled me that a man should have a grievance that nobody was prepared to hear. Even his local Member of Parliament refused to take up the case. I am pleased to say that this House has a long and proud tradition of defending the weak and standing up for those who have no voice. Parliament, after all, is supposed to be the highest court in the land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="90421-0012.htm_para13"><a name="090421138000006">Tonight I bring before the House the strange case of Paul Buchanan. His world has been turned upside down, his career prospects have been badly damaged, his political ambitions in local government have been ruined and his good name has been rubbished, all because of the actions of one highly placed, highly paid and quite unscrupulous public official&#151;the chief executive of Somerset county council, Mr. Alan Jones. This is a true story. Mr. Jones is guilty of deliberate deceit and victimisation. He deliberately set out to destroy Paul Buchanan. The tactics that Jones used make Damian McBride look like an angel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="90421-0012.htm_para14"><a name="090421138000007">I have the evidence right here. To his credit, Mr. Buchanan has at no time broken any confidences to me. All my information has come from available transcripts which were deemed by the Adjudication Panel for England to be &#147;in the public domain&#148;. The documents that I have collected were part of recent hearings against Paul Buchanan. I attended one of the proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="90421-0012.htm_para15"><a name="090421138000008">The evidence against Alan Jones is damning. On 4 April 2007 Alan Jones composed a six-page letter of complaint about Paul Buchanan and sent it to the Standards Board for England. At that time Mr. Buchanan was deputy leader of his party and hoped to be the new leader. Without the intervention of the chief executive, he would probably have succeeded, but with a very poisoned pen Jones totally undermined him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="90421-0012.htm_para16"><a name="090421138000009">The letter is a bizarre piece of writing. Jones  attempts to play the reasonable father-figure, describing Mr. Buchanan as &#147;young, able and enthusiastic&#148;. Then the venom starts to flow. Paul Buchanan is accused of secretiveness, undermining staff, aggression, threatening behaviour, rudeness, intimidation, anger, disrespect, fraud, sexism, racism, homophobia, and abuse of his office as an elected councillor. There is barely concealed hatred   <br>

of the man in every sentence. It is the ultimate hatchet job. Indeed, if there was a prize for the black arts, Alan Jones would win it, hands down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="90421-0012.htm_para17"><a name="090421138000010">Jones did not want the Standards Board to investigate. He wanted an instant political execution. He asked for Buchanan to be suspended there and then. I can only hazard a guess at the reaction when his letter was received. The Standards Board would have been forgiven for thinking that Paul Buchanan was an unstable nutcase with homicidal tendencies. In fact, the really unstable character was the one who made the complaint&#151;Somerset county council&#146;s most senior officer. Unfortunately, the Standards Board does not investigate complaints against officers; there is a gaping hole in the justice system. It is manifestly unfair that no legal process has yet been created by which officers can be independently investigated&#151;unless, that is, they commit actual crimes. I invite the Minister to comment on that vital general point when he responds, and to see whether he can do anything to help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="90421-0012.htm_para18"><a name="090421138000011">The Standards Board had very few options. It was obliged to launch a full-blown inquiry into Mr. Buchanan, even if it doubted the wild complaints about him that Alan Jones had brought. The board went about its task relentlessly for two years. It conducted literally hundreds of interviews and produced thousands of pages of transcripts. When it rejected Alan Jones&#146;s first batch of complaints, Jones wasted no additional time disputing its findings. I sympathise a little with the Standards Board; it was dealing with a deranged obsessive. The first investigator, or ethical standards officer, as the board calls them, retired halfway through the tortuous process&#151;probably exhausted. Lawyers came and went, and it dragged on. Heaven only knows what it cost&#151;and the result? Eventually, 16 of the original complaints were rejected completely and four others were referred to a higher court&#151;the Adjudication Panel. That meant more delay and more uncertainty for Paul Buchanan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="90421-0012.htm_para19"><a name="090421138000012">The panel, with a bench of barristers in tow, finally met in Somerset over recent weeks. Key witnesses were called to give evidence again&#151;remarkably few, actually, because most did not want to have anything to do with it. The panel had access to all the original documentation and threw out three more complaints. One tiny charge was upheld. Paul Buchanan had been heard swearing under his breath. He was deemed to have been a little careless and ticked off with a censure&#151;the mildest possible sanction. That is mad. Frankly, after two years in limbo, my language would have been extremely fruity and very loud indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="90421-0012.htm_para20"><a name="090421138000013">My fascination with the case, however, is with what really lies behind it. Why on earth did a chief executive, earning &#163;160,000 a year, with 17,000 staff and huge responsibilities, go to so much trouble to make complaints about a young, ambitious councillor? Mr. Jones&#146;s explanation was beyond belief. He said that Mr. Buchanan&#146;s behaviour was</p>
<a name="90421-0012.htm_brev9"><a name="090421138000078"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;capable of damaging the council&#146;s continued improvement and external reputation.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="90421-0012.htm_para21"><a name="090421138000014">That statement would stack up only if the charges against him were proved, but they were not. Paul Buchanan has been acquitted of everything serious. Let us remember the allegations: secretiveness, undermining staff, aggression, threatening behaviour, rudeness, intimidation, anger, disrespect, fraud, sexism, racism, homophobia&#151;and, I suspect, leaving the toilet seat up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="90421-0012.htm_para22"><a name="090421138000015">It is not credible that Alan Jones made an innocent mistake in complaining about Buchanan. Mr. Jones&#146;s charges were too specific, and they were backed up with too much detail and too much personal bile. It was a wholly personal vendetta. It is open to anyone&#151;fellow councillors, council employees and ordinary members of the public&#151;to make complaints to the Standards Board, but Jones extracted statements from junior staff who were perhaps too scared to go against the boss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="90421-0012.htm_para23"><a name="090421138000016">So, why on earth did Jones want to get Buchanan? And, what had Buchanan got on Jones? I am sorry if it sounds conspiratorial, but there is a big hint of conspiracy in all this. Mr Buchanan unfortunately knew too much for his own good. Back in 2005 there was gossip about Alan Jones having an affair with a member of staff called Jenny Hastings. Everybody at county hall knew about it; it was no secret. What Buchanan did not know, however, was that when the affair came to an end, Ms Hastings made very serious allegations of harassment against Alan Jones.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="90421-0012.htm_para24"><a name="090421138000017">Obviously, engaging in such harassment is a sackable offence. The allegations had to be dealt with by a confidential panel of elected members, including Councillor Cathy Bakewell, the lady who led the council at the time. The panel did not reach a quick conclusion; everything was delayed because Mrs. Bakewell was taken seriously ill halfway through. These things happen. Paul Buchanan was then deputised to take on many of her responsibilities, but Cathy Bakewell never told him about the Alan Jones inquiry. Alan Jones, however, did tell him&#151;and in lurid detail. Perhaps he wanted to curry favour with the man most likely to be the next leader of the county council. Until that moment, Paul Buchanan was unaware of any allegations and did not know about the confidential panel either; he was not even on it. Jones pleaded with Buchanan to help. Buchanan rightly told Jones that he could not. Big mistake: Alan Jones has a long memory and, as we will see, bears grudges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="90421-0012.htm_para25"><a name="090421138000018">By the time Councillor Cathy Bakewell returned to work, it was deemed too dangerous to punish Jones by sacking him. At that time, Jenny Hastings was threatening an industrial tribunal&#151;a very public way of exposing the antics of her erstwhile lover. Meanwhile, the Audit Commission was due to inspect the council. There is nothing like a four-star sex scandal to scupper a council&#146;s chances of an &#147;excellent&#148; four-star rating. Behind closed doors and with the help of ACAS, a deal was sealed to buy off Ms Hastings. It cost &#163;140,000 of taxpayers&#146; money&#151;slightly less than Alan Jones&#146;s annual salary. Somerset county council thought that it had got everyone involved to sign a confidentiality agreement, but it carelessly left at least one person off the list, which is why I know how much she was paid. There were also some very large extra payments. In the next couple of years, millions of pounds were spent on mysterious &#147;staff restructuring&#148; at Somerset county council. Did any of that money help buy the silence of those on the inside who knew the gory details? Were those in the know given golden goodbyes when they retired?</p>

district councils. In my opinion, it was a mad idea, but Mr. Buchanan is a Liberal Democrat, so we have to allow for a certain degree of woolly-headed lunacy. Both Buchanan and Jones also wanted to see improvements in how services were delivered. So, in a peculiar fashion, Jones and Buchanan looked like peas in a pod. Jones was the go-getting chief executive, albeit with a weakness for women; Buchanan was business-savvy and energetic. What a team! Except that the go-getting chief executive much preferred compliant pussycat politicians who sit quietly in the corner and purr when officers tell them what to do. Mr. Buchanan had a failing: he was apt to ask too many questions. Furthermore, he came equipped with a brain.</p>

Its computer system does not work, it cannot place orders or pay bills and it is certainly not saving any money. Southwest One is the dubious end product of Alan Jones&#146;s desire radically to improve services&#151;mad. The Jones philosophy is &#147;anything goes&#148;, which explains how he was able to hire the wife of Avon and Somerset&#146;s chief constable to set it all up. Sue Barnes became Somerset&#146;s project director without any kind of formal interview. Her hubby, Colin Port, is now on the board of Southwest One. Funny old world, isn&#146;t it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="90421-0013.htm_para3"><a name="090421138000024">Paul Buchanan was involved in assessing the merits of the commercial bidders back in 2006. He was, after all, deputy leader and he knows a thing or two about business. There were three rivals: Capita, which, as we all know, is a big player in local government; British Telecom, for which Alan Jones got a consultancy in Somerset; and IBM. With millions at stake, such companies spend hundreds of thousands of pounds polishing their bids. They twitch if anyone speaks out of turn because there is so much at stake.</p>

My sources in the industry tell me that IBM was badly rattled. It had heard rumours that Alan Jones had been singing the praises of BT during a late-night drinking session at a conference of chief executives. I forgot to mention that Mr. Jones likes to unwind with a glass in his hand&#151;but this time, unfortunately for him, he was overheard. Sue Barnes and Paul Buchanan, to their credit, had to pour oil on IBM&#146;s troubled waters; otherwise, the whole project would have gone belly up.</p>

in the leader of the Lib Dems on the Local Government Association as a kind of mediator. Bad call. That particular individual, Richard Kemp from Liverpool&#151;Jones&#146;s home town; they may even be mates&#151;is known in Liberal circles as the Jackal. Assassination is his speciality, and Jones went to London to give him ammo&#151;signed statements from people in and around Jones&#146;s office alleging Buchanan&#146;s &#147;unspeakable&#148; behaviour. Jones is a bully; his staff probably signed those statements in their own blood, for all I know.</p>

Chief executives, I had always thought, are meant to leave politics to the politicians, but at Somerset county council, with a weak leader on her way out, anything goes for Mr. Jones.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="90421-0013.htm_para7"><a name="090421138000028">The Jackal came to Somerset with a cunning plan: if Buchanan quietly resigned as deputy leader, promised to shut up and be a good boy, and accepted &#147;mentoring&#148; from Jones and the Jackal, then the charges would be dropped. Mr. Buchanan was not playing. If he had agreed to the Jackal&#146;s plans, he would have been accepting his own guilt&#151;and, as we all know, he was not guilty of anything except swearing, once, under his breath. Mr. Buchanan suggested another mentor, a far more respected and accomplished figure&#151;the former leader of Somerset county council, Sir Chris Clarke. Mentoring in local government is a semi-official process. A contract is drawn up between one of the major local government quangos and the council involved. Somerset did agree to sign up Sir Chris to mentor Paul Buchanan, but that did not stop Jones&#146;s campaign to destroy the man.</p>

He said:</p>

Paul Buchanan is still a Liberal Democrat, but his party will not have him as a council candidate in Somerset. He has been stitched up and, I am afraid, let down. The Liberal Democrats emerge from this sordid affair as weak-willed, mealy-mouthed and yellow&#151;that is their party colour, after all. Alan Jones emerges as precisely what he is&#151;a busted flush. Chief executives have a duty to behave like officers and, I would say, gentlemen.

 It is right that I should not be able to intervene in individual cases, as that guarantees the impartiality of the conduct regime and investigation process. Although I am happy to discuss the work of the Standards Board for England and the Adjudication Panel in general terms, I will not comment on or engage in debate about any specific ongoing case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="90421-0013.htm_para22"><a name="090421138000052">As the debate&#146;s title suggests and as the hon. Gentleman outlined, the case concerns Councillor Paul Buchanan, a former deputy leader of Somerset county council, but given that the Adjudication Panel is due to convene shortly to determine the outcome of several outstanding allegations, I will not comment on it. However, I should like to address briefly the conduct regime and the two points that the hon. Gentleman raised with which I can deal specifically later in my short speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="90421-0013.htm_para23"><a name="090421138000053">In this country, we have naturally high standards of probity, accountability and objectivity&#151;expectations of behaviour that demand a serious, reasonable, robust and fair conduct regime. It must be fair to the public and to all in public life. That applies equally to those elected to local authorities and to Members of Parliament. It is worth remembering that the conduct regime was introduced in the Local Government Act 2000 to promote high standards of ethical behaviour by local authority members. It gave a clear ethical framework for local authority members to work within, and made clear to the electorate the standards of behaviour that they could expect from those whom they voted into office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="90421-0013.htm_para24"><a name="090421138000054">In 2007, a revised model code of conduct for local authority members was issued, which was yet clearer, simpler and more proportionate. It removed barriers to members&#146; ability to speak up for those they represent, for example, on planning and licensing issues, and has been well received by local government. All local authorities have followed it in their own codes, by which their members must abide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="90421-0013.htm_para25"><a name="090421138000055">In May 2008, the Government fulfilled their White Paper commitment, as recommended by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, to introduce a more locally based conduct regime for members and co-opted members of local authorities in England. Devolving responsibility for conduct issues to local authorities provides them with greater ownership of the conduct regime and local conduct issues, and boosts their role in promoting and maintaining a culture of high standards of behaviour. That belief is shared throughout the local government world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="90421-0013.htm_para26"><a name="090421138000056">The Standards Board for England, which until that point had been responsible for investigating alleged breaches of the code of conduct, has assumed its new role as the strategic regulator of local authority standards committees, responsible for monitoring their performance and issuing guidance on the conduct regime. The Standards Board continues to investigate the most serious allegations of misconduct.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="90421-0013.htm_para27"><a name="090421138000057">Let us be clear: the regime accords with the recommendations of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, including the recommendation to establish a more locally based decision-making regime for  <br>

investigating and determining all but the most serious misconduct allegations, but with the Standards Board at the centre of the revised regime with a new strategic, regulatory role to ensure consistency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="90421-0013.htm_para28"><a name="090421138000058">The hon. Gentleman referred to serious allegations. It is a sad fact of political life that disagreement about issues can occasionally spill out of the correct channels for resolution and take on the form of remarks or accusations that suggest personal enmity. It is good to hear forthright views expressed vigorously&#151;healthy debate is good for a healthy democracy and ensures that issues are thoroughly and publicly examined. That is true, whether in the Chamber, a council meeting or a parish hall. To some extent, we can also expect public figures to comment on issues in a private capacity&#151;we are familiar with examples of that from our national and local media. For example, councillors with opposing views clearly express their opinions in the letters column of local newspapers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="90421-0013.htm_para29"><a name="090421138000059">As modern media have developed, so have the great opportunities that they afford for communication; indeed, the hon. Gentleman referred to his website. That is one of the reasons why my Department recently consulted on proposed changes to the code of recommended practice on local authority publicity. We want to remove barriers to communication between councillors and those whom they serve, by allowing, for instance, the local authority to host a councillor&#146;s blog. However, with that freedom comes responsibility. There is no place in political debate for making hurtful, potentially damaging and unfounded accusations. That is why we take bringing the office of a councillor into disrepute so seriously and why doing so constitutes a breach of the local authority members&#146; code of conduct.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="90421-0013.htm_para30"><a name="090421138000060">The other point that the hon. Gentleman made was about using the conduct regime as a political weapon. I am not insensitive in this context to the allegation that unscrupulous individuals may consider that the conduct regime can be used maliciously as a political weapon. I am conscious of that threat, but when we consider steps to halt what some might consider to be obviously false allegations intended to waste time and resources, we must take great care to ensure that in so doing we do not gag legitimate allegations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="90421-0013.htm_para31"><a name="090421138000061">Before the new regime, it was for the Standards Board for England to assess, and if necessary investigate, the some 3,500 allegations made about the behaviour of councillors every year. Under the devolved regime, the Standards Board investigates only the most serious allegations. One of the concerns raised by the hon. Gentleman was about delay. Indeed, the facts of the delay are a source of serious concern. The Standards Board has a target of completing 90 per cent. of its cases within six months; he mentioned a period of two years and explained why there had been unfortunate problems in the case. The 90 per cent. target is a challenging target, but he will be interested to know that last year the Standards Board did not just meet it, but exceeded it, completing 96 per cent. of cases on target.</p>

Investigations can become protracted for a number of reasons. Some cases are complex and require the collection of evidence from a number of witnesses. In addition, fresh evidence may come to light during the  <br>

investigative process. We must also consider the fact that, unfortunately, the investigation can be protracted owing to malicious behaviour on the part of the subject or subjects of the allegation, or perhaps others who have reason to fear its outcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="90421-0014.htm_para1"><a name="090421138000063">Let me turn to the issue of misconduct. The Adjudication Panel for England, the Standards Board for England and the standards committees of local authorities are all part of a conduct regime underpinned by the local authority members&#146; code of conduct. The code makes it clear to councillors and their communities what might constitute a personal or a prejudicial interest, for example, and it addresses issues such as gifts and hospitality, which are clearly not relevant to this case. However, the code also addresses fundamental issues of behaviour and conduct.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="90421-0014.htm_para2"><a name="090421138000064">Founded upon the seven principles of public life, the code states, for instance, that councillors must not abuse their position as councillors and that they must not disclose confidential information in an inappropriate manner. The code directly addresses matters more fundamental still&#151;not just those that are fundamental to public life, but principles so fundamental that I hope that we would all strive to meet them unconsciously in everyday life. The code explicitly states:</p>
<a name="90421-0014.htm_brev0"><a name="090421138000080"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;You must treat others with respect&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="90421-0014.htm_para3"><a name="090421138000065">and says:</p>
<a name="90421-0014.htm_brev1"><a name="090421138000081"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;You must not...bully any person&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="90421-0014.htm_para4"><a name="090421138000066">or &#147;intimidate any person&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="90421-0014.htm_para5"><a name="090421138000067">Let us take bullying as the most obvious example. Bullying, I hope we can all agree, is unacceptable. It does not matter whether bullying happens in the playground, the workplace, the Chamber or the barracks&#151;any civilized society rejects it. That is why bullying is in the code&#151;because it is a serious issue when it happens between individuals, damaging people, and because it is a serious matter when it happens in a local authority, damaging the working of the authority and, potentially, confidence in democracy if exposed, and the delivery of services if not. Simply put, unacceptable behaviour is not tolerated. Those who are guilty of misconduct are investigated and sanctions are brought against them. The conduct regime, underpinned by the members&#146; code, will ensure that that continues to be the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="90421-0014.htm_para6"><a name="090421138000068">The hon. Gentleman raised the question whether the Government should allow standards committees to investigate, for example, allegations against local authority officials such as chief executives. He will be pleased to know that we recently held a consultation on whether there should be a model code of conduct for local authority officials, just as there is one for local authority members. We are currently considering the more than 1,000 responses to the consultation that we have received. The consultation included proposals to transport some aspects of the members&#146; code to senior officials. The code will form part of an employee&#146;s terms and conditions of employment and could be used in any disciplinary procedures. I should just add that whether the standards committees or other bodies should have the authority to enforce the code is an issue on which we shall consult.</p>

Minister give an indication of the time scale involved? I know that we are in the middle of the consultation, but he must have a thought in the back of his mind as to when this will happen. It is extremely important in trying, as it were, to even things out on both sides.</p>

 I think it is important to have political consensus in this area. I do not wish to make cheap political points, but the hon. Gentleman will be aware that his party is committed to abolishing the Standards Board, so the idea of having a parallel system for senior officials would obviously not work if the Standards Board regime were abolished. I am keen to move forward as soon as possible. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s example is not the only example of allegations&#151;these are allegations&#151;against senior officials, and the issue of public confidence is important.</p>

Gentleman will be aware that, in the meantime, it is open to the employers of senior officials to take disciplinary action if they have breached express or implied terms in their contracts of employment. I nevertheless understand the point that he has raised and the sense of urgency, as we do not want examples of serious allegations against senior officials not being taken seriously or not being considered by a similar code.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90421-0014.htm_para8"><a name="090421138000072">Before concluding, I want to address another issue that the hon. Gentleman raised&#151;Southwest One. My Department has no formal involvement in the development of Southwest One, but if allegations of corruption are made, they should clearly be viewed as a criminal matter requiring the involvement of the police. If there is any evidence of corruption in this case, it should be turned over the Serious Fraud Office.</p>

that there has been a desperation to do a deal for procurement, which neither side disagrees with. We agree in the House that efficiency is right. It is the undue haste and the way it was set up that has been the problem, but there is nothing criminal about that. It is just that the procedures were not followed and when somebody said, &#147;Look, this is wrong,&#148; they sacked him. Another illustration is that the union leader, Nigel Behan, who has also tried to lead on this, has been fired as well. He is seeking reinstatement at the moment, so the issue has deepened, but there is no criminal intent.</p>

 Let me conclude. I recognise that investigations into allegations of misconduct impact on reputations, careers and lives; they are not undertaken lightly. I recognise, too, that there are those who would try to twist the conduct regime&#151;which is intended to give councillors an ethical framework to work within and to give the public a clear expectation of the standards of behaviour they can expect from those they voted for&#151;for their own ends. I believe that the conduct regime is robust, reasonable and proportionate and that it provides a framework to work within and an enforcement method to address those who are guilty of misconduct, so helping to maintain confidence in democracy.</p>
