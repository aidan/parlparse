<p><a name="qn_o0">2. <a name="60327-01_wqn0"><b> Mr. Peter Bone  (Wellingborough)</b> 
 (Con): What progress has been made in discussions with the United States about the joint strike fighter. [60957]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60327-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence  (Mr. Adam Ingram): </b> 
 We continue to make good progress with the US to ensure that the UK&#039;s military and industrial requirements for the joint strike fighter programme will be met. In the past 10&nbsp;days, there have been no fewer than three meetings on those very issues with the Senate Committee on Armed Services, involving the Secretary of State and my noble Friend Lord Drayson, the Minister for Defence Procurement; one took place in Washington and two in London. Following those discussions, we remain optimistic that we will be in a position to sign a production, sustainment and follow-on development memorandum of understanding in December, as planned.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60327-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bone: </b> 
 Does the Minister really believe that the joint strike fighter will ever enter service? If so, when will it do so, and by how much will it be over budget?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60327-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Yes, I do, and it will be on programme.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="60327-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Lindsay Hoyle  (Chorley)</b> 
 (Lab): Of course my right hon. Friend is aware of the need to ensure that the contract goes ahead, but as part of that contract we need to see final assembly for the north-west and full heavy

<br>&nbsp;<br>maintenance in the United Kingdom. Those are the reassurances that we need, as well as the hope of a short take-off and vertical landing version of the joint strike fighter. Can my right hon. Friend enlighten the House on what progress has been made?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60327-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I would love to be able to enlighten my hon. Friend, but no final decisions have yet been made on the points that he raises.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60327-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Michael Jack  (Fylde)</b> 
 (Con): On the basis of a briefing that I received from our embassy in Washington, may I record my appreciation for what Lord Drayson has done by way of representation on Capitol Hill?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">While the Minister pursues his objective of ensuring that the memorandum of understanding is signed in November, what steps are being taken to bring the armed forces committee and the House of Representatives on side? They appear still to be the ultimate logjam.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60327-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I know that the right hon. Gentleman has taken a close interest in the matter, and that senior members of his party were present during the representations made in Washington. All the representations are being made as strenuously, as pointedly and, I believe, as constructively as we can make them. Every effort will be made to ensure that that continues, and I know that the right hon. Gentleman will take the opportunity to express his view to those in Washington with whom he is in contact.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60327-01_spnew6"><b> Sarah McCarthy-Fry  (Portsmouth, North)</b> 
 (Lab): Does the Minister agree that the decision by the United States to cancel the development and construction of the second engine, apart from delivering a blow to British jobs, was shortsighted? In creating competition by developing two engines, we could have driven down costs in the whole project and secured a better engine design.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60327-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 That was an important part of our earlier approach, and we still believe that it would confer added enhancement and benefits to the programme. We will continue to make that view known. It was raised when my noble Friend Lord Drayson met the US Senate Committee on Armed Services about 10&nbsp;days ago, and we continue to raise it, along with all the other representations that we make about the need for transfer of the technology.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60327-01_spnew8"><b> Nick Harvey  (North Devon)</b> 
 (LD): I commend the robust attitude that Ministers are taking on the issue of technology transfer, but may I ask how much money has been spent on the programme so far, and what conditions were established at the outset in relation to technology transfer? Clearly we are talking about huge sums, and I presume that the Government must have included some guarantees in the original agreement that they negotiated.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60327-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I do not have the precise figure to date, but I can say from memory that it is about $1&nbsp;billion. I will write to the hon. Gentleman with a more up-to-date figure.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 525</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">The other issue that has been raised is &quot;Government to Government&quot;. We have very good relations with the United States Administration, although obviously we have differences with them as well, and express ourselves forcefully when those differences arise. When agreements are reached, they are reached by two mutual and close partners. I do not see the worries that the hon. Gentleman is trying to raise. I know that there is a bit of anti-Americanism in certain parts of politics today; I think that that is to be regretted, and that it detracts from what we are seeking to do.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60327-01_spnew10"><b> Dr. Liam Fox  (Woodspring)</b> 
 (Con): I am sure that the Minister would agree that the JSF is the best aircraft for the roles that are currently envisaged, and that defence technology transfer should not be an issue, given the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intelligence co-operation and nuclear weapon technology exchange between the UK and the US. Does he also agree that failure could drive the UK into further European procurement that is not, in this instance, in the strategic interests of either the UK or the United States?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_o2">Does the Minister understand the fears of the United States about the leakage of defence technology? Would he care to reflect on the damage done by today&#039;s news that 41&nbsp;German companies are being investigated over sales of equipment and technology to Iran for potential use in its nuclear programme, and the impact that that will have on Capitol Hill?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60327-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his efforts, particularly during his visit to Washington, in trying to ensure that we do what is required to take this programme forward. We have made it clear that we want to win the contract on the proposed basis and we are making every effort to achieve that. The US Administration&#151;and, indeed, beyond that&#151;well understand the strength of our case, but it does not help to point out that other nations are allegedly involved in things that they should not be doing, as such a claim has been the basis of press reports. Clearly, there are some concerns within the US about this matter. As I said in my earlier answer to the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey), the issue will be settled on the basis of the good relationship that exists between very close allies and partners. If we strike the deal that we want, I am sure that every aspect will be honoured on both sides of the relationship.

<p><a name="qn_o1">3. <a name="60327-01_wqn1"><b> Mr. Iain Wright  (Hartlepool)</b> 
 (Lab): What progress he has made with his plans for the veterans badge now that the one year trial period has come to an end. [60958]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60327-01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Don Touhig): </b> 
 I can confirm that, following the trial, which proved its popularity, we will continue to issue the veterans badge to service leavers. I can also tell the House that more than 200,000&nbsp;badges have been issued to date and eligibility to apply will be extended to all qualifying veterans as soon as it is practicable to do so, so that all generations can have the privilege and honour of wearing it.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 526</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60327-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Wright: </b> 
 Of all the issues that I have dealt with during my time in the House the veterans badge has had the greatest impact in respect of take-up among constituents&#151;and rightly so. Will the Minister expand on his answer and tell us what plans he has to extend the scope of the badge to other campaigns&#151;perhaps to include widows of veterans, too?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60327-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced on 13&nbsp;February that we will extend eligibility to veterans who served in our forces up to 31&nbsp;December 1959. They are now able to apply for the veterans badge. I can tell my hon. Friend that those eligible to apply for it are members of the armed forces, the merchant navy, the Home Guard, the Polish forces and the UK command in the Cyprus Regiment. The badge can also be awarded posthumously to widows who are in receipt of a service pension. I have letters almost every day from people across the country who are hugely grateful for the opportunity to wear the badge. It was a fantastic idea that has been a huge success and it demonstrates how much the whole House and the whole nation value our veterans.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60327-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. John Randall  (Uxbridge)</b> 
 (Con): While I recognise that, is not the present position unfair to people who served the country during the last war, but who were precluded from joining the armed forces because they had to work in reserved industries and other such areas? If it is inappropriate to give them a veterans badge, does not the Minister believe that something should be done to reward people who served their country well, but not necessarily in the armed forces?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60327-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 Our success in prosecuting and winning the last war was the result of the whole nation&#039;s efforts, and I am sure that the whole House recognises that. Our responsibilities, however, relate to those who served in His Majesty&#039;s armed forces at the time. That is why the veterans badge is awarded in the way that it is. I am aware of the contribution of the Bevin boys, the land army and others and I understand that some people believe that they should also qualify&#151;a matter for my ministerial colleagues in other Departments as well as me&#151;but I certainly share the sentiment behind the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point.

 (Lab): What guidelines he has laid down for the procurement of the tartan material required for the production of the new Royal Regiment of Scotland kilts. [60959]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60327-02_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence  (Mr. Adam Ingram): </b> 
 Procurement of kilts for the Royal Regiment of Scotland will be carried out under public procurement regulations, which are applicable under United Kingdom and European Union law. Sourcing the tartan will be the responsibility of the successful bidder. Award of the contract for the kilts will be based on a thorough assessment of quality and technical standards as defined by the user, as well as on cost in order to ensure best value for money for the taxpayer.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 527</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="60327-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. McGovern: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for his response and for the correspondence that he sent me on this matter. However, there remains considerable concern in Scotland that the new tartan might well be manufactured outwith Scotland, possibly in eastern Europe. On this, the very day before the official formation of the new Royal Regiment of Scotland, will the Minister assure the House that, just as Jersey potatoes must come from Jersey and Newcastle brown ale from Newcastle, the new Scottish tartan for the new Scottish regiment will be manufactured in Scotland?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="60327-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I know that my hon. Friend is trying valiantly on this issue, but we are constrained by European regulation. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Perhaps I should explain that the current prime contractor for the kilts is based in England.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="60327-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. James Gray  (North Wiltshire)</b> 
 (Con): I am astonished by the Minister&#039;s last remark. My understanding is that the firm of John Noble and Co., in Peebles, has made the kilt for the British Army in Scotland since the late 18th century, and that the contract is for 5,000&nbsp;kilts at a cost of &#163;300,000. The Minister must appreciate that the Scottish soldier&#039;s kilt has always been made in Scotland. It is made there now by John Noble and Co., and surely the Minister can see that both its weaving and manufacture should continue to be done in Scotland.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="60327-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 On a point of accuracy, Robert Noble and Co. makes the tartan, the prime contractor is a Yorkshire-based company and a company in Alexandria manufactures the kilts. The contract, which is a &#163;1&nbsp;million contract for 5,000&nbsp;kilts, will go out to tender. There will be a repeat contract for 300&nbsp;kilts each year. The material in question is not being changed; it is already in use. We are simply standardising the use of a material that used to apply only to certain officers throughout all the ranks.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="60327-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Gordon Prentice  (Pendle)</b> 
 (Lab): Army kit that used to be made in Lancashire is now being made in China. It is simply unacceptable for the tartan for Scottish kilts to be sourced from Shanghai or any place in eastern Europe, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. McGovern) suggests.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="60327-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I do not know whether that was a question. There were a number of bidders for the contract to which my hon. Friend refers and, from memory, they all outsourced outside the United Kingdom for the material and its manufacturing. Indeed, the company that previously had responsibility for the manufacture of the uniform in question&#151;it was one of the two main competitors in the bid&#151;was also seeking to outsource in China.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="60327-02_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Don Touhig): </b> 
 We recognise that many service personnel and their families need assistance with, and advice on, housing matters. Through the Joint 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 528</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Service Housing Advice Office, we provide comprehensive advice on housing options and, in some cases, assistance with housing placement where personnel are about to return to civilian life. In addition, we work closely with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, ex-service charities and other specialist services to help identify those who might be at risk of homelessness.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="60327-02_spnew6"><b> Mrs. Dorries: </b> 
 The situation that servicemen and women find themselves in before discharge has been highlighted by my serving constituent, Mr. Nick Cowan. Housing associations are able to step in only when such people are officially declared homeless&#151;28&nbsp;days before discharge&#151;and charities are left to pick up the pieces. The JSHAO to which the Minister just referred provides only advice, not, as he stated, assistance. Is this the way to repay loyal servicemen and women?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="60327-02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 I am of course familiar with the case that the hon. Lady mentions; she has corresponded with me about it and I have answered some of her questions. I do not doubt her commitment to her constituent and the hard work that she has done on this issue, but I suggest that she look at her website, on which she says that one of her priorities is opposing the Government&#039;s &quot;damaging&quot; house building plans. Well, we have to have houses to house people in the first place; nevertheless, she makes an important point. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Lady will listen, I will give an answer. We have been working across the board to try to deal with these issues but, as she knows, questions of housing priority are often a matter for local housing authorities. The council in the area represented by my right hon. Friend the Minister of State gives housing priority to those who have served in the armed forces, and I urge councils throughout the country to think on that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="60327-02_spnew8"><b> Mr. Mark Harper  (Forest of Dean)</b> 
 (Con): When a member of the armed forces is discharged and is looking for a roof over their head, they are at a disadvantage in gaining access to social housing. No matter how long they have been based in a particular area, their residence does not establish a local connection in the eyes of many councils, although there are honourable exceptions. Effectively, such people are treated in the same way as those who are resident in prisons. Why, in the light of the Minister&#039;s concerns, have Ministers from the Ministry of Defence and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister not met to discuss the local housing connection?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="60327-02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 I can tell the hon. Gentleman that we have ongoing discussions with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister so that we can overcome some of the problems, but as I pointed out a moment ago the allocation of priority housing is a matter for local housing authorities. When I was a young councillor in my 20s, my council gave priority housing to key workers and those who had served in our forces. We understand the problems experienced by those who have served in our forces as they move into civilian life and we do everything possible to make sure that the transition is smooth. We give every support that we possibly can, but often people want to be housed in an area to which the local authority feels that they have no particular links or

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 529</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>connection so they do not receive priority. We shall do all that we can to bring the matter to the attention of the Local Government Association and others. At present, the LGA is run by a member of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party, so he might care to make representations to the association to urge local authorities across Britain to give priority to our ex-servicemen and women who apply for housing.

Is it the Secretary of State&#039;s understanding that the United Kingdom maintains a duty of care for such people even after they have been handed to the Afghan authorities?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o34"><a name="60327-02_spnew13"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 Obviously, the British authorities&#039; duty of care is primarily while people are in their custody, which is, as the right hon. Gentleman said, for only a limited period.

What I do not necessarily accept are the views of the group to which the hon. Gentleman referred. As he will know, it campaigns for the legitimising of the production of opium and drugs on the grounds that they could be used for medicinal purposes. We have considered that, but we do not believe that it is viable in the present situation in Afghanistan. More importantly, the Government of Afghanistan do not believe that that is viable.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his condolences. The strategic aim of the international security assistance force is not to suppress the insurgents and eliminate the poppy trade. That is the strategic aim of Operation Enduring Freedom, which is the American-led exercise to chase the terrorists and the&nbsp;insurgents. The strategic aim of ISAF is to provide the security umbrella within which the Afghan Government can extend their control, the security forces to protect that democratic control can be built up and the economy can be built up. It is in the course of that that we have to tackle the drugs trade.

<a name="60327-02_para5">
<a name="stpa_o8">I agree with the hon. Gentleman wholeheartedly that in doing that latter task, it is necessary to ensure that if the farmers are, to a greater or lesser extent, dependent on income from narcotics&#151;let us remember that they are Afghan farmers and have nowhere else to go&#151;it would be unwise to remove that income without a replacement income in the short term and a replacement livelihood in the longer term. We would then create not stability, but insurgency. I therefore agree with the hon. Gentleman that that is a very important task in the pursuit of our strategic objectives.

<p><a name="st_o39"><a name="60327-03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Don Touhig): </b> 
 The Ministry of Defence provides direct funding of approximately &#163;95&nbsp;million a year to allow the cadet forces to offer a vast range of personal development and educational opportunities for young people and, with their nationwide reach, act as a genuine force for good, both for the youngsters who join and the communities in which they are based. In addition, the armed forces support the cadet forces with a significant benefit in kind in the form of training facilities, mat&#233;riel and some manpower resources.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o40"><a name="60327-03_spnew0"><b> Ms Johnson: </b> 
 Given the success of project outreach, does my hon. Friend agree that even more encouragement of young people to engage with cadet projects would not only benefit the young people but would fit very well into the Government&#039;s respect agenda?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o41"><a name="60327-03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 I certainly endorse the point that my hon. Friend makes. Indeed, just a week or so ago, on 19&nbsp;March, I had the opportunity to visit an outreach project at Sennybridge. It was a dry and beautiful day. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I should add that there was no rain in the Brecon Beacons on that day, given comments made by Opposition Members. The programme is run by the Army cadet force. It is a project that helps youngsters build confidence and raise self-esteem, and it offers them a positive purpose. Many of them who come from disadvantaged backgrounds certainly benefit from it. Those values are part of the Government&#039;s respect agenda, which we can all endorse. I pay tribute to those people whom I saw that day. They work very hard with those youngsters, some of whom come from difficult backgrounds who saw the programme as a second 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>








<p><a name="st_o43"><a name="60327-03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman refers to one of the most exciting developments in the cadet forces at present. There have been discussions between my Department and officials at the Department for Education and Skills for some time, and we have now extended those discussions to include the Treasury. We hope to announce a series of pilot schemes across the country that will extend the combined cadet force into state schools. We hope that some of the funding will come from the private sector and some from the Government. We have to resolve a number of key issues. Obviously, funding is one of them. We need to identify the schools and ensure that there is appropriate support for the project. We need to ensure that we have enough people to train and take part in those schemes, but we are working very hard, and I hope that, before too long, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence will be able to make a further announcement on the issue.

How can we hope to expand the scheme, which I would love to expand, if we cannot find ways to encourage more adults to help those youngsters in a very important part of their development?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o45"><a name="60327-03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important point. We now have 3,300&nbsp;units across the country, with 130,000&nbsp;cadets and 23,000&nbsp;adult volunteers, but I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the House recognise the fact that the success of the whole cadet movement is dependent on the ability to attract and retain sufficient adult instructors who are willing to take part. As part of the work that we are now undertaking with the Department for Education and Skills and the Treasury, we hope to address this matter so that we can take forward the agenda. We recognise the difficulties and shortfalls, and it is a major objective of ours to try to correct them.

 I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the precise figures to break down the &#163;95&nbsp;million that we give to our cadet forces.

I do not underestimate the great work done by the cadet forces&#151;I pay tribute to them for it&#151;and I am conscious of the fact that we have a responsibility to ensure that they are properly funded. I am actively looking at ways to try to improve that.

<p><a name="st_o51"><a name="60327-03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for keeping on track.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-03_para0">
<a name="stpa_o9">The veterans challenge fund offers &#163;750,000&nbsp;each year to pump-prime projects that support our veterans strategy. During the past 12&nbsp;months, the fund has provided funding for a number of projects, including a study by Manchester university into suicide among veterans, support to the project that seeks to find employment for homeless veterans and advice for those who seek to work with veterans in prison.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o52"><a name="60327-03_spnew12"><b> Edward Miliband: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that answer. Does he agree that the veterans challenge fund can play an important role in helping excellent organisations, such as the Dunscroft branch of the Royal British Legion in my constituency, at whose annual dinner I am speaking, as part of the veterans day celebrations? Does he further agree that all hon. Members have a responsibility to help to promote take-up and awareness of the veterans challenge fund, so that our most vulnerable veterans can get the support that they deserve?


</p>








<p><a name="st_o53"><a name="60327-03_spnew13"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 I am in the happy position of being a Minister who has money to give away. I want to make sure that more and more veterans organisations apply for funding from the challenge fund. Indeed, I spoke at the veterans forum only last week and urged more organisations to apply. I hope that Members on both sides of the House will recognise the important contribution that the challenge fund makes. There are funds available and I urge Members to look for opportunities for organisations that support the veterans agenda in their constituencies to bid for funding. The number to ring is 0800 1692277&nbsp;or they can write directly to me and I will give them the address.

<p><a name="st_o54"><a name="60327-03_spnew14"><b> Tony Baldry  (Banbury)</b> 
 (Con): I am genuinely confused about why that work cannot be done through the Royal British Legion. Will the Minister explain the difference between veterans day and Armistice Sunday? These veterans initiatives are all extremely worth while, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 534</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>but there is scope for some confusion. In a constituency such as mine, it is quite difficult and challenging to find sufficient volunteers to collect for poppy day. There may well be some scope for distraction if we have too many initiatives, rather than concentrating on those that are well established.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o55"><a name="60327-03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 We may be a bit ahead of ourselves: the next question is about veterans day. However, I will respond to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point. We are determined that the 11&nbsp;November commemoration should remain the national commemoration when the country comes together to remember those who gave their lives for the forces in defence of our freedom and way of life. We in no way wish to take from that important and historic event the solemnity that the whole country places on it and we pay tribute to the work done by the Royal British Legion in helping to promote and organise that event, and in particular in promoting poppy day. The purpose of veterans day follows on from last year&#039;s successful veterans awareness week. We wanted to set aside a day every year&#151;we have chosen 27&nbsp;June&#151;on which the whole country can commemorate veterans and celebrate with veterans. That is more a day of celebration and of paying tribute to those who have given a great deal in support and defence of our country. It is quite clearly different from the 11&nbsp;November memorial and that is how we want to keep it.

 The Government&#039;s decision to institute an annual veterans day on 27&nbsp;June provides a major new opportunity to celebrate the enormous contribution that veterans have made to our country. Plans are progressing well for a London event, linked with the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of the institution of the Victoria cross, which will pick up on the qualities of supreme courage shown by those who are awarded that medal.

<br>&nbsp;<br>of events to commemorate veterans day. It is important that we recognise that veterans come in all ages, shapes and sizes. In Newcastle recently, when I did a radio interview about the advertising campaign that we were launching for the Veterans Agency, it was put to me that veterans are generally people who fought in the last war, but I was alongside a veteran who was in her 30s and had two young children. Veterans come in all ages, shapes and sizes and have made a huge contribution to our country. I hope that veterans day this year will raise awareness across the country that a veteran is someone who has served in our armed forces. Some 23,000&nbsp;people leave our armed forces every year and they should be honoured as veterans as much as anybody else.

 Yes, of course I will. Indeed, I invite colleagues on both sides of the House to come forward with ideas.

I pay tribute to the organisation to which my hon. Friend refers. If he would like to get in touch with me directly, I will do everything I can to help the commemorations and celebrations in his constituency.

 I had to answer such a question about St.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David&#039;s day when I was a Wales Minister. It is a problem, but there are no plans to make veterans day a public holiday. However, I would say that we see this as a process, not an event. We think that the day will evolve year after year. We will stick to commemorating and celebrating veterans on 27&nbsp;June, and I have no doubt that in time there will be a great many events throughout the country that will lead us to celebrate and cherish what our veterans have done. Who knows? At some time in the future the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point might well be on the agenda, but it is not at present.

Does the Minister accept that the Government have received strong support from the Opposition for a whole raft of commemoration events, whether they be for the battle of the Atlantic, or the end of world war two&#151;VE-day and VJ-day? Can he honestly say that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had serious discussions with the Ministry of Defence and the Veterans Agency before making the announcement? The Chancellor did not seem to be aware that there was already an archive of veterans&#039; memories when he talked of children going round with tape recorders recording them&#151;as the Minister knows, the Imperial War museum does that very well. Did the Chancellor realise 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 536</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that, in America, veterans day is the same as Armistice day, and does the Minister accept that veterans day could, to some extent, undermine Armistice day in this country?

<p><a name="st_o65"><a name="60327-04_spnew7"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 On the last point, I do not. As I said earlier, I am very keen that we hold 11&nbsp;November in a special place in the hearts of the whole country as a day on which we solemnly remember those who made a sacrifice for our country to defend the freedoms that we enjoy today. Veterans day is meant as a celebration for veterans of all ages who have served our country at all times in the past.

We have concluded&#151;this was the reason for his announcement&#151;that we will have a veterans day this year. We think that 27&nbsp;June is the appropriate time of year to hold it for various reasons, such as the fact that it is away from 11&nbsp;November and the time at which we celebrate Her Majesty&#039;s official birthday. I hope that everyone will see the day as a significant move forward to recognise our veterans&#039; contributions, support it and do all that they can to make it a success.

 I would not accept the description of a policing role, although my hon.

Rather, we are there to act as a protective military force, protecting not only ourselves but the Afghan Government and those working with them to build their economy, their democracy and their security.

<a name="stpa_o13">There are two elements to our force protection. The first is our force configuration&#151;including air mobile components and Apache helicopters deployed for the first time in action&#151;which was specified by our chiefs as the necessary one to defend our forces. Secondly, we are of course not going into the south of Afghanistan alone: to the east of us will be about 2,500&nbsp;Canadian troops; and to the north in Oruzgan province there will be 1,400&nbsp;Dutch troops, several hundred Australians, and Estonians and troops from the Afghan national army. There are around 9,000&nbsp;troops there, and although I do not for one moment belittle the difficulties and dangers of deployment to the south, I am satisfied that, subject always to preliminary operations of our forces on the ground and what they discover, we have the configuration necessary to protect our troops.

I have only conveyed the position presented to me by politicians from a range of backgrounds. Nevertheless, the point is not to argue about the definition of a conflict but to accept that as a result of deliberate provocation and the terrorists&#039; intentional aim to provoke a civil war that is neither imminent nor inevitable there has been an increase in sectarian killings leading to a situation that no one can regard with complacency.

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60327-06_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Margaret Beckett): </b> 
 In my written statement to the House on 16&nbsp;March, I told the House that the Rural Payments Agency had advised me for the first time on 14&nbsp;March that it would no longer be possible to make the bulk of single payment scheme payments by 31&nbsp;March, and that in the light of this unacceptable situation a new chief executive would be appointed. I fully understand and share the anxieties that these events will cause to the farming community, and deeply regret that this unacceptable situation has arisen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_0">I received an initial report from the acting chief executive, Mark Addison, on the situation at the RPA on 21&nbsp;March. There are substantial problems facing the RPA in getting SPS payments out to farmers&#151;much greater than had previously been reported to Ministers. As I know the House and the farming community would expect, speeding up those payments remains the overwhelming priority of Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Ministers and of RPA staff. However, it remains essential that actions taken now in response to these problems are carefully considered but also sure-footed, to avoid making the problems still worse in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_1">Mr. Addison&#039;s report identified some initial steps to take, which should enable us to speed up payments without losing sight of the need to manage properly the disbursement of a large sum of public money. These are the initial steps that I have sanctioned: focusing resources in the RPA on making the 2005&nbsp;payments as fast as is legally possible; removing disproportionate checks from the payment authorisations system to speed up the flow of payments once claims have been validated; prioritising work on the validation of claims to release the maximum value of payments as quickly as possible as opposed to the maximum number of claims, which is an action that will mainly benefit historical customers; centralising key mapping work at the most productive office, Reading; reviewing what further steps can be taken to simplify the process to allow decisions to be made later this week; strengthening the RPA&#039;s capacity in key areas; and changing the RPA&#039;s structure to streamline command and control.

They will also urgently engage with the banks and other key stakeholders. The team at the RPA is central to the success of those steps.

 I remind the House of my entry in the Register of Members&#039; Interests, and I thank the Secretary of State for her answer. In a newspaper produced by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs that landed on the doorstep of every farmer in the country just six days ago, the headline stated, &quot;Full payments on track for farmers&quot;. I hope that the Secretary of State is ashamed that that happened.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_3">As the Secretary of State has rightly said, the first priority in this debacle is to get the money to the farmers who desperately need it. Tens of thousands of decent, hard-working family farmers were promised their payments, which in many cases cover up to one third of their income. In time they will need to stop relying on such payments to support their businesses, but this is the first year of painful transition. Will the Secretary of State tell us how many payments will now be made by the end of March? Exactly when will all the outstanding payments be completed? What is she doing about all the non-validated entitlements, and will she confirm that they will be paid on the same time scale? Will she consider making an interim payment for everyone who cannot receive the full amount by the end of March? That could be done manually, even if the computer cannot cope. The delays are costing the industry &#163;10&nbsp;million to &#163;12&nbsp;million a month. Will the Government repay the interest on any related loan until the RPA issues the payment? Will the Secretary of State seek a derogation from the EU to delay the 15&nbsp;May deadline for next year&#039;s applications? The RPA should not be sending out next year&#039;s forms instead of last year&#039;s money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_4">We also need to know how the crisis arose. Given the continuing mapping problems and other issues, the crisis was obvious to us all, yet throughout those months the Government told us that we were scaremongering and that the targets would be met. In January Lord Bach told the Oxford farming conference that 96&nbsp;per cent. of payments would be made by the end of March. In the same month, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee report stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;The Committee is dismayed at the complacency of Defra Minister, Lord Bach, who refused to admit that any mistakes had been made or that anything could have been done differently to avoid the problems.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_5">Lord Bach called that report &quot;shoddy&quot; and said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;I am deeply disappointed with the timing of this report which could create unfounded alarm and uncertainty in the farming community.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-06_para9">
<a name="stpa_6">On 2&nbsp;February the Secretary of State told this House that the 96&nbsp;per cent. target would not be met. Three days later, Lord Bach told me in a letter that he still expected &quot;the bulk of payments&quot; to be made, although he went on to tell <i>Farmers Weekly</i> that &quot;the bulk&quot; meant more than 50&nbsp;per cent. Just a month ago the Secretary of State told the National Farmers Union conference:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;Having demonstrated last week that its systems are working as planned, the RPA is now in the process of authorizing payments&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="stpa_7">That is some plan!

<p>
<a name="60327-06_para11">
<a name="stpa_8">If Ministers were misled by the chief executive of the RPA it is right that he should go, but that does not absolve Ministers from this catalogue of incompetence

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 545</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and ministerial denial. This House and the industry are entitled to an apology, because the chain of accountability reaches the top. It was the Secretary of State who decided, rightly, to introduce a complicated hybrid scheme, but then opened it up to 48,000&nbsp;new applicants, with 360,000&nbsp;new parcels of land that had not previously been receiving support. Then, to make it worse, she rammed it into place in the first year of the three-year window&#151;and that is where the problem began. But even Germany and Denmark, which also have hybrid schemes, paid almost all their farmers months ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-06_para12">
<a name="stpa_9">Sacking a civil servant is not the end of the matter. Ministers knew that there was a problem because they reduced the targets, but they appear to have done nothing until I challenged the Prime Minister two weeks ago. What questions were asked? How many Ministers actually went to the RPA to see what was happening? Did nobody have the gumption to ask why farmers were reporting so many problems? The Government&#039;s usual &quot;blame somebody else&quot; line will not wash. Lord Bach criticised others for saying what was abundantly clear to everybody, but he was wrong. A Minister who truly had his finger on the pulse of farming would have seen this coming and prevented it from happening. He has lost all credibility in the industry for which he is responsible, and he should go. This House and, more importantly, the farming industry deserve better.

I genuinely think that he was quite unjust to my noble Friend Lord Bach, who has spent not just hours but days working on this over many, many months.<i> [Interruption.]</i> I say to the hon. Gentleman, and to the House, that when the scheme was initially being considered and the arrangements were being put in place, a substantial contingency of time was of course built in to allow for any hiccups and difficulties. Over time, that contingency was gradually whittled away. My noble Friend has maintained the closest possible interest, and I, like him, continue to reject any charge that there was complacency on the part of Ministers. Ministers are dependent, as is everyone in the House, on the information that they are given and the confidence that they can place in it. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I simply repeat to the hon. Gentleman what the proposal to us was. We published this more than a year ago; I cannot now recall exactly when, but it was a long time ago. The proposal to us was that the first payments would begin to flow in the week of 20&nbsp;February, and they did. It was after that that the scheme began to break down.

<a name="60327-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_14">There were repeated challenges by Ministers, and repeated demands for harder information about the number of payments that had been made.

 The Secretary of State talks about using up margins of contingency, but surely there is no way of describing the matter other than as a botched introduction of the single farm payment scheme in England.

Will Ministers assure us that they have contacted the principal lending institutions to the farming community and accepted full responsibility for any delays in farmers&#039; payments that may arise through DEFRA&#039;s broken promises?

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60327-07_spnew2"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman drew on the experience of Scotland and Wales, and he is right to say that they have adopted a different system&#151;although initially they made partial payments, and I am not certain whether Scotland is yet making full payments. Wales has begun to do that. However, those systems are not only different but involve a much smaller number of claimants. The hon. Gentleman described the scheme that we introduced in England as &quot;more fancy&quot;; a more accurate term would be &quot;more sustainable&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-07_para10">
<a name="stpa_20">The hon. Gentleman spoke as if it would always be better to pursue the historic system. He is new to the portfolio and will not therefore have the subject at the front of his mind, but under the historic system, people continue, now and for the future, to be paid on the basis of what was received by someone farming the same land between 2000&nbsp;and 2002. That appeared to be neither beneficial in driving farming forward to be receptive to the market, nor something with which taxpayers or farmers would be content for long. There are already rumblings in member states that have maintained the historic system about how unsatisfactory it is. This is not, therefore, a simple black-and-white question of why we did not do what it is claimed would be easier.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-07_para11">
<a name="stpa_21">The hon. Gentleman made a further point, and I was not sure whether it was based on information from the Select Committee report. If it was, I regret that. There is a misunderstanding that the cost of the information technology system is somehow evidence of things going wrong. The RPA was already set to undergo a programme to provide it with new IT. That was the &#163;18&nbsp;million scheme that was initially intended to be put in place. However, that was agreed before the common agricultural policy reform proposals, which obviously resulted in the need not only for a new IT system but for one that would perform a different task. That is why there is a difference, and the two sums involved are not comparable. We are not talking about twice the money for the same scheme changes.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-07_para12">
<a name="stpa_22">The hon. Gentleman also asked about interim payments. I can only repeat what I said earlier to the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice), which is that we continue to keep that matter under review. I shall not be drawn into making forecasts, other than to draw attention to the scale of the payment window. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire referred to

<br>&nbsp;<br>the speech that I made to the National Farmers Union annual conference, at which I said that payments had begun to flow on 20&nbsp;February&#151;as they had&#151;and that I had been advised that, very shortly, some &#163;350&nbsp;million would already have flowed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-07_para13">
<a name="stpa_23">When I saw the chief executive of the RPA on the evening of 14&nbsp;March, however, he told me that only about &#163;60&nbsp;million had been paid by that date. That was the first intimation that DEFRA Ministers had had that those were the figures involved. However, that sum was disbursed over about three and a half weeks. In the period since that date&#151;just over a week of payment days&#151;some &#163;75&nbsp;million has already been disbursed. That is obviously not enough, but it is certainly a big improvement on the previous figures.

I would also say to my hon. Friend, as I should have said to the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) a moment ago, that we are in touch with the banks. They understand that the payment window runs until June, and they have hitherto given us no indication of any difficulties that they had not anticipated.

 As has been said, Scottish farmers have already received their single farm payments. May I assure my right hon. Friend, however, that they derive no satisfaction whatever from the situation in England? They understand, as she does, how vital those payments are to the incomes of working farmers in England. Indeed, she has pointed out that failure to receive them could result in people being pushed above their bank borrowing limit. She has undertaken to keep the House informed of developments. Will she make a statement on the matter after the Easter recess?
</p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="60327-08_spnew6"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b>

 Is the Secretary of State aware that under the old integrated administration and control scheme introduced by the previous Government, each form was dealt with by a single official in a single payment centre? Is she aware that under the new system each form is divided into tasks, so it is not merely shuffled between officials but between centres&#151;at the mercy of a failing computer system, which has managed to wipe off all the hill farm allowance payments for my constituency? Can we not revert to a system that gives the farmer accountability and the official efficiency, and liberates us from the tyranny of the computer?

 I always listen with great care to the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s observations, and frequently find great wisdom in them. I assure him that one of the reasons Ministers decided to commission a long-term review of the RPA&#151;although we had not announced it&#151;was our considerable concern that although there is no doubt that the organisation is customer-focused in that the staff care about their customers and are working hard and trying to do their best, its systems are not remotely customer-focused. That is one of the issues that I hope that we will address, perhaps even in the short term.

<p><a name="st_16"><a name="60327-08_spnew9"><b> Helen Goodman  (Bishop Auckland) (Lab):</b> 
 Obviously, the situation is most regrettable, and I am grateful to the Secretary of State for the measures that she has announced this afternoon. Will she consider paying interest or financing costs for farmers beyond the end of March, if those arise because of late payments?
</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="60327-08_spnew10"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I cannot give that undertaking&#151;although, as I said, we are keeping the whole position under review, not least because the official payment window runs until the end of June. Although I understand the concerns and anxieties of farmers, my hon. Friend will know that extensive discussions have been held with people&#039;s banks, more are due, and there has been more than a year&#039;s notice that there would be some delay and payment would be made later in the window.

</p>








<p><a name="st_19"><a name="60327-08_spnew12"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I assure the House, and the right hon. and learned Gentleman, that that is being carefully considered. He will understand that there is no wish to do anything that will disrupt the likelihood of the majority of payments going out. I have instructed the acting chief executive that the large number of people who have an almost minuscule entitlement&#151;on the whole, new claimants&#151;should not be his priority. In so far as possible, he should perhaps worry slightly less about some of those for whom the level of the payment might not be a matter of immediate desperate concern. The whole focus of the RPA&#039;s attention should be on those who need the money, about whom the whole House is concerned.

 My hon. Friend has long been a critic of the system of farm support in this country. I know of his concern for ordinary people facing difficulties, however, which he will extend to people in any circumstances. In the longer term, the purpose and effect of the overall reforms of the common agricultural policy introduced in 2003&nbsp;will be to link farmers more closely to the market and, as my hon.

<p><a name="st_27"><a name="60327-09_spnew0"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman can tell them that a bold move was made in the 1980s: the setting up of such things as agencies, which are at one remove from Government and carry out executive tasks. It is an agency that is carrying out this work.
</p>








<p><a name="st_28"><a name="60327-09_spnew1"><b> Mr. John Maples  (Stratford-on-Avon) (Con):</b> 
 But the Secretary of State designed the scheme herself; she did not have to introduce it. She announced it more than a year ago. Now she is saying that it was not until 14&nbsp;March that she was aware of how badly wrong it was going&#151;although many of us had been writing to her for weeks telling her that exactly this was going to happen. If she thinks that her Minister has been doing a good job she had better get a grip on the issue personally, or the payments will not even be made by the end of June.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_24">May I ask the Secretary of State specifically whether the Government will compensate farmers who have had to incur loans and pay interest because of the late payments? May I remind her how fast the Government are to extract interest from their debtors when they are late in paying their taxes?
</p>








<p><a name="st_29"><a name="60327-09_spnew2"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right to observe that Members were saying that the scheme was going badly wrong. Members were saying that payments would not begin on 20&nbsp;February. They were saying that entitlement notices would not be sent out. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am not sure whether those who are groaning attend agriculture questions very often.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_25">Let me simply say to the hon. Gentleman that undoubtedly there were real concerns and anxieties, and that those were reflected at ministerial level. That is why the Minister in particular, and my officials, spent so much time working with the RPA. The fact is, however, that payments did begin when they were intended to, and notices did begin to go out when they were intended to. What did not happen was the dramatic ramping up of the speed of payments that was expected to follow. As late as 10&nbsp;March, the RPA was still insisting to Ministers that more than 51&nbsp;per cent. of payments would be made by the end of March, and 96&nbsp;per cent. would be made by the end of June.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_26">The issue of compensation has been raised before. I have already told the House that the payments window closes in June 2005&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;2006.&quot;] I am sorry, I meant 2006. Farmers are probably even more aware of that than Members.

<br>&nbsp;<br>ministerial responsibility, but if she looks at the report of the debate in Committee on the statutory instrument that set up the Rural Payments Agency she will find that I&#151;along with many others, including some of her hon.

<p><a name="st_31"><a name="60327-09_spnew4"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 If that was five years ago, it was long before the negotiations on CAP reform, for a start. Once the decisions had been made about the form and nature of the scheme, Ministers and stakeholder representatives of the industry spent time with the RPA seeking information and assurances on whether it could indeed handle the scheme within the time frame. Those assurances were given, and given categorically&#151;to the extent that stakeholder representatives and Ministers came back immensely reassured and full of confidence that the RPA could handle the issues.
</p>

<a name="stpa_27">That was the position at the start. It has to some extent been asserted that the Government were warned from the beginning that the RPA could not handle the scheme.

Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight), at Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions on 9&nbsp;March. He has apologised to me in person, but for the benefit of the House it should be placed on the record that his answer was incorrect and misleading in every particular. He said on 9&nbsp;March that most of the payments had been made and that Scottish and Welsh farmers had been paid in full, when in fact no payments had been made to English farmers. Will the Secretary of State take this opportunity to show her awareness of, and willingness to take action on, two related issues? The market in England has been distorted, in that Scottish and Welsh farmers have the cash in hand to pay more for farm animals than English farmers can possibly pay. Secondly, tenant farmers are suffering particular hardship because they have no assets against which to borrow.

Obviously I do not have responsibility for payments there, but I think that the hon. Lady will find that not all payments have been made in full, although they are doubtless proceeding. I entirely take her point about tenant farmers, and I am mindful that they are likely to be the most vulnerable people.

In some states, in contrast to the United Kingdom, unemployment is about 10&nbsp;per cent. and almost one in five young people are without a job.

<p>
<a name="60327-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_29">The British Government know that there is only one way to get Europe back to work and to deliver social justice in a global economy. We base that not on theory but on solid evidence. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of Exchequer pointed out in his Budget speech last Wednesday, in 1996&nbsp;we had the lowest income per head of any of the G7&nbsp;countries; today, we are second only to the United States. We have grown more quickly, created more jobs and provided more social benefits than most other member states. We have done so by liberalising markets, increasing our competitiveness and investing in the future, including in our public services. The European response to globalisation must emphatically not be a return to old-fashioned protectionism, whether by that or any other name.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_30">Specific elements of the Hampton Court agenda were energy, research and development, and universities. The case for a more liberal energy market is overwhelming. Gas and electricity prices in the UK in the period between 1996&nbsp;and 2004&nbsp;fell much faster than they had done in EU states as a whole, which have kept their energy markets closed. Consumers in those countries will thus gain from a functioning internal market, but so too will consumers in this country. We currently do not have the access to gas that we would have in a more sensitised market. One of the first achievements of the Lisbon Agenda back in 2003&nbsp;was the decision to liberalise energy markets by 2007. Last week, the European Council reaffirmed that timetable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_31">Completion of the internal market is one of four elements in a new approach to European energy policy. At the summit, we also agreed the programme relating to the other three areas, which are to intensify diversification of supply, to promote environmental sustainability and, by the next European Council, to develop a strategy for dealing with countries outside the EU. The Council asked the Commission to present a strategic energy review on a regular basis, starting in 2007.

<p>
<a name="60327-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_33">Linked to research and development is the third area: increased investment in universities, where currently only two of the top 20&nbsp;universities in the world are European&#151;both, I should say, are in the United Kingdom. The European Union has to produce enough graduates of the right calibre and improve links between business and universities if we are to open up and prosper in new global markets.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_34">In addition to the Hampton Court agenda, the British presidency had taken forward valuable work on better regulation and on the services directive. There was further progress on both those areas at the Council. The summit tasked the Commission to report by the end of this year on measurable EU targets for removing administrative burdens on business, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, and to press ahead with the reforms undertaken during our presidency, including more simplification of existing EU legislation, further withdrawal of unnecessary or outdated legislation, and more effective use of impact assessments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-10_para7">
<a name="stpa_35">The summit also agreed a way ahead on the services directive. That directive will be of great assistance to British service companies and to opening Europe up properly to a single market in services. The current proposals are not everything that we wanted, but a year ago, some European leaders were declaring the directive dead and buried. It is not and it will represent a significant advance in the process of making Europe globally competitive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-10_para8">
<a name="stpa_36">It is customary that the spring Council concentrates largely on the economic agenda of the European Union. However, all member states shared a deep concern about the recent elections in Belarus and a declaration relating to those elections is attached to the conclusions. We agreed a statement that condemned the actions of the Belarusian authorities in arresting peaceful demonstrators early in the morning of Friday 24&nbsp;March. We restated our view, based on the assessment by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, that the elections were fundamentally flawed. The European Union is now deciding on the restrictive measures that it will take with respect to the Belarusian authorities. The statement makes it clear that President Lukashenko should not escape responsibility. The European Union applauds those who stood up for democracy against the odds and is determined to support civil society and the Belarusian people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-10_para9">
<a name="stpa_37">The situation in Belarus stands in stark contrast to the situation in Ukraine. The OSCE said that yesterday&#039;s elections there had

 Let me try to rattle through that long list of questions. On Belarus, the statement of conclusions spells out that the EU will consider restrictive measures against those responsible. I cannot anticipate precisely what will be decided, but there could be a range of measures, including travel bans and asset freezes. As the right hon.

<a name="stpa_58">On economic reform, the right hon. Gentleman asked me about the comment made by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister at the time of Lisbon. As a matter of fact, I do think that Lisbon has involved a sea change in EU thinking. It is true that the sea is very large and rather thicker than the sea that we are used to and the tanker of the EU is so big that it takes some time to turn round. However, let us take the example of better regulation. Until two or three years ago, the European Commission was simply a machine for producing more and more regulation. The right hon. Gentleman asked me about conversations that I have had with commissioners and others. I have had endless conversations. When I first got this job, I tried to have conversations about ending gold-plating in the Foreign Office and doing the same in Brussels and it was as though I had said something indecent, but these days things are changing. Under G&#252;nter Verheugen, the commissioner with responsibility for better regulation, there has been a big change. Some 68&nbsp;pending items of legislation have been withdrawn. There is a rolling programme to repeal, codify, recast or modify 228&nbsp;further pieces of legislation and more than 1,400&nbsp;related legal acts over the next three years, and much else besides.

 May I take the Foreign Secretary back to what he said about the strategic energy review? Apparently it is said in Moscow that it is not so much remarkable that the EU enlarged eastwards, but that Gazprom enlarged westwards. Does he thus recognise that we must secure safety of supply and, in terms of the internal market, ensure that national cartels do not become European cartels and that there is a genuinely free market?

 I agree with my hon. Friend on both those points. Ensuring a broader diversity of supply was one of the summit&#039;s key conclusions on energy. She is right about national cartels. It is curious that several member states have national energy companies that are highly protective of their own market, while being atavistic when it comes to the acquisition of other energy operators in other markets.

We wanted a decision about 2007&nbsp;energy liberalisation in the conclusions to test, in a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sense, whether European Heads of State and Government around the table were serious about that liberalisation, which is for consumers, not industrial users. It is my judgment that they are, although time will tell. Although sometimes we take three steps forward and two back, overall, including in countries with a protectionist past and present, the move is towards greater liberalisation because the benefits of that are perfectly plain to everyone.

There are &#8364;140&nbsp;million unspent in Brussels for democracy and human rights promotion. Both the Council and the Commission are not very good at that kind of work.

That is an indicator of the policies that will work, which are basically those where there is greater liberalisation as well as good underlying investment, and those that will not work, where there is a high degree of protectionism and a lack of liberalisation in the markets.

 Will the Foreign Secretary show greater urgency in pressing for diversification of gas supplies?

Will he take into account the fact that, as 52&nbsp;per cent. of Gazprom is owned by the Russian Government, any decision by Gazprom to withhold gas from Ukraine, Moldova or any other country must be deemed to have been taken on political, not business, grounds? Will he make it clear to his Russian colleagues that as long as that continues, Russia will not be seen as a reliable partner in energy matters?

 The right hon. and learned Gentleman raises a very important issue. Our own gas supply is not nearly as vulnerable as that of Europe as a whole to just a handful of suppliers and Russian gas supplies are likely to account for only 5&nbsp;per cent. of our supplies, compared with much higher dependency elsewhere in the European Union. However, I accept his overall point. Both the reliance on a few countries and the problems that arose between Russia and Ukraine and the rest of Europe are matters of concern. Energy security will dominate the G8&nbsp;summit in St. Petersburg in the summer, and I know that my right hon.

 There was not, as I recall, discussion on the Palestinian situation in the summit itself. We discussed it earlier in the week, in the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Monday. We will get a better idea of Hamas&#039;s real intentions after the Arab League summit in Khartoum. If Hamas indicates that it supports, even tacitly, the proposals of the then Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia in the Beirut declaration of three years ago, which was in favour of accepting the reality of Israel, there may be a basis for moving forward, but Hamas, as well as the European Union and the international community, has to make moves.

<p><a name="st_81"><a name="60327-14_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Local Government  (Mr. Phil Woolas): </b> 
 With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a statement on council tax for 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and the action that the Government propose to take with regard to local authorities that have set excessive budgets. Figures released today show that, excluding the council tax element of the funding package for the 2012&nbsp;Olympic games, the average council tax increase in England for 2006&#150;07&nbsp;is 4.2&nbsp;per cent. With the council tax element of the Olympics, it is 4.5&nbsp;per cent.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_72">We have a mature working relationship with the Local Government Association. We have worked with the LGA to look at the pressures that councils face in the next two years, and how central and local government can manage those pressures. Under the settlement for 2006&#150;07, which the House approved on 6&nbsp;February, total support for local government, including specific grants, will rise by 4.5&nbsp;per cent. compared with 2005&#150;06. That includes an extra &#163;305&nbsp;million above previous plans. The provisional settlement for 2007&#150;08&nbsp;will provide an increase of a further 5&nbsp;per cent., with &#163;508&nbsp;million above that previously planned. By introducing multi-year settlements, we are enabling authorities to plan ahead more effectively in budgeting for service delivery. We have now provided a framework for authorities to deliver effective local services over the next two years that takes account of the pressures that those authorities face.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_73">By 2007&#150;08, Government grant for local services will have increased by more than the rate of inflation for 10&nbsp;years in succession. That represents an increase of 39&nbsp;per cent. in real terms since 1997. It can be compared very favourably with a real-term reduction of 7&nbsp;per cent. in the four years up to 1997. I also remind the House of the council tax support that the Government provide to those on low incomes. Indeed, 14&nbsp;per cent. of total council tax is paid through council tax benefit. Nobody who is unable to pay is made to pay, and we are working to ensure that all who are eligible do claim the benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_74">Given our significant extra investment of grant, and the continuing scope for efficiency savings, we made it very clear again this year that we expected authorities to budget prudently. It was only with the greatest reluctance, following the 12.9&nbsp;per cent. rise in council tax in 2003&#150;04, that we first made use of our reserve capping powers. However, as we said in our 2005&nbsp;election manifesto, we will use capping to protect council tax payers from excessive increases. There can be no doubt that the recent, more modest increases in council tax could not have occurred without the Government making judicious use of those powers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_75">When we announced the provisional settlement in December, we said that we expected the average increase in council tax in England to be less than 5&nbsp;per cent. for each of the two years 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08. I set that out in a letter to all authorities. Ministers later wrote to those authorities reported to be considering setting increases of more than 5&nbsp;per cent. I also wrote jointly with my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety to all police authorities reaffirming the Government&#039;s expectations.

<a name="stpa_76">I am pleased to report that the overwhelming majority of authorities have responded positively to our messages. Most authorities fully recognise the need to minimise the demands that they place on council tax payers. Regrettably, however, a very small number of them have set excessive budget and council tax increases, and it is for that reason that I am making a statement to the House today about the action that we propose to take.

<a name="stpa_77">I should like to remind hon. Members of the provisions of the capping legislation set out in the Local Government Finance Act 1992, as amended by the Local Government Act 1999. In order to determine whether each authority&#039;s budgeted expenditure as defined in the legislation is excessive, we must compare the authority&#039;s budget requirement for 2006&#150;07&nbsp;with that of the previous year. The legislation also allows us to determine other principles, such as the level of increases in council tax.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_78">This year, the increase in budget requirement for authorities providing education, police and fire services is measured using the alternative notional amounts given in the &quot;The Limitation of Council Tax and Precepts (Alternative Notional Amounts) Report (England) 2006/07&quot;, which the House approved on 6&nbsp;February. Alternative notional amounts are notional figures used for capping purposes to help give a like-for-like comparison of budget requirements between years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_79">Our view is that authorities&#039; 2006&#150;07&nbsp;budgets are excessive if they show, first, an increase of more than 6&nbsp;per cent. in budget requirement compared with 2005&#150;06, and, secondly, if council tax has increased by more than 5&nbsp;per cent. in the same period. As was the case in 2005&#150;06, a single set of principles has been applied to all authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-14_para8">
<a name="stpa_80">Despite the principles being more stringent than in 2005&#150;06, when authorities&#039; budgets were judged excessive if they showed an increase of more than 6&nbsp;per cent. in budget requirement compared with 2004&#150;05&nbsp;and if council tax had increased by more than 5.5&nbsp;per cent, we are proposing to take action against only two unitary authorities this year, compared with 2004&#150;05, when we took action against 14&nbsp;authorities, and 2005&#150;06, when we took action against nine authorities. The two authorities in question are Medway borough council and York city council, which have both set excessive budgets according to the principles that I have described. We are writing to those authorities today, informing them of our decision to designate them with a view to capping them in-year, and notifying them of the maximum budget that we propose to set for them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_81">The authorities have a statutory right to challenge the proposed caps, and they have 21&nbsp;days in which to do so. If they want to challenge, we will carefully consider the information that we have required them to send us, along with any other representations they make, before we take final decisions. We will then either make an order, to be approved by this House, designating the authorities at the level of the proposed maximum budget or another level, or we will withdraw the designation and nominate them instead. Nomination would allow us either to set them notional budgets for 2006&#150;07&nbsp;for future capping comparisons or to cap them in advance for 2007&#150;08.

It is a measure of how great is the council tax burden that the current increase is &#163;4&nbsp;short of being the fourth largest increase that this Government have made in the course of their massive increases in council tax. The current increase is &#163;5&nbsp;more than last year&#039;s increase. The Minister can talk in terms of percentages, but &#163;54&nbsp;is a lot for a hard-working family. As the Chancellor might say, in his own inimitable way, &quot;We have had increases of &#163;59, &#163;50, &#163;49, &#163;54, &#163;75, &#163;126, &#163;65, &#163;47&nbsp;and &#163;54, making a total increase of &#163;579&nbsp;since Labour came to power&quot;&#151;although he would probably have rattled through it much more quickly.

Where does the Minister seriously expect pensioners just above the benefit level to find an extra &#163;254? Can he explain why the &#163;200&nbsp;pensioners&#039; payment has mysteriously disappeared this year? Last year, when council tax had increased by &#163;525&nbsp;since 1997, the Government felt that pensioners needed extra protection. This year, it has increased by &#163;579&nbsp;since 1997, so why do they now feel that pensioners no longer require that protection? The House can only draw the conclusion that that money was a cynical election bribe.

<br>&nbsp;<br>increase for band D is &#163;59, that of Hartlepool is &#163;57&nbsp;and that of North Tyneside is &#163;55. What makes those increases acceptable to the Minister? Why is the highest band D council tax in the country levied in Sedgefield, at &#163;1,490? It has a Labour district council, a Labour county council and, at least for now, a Labour Member of Parliament. Cannot the Minister speak to that spendthrift Member and try to ensure that people in Sedgefield get a fairer deal?

<a name="stpa_95">Every year, the council tax increases. Every year, despite fiddled figures and grant, and wishful figures provided by the Minister, Labour&#039;s tax burden increases and it digs itself further into a hole over council tax. In some parts of the country, Labour will face the consequences in May, but in most parts, the poor council tax payer must face those consequences.

<p><a name="st_83"><a name="60327-15_spnew0"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 First, I thank the hon. Gentleman for his kind initial remarks. Let me deal with his points in the order that he raised them. On extra resources, we have a mature working relationship with the Local Government Association that allows us to make a serious analysis of the pressures that councils say that they face. I have made it clear that the new burdens principle will be implemented, but on the basis of net rather than gross new burdens, and on a shared understanding and analysis of those pressures.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_96">We believe that the exercise leading up to the two-year settlement satisfied the Local Government Association&#039;s major recommendations, either by establishing self-funding regimes in the case of fees&#151;particularly in regard to licensing&#151;or by providing the extra resources that we were able to announce in the settlement. I notice that the hon. Gentleman did not welcome that extra money but, shucks, I guess I will just have to live with that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_97">The hon. Gentleman said that council tax had gone up by 84&nbsp;per cent. I said in my statement that the 12.9&nbsp;per cent. increase some years ago had been unacceptable. It is also true that significantly more resources had been given to local councils in that period. I also mentioned the 39&nbsp;per cent. real-terms increase in Government support for local authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_98">The hon. Gentleman asked about the &#163;200&nbsp;assistance for pensioners, but he failed to mention two important points. One is that about 14&nbsp;per cent. of council tax is now paid through council tax benefit, and that people on full pension credit pay no council tax at all. All right hon. and hon. Members would like to see 100&nbsp;per cent. take-up of council tax benefit, and I would ask Conservative Members to join us in encouraging that take-up, as many Conservative-run local authorities already do. Secondly, the hon. Gentleman ignored the other help that pensioners receive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_99">The hon. Gentleman&#039;s fifth question was about billionaires. I feel that it is only right to ask him what is the Conservatives&#039; actual policy on a property tax. I must remind the House that this property tax&#151;the council tax&#151;was introduced by the Conservatives, and we all remember the circumstances in which that happened&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, I have asked before in the House about their policy on a property tax. Do they have a commitment to a property tax or do they not? They introduced the eight bands in 1991. It would be perfectly possible for them to put a proposal to Sir Michael Lyons&#039; inquiry for an increase in the number of bands, so as to include a billionaires&#039; band. Perhaps they should propose that, but I suspect that they will not.

Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner) is not in his place, but if he were, he would be reading out statements from the special interest group of municipal authorities&#151;SIGOMA&#151;many of which are floor authorities. It is a bit rich of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar to make such an accusation, which I deny outright.

I suspect that the hon. Gentleman is not quite sure whether he would prefer there to be higher council tax increases so that he could blame central Government, or lower council tax increases, for which he would no doubt give the credit to Conservative-run councils&#151;but not Labour ones&#151;in the forthcoming local government election campaign.

It is important that that point is understood.

Underlying all that is the byzantine grant allocation mechanism that he and his colleagues have devised. It might or might not be politically partisan, but it is certainly partisan as between central Government and local democracy, leading to higher council tax, intolerable burdens on pensioners, cuts in services and, today, the ultimate madness, capping by this Government.

<a name="stpa_106">At least the hon. Gentleman&#039;s points, in contrast to those made by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles), are based on a policy. At least he has a policy. It is an unworkable policy, and the wrong policy, but it is a policy. He says that the ability to pay should be the criterion for a local tax. We will wait to see whether such a local income tax proposal emerges from the Liberal Democrats&#039; internal debate. He has made it clear, however, that he believes that local tax should be based on ability to pay. Of course, that ignores all those people in hard-working families, with two or more income earners, who would pay for the difference. I suspect that the &quot;scrap the tax&quot; campaign&#151;indeed, I know it for a fact&#151;does not have details of the costs of the extra local income tax.

 What estimate has the Minister made of the effect of the local government pension scheme on council tax levels in 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subsequent years? Against the background of tomorrow&#039;s industrial action in local councils, is he still hopeful that a settlement can be found that will modernise the pension scheme?

 Yes, I am hopeful, and the Government, as regulator of the scheme, stand ready to facilitate discussions between the employers represented by the LGA and the representatives of members of the scheme, the trade unions. Our policy is that the taxpayer should not be asked to pick up any additional burdens. This is a funded scheme. We have legal obligations to ensure that it is viable and, of course, legal, and we seek to do that in a way that will secure the future of the final-salary pension scheme to the benefit of all employees and of local authorities.

<p><a name="st_94"><a name="60327-16_spnew5"><b> Mr. David Curry  (Skipton and Ripon) (Con):</b> 
 The crisis in social services is bound to be made worse by the formula because of increasing demands from old people&#039;s and, indeed, young persons&#039; services, but that must be seen in the context of the crisis in the NHS as well, owing to increasingly close links between it and social services&#151;links that the Government and most sensible people want. What steps do the Government intend to take to ensure that those two crises do not simply play against each other and cause a steady deterioration in services, both for those who look to the NHS and for those who look to their local councils?

<p><a name="st_95"><a name="60327-16_spnew6"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 Of course the Government recognise&#151;and have recognised in their joint work with the LGA&#151;the pressures faced by social services, particularly services for adults and the elderly. It would be nonsensical to deny the existence of those pressures. But those pressures, the result of largely demographic changes, also apply to central Government, which is why our policy is to ensure that budgets are balanced. Behind the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s question is a paradox. The solution that he seems to offer is further increases in council tax, but if I were to allow them, his Front-Bench colleague, the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar, would no doubt be the first to criticise me. Joint work is required to deal with those very real pressures. Against the background of an increase in the revenue support grant, I must point out that the amount of money going to social services has not been cut, but increased.

<p><a name="st_96"><a name="60327-16_spnew7"><b> Mr. David S. Borrow  (South Ribble) (Lab):</b> 
 May I raise with the Minister the impact of the capping criteria on authorities that have historically had a low council tax, or, in the case of the Lancashire police authority, a low precept? Over a number of years, it has wished to raise its precept to its expenditure and to be in the middle rather than at the bottom of the list of authorities in respect of spending, but it has been unable to do so. That will have a considerable impact over the next few years as a result of the merger of Lancashire police authority and Cumbria police authority, which has a much higher precept. Will the Minister comment on the likely impact of the capping criteria in the light of that merger?
</p>








<p><a name="st_97"><a name="60327-16_spnew8"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s point. Lancashire police authority has, in common with others, been reasonable in setting balanced budgets. My hon. Friend&#039;s question about the impact of the merger of his police force is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, who will shortly take decisions on the future composition of the police. My hon. Friend&#039;s point about the historic level of the council tax having a huge impact on the way in which the precepts have been levied has also been raised by several hon. Members. One of the major reasons I took the decision to abolish the formula spending share was to allow greater transparency so that the House and the Lyons review can make decisions on the basis of facts rather than notional figures.

</p>








<p><a name="st_99"><a name="60327-16_spnew10"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 The Government take their decisions on these matters in the round. One also has to take into account the position of the Department for Work and Pensions, which funds the council tax benefit system. What cannot be dismissed is the fact that 2.5&nbsp;million pensioners, representing 14&nbsp;per cent. of the total council tax budget, pay their bills through council tax benefit.

 I do not accept the premise of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question. Indeed, it provides a classic example of what I call the Liberal Democrat single transferable argument. When the council tax level is beyond what the hon.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising that point again. As I said in my statement, the average council tax increases of 12.9&nbsp;per cent. that took place some years ago were regrettable. However, he must accept that council tax levels are set by local authorities.

<a name="stpa_114">It seems strange that the House was precluded from debating that important issue during Defence questions today due to that transfer by the Table Office, especially as the Secretary of State was asked what discussions he personally had held with his US counterparts at the Pentagon. Can you get us an explanation, Madam Deputy Speaker&#151;if it is other than the fact that the Foreign Secretary has now been de-graded to the point of being the diary secretary for the Secretary of State for Defence?

<p><a name="st_115"><a name="60327-17_spmin0"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker  (Sylvia Heal): </b> 
 I am aware of the transfer of that question, together with others, perhaps in identical terms, that appeared on the Order Paper last Thursday. The decision to transfer a question is a matter for Ministers, not for the Chair. However, decisions on transfers should be consistent; they should be made as soon as possible after tabling and quickly notified to the Member concerned. Where there is a genuine element of doubt and an oral question is involved, it is reasonable that the Member should have the benefit of that doubt. I have nothing further to add.

<a name="stpa_115">Although there are 5.2&nbsp;million carers, I want to focus on those who have the heaviest commitment, where caring can have an impact on the health of the carer. One million carers care for more than 50&nbsp;hours a week, which is more than a full-time job. Research shows that such caring commitments often result in poor health for the carer. A Carers UK report, based on the 2001&nbsp;census, showed that one in five of those caring for more than 50&nbsp;hours a week were not in good health, and that figure worsened to one in four carers in some areas of the country. Areas with the worst figures for poor health among carers also tend to have high levels of disability and illness, often linked to the heritage of industrial disease. Those include my local authority areas of Salford and Wigan and many former industrial and mining areas nationwide.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_116">The report noted that older carers are often likely to be suffering poor health, and caring will have a further impact on the carer&#039;s health. An American study of carers of patients with stroke disease or dementia found that caring did have an impact on their health. Stress from caring affected the carer&#039;s immune system in ways that accelerated the risk of age-related diseases. The stress of caring does not just affect older carers&#151;the Carers UK report found that carers in younger age groups, from 16&nbsp;years upwards, were significantly more likely to suffer ill-health than non-carers of the same age.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_117">The fact that carers&#039; health suffers through caring is well known to the charities who work to support carers. The Princess Royal Trust for Carers has some 60&nbsp;centres in its network, which work with primary health care teams to help them to identify and support carers. The trust also has more than 30&nbsp;projects working directly with primary care. The first projects were established in the early 1990s and that work led to the trust publishing a good practice guide for support workers and GP practices in 1999.

<a name="stpa_119">for many carers. The Government highlighted in the strategy the fact that GPs and primary health care teams had a key role that they should be performing with carers within their practice population.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_120">The strategy included a five-point checklist for primary care to use with carers. The checklist covered GPs identifying carers, making checks on their physical and emotional health, telling carers that they can ask for a social services assessment of their own needs, routinely asking patients about sharing information about their health with their carer and being aware of local carers&#039; support groups and telling carers about those groups.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 581</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_121">The national strategy gave that checklist to GPs as good practice for their work with carers. The emphasis on identifying carers within primary care was important because carers play such a vital role in health and social care. They are increasingly being recognised by NHS staff as partners in care. While a proportion of GPs and primary health care teams do work to identify the carers within their practice population, research on the extent of the work being done shows that this is patchy. Some GPs say that they are too busy to undertake the work. My Bill would require that primary care trusts and local health boards ensure that effective procedures exist within primary care to identify carers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_122">Current good practice suggests that it is worth GPs identifying certain carers so that they can be referred to other agencies for support and for assessment of their needs. In a GP practice population of 2,000, there are likely to be some 200&nbsp;carers, of whom about 40&nbsp;will be caring for 50&nbsp;hours or more per week. The task of identifying the 40&nbsp;carers with the heaviest commitments does seem manageable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_123">The Princess Royal Trust for Carers centre in Salford has a primary care liaison worker called Julia Ellis. Julia told me how two primary care practices in my constituency were successfully identifying and referring carers to her centre. Practice nurses from the Limes medical practice in Walkden carry out that work when making home visits to a patient who seems to have a carer. The nurses run through a series of questions with the patient and carer about who does certain tasks for the patient. The nurses then fill in a referral card for the practice to ensure that the primary health care team know about the carer, and they also ensure that the carer is referred to sources of advice and support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_124">The Dearden avenue medical practice in my constituency has a different approach. Its staff carried out a search on the practice&#039;s computer system. For all those patients over 70&nbsp;who were not in residential care homes, a letter was sent to the next of kin asking if they were the patient&#039;s carer. Out of 149&nbsp;letters sent, 90&nbsp;were returned from carers. That excellent response rate enabled follow-up information to be sent, telling the carer about support and information available, including having an assessment of their own needs at Salford carers centre.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_125">I pay tribute to the Princess Royal Trust for Carers for its work in primary care for many years in centres such as the one at Salford, and to Carers UK for their campaigns to highlight carers&#039; issues and needs. Although I was pleased to find that GPs and primary health care teams in my constituency are tackling the work of identifying and referring carers, there is much more to be done.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-17_para14">
<a name="stpa_126">Since I became an MP, a number of constituents who are carers have asked for help with urgent problems with health services. I have found that those constituents tend not to think of themselves as carers; nor have they been identified as such by their GPs. They do not know that there is a carers centre in Salford and a carers support group in Wigan and Leigh, both of which can offer them advice and help. It seems that we have a long way to go before it is routine for carers to be identified and offered the help and support that they need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-17_para15">
<a name="stpa_127">Carers are not yet routinely identified and referred for advice and support; nor are they helped to plan alternative care if their own health fails. Last year, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 582</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Carers UK reported on the experiences of more than 1,000&nbsp;carers who had to find alternative ways to manage their caring responsibilities during an emergency or health crisis. Some of those carers had life-threatening conditions themselves, but they still had a battle to find information and support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-17_para16">
<a name="stpa_128">Carers with substantial caring commitments need to have regular checks on their own physical and emotional health. My Bill would require that carers are offered consultations and health checks and that that is done routinely for carers whose health is at risk because of caring. Carers also need to have regular reviews of how they are coping with their caring commitment in case their own health deteriorates or they stop being able to cope. They also need information on what alternative care is available, and my Bill would enable carers to be referred for such advice.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-17_para17">
<a name="stpa_129">Research has shown that carers can find it difficult to make an appointment with a GP for their own health needs, as they are more restricted in the times that they can attend and must often make alternative care arrangements. Similarly, it is difficult for them to get out of the house to pick up prescriptions. When attending an appointment with the person who is cared for, the waiting room arrangements can be a barrier for carers, particularly if the cared-for person is an autistic child, chronically or terminally ill, or suffering from dementia. Having to wait to see a GP is annoying for many people, but carers in the situations that I have described find that a wait may be impossible. My Bill would require that primary care services take carers&#039; needs into account in making medical appointments, issuing prescriptions and making suitable arrangements in the waiting room.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-17_para18">
<a name="stpa_130">The recent White Paper, &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot;, offered a new deal for carers and an updated and extended national strategy. The new strategy will promote

<p><a name="st_126"><a name="60327-18_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Ruth Kelly): </b> 
 Today, we debate the central theme of this Labour Government&#039;s 10th Budget: education&#151;our No. 1&nbsp;priority. Our vision is for a nation that is both economically successful and socially just, where everyone has the opportunity to fulfil their potential, no matter who they are or where they come from. Education is central to that vision. It has the potential to transform our lives, individually and collectively. It is a powerful force for both economic success and social mobility, which is why Labour values it so highly and debates it so passionately.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_134">In last week&#039;s Budget, we had to make a choice&#151;we could invest in our children, schools and young people or we could put tax cuts before the needs of our young people. We chose to invest in the future and in our economy, leaving the Opposition to make the case for the old Tory politics of cutting public services to pay for tax cuts. The prosperity of our nation requires a Government who are not only strong enough to take the difficult decisions for today, but who have the vision and determination to take the essential decisions needed for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tomorrow. Since taking office in 1997, this Government have never failed to meet that challenge, making the case for reform in our education system where it was needed, but also backing that reform with investment.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_135">The priority of this Labour Government is to pursue our vision, in which an outstanding education will be the right not only of a few pupils who have opted out of the state system or whose parents benefited from a good start in life, but of every single child&#151;100&nbsp;per cent. of our children will be valued highly; 100&nbsp;per cent. will be fully equipped for the challenges of the future. Because we want every child to have the chance to succeed, schools were at 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 584</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the heart of last week&#039;s Budget. The Government have already raised standards in primary and secondary education. There has been unprecedented capital investment since 1997. There are 30,000&nbsp;more teachers and more than 130,000&nbsp;more support staff in our schools, and there have been year-on-year improvements in results at ages 11&nbsp;and 14&nbsp;and at GSCE. Where only 45&nbsp;per cent. of pupils got five good GCSEs in 1997, 56&nbsp;per cent. achieved that level in 2005.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_136">The Education and Inspections Bill currently before the House takes that transformation of schools further still. Schools will be able to take the decisions that they need to raise standards and will be free to form relationships with external partners, such as business foundations, further education colleges and universities, charities and other schools, where that will help them to drive up standards. For the first time ever in our nation&#039;s history, we are introducing a new right for all young people to a high quality vocational route from the age of 14.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_137">The Budget heralds more major investment for our schools. We have already doubled the money that we spend on each pupil each year from &#163;2,500&nbsp;in 1997&nbsp;to &#163;5,000&nbsp;today, but we know that, in the independent sector, average spending on each pupil is still &#163;8,000&nbsp;each year. As the Chancellor has made clear, our long-term aim will be to close the gap between spending on private school pupils and those in state schools. We want all pupils to benefit from the investment and support now available to only some of them. In particular, as a first step the Budget includes capital investment in school buildings and information and communications technology, which will increase by &#163;1.6&nbsp;billion to a total of more than &#163;8&nbsp;billion by 2010&#150;11. That will close the historical gap in capital investment between state schools and independent schools so that all our young people can benefit from world-class educational facilities.

 The right hon. Lady said a moment ago that the Government have committed themselves&#151;true enough, they have&#151;to a right to a vocational education, including, therefore, a commitment to access the specialised diplomas that will form its essence. Why are the Government not prepared similarly to commit to the funding of personalised learning?
</p>








<p><a name="st_128"><a name="60327-18_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely good point. I want to come on to personalisation, because it is at the heart of our education reforms. The Budget commits the Government to spending &#163;220&nbsp;million next year, followed by &#163;365&nbsp;million the following year direct to every head teacher to help to provide tailored teaching and learning in and out of the classroom.

 My right hon. Friend is moving on to an interesting topic, but I want to return to the previous topic of capital investment. Has she analysed the distortion caused by forcing local authorities to have academies? On at least two occasions, I have heard my colleagues say that their local authority has been told that if it will not have an academy, its capital investment programme will be put back by two or three years.

<p><a name="st_130"><a name="60327-18_spnew3"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I would be glad if my hon. Friend provided the evidence for that. I would be happy to look at it. The Government&#039;s commitment is to raising standards. When a local education authority has a plan that will clearly raise standards, particularly in underperforming or failing schools, the Government welcome that. When it does not, an academy may be the option&#151;when there is persistent educational inequality and disadvantage, which sometimes will have existed for generations.

<p><a name="st_131"><a name="60327-18_spnew4"><b> Mr. David Chaytor  (Bury, North) (Lab):</b> 
 On the previous point about matching the funding in state schools to that which currently applies in private schools, will my right hon. Friend indicate the time over which that objective could be achieved? Does she think that it can be achieved entirely out of general taxation?
</p>








<p><a name="st_132"><a name="60327-18_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 As usual, my hon. Friend makes a salient point. I have just laid before the House detailed, concrete commitments on capital investment, which, as a first step, will help to close the gap&#151;and, in fact, close it&#151;between private sector capital investment spending today and our ambition for capital spending on state schools. Clearly, there are also revenue implications. As he knows, we do not, in general, set out our revenue plans beyond the period of the comprehensive spending review, but we have given a commitment for the next two years to invest heavily in personalised education, out of general taxation, so that every child can benefit from more catch-up support, more individual teaching, more small group and one-to-one support&#151;particularly for those falling behind&#151;and additional activities for the most able. I am talking about personalised provision, with pupils from the most disadvantaged backgrounds as the first priority. Combined with the investment already allocated in last autumn&#039;s schools White Paper, we have now given a total of &#163;1&nbsp;billion to support that approach to individual teaching and learning.

 I may have misheard my right hon. Friend, but, from reading the vast amount of documentation that we have had since the Chancellor&#039;s Budget speech, I understand that the figure that she gave is the added amount that the Chancellor announced. When combined with the amount already being spent, the figure is much larger, is it not?
</p>








<p><a name="st_134"><a name="60327-19_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The amounts that I have just outlined are in addition to the amount for personalisation already allocated through the direct schools grant. That brings the total over the next two years&#151;just for personalised learning&#151;to more than &#163;1&nbsp;billion. As he will know, last week I asked Christine Gilbert, the chief executive of Tower Hamlets council, to lead an expert review team to investigate how we can take forward the vision for outstanding, tailored teaching and learning. Her report, which is due towards the end of the year, will set out a vision for the next generation&#151;teaching and learning in 2020.

<a name="stpa_138">As the Chancellor said last week, investment in schools is the most important and pivotal investment that we can make for our economy and our future.

I am delighted to see the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) on the Front Bench, waiting to hear what I am going to say. On Budget day, when she was asked whether the Conservatives, in government, would spend less on education, she said, &quot;Um. Ah.

 As the Secretary of State is being party political, may I remind her that one of the Government&#039;s key promises in 1997&nbsp;was that class sizes in primary schools would be under 30? However, by 2001&nbsp;that key pledge was abandoned and has thus not been met. Any aspiration must be matched against the reality of what the Government say and what they do not deliver.

Once again the Conservative party is failing to prove itself to be a credible party of opposition when we discuss education.

<a name="stpa_145">Today, I have published a White Paper on the future of further education. It sets out an ambitious programme of investment and reform and gives the college sector the status and attention it deserves. The Government have chosen to invest in the college sector, just as we have in our schools. Since 1997, there has been a 48&nbsp;per cent. real-terms increase in investment. An additional &#163;350&nbsp;million of capital over two years for colleges was announced in last year&#039;s Budget, and new resources are set out in this year&#039;s Budget and today&#039;s White Paper.

<a name="stpa_146">Labour Members have an ambitious programme of investment for our colleges&#151;we have made our choice. The investment that we have already delivered has paid off. More people are joining FE courses&#151;6&nbsp;million now compared with 4&nbsp;million in 1997&#151;and more young people and adults are starting and completing good qualifications every year. However, we face unprecedented challenges, so we must do much more. Our post-16&nbsp;staying-on rate is one of the worst in the industrialised world, and we need to transform the skills of adults if we are to remain competitive in the new globalised economy, with new players such as India and China becoming more powerful every day. Standing still is simply not an option.

Today&#039;s White Paper will make a reality of those ambitions. There will be &#163;25&nbsp;million to fund a new entitlement to a free first level 3&nbsp;qualification for all 19&nbsp;to 25-year-olds, together with an extra &#163;11&nbsp;million to provide maintenance support to help with living costs. There will be &#163;11&nbsp;million to help colleges to improve their work force by recruiting mid-career professionals from industry and top-flight graduates.

 I absolutely agree with the Secretary of State about the importance of the White Paper that was published today. One of its elements is the return of learning accounts. When the policy was in practice before, it was affected by the severe problem of fraud, which led to a loss of confidence in the accounts. Will she set out what difference there will be between the learning accounts to which the White Paper refers and those that existed in the past?
</p>








<p><a name="st_149"><a name="60327-20_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important point. It is right that funds are in the hands of individuals so that they can access the courses that they think best meet their needs. The vision of a demand-led system&#151;by both individuals and employers&#151;is at the heart of our approach for the further education sector. Clearly, the individual learning account experience was subject to fraud, and we learned lessons from the Select Committee inquiry into that. In future, all courses will have to be quality assured. A register of quality-assured providers will ensure that it is not possible to defraud the system. At first, the new accounts will be available only for level 3&nbsp;courses, rather than all courses, and we will pilot the approach carefully before extending it across the country. If, as I think we will, we develop a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 589</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>watertight system that puts power in the hands of the individual, we will move towards a further education system that is in general much more responsive to individual need and demand and that helps us to meet the skills challenges of the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_148">We will not only put more power into the hands of the individual in the further education sector, but we will ask colleges to be more responsive to employers. I would like to see courses that are chosen by employers and delivered in the workplace so that companies can access all their training needs, from adult literacy to degree-level engineering, in a convenient and timely way. All colleges will be asked to specialise in their strong areas so that they all have a real centre of excellence. We will raise the bar on standards by taking tough measures to improve colleges that are underperforming. This is a radical package for the further education sector, and it is a Labour package. This is a Budget that secures fairness for every child and every learner by investing in every child and every learner. The Conservatives had the chance to invest in the further education sector when they were in government, but did they? No. In fact, funding was cut by 14&nbsp;per cent. in real terms under the previous Government.
</p>








<p><a name="st_150"><a name="60327-20_spnew2"><b> Mrs. Nadine Dorries  (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con):</b>

<p><a name="st_151"><a name="60327-20_spnew3"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 Why has it taken the Conservative party nine years to wake up to the fact that more investment might be needed in our schools and further education colleges? Over the past nine years, funding in education has risen by 48&nbsp;per cent.&#151;almost half&#151;in real terms. At the same time, we have introduced a new level 2&nbsp;entitlement for all young learners and an entitlement for adults who do not have the basic skills required, to gain them for free. We are also piloting a new approach to level 3&nbsp;in the regions. The White Paper relates to colleges that are needed to deliver the skills needs of the nation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_152"><a name="60327-20_spnew4"><b> Peter Luff: </b> 
 Does the right hon. Lady think that perhaps the time has come for a more radical assessment of the relative roles of higher education and further education? The overlap is now considerable. The message of a 50&nbsp;per cent. target for HE seems to diminish the value that the Government attach to FE. Is the White Paper radical enough to address the skills needs of our country?
</p>








<p><a name="st_153"><a name="60327-20_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I think that it is. When the hon. Gentleman has a chance to read the White Paper, he will see that we plan to use FE colleges as a major way of delivering HE for those learners who are already in employment and need skills delivered in the workplace, and for those areas where students and employees do not have ready access to HE institutions. That is right and it will help us to achieve our target. If anything, the target of 50&nbsp;per cent. is too low an ambition rather than too high an ambition.

However, does she think that there is a problem with rebuilding and refurbishing the FE sector estate? She knows about the serious financial problems with borrowing the money in the FE sector. I have not been able to find anything in the document to put that matter to rest.
</p>








<p><a name="st_155"><a name="60327-20_spnew7"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I agree that the sector needs more capital investment, and capital spending in the FE sector will rise by &#163;1&nbsp;billion over the next five years, &#163;350&nbsp;million of which was announced as additional investment in last year&#039;s Budget. My hon. Friend is also right that the FE sector finds it difficult to compete on the same terms as schools for 14&nbsp;to 19&nbsp;education in particular. When he examines the White Paper closely, he will see that we are planning to level the playing field and make things fairer between schools and the FE sector, and sixth-form colleges in particular, in the approach to 14&nbsp;to 19&nbsp;capital, with local authorities in the lead, delivering their vision for capital spending across that age group. I hope that he accepts and recognises that that is a major step forward for capital investment in the FE sector.

<p><a name="st_156"><a name="60327-20_spnew8"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 On employer involvement, in the formulation of the content of the specialised diplomas, how will the right hon. Lady decide which employers to consult, by what means and over what period?
</p>








<p><a name="st_157"><a name="60327-20_spnew9"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 Again, the hon. Gentleman makes the important point that employers in each sector should be intimately involved, not only in delivering part of the diploma, but in designing the curriculum content. That is why I have asked every sector skills council, which the Government have set up in every major area of the economy, to lead in bringing together a partnership of those interested employers to agree the content of each and every one of those specialised diplomas. By 2013, every young person in the country over the age of 14&nbsp;will have the choice of learning on one of those 14&nbsp;specialised diplomas, to which he so rightly referred&#151;bold thinking, but the need for much higher quality and better vocational education is clear. If we are to compete against China and India, we need to invest in engineering and other major parts of the economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_149">In proposing our reforms, we have always been clear that they need to be backed up with investment.

The Conservative party refuses to match the investment that we are putting into our education system. I ask the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) to contradict me if what I am saying is not true. It is a party that yet again puts tax cuts before the investment that is needed in our nation&#039;s future.

: My right hon. Friend may be coming to this, but it is worth making the comparisons in concrete terms for the House and the record. My understanding of education spending trends is that between 1992&#150;93&nbsp;and 1997, the percentage of gross domestic product spent on education fell from 5.4&nbsp;to 4.7&nbsp;per cent. under the Conservatives. In the period in which Labour has been in

<p><a name="st_159"><a name="60327-20_spnew11"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a compelling point. It is true that when the Conservatives had the chance, they cut investment in education. Not only that, in their most recent manifesto of 2005, they did not mention skills. Those did not get a look-in.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_150">My hon. Friend asks about our ambition for the future. As he knows, it is to match spending in the state sector with spending in the private sector. Over the course of this Parliament, we have said that we intend to continue to raise the proportion of GDP that is spent on education. We have also said that by 2010&#150;11&nbsp;we will have fulfilled the ambition on the capital side. We have gone much further than the Conservatives in outlining our plans for the future.

<a name="stpa_157">For Budget after Budget we have had announcements of specific pots of money attached to specific purposes, but never an explanation of why the priority in question has been chosen. I remember, for example, the Chancellor announcing in the 1999&nbsp;Budget debate &#163;2,000&nbsp;for every school to buy books, saying that it would lead to a total of 10&nbsp;million new books in all. I never knew how the Department was going to ensure that those 10&nbsp;million new books arrived. I do not know whether it set any conditions or followed the matter up. I would just like to know from the Secretary of State exactly how she is going to ensure that this money is spent on personalisation, or whether this is a pretence in which we are all supposed to share, whereas in reality it is a cheque for the school&#151;and a good thing, too&#151;but nobody will inquire how the head teacher has spent the money.

As I understand it, we have been told that we are to have a total of &#163;34&nbsp;billion of capital expenditure over five years, which we welcome. We have been told that the money will rise from &#163;5.6&nbsp;billion this year to &#163;8&nbsp;billion in five years, but for some reason we are not to be provided with the crucial information on how the money will be broken down over that period, which schools and people planning capital expenditure need if they are going to get proper value from it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_160">There are a limited number of ways in which one can spend sums that start at &#163;5.6&nbsp;billion, end up as &#163;8&nbsp;billion and add up to &#163;34&nbsp;billion, so why does the Secretary of State keep the House in suspense? Why does she not fill in the gaps, so that schools and people who wish to help finance capital spending in schools can do some serious planning? That would be very helpful for many people who care about the quality of education. Again, if she wishes to intervene, I would welcome further information.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_161">The last of the Secretary of State&#039;s three announcements on spending is the figure for the long term&#151;the proposals for increasing expenditure to reach the level in the private sector. When I heard the Chancellor announce that in his speech the other day, I thought that I had heard it before. Indeed, what do we find but that in 2001&nbsp;the Prime Minister, speaking at the conference of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said that his aim was


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;to get to the situation where we have a state education system that is as good in its facilities and its investment as the independent sector&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_162">When asked what that meant, a senior Government source&#151;for all we know it was the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. McFadden), who I think was then one of these advisers, and an expert in the black arts&#151;said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">&quot;The prime minister was indicating that as we continue with real-term, year-on-year spending in state schools, we would hope to narrow the gap with the independent sector.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_163">In 2001&nbsp;the gap in spending between the state sector and the private sector was approximately &#163;2,000&nbsp;per pupil a year. In the five years since the Prime Minister made that pledge, the gap has widened to &#163;3,000. Now that the Chancellor has turned up and repeated what the Prime Minister said five years ago, we are rather interested to know why the Government should do any better this time than they did when they made the announcement last time.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_164">Of course we want the gap to be bridged and we want to see that level of expenditure, but it is hard for us to judge how the Government are setting about achieving it. One possibility&#151;although I would never suspect the Secretary of State of such cynicism&#151;is that we simply take today&#039;s expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP and project it forward, and there comes a point at which simply by holding expenditure constant as a percentage of GDP, it eventually reaches &#163;8,000&nbsp;per pupil per year. In fact, on our calculation that happens shortly after 2020, so perhaps the Government expect it to happen shortly after 2020. Indeed, in his briefings on the Budget, the hon. Member for Normanton (Ed Balls) gave 2020&nbsp;as one of the dates when the target would be achieved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_165">That aspiration is in reality a forecast, and the Government need do nothing other than keep public spending on education at today&#039;s level. The Secretary of State may tell us otherwise, and if so, I would very much welcome that. How does she intend to achieve that aspiration, and over what time scale? We are happy to sign up to such an aspiration, but while the Government talk only about inputs, spending and ratios, we want standards in state schools to reach the standards in private schools. That is what parents care about most, and that is how we should approach the objective that has been set.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_166">When the Secretary of State and the Chancellor reflect on these matters they ought to take careful account of the wise advice in successive reports by the Education and Skills Committee. In two separate reports on public expenditure it has issued salutary warnings that the Chancellor and the Secretary of State have not taken fully into account. Its report on public expenditure on education and skills for the Session 2004&#150;05&nbsp;begins with a crucial paragraph entitled &quot;The effectiveness of increased expenditure&quot;, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">&quot;The Chancellor&#039;s budget book for 2004&nbsp;claimed a direct relationship between the increased investment in education since 1997&nbsp;and improvement in GCSE results in particular.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_167">that is something of which the Opposition are accused&#151;

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;GCSE results had improved to at least the same extent in earlier periods in the 1990s.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_168">We therefore secured similar improvements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-21_para14">
<a name="stpa_169">The report continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;The Government needs to take great care in making claims about the effectiveness of increased investment in education in increasing levels of achievement which the evidence cannot be proved to support.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-21_para15">
<a name="stpa_170">That is extremely wise advice. When the Prime Minister said that he was going to focus on outputs, not inputs, we thought that that was part of what new Labour was supposed to be about. However, what we heard from the Chancellor last week and the Secretary of State this afternoon was entirely about inputs, not outputs. Why did the right hon. Lady not take to heart the advice in the Select Committee report?
</p>

<p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;sets great store by stability of funding; it needs to ensure that budget holders across the education sector are aware that funding will not rise at a significant rate over the next spending review period and beyond.&quot;</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;The Government has already accepted that spending increases will be more modest in the years ahead. The DfES needs to be explicit in stating that growth in expenditure on education and skills will slow down significantly in the coming period.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-21_para18">
<a name="stpa_173">The Select Committee rightly called for a grown-up debate so that people who work in education can accept that the rate of growth of education spending will slow down a great deal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-21_para19">
<a name="stpa_174">That was extremely important advice, but last week the Chancellor and the Secretary of State, who has talked about a &quot;huge new resource&quot;, painted a picture for people in the world of education that is very different from the reality set out soberly and frankly in the Select Committee report. I would be happy to join the Secretary of State in a grown-up debate about how, if the rate of growth of spending is to slow down, that money can be used most efficiently to raise standards in education.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-21_para20">
<a name="stpa_175">Instead of following the Select Committee report, the Government have bandied figures about as if there is there is going to be an extraordinary splurge in public spending. The figures show that the rate of growth of public spending will not be as great in the next few years as it has been in the past few years. It would have been grown-up to follow the Select Committee advice and confront the world of education with that reality, rather than try to avoid it. The Chancellor frequently enjoys accusing us of boom and bust in our management of the economy, but the record shows that in the financing of public services the Government are responsible for a cycle of boom and bust.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-21_para21">
<a name="stpa_176">May I invite the Secretary of State to focus on science&#151;a subject to which the Chancellor referred in the Budget? The state of science is a subject of widespread concern, and something that worries Members on both sides of the House. Specific science initiatives were launched which, in so far as we can understand them and the figures behind them, we welcome. However, I hope that the Secretary of State will forgive our scepticism about the special schemes that are always being announced.

 Over the past five years many science departments in universities have closed, and the largest proportion of science students are from the independent sector, so the position is far worse than my hon.

<a name="60327-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_181">I turn to the subject of further education, about which the Secretary of State spoke and on which we have had a White Paper today. I agree with the right hon. Lady about the importance of FE. I served on the governing body of an FE college for six years, after it was incorporated. Many FE colleges greatly welcomed incorporation, although I fear that the present direction of policy is slowly and insidiously to take away many of the freedoms that FE colleges had an opportunity to seize then.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_182">FE has rightly been described as sometimes being the middle child in the world of education, which does not get the attention that it merits, between schools and higher education. Sir Andrew Foster&#039;s report on FE was excellent. I hope the Secretary of State will agree that if we ever want to assess the Government&#039;s performance when it comes to opening up skills and opportunities for our young people, nothing beats table D4&nbsp;of <i>Labour Market Trends</i>. That says it all. I shall give some edited highlights.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_183">The table is entitled &quot;Economic Activity and Economic Inactivity&quot;, broken down by age. It shows that among 16&nbsp;and 17-year-olds, 95,000&nbsp;are unemployed and not in full-time education. There are a further 122,000&nbsp;who are economically inactive and not in full-time education, which adds up to a total of 217,000 16&nbsp;and 17-year-olds alone. That compares with a figure of 170,000&#151;quite bad enough&#151;when the Government came to office. I should like to hear from the Secretary of State why she thinks that figure had deteriorated so much during her years in office.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_184">The next line in the table provides figures for 18&nbsp;to 24-year-olds. A total of 997,000 18&nbsp;to 24-year-olds are neither working nor studying nor training. Again, that is a bad figure; the total was 912,000&nbsp;when the Government came to office. After nine years of initiatives, the new deal and all the other investment, the number of young people who are neither working nor studying nor training has significantly deteriorated since the Government started. Instead of the complacency that we heard from the Secretary of State, I hoped that for once she would tell us why the figures are still deteriorating. None of us can take any comfort from the fact that the position is so bad. The Opposition are entitled to be sceptical about the Government&#039;s chances of tackling this very serious problem.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_185">On page 27&nbsp;of Sir Andrew Foster&#039;s report there is a little box that tells the story that we hear from anybody working in the world of FE. The box is entitled, &quot;List of organisations with a monitoring/inspection/improvement role in FE colleges&quot;. I will not detain the House by reading out the full list. Suffice it to say that 17&nbsp;different bodies are listed in the report as having a role in the regulation of FE. My understanding of what today&#039;s White Paper proposes is that one of the bodies, the adult learning inspectorate, is merged with Ofsted, but one new body is created&#151;the quality improvement inspectorate&#151;leaving us still with a net total of 17&nbsp;bodies improving, regulating and auditing FE. That is far too many bodies supervising FE. It is clear from Sir Andrew Foster&#039;s report that that is the problem that he wants tackled.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-22_para14">
<a name="stpa_194">There is a big focus in the White Paper on national vocational qualifications. Is the Secretary of State, like me, concerned about many employers&#039; lack of confidence in NVQs? The paradox is that the funding is being shifted to NVQ levels 1&nbsp;and 2, when those qualifications command no premium whatsoever in the labour market. They are not worth any increase in pay. That tells us something about what employers think of those NVQs. Why are the Government trying to funnel Learning and Skills Council funding into courses that, sadly, are of the lowest value in the labour market, and away from courses that have other values?

Average wealth per head has risen from the lowest in the G7&nbsp;to second place&#151;the G7&nbsp;consists of the UK, the US, France, Canada, Italy, Japan and Germany. Furthermore, households across the income scale continue to see their living standards rise. A strong and strengthening economy, alongside the sound management of our public finances, means that this Government have again been able to invest in Britain&#039;s future.

<a name="stpa_200">The Budget has served another purpose by shedding a little light on the policies of the official Opposition. After all, although Conservative Members are eager to tell us that they have changed, they are rather shy about what they have changed into. We now know that the Conservative party would reduce spending by &#163;17&nbsp;billion in the year ahead. On top of that, my right hon. Friend the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chancellor has calculated that a Conservative Government would require public spending to be &#163;16&nbsp;billion lower in 2007&#150;08, which would eliminate all possibility of additional investment in infrastructure, science or education.

<a name="60327-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_201">A key benefit of the economic strength and stability maintained by this Government has been the steady rise in the number of people in work. The UK has the highest employment rate in the G7, and the number of people in employment is close to record levels&#151;up by 178,000&nbsp;since last year. More people are in work, and with the national minimum wage, child benefit, the child tax credit and the working tax credit, this Government have made work pay. People are no longer better off on the dole. Alongside the high level of employment, the number of unemployed and the rate of unemployment have stayed and remain low.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_202">There has been a slight rise in unemployment in recent months. There has also been a large migration of workers from central and eastern Europe into this country, and, generally speaking, those people are now productive members of our labour force. There has been speculation that the scale of that influx might have been a factor in the recent slight increase in unemployment. It is early days, but the Department for Work and Pensions has published two working papers since the enlargement of the European Union in May 2004. I am pleased that the indications to date are that this migration is not the cause of the small recent rise in unemployment and that the overall economic impact of the migration has been &quot;modest but broadly positive&quot;.

<a name="stpa_203">The current budget balance is clearly important. We can argue about the scale of borrowing that it is prudent for the Government to undertake in any financial year, and we can debate what is a sensible maximum for the national debt as a percentage of gross domestic product. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has articulated what is described as the golden rule with respect to our budget balance. I shall leave it to the economists in this House to argue about the length of the economic cycle, but it is worth making the point that, even with the previous dating of the economic cycle, the average current budget balance was zero and the cumulative deficit over the period was &#163;1.9&nbsp;billion.

I encourage my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to address the importance of the trade balance in the modern world, because, as hon.

In the past five years, the deficit has increased from more than &#163;19&nbsp;billion in 2000&nbsp;to more than &#163;47&nbsp;billion in 2005, and the trend was rising before that.

 The Budget contains many welcome proposals on education, and I shall go through some of them in more detail. However, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 603</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>it is frustrating that, when the Government have some good tales to tell on education, they insist on over-hyping and over-selling their announcements. That is entirely counter-productive, because it hands a stick to the Opposition with which to beat the Government about the head, which is pointless. Re-announcing previous spending and artificially inflating the figures just leads to cynicism. If they were frank about their announcement, we could discuss the points of fact, welcome some of the commitments and debate policy priorities, which is what we should be doing in this kind of debate. Instead of that, we must spend some time unpicking the spin.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_209">Let me begin with the Chancellor&#039;s announcement that he is handing an extra &#163;34&nbsp;billion to schools. Of course, that got fantastic headlines, but the figure is based on adding up all the capital spend over the next five years, with many of the announcements having been made prior to the Budget. The extra amount in each year is actually just &#163;1.6&nbsp;billion, representing the rise from the planned &#163;6.4&nbsp;billion for 2007&#150;08&nbsp;to just over &#163;8&nbsp;billion in 2010&#150;11.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_210">Then there is the impressive-sounding pledge to increase spending on state school pupils to the level spent in private schools, which, as the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) pointed out, the Prime Minister promised to do some time ago. But there is no timetable for closing that spending gap&#151;it is a vague aspiration. If Liberal Democrat Members expressed such an aspiration, the Secretary of State would accuse us, with some enthusiasm, of making ludicrous and uncosted spending commitments, yet the Government seem perfectly happy to express such aspirations. The pledge is to raise state school spending, at some future date, to the level of today&#039;s private school spending. That is a big enough task in itself. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, it would, even after the announcements in this week&#039;s Budget, require an extra &#163;17&nbsp;billion on top of planned spending. That would take 16&nbsp;years to achieve if spending grows in line with the growth in the economy. Even then, it will not close the gap with the private sector unless the private sector does not significantly increase its own spending over that period. I suppose that we must at least be grateful that these myths were exploded within 24&nbsp;hours, in contrast to the myth about the spending on school science labs, which took rather longer to decode. as the hon. Member for Havant pointed out. Such claims are unhelpful and breed cynicism.

<p><a name="st_191"><a name="60327-24_spnew0"><b> Michael Connarty: </b> 
 I would not like to accuse the hon. Lady of trying to debunk a promise on the basis that it is good for the Liberals but does not reflect the Government&#039;s position. The hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) quoted the Prime Minister as saying that we will narrow the gap. The Chancellor said in his Budget that we will do away with the gap and match spending on public sector students to the level in the private sector. I should have thought that that is a significant move forward. I certainly welcome it and I hope that the hon. Lady will do so without being churlish.
</p>








<p><a name="st_192"><a name="60327-24_spnew1"><b> Sarah Teather: </b>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 604</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Secretary of State said earlier, there is no timetable for narrowing that gap. It depends on the rate at which private sector spending increases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_211">Despite the spin and nonsense, the Budget contains genuine bonuses and good proposals for education with which I wholeheartedly agree. I shall highlight a few of those, because it easy for us to spend a great deal of time castigating the Government about things that we disagree with.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_212">First, let me highlight a proposal that nobody else has mentioned and that is unlikely to gain any headlines, spun or not, but which is none the less welcome&#151;that is, that we should move towards a simpler and less burdensome assessment of research in our universities. We will need to look at the detail of that. However, it seems eminently sensible to move towards a metric system in place of the existing research assessment exercise and to run the old system in conjunction with the new. That is likely to be welcomed by all, especially universities. We look forward to the Government clarifying those proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_213">Secondly, the Budget includes a genuine acknowledgment of the depth and scale of the problem of the shortage of specialist science teachers. Although that is rather late, as it comes 18&nbsp;months after Professor Smith&#039;s report, it is welcome, as are some of the proposals. Liberal Democrat Members have for some time pointed out that it will not be possible to fill all the gaps in the system merely by recruiting new specialists, and that we must also invest in retraining teachers currently teaching in areas outside their own specialism. We made an election pledge to do that in our 2005&nbsp;manifesto. The Budget announces pilots to begin that process. We look forward to the results of those pilots. I urge the Secretary of State to extend the scheme to language and English teachers, where there is also a critical shortage. I am pleased that the Government have acknowledged the shortage of specialist science teachers, particularly in physics and chemistry. The Institute of Physics and others have called on the Government to break their target down for recruitment to identify those areas of specialism in particular, and it is welcome that they have done so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_214">The detail of the commitment to recruit, retain and retrain new specialist teachers remains unclear, as the hon. Member for Havant observed. Will there really be 3,000&nbsp;new teachers, as reported by the press, given that the detail is not in the Budget papers? If so, what steps are the Government taking to entice people into teaching and to prevent them from leaving? Last year, they missed their own target for recruiting specialist science and maths teachers&#151;and, indeed, specialist language teachers, where they fell short by a greater amount. What new activity are they proposing to ensure that they reach this target? Surely they need to look at this as part of a general problem with recruiting and retaining highly qualified teachers. We have a critical shortage of head teachers and, despite six-figure salaries being offered, many posts lie empty for extended periods. The Government need to get to the bottom of why so many people do not want to do the job. I suspect that when they ask teachers and teaching unions why schools find it so difficult to recruit highly qualified teachers, they will find that, despite the spin in the White Paper about freeing up schools, it is teachers who are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 605</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>desperate to be freed from the endless edicts from Whitehall and want far more freedom to teach a curriculum that meets the needs of their students.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_215">The money allocated to personalised learning is welcome, but the details of how it will be allocated are not clear, and I would be grateful for the Minister&#039;s clarification. John Dunford from the Association of School and College Leaders has described the current system for targeting extra funds on disadvantaged students as spraying funds around like Dick Cheney on a quail shoot. He points out that money is failing to reach the most disadvantaged students, with some schools doing comparatively well despite the fact that they are in low-performing areas. It is not clear from the Budget documents or from previous announcements whether the Government intend to target money based on data surrounding schools or on deprivation figures for the local authority. We urge the Secretary of State to go further and consider targeting on the basis of individual pupils. We are examining the detail of how such a scheme could work in practice. It could absorb many of the existing funding streams for disadvantage and focus on underachievement as well as on disadvantaged students, no matter what school they study at, to give a greater incentive to take those students and to provide the support that they need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_216">I am sure that the Secretary of State will agree that what would make the most difference in this respect is smaller class sizes, with very young children being the most important age group. That is why we would like class sizes for infants to be reduced to 20. We accept that it is an expensive commitment, so we would want to use the money allocated to the child trust fund to pay for it. We believe that it would be more effective to invest money in a child&#039;s education at five than to give them something that they can cash in when they are 18.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_217">I have mentioned some of the proposals that I welcome and others where I disagree with the Government&#039;s focus. Let me conclude by saying a few words about some glaring omissions as regards the proposals on further education. I had hoped that they would be clarified by today&#039;s White Paper, but that is not so. The greatest disappointment in the Budget, and indeed in the White Paper, is that while it repeats the earlier aspiration of closing the funding gap between schools and colleges for the same provision, there is no timetable and no concrete commitment to achieving it&#151;it is another uncosted aspiration. The young people who study in FE colleges are disproportionately from less affluent backgrounds, and each is short-changed by about &#163;400&nbsp;a year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_218">The White Paper contains some welcome warm words&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about a new set of principles for funding 14-to-19&nbsp;learning such as laying out comparable funding for courses irrespective of institution, recognising genuine costs and advocating an approach that should not limit students&#039; choices. However, the task has been hived off to a technical funding group and I am worried about how much will get implemented and over what time scale. Students and colleges need these changes now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Programmes such as the increased flexibility programme are not funded to the level of true costs, with many colleges, including the College of North West London in my constituency, reporting that they 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 606</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>subsidise the programme heavily, with a dramatic impact on courses in other areas. The Government cannot push on with an agenda of contestability and rely on the good nature and social justice ethos of colleges without adequately funding them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_219">If we are looking for a place from which to squeeze money, perhaps the Learning and Skills Council should be a prime target for cuts. I welcome statements in the Budget about slimming down that obese organisation, but its costs are astronomical. They run at more than 10&nbsp;times the costs of the equivalent body in higher education. The LSC is a bureaucratic monster, unaccountable to local people, barely accountable to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament and unpopular with colleges. The Government should take a firm hand with it. One of my favourite idiot edicts from that organisation said that science and maths courses should be a low priority in London and proposed that colleges should cut them. Thankfully, it appears to have seen sense, but that is indicative of an organisation that is grossly out of touch.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_220">The new first level 3&nbsp;entitlement up to the age of 25, which is included in the Budget, is welcome and has been our party policy for some time. However, the allocated &#163;25&nbsp;million looks likely to cover only those already paying for the course. Given the statements of the Chancellor and the Secretary of State about the importance of that qualification to the economy, will the LSC be charged with recruiting more students to study at that level? If so, where will the money come from? Are colleges expected to take it from existing adult provision and cut that even further? We already have a crisis in adult provision, not only in basket-weaving or underwater swimming, but in core courses, which are vital to the economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_221">The Budget announces the roll-out of the train to gain programme, but the Government do not seem to have taken account of the IFS report, which said that the scheme had little if any impact in the pilot areas because those who trained under the pilot scheme&#151;the national employer training programme&#151;would have done so anyway. What changes have the Government made to the scheme to take account of the IFS evaluation? They cannot bleat about the importance of evidence-based policy if they choose to ignore evidence that is presented to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_222">The Budget contains some welcome proposals, marred by the usual dodgy statistics and over-inflated claims. However, it also contains some glaring omissions in policy areas that specifically target under-achievement in the most disadvantaged groups. If it had a school report, it would read, &quot;Not bad, but could do a lot better.&quot;

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;The Government sets great store by stability of funding; it needs to ensure that budget holders across the education sector are aware that funding will not rise at a significant rate over the next spending review period and beyond.&quot;</p>

<a name="60327-25_para1">

<a name="60327-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_225">Listening to the Budget debate and the remarks of the Chancellor of the Exchequer made me think that we had reached the right conclusions based on the evidence that the Secretary of State and the permanent secretary&#151;who has now moved to the Home Office&#151;presented to the Committee. The Chancellor made a range of commitments last week and it is our job as a Select Committee to track whether the Government follow them through. We will monitor that progress carefully.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_226">After consulting some of the usual suspects, who immediately analyse the Budget figures, one expert from the London School of Economics suggested that, if one took the Chancellor&#039;s commitment to make expenditure of &#163;5,000&nbsp;a year per state school pupil catch up with the independent sector&#039;s &#163;8,000&nbsp;a year per pupil and timed it for five years, it would cost between &#163;17&nbsp;billion and &#163;20&nbsp;billion. If that is the case, it would mean a genuine increase in education spending across the piece, perhaps overtaking health expenditure to account for approximately 7.2&nbsp;or 7.3&nbsp;per cent. of GDP.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_227">I warn the Government that we have a job as a Committee and when the Secretary of State appears regularly before us to discuss the Department&#039;s work, we will ask her how far she has got on spending between &#163;17&nbsp;billion and &#163;20&nbsp;billion and reaching the education funding target of 7.2&nbsp;per cent. of GDP. The Chancellor must have known what he was doing last week and we therefore take comfort in the fact that we have a Government who have reasserted their commitment to prioritising education spending.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_228">Some discussion about the personalisation agenda has already taken place. I intervened on the Secretary of State because I wanted to ensure that we were clear about the figures for that, and that those that she used did not constitute the total amount that would be spent over the two years but built on what had already been promised as spend. I was reassured by her response and I am pleased with the amount. However, I ask her to check regularly to ascertain that the money flows to fulfil the personalised agenda. Our Committee is in the middle of considering special educational needs and some of the most deprived&#151;in every sense of the word&#151;members of our community. Those people need the greatest amount of personalisation and we must get that right.

<br>&nbsp;<br>transforming our education system and the way in which we view children. As we move on with policy, I suspect that we will be conscious that the joined-up government that we now apply to under-18s must apply much further through the age range, especially for special needs.

That is a serious decline. I appreciate that the Government have invested money in some of those programmes, as my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) mentioned. However, the situation is grave and applies not only to the UK, but to most countries in the developed world. It is not a problem in China and India, and that is worrying.

Is the money for them part of the &#163;18&nbsp;million announced to support teaching and learning in school science? If so, that amount just sounds a bit small.

Much of the further education sector, in wanting to rebuild, wants to have a stake in the 21st century so that the kids in the sector can feel good about their environment. However, many representatives of the FE sector have a problem with borrowing the money and ensuring that they can pay it back over 20&nbsp;or 25&nbsp;years.

We have so much to be proud of in terms of the investment that the Government have put into it over the past few years, so the message is that we are very encouraged and we could return to being the top spender on research.

He told us what he thinks about the key challenges that Britain will face in the coming years, and we now know exactly what to expect from his Government, with an emphasis, above all, on extending the power of central Government that he will control. I came away from the House after his speech with a feeling of alarm about Britain&#039;s ability to deal with the key challenges of this new century and about our long-term prospects as a major economic power.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_234">The Chancellor&#039;s strategy for this country appears to have been devised as though Britain were still in the 1970s and still competing with a handful of high-cost west European powers. We need to be clear about this: Britain is entering a period of unparalleled global change and competition. The Government, and especially the Chancellor, like to refer to global opportunities. That is right: the rapid economic development of places such as China does offer unparalleled opportunities for Britain. But those opportunities will become threats if the Government continue to ignore the way in which the rest of the world is developing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-25_para12">
<a name="stpa_235">The hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) has just celebrated the ever-rising level of public expenditure. I should like to explain how that might not be the answer. We have grown used to facing competition from low-cost countries in lower-skill industries, but we shall increasingly find ourselves challenged right across the board as emerging economies begin to produce highly skilled, highly educated, cheap-to-employ graduates. There will be an increasing number of attractive alternative destinations for major business investment, and a country with an uncompetitive economy, and with high taxes and regulation, will lose out. Soon, Britain&#039;s problems will shift from retaining low-tech manufacturing to retaining high-tech manufacturing and even financial services and research and development centres. Britain needs to focus above all on ensuring that our economy remains competitive by keeping costs down and on ensuring that our education system is producing intelligent, highly skilled young people who will be able to compete with the brightest and best that other countries are producing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-25_para13">
<a name="stpa_236">Unfortunately, the Budget speech does nothing to address these issues, despite its rhetoric. Reference to 4&nbsp;million overseas graduates being invited here to be educated does not address the fundamental problems that our economy faces. For a start, the Chancellor has made no commitment to reducing the British tax burden in either the short term or the long term. Instead, he proposes to increase tax again. Indeed, he boasts about the fact. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) pointed out on Budget day, we are therefore still on course for having the highest ever tax burden in Britain, overtaking the tax burden of low-growth Germany. Predictably, the Chancellor has also ignored the direct pleas of the main business organisations to reduce corporation tax. There is a clear trend elsewhere in the world to reduce corporation tax, but that requirement does not appear to trouble him at all.

<a name="60327-25_para14">
<a name="stpa_237">It is bizarre to believe that we can compete against the rising economic powers in Asia with our current taxation system when it is obvious that we cannot. It is all very well to take credit for the rise in gross domestic product per head, relative to other countries, but that is in the past. We must look to the future. Britain is beginning to fall down the league tables of international competitiveness from which the Prime Minister used to quote so regularly when he was Leader of the Opposition. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, Britain has fallen from second to eighth in the global competitiveness rankings since the Chancellor took control of the economy in 1997.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-25_para15">
<a name="stpa_238">The Chancellor&#039;s strategy will fail. Every year, Britain will continue to become less competitive, and he will delay taking the decisions necessary to meet the challenges of this new century. Of course economic stability comes first, but we have to reduce the tax burden as a proportion of national income so that Britain can once again become the most attractive place for business investment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-25_para16">
<a name="stpa_239">The Chancellor seems to think that, however much he raises taxes, it has no impact on incentives, on the health of the economy or on competitiveness. That is wrong, and we should not make the same mistake as the Government by assuming that we can reduce taxes only by the amount that we cut spending. That is the myth peddled by the Government; it is not true. In Ireland, for example, taxes have been reduced, yet tax revenues have increased. Let me quote the EU Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services, Charlie McCreevy, who used to be Ireland&#039;s Finance Minister:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;Back in the late 1990s when, as Ireland&#039;s Minister of Finance, I started cutting taxes, many people feared that the loss of revenue to the Exchequer would be massive and that the policy would have to be abandoned. But the opposite happened. Far from the policy causing an erosion of the Exchequer&#039;s revenue stream, reduced tax rates generated higher economic activity, greater taxpayer compliance and a surge in the tax take for the Exchequer.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-25_para17">
<a name="stpa_240">That is the policy that my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench will be pursuing and why, under a Conservative Government, we will spend more on the public services than a Labour Government will ever be able to afford.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-25_para18">
<a name="stpa_241">We can begin to reduce our tax burden very quickly by significantly cutting down on waste rather than on front-line services. Everyone knows that the Government are mired in waste. No doubt the Chancellor will claim that the Gershon review will reduce waste and improve efficiency&#151;it has certainly confirmed that the waste is there. But it is becoming more and more obvious that the review, with its limited ambitions, is a public relations stunt created so that the Government could pretend to be doing something about waste and declining public sector productivity, when in reality they are doing nothing at all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-25_para19">
<a name="stpa_242">The amount of regulation on business needs to be drastically reduced, including the vast amount of regulation that pours out of the European Union, which the Government seem to do virtually nothing to halt. Indeed, the notorious Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill would give the Government unprecedented powers to overturn or repeal any Act of Parliament that affects domestic legislation, but it would do nothing to address the problem of EU regulation, which the Chancellor himself says accounts for more than 50&nbsp;per cent. of the regulatory burden on business.

<a name="stpa_243">It is right to put improving education at the heart of any economic strategy, but simply throwing money at the problem, which might earn the Chancellor cheers on Budget day, will not sort it out. We need meaningful reform of the system so that pupils leave school with a proper grasp of maths, science and English, which they need for the modern world. Free A-levels up to the age of 25&nbsp;is all very well, but a mere drop in the ocean when it comes to the UK&#039;s real competitiveness. Over time, it will become increasingly evident that the Government&#039;s strategy will not be sufficient to deal with the challenges of the 21st century.

<a name="stpa_244">Are we facing an immediate economic disaster? I doubt that there will be a single devastating event that highlights the Government&#039;s mistakes, but we will see, and are seeing, a long, steady period of eroded competitiveness and relative decline. The Chancellor readily quotes our growth performance against slow-growth countries such as France and Germany. But what about Portugal, Ireland, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and the United States? All those countries have mature economies, like ours, which are performing much better than ours. We should be competing effectively against them, but we are not doing so. We will simply not be able to carry a tax and regulatory burden that makes it difficult to do business here, and a dysfunctional education system that cannot produce enough well-educated and capable school leavers.

 I draw the House&#039;s attention to my declaration in the Register of Members&#039; Interests.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_246">The Chancellor&#039;s statement last week demonstrated the extent to which economic stability has now been embedded in our country, in stark contrast to the situation that constituents such as mine witnessed in the 1980s and early 1990s. From that position of economic strength, we can plan ahead with confidence for the challenges that this country faces&#151;and we face several new challenges. I want to deal with the pensions challenge, which will need to be considered in the near future. In my view, it is perhaps the biggest challenge that we face as a country. Two distinct but linked issues must be considered. First, how can we come up with a set of proposals that will offer security and dignity for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 612</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>today&#039;s pensioners; and, secondly, how can we construct a new regime that is fair, affordable and sustainable for the pensioners of the future?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_247">The Government already have a good record with regard to pensioners. When we came into office in 1997, we were acutely aware of the way in which pensioners had been let down by the Conservative Government. In 1997, one in four pensioners&#151;2.8&nbsp;million&#151;were in poverty. It was therefore right that a top priority for an incoming Labour Government had to be how to get money quickly to those pensioners to lift them out of poverty. We used the minimum income guarantee and, more recently, the pension credit to target resources and ensure that those pensioners were taken out of poverty. We were successful. As a result of those policies, nearly 2&nbsp;million pensioners have been lifted out of poverty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_248">Of course, all pensioners benefit from and welcome some of the universal provision that we have exceptionally made available&#151;free television licences for the over-75s and the winter fuel payment, well regarded by pensioners throughout the country&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I will come to the council tax rebate in a minute. The challenge now is to achieve a national consensus on the way forward for tomorrow&#039;s pensioners and, at the same time, to give today&#039;s pensioners the security that they deserve, which, in my view, this Government should continue to deliver. Affordability and sustainability must be at the heart of our consideration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_249">We must also be aware, however, that because of the way in which pensions policy has developed, with which I agree, and because the benefits that we provide are means-tested, a large amount of money is unclaimed by pensioners&#151;money to which they are entitled and which the Government have allocated for pensions. The Department for Work and Pensions produces a useful example of the levels of take-up across a range of income-related benefits. The latest figures relate to 2003&#150;04. I want to take the lowest estimate of unclaimed benefits&#151;some estimates would be even higher. A minimum of 210,000&nbsp;pensioners do not claim housing benefit to which they are entitled, which amounts to some &#163;310&nbsp;million. A minimum of 1,600,000&nbsp;pensioners who are entitled to council tax benefit do not claim it, which means that at least &#163;870&nbsp;million of council tax benefit is unclaimed by pensioners. On the lowest estimate, 1,200,000&nbsp;pensioners do not claim pension credit and the minimum income guarantee, which amounts to &#163;1.6&nbsp;billion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_250">That is money that the Government have put aside for pensioners. If we take those three benefits together, &#163;2.8&nbsp;billion is unclaimed by pensioners. In terms of affordability, that money could be made available to pensioners. The total cost of the &#163;200&nbsp;council tax rebate is &#163;800&nbsp;million, and we should use some of the unclaimed money to support a continuation of that rebate for pensioners.

<br>&nbsp;<br>testing, for which his Government have been responsible, and in favour of the application of universal benefits for pensioners, which they very much prefer?
</p>








<p><a name="st_199"><a name="60327-26_spnew4"><b> Mr. Byers: </b> 
 That relates to what will be my next point, on a fair deal for the pensioners of tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_251">We must do all that we can to make sure that pensioners claim unclaimed benefits. We all know the nature of pensioners, however&#151;they are reluctant to go through a means-tested process, so those sums are unavailable to them. If we can make them available for universal provision&#151;of which the &#163;200&nbsp;rebate is a good example&#151;we should do so. However, almost &#163;2.8&nbsp;billion is unclaimed, so we should also consider those pensioners aged over 75, many of them women, who do not get the basic state pension. We all know that the age group with which we are concerned will have been at home and will not have paid their national insurance contributions&#151;the pensioners in poverty today. If we can extend universal provision to them, at a net cost of &#163;1.4&nbsp;billion, we will tackle what is left of pensioner poverty in our country. We can do both of those within the amount of money unclaimed at present.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_252">I accept that there is real concern about the nature of means-tested provisions. I approve of the approach that we have adopted since 1997, which ensures that money goes quickly into the pockets of pensioners in greatest need. However, it was never a long-term solution to the problem of establishing a fair pensions regime. Some of my friends here will be surprised to hear that I agree with Brendan Barber, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, who said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">&quot;You cannot build a long-term pensions system on mass means-testing of pensioners&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_253">I do not think that, when we come to consider a new regime for pensions, we can continue as we have since 1997. There cannot be minor adjustments to the present regime, or incremental change. We need to think fundamentally about the sort of pensions system that we want for the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_254">I think that the tests set out by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions are the right ones. Does the new system promote personal responsibility? Will it be fair? Is it affordable? Is it simple? Is it sustainable? I believe that, along with the recommendations of the Turner commission, those tests strike the right balance between the respective responsibilities of the Government, employers and employees. That is why I approve of the package produced by Adair Turner.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_255">I hope that when the Government produce their White Paper, they will be prepared to embrace the thrust of Turner&#039;s recommendations. In my view, the Turner report provides the blueprint&#151;the package of measures that can deliver fairness and justice for pensioners long into the future, which is what we should be seeking.

That is one way in which we can secure a system that is grounded in fairness, which is what we must try to achieve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_256">I raised this subject today because I believe that the Labour party, in particular, cannot compromise on its duty to pensioners. We owe them a responsibility&#151;a responsibility grounded in the traditional values of the Labour party. The Labour party is about ensuring, and recognising, that we can achieve far more when we act together than we ever can as individuals. Pensions present a good example of the way in which the people of today who create the wealth should look after those who, in years gone by, have provided for our country in good as well as more difficult times. It is for the Labour party to repay its debts, and I believe that a pensions policy based on the thrust of the Turner proposals represents a very positive solution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_257">Let me make a final comment on the Budget. I was delighted that the Chancellor reaffirmed the commitment to the eradication of child poverty by 2020, and the commitment to halve the number of young people in poverty by 2010&#150;11. He proposed increases in child benefit and more help to get single parents into work, lifting another 300,000&nbsp;children out of poverty. That will make an important contribution, but we need to do more. We can build on that proposal, but the important message of the proposal and, indeed, the Budget is that we cannot have a strong economy if we have a weak and divided society.

The second is national. As the hon. Member for Brent, East said, the Chancellor was right to emphasise the importance of skills and education, but I doubt that his approach is radical enough to rise to the challenge. The third is international, and relates to what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex.

It simply does not match the scale of what is happening in the wider world: as I have said, it is a Budget for mediocrity, not excellence.

His dogmatic insistence that the growing levels of public spending&#151;or investment, as he mischievously describes it to make it sound even more virtuous&#151;are compatible with our country&#039;s international competitiveness is simply wrong.

In 1997, the cash gap between funding per pupil in Worcestershire and the national average was &#163;150; now, it is more than &#163;400, and it is a whopping &#163;840&nbsp;in the case of neighbouring Birmingham.

<a name="stpa_272">Given that the new Secretary of State for Education and Skills was educated in Worcestershire and that the Minister for Schools is a Worcestershire MP, I thought that things might get better, but I was wrong. Their plan for the next two years is for Worcestershire again to have below-average increases in funding per pupil, thereby making a difficult situation worse. What is more, if I have read the Red Book correctly, propositions for the distribution of funding as listed in paragraph 6.58&nbsp;mean that local education authorities that already get high funding levels will get still higher ones.

<a name="stpa_273">I have wondered why that should be so. Why should this discrimination against my county continue? I thought that perhaps those in London just did not understand the scale of urban and rural deprivation in my county. Perhaps they view it as some rural paradise where affluent upper-middle-class parents send their children to fine private schools and live in large mansions and farmhouses, far from the gritty reality of urban Britain. Perhaps they do not understand the level of poverty and deprivation in Redditch, Worcester, Wyre Forest and, yes, in my constituency of Mid-Worcestershire. How else can we explain the bewildering paradox whereby we are considered too rich to get a decent amount of cash for our kids, and too poor to qualify for the area cost adjustment?

 I want, if I may, to take the hon. Gentleman back to the subject of India, about which I thought he was going to speak for slightly longer. Does he agree that there is great merit in UK universities establishing business schools that focus on India? We lack such schools, and the Indian high commissioner is a great advocate of such an approach. I should be interested to know whether the hon.

 I am most grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that intervention and I am happy to agree with him yet again. We will be taking an additional evidence session from the higher education sector after Easter to explore precisely that point and others. We believe that that is one of the major missed tricks in our relationship with India in terms of offering India services, bringing Indian students to the UK and the whole gamut of such issues. The Government have been timid in their approach and a lot more could be done. For example, given that Indian students who come to Scotland can stay for two years and earn money to pay for their fees, why is it that they cannot stay in England at all? True, the right to stay is being extended to one year; however, why is there one immigration law for Scotland and another for England? Such issues need to be addressed to ensure that links between India and the UK are improved dramatically. I entirely agree with the right hon. Member for North Tyneside in that regard. I wanted to say a lot more about the HE sector, but time is against me.

<p>
<a name="60327-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_279">The other issues that we need to address in facing the challenges presented by India and China include productivity, research and development, innovation and taxation. My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex was right to talk about taxation. This Budget marks the doubling in size since 1997&nbsp;of the published tax code&#151;from some 4,500&nbsp;pages to approximately 9,000. Of course, that is on top of the growing burden of business taxation. The thresholds for corporation tax are unchanged; they have not even been uprated for inflation. Fiscal drag, one of the Chancellor&#039;s favourite stealth taxes, will increase the overall cost of doing business in the UK&#151;at precisely the time when our major competitors are cutting their tax burdens.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_280">So our skills are too low, our infrastructure is inadequate, our regulatory burden is too high, our productivity is inadequate and our taxes are excessive. One can see why the view that China and India compete with us only on price and that they are in some sense stealing our manufacturing jobs&#151;or our call centre jobs&#151;is a dangerous one for us to cling to. The challenge is far more profound than that. For example, twice as many engineering graduates leave Indian institutions of higher education every year as are employed in total in the Indian call centre sector. That is a real challenge that we have to face up to.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to today&#039;s Budget debate. Clearly, today&#039;s theme has been education, but the Budget&#039;s overall theme has been how we cope with rapidly changing world circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_282">I welcome the particular emphasis this year on climate change and the strong indication that this policy area will be further developed over the coming weeks and months. A number of Members have already urged the Chancellor to go further, and I agree with many of their sentiments. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) pointed out last week in a thoughtful and well-argued contribution, it is also necessary to reach as far as possible a general consensus both inside and outside this place on how we are going to make the necessary changes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_283">A recent poll about people&#039;s perceptions of climate change, carried out by the University of East Anglia, showed that a very large percentage of people&#151;more than 90&nbsp;per cent.&#151;recognised that climate change was a major problem. But when asked who should deal with it, most pointed to multilateral institutions and to their own Government, rather than to action on the part of individuals. However, we know that we can make significant progress in reducing energy demand and, in turn, carbon emissions if we can greatly increase domestic energy efficiency and change entrenched daily habits such as the so-called school run.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_284">Our Government clearly have a role to play in moving energy efficiency forward, not only by setting better standards in building regulations, as was done in the Budget, and providing lower tax rates for more energy efficient technology, but also at times by encouraging a different mindset in our citizens. I am reminded of the long, often fractious debate about smoking in public places. I observed the implementation of the ban in Scotland just yesterday; there was surprisingly little fuss and already a growing perception that the vast majority of the population, including the majority of smokers, now see the ban as a necessary step to better health for the country as a whole.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_285">We need to expand the debate on climate change to all sections of our community, but we also need to accept that it will include making tough decisions, which is why I welcome the indexing proposals for the climate change levy. I hope that the Government will feel able to go much further both on vehicle taxation, especially as the relative cost of driving has gone down in recent years, and on aviation.

<a name="stpa_286">In the longer term, we need to consider a much larger expansion of congestion charging and investing more in the Cinderella of public transport&#151;no, not cycling but buses. I am delighted that the national bus scheme for the elderly and disabled will be extended to England. As Members are aware, Scotland will start its scheme next month, although I hope we can manage to make sure that if senior citizens want to travel between Gretna Green and Carlisle, that will be included in the scheme. We already enjoy a free scheme throughout the whole of Strathclyde, which has made a tremendous difference to the quality of life for many of our senior citizens. Some ingenious journeys have been undertaken. I heard last week that two ladies from Kilmacolm in West Renfrewshire regularly take a bus via Glasgow to Campbeltown to buy fresh fish&#151;a journey of more than 200&nbsp;miles.

<a name="stpa_287">On a more serious note, greater use of buses by one section of our community will help to change the mindset about that mode of transport and will, I hope, also encourage younger generations to see its benefits for their daily journeys. I impress on the Government, however, that both in Whitehall and in the Scottish Executive we need to tackle the continuing problems caused by the deregulation of bus services, so that services are seen to be regular and reliable at all times of the day and night, to encourage greater use.

We need to show long-term support for that industry if its market share is to grow to the extent that it becomes part of our everyday choice in providing energy for our local communities. Unfortunately, as I found recently, it is still difficult to purchase the right type of energy-efficient light bulb. If anyone has managed to buy the equivalent of a 100&nbsp;W bayonet bulb, they are doing well because those bulbs are certainly not to be found in most shops.

There are some good examples that we can follow from this country and around the world, and we need to ensure that such provisions are fully integrated in our planning and building proposals. Today we heard the good news that wind turbines are being installed faster than predicted, which shows a real interest and keenness to pursue that market.

Our economy is heavily dependent on world trade, particularly in our services sector, so any rise in protectionist sentiments is clearly of concern. Symptoms of the problem are already evident in the current World Trade Organisation negotiations, which at best will achieve a much narrower set of agreements than was originally hoped. The underlying problem is a growing disconnection on a global scale between growth and employment creation rates. The UK&#039;s main strength over the last eight years has been to focus our principal priority on creating more jobs, but that picture has not been replicated elsewhere.

<a name="stpa_292">The consequences will undoubtedly affect us all, which is why it is crucial that at international level, whether through the EU, the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank, we consider how to align labour policies more closely with developments in trade, and ensure that we have the ability to react quickly to rapid change. That is why the specific measures announced on extending research and development support to medium-sized enterprises and the strong emphasis on supporting science at all levels is so crucial.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-28_para16">
<a name="stpa_293">A number of those measures are specific to England, but the move to enable pupils to study three sciences at GCSE is sensible. There is growing concern about the small number of undergraduate students choosing science, and we need to reverse that trend. Last Friday I had the pleasure of opening new X-ray labs in the chemistry department of Glasgow university, and when I discussed that issue with the staff they said that they had no problem in recruiting students. The key to that was the fact that their four-year course allows students to specialise after their first year at university. The world of university science is very different from that of the school, and choices can be made better when students are following their university course.

<p>
<a name="60327-28_para17">
<a name="stpa_294">Glasgow offers a good example of universities working together. Under the Westchem initiative, Glasgow and Strathclyde universities share their resources and offer a joint service to the private sector, ranging from BP to local small and medium-sized enterprises. As was pointed out earlier, there has been a considerable increase in investment, with new cutting-edge equipment that allows enterprises to compete at a global level. We need to make sure that such initiatives are expanded throughout the UK.

<a name="stpa_298">I want particularly to deal with the latter point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_299">I think we would all agree that there is a certain imbalance in the structure of the British economy. The importance of the financial services industry has become utterly pre-eminent, as the decline in manufacturing and manufacturing employment has taken place in this country. The Chancellor has appointed a panel to look at the financial services industry&#151;some great and good individuals who will meet somewhat infrequently&#151;but our real concern, which we must really examine, must be that the burden of regulation does not become too oppressive in this country. Unlike manufacturing, which is difficult to move, it is much easier for the financial services industry to move to Shanghai, for example, to locate the headquarters of a bank. It is not only the tax regime that we have to worry about, but the regulatory burden.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_300">In the past few years, a culture of regulatory self-protection has grown up in this country. Instead of appointing a panel, the Chancellor should have looked carefully at the functioning of regulation, especially across the economy and the vital financial services industry. There should be an additional, fundamental remit for the Financial Services Authority on competition and competitiveness. The FSA should have independent directors, principles-based direction and a moratorium on EU regulation, accompanied by mutual recognition of other regulatory systems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_301">The British Chambers of Commerce has expressed disappointment that the Chancellor did not produce specific targets across Departments for the reduction of regulation on business. After all, 2006&nbsp;is meant to be the year of delivery for deregulation. The BCC argues that the cost of regulation has grown by some &#163;50&nbsp;billion since 1998. The Government have not sought an official measurement of the administrative cost of regulation imposed on business, which disproportionately affects small businesses. The obsessive micro-management that has become a characteristic of this Government is a beanfeast for lawyers and accountants.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_302">It is worth remembering what the Labour manifesto said in 1997, which echoes the powerful point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) earlier:


</p>

The Secretary of State was interviewed yesterday on television, and said that the devastating cuts in employment in the NHS, the reductions in wards and beds and the hospital closures were all to do with improving patient care.

For the Prime Minister&#039;s constituency the figure is &#163;1,442&nbsp;and for that of the Secretary of State for Health it is &#163;1,306. Even for that of the Secretary of State for Education and Skills it is &#163;1,245. It is curious that all the spending has moved towards the urban parts of our country, especially the north.

The successive changes to the formula have moved funding away, linked with a lack of recognition of the age profile in certain areas.

There is no point in rattling out vast sums of money without recognising the devastating impact of the effect of the spending formula. It is causing real distress, and I dare say the Chancellor recognises that, which is why he left out any comment on a situation that is making headlines all over the country. People are desperately concerned about it. It is the price we are paying for not reforming our public services. The tax burden has increased, but we are not getting value for money out of the huge increases in the spending of taxpayers&#039; money that we have seen in the past few years.

 The Chancellor has obviously been spending his time at Cape Cod in Massachusetts to the benefit of this country by talking to people at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology about subjects such as innovation and the creation of new products and so on. He has brought that to this country in an interaction at Cambridge university with MIT, whereby young people can interplay between the two institutions on their courses, come up with new, bright ideas and show a way forward for international co-operation in research. Again, that is mirrored across the world, as we find that published papers on industrial and scientific matters include the names of people not just from one country, but sometimes from 12&nbsp;countries.

<a name="stpa_320">When we talk about young people, the real problem comes from the research assessment exercise. Not only has that exercise made teaching less productive and something not to put as much effort into as publishing research papers and getting high grades and therefore the money, it has also effected the young people who are part of that process and employed on temporary contracts. I understand absolutely why young people do not want to go into science after university. They want to go into the City and elsewhere because there is no permanent career structure for them. I know that there is no permanent career structure for anyone&#151;particularly, MPs, of course&#151;but people are owed five to 10&nbsp;years in a job to exploit and understand the areas in which they are interested.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_321">Of course, the problem starts in our school system, where people are turned off science and do not want to study at our universities. I have talked about higher education, but this is also relevant in primary schools. Young people are interested in science; they are fascinated by it. They watch David Attenborough&#039;s programmes about the world. They want to go on field studies and see what the world is like. They want to talk about intelligent design&#151;whatever that might mean&#151;and compare it with Darwinism and so on. They want to talk about stem cells. There are many areas of fascination.

 I thank my hon. Friend for that question. I would make watching those programmes compulsory in schools. The problem in schools is not a lack of interest among young people about science, climate change and so on. For example, there are a huge number of university forensic science courses. Forensic science is developing in our universities because of Amanda Burton on television. Everyone wants to be Amanda Burton, and there is no doubt about that when we see certain people in white coats who look much more glamorous than others.

 My hon.

Attention needs to be given to university pay scales, certainly those of principal lecturers, because they have weakened considerably since I taught in higher education. We need to do something on that score, do we not?

 That is an absolute factor for many people, but many other people are in higher education not for the money, but for the fascination of finding out about the world, why things exist and where they came from. That excites young people, too, but they never get the chance to get their hands dirty doing practical work. Schools need high-flying lab facilities so that the teacher is not doing things for young people but young people are doing things for themselves. When young people find something out and want to find something else out and the teacher says, &quot;You must carry on with what the curriculum tells you to do,&quot; that is nonsense. They should be allowed to develop and explore attitudes and phenomena for themselves. That is what is missing. The science and technology curriculum in British schools is rotten.

One of the greatest things is for a person to be able to teach a class and inspire them. That is hard work and it may not be paid well, but, by gosh, when one meets students whom one has taught or young people whom one has gone into a school and helped&#151;many people do that now&#151;and one sees what they turn out like, it is wonderful.

 I do not want to pour cold water on that wonderful speech, but I might bring Members back down to earth ever so slightly. The Budget was based on a 2&nbsp;per cent. inflation figure. I know that the retail prices index basket has to include a large number of items to come to an average inflation figure, but my constituents on low and modest wages are paying council taxes at twice that rate. The petrol that they are filling their cars up with to go to work has increased at four times that rate. They are paying gas and electricity bills that are rising at 10&nbsp;times the official inflation rate. The figure of 2&nbsp;per cent. bears little semblance to reality for them. For some of the heavy energy users&#151;the businesses in my constituency, which have seen prices rise by 100&nbsp;per cent. in the past year or so&#151;a 2&nbsp;per cent. inflation figure is something of a fantasy compared with the 25, 26&nbsp;or 27&nbsp;per cent. surcharges that they are having to put on the cost of goods as they leave the factory gate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_326">The Budget was very thin. The Royal Bank of Scotland described it as &quot;Heavy on Light Measures&quot;. It also analysed it as a modest &quot;give-away&quot; of some &#163;380&nbsp;million in the forthcoming year, with a net tightening of &#163;740&nbsp;million over the course of the next three years. That means that the Chancellor took 61&nbsp;minutes to announce an adjustment of perhaps 0.07&nbsp;per cent. of total receipts. However, even that RBS analysis masks the multitude of minor micro-management adjustments that were announced and further disguises the many omissions from the Budget.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_327">One key omission was the lack of any significant measure to encourage more investment at home. The differential between investment from the UK overseas and investment from overseas coming to the UK was some &#163;21&nbsp;billion last year. It seems extraordinary that &#163;3.47&nbsp;billion of UK money was invested in UK offshore islands and some &#163;6.27&nbsp;billion was invested in Bermuda. Perhaps the Chancellor&#039;s biggest omission was his failure to consider a way of closing that gap to stop that &#163;10&nbsp;billion or &#163;11&nbsp;billion being parked&#151;sorry, invested&#151;in Sark and Bermuda.

<a name="stpa_328">We also note that the pre-Budget report increased the tax in the North sea by some 25&nbsp;per cent. Last week&#039;s Budget was an opportunity to redress some of that and to encourage the exploitation of heavy oil, which sells at some $10&nbsp;a barrel less than other oils, in the central North sea. It could also have encouraged the development of new resources west of Shetland and exploration in the very deep waters west of Scotland. However, the Chancellor chose not to do that. Instead, through changes to taxation on blended oils, he actually grabbed &#163;200&nbsp;million. If that &#163;200&nbsp;million had been invested rather than grabbed, the Government could have removed the supplementary charge from tariff contracts to encourage the development of the small fields that are required to use existing technology, levelled the playing field for new entrants by increasing the extent to which unrelieved allowances are reimbursed, extended research and development tax credits to North sea activities, encouraged investment in heavy oil extraction and introduced a floor of $30&nbsp;a barrel below which the supplementary charge would not apply. However, the Chancellor took the &#163;200&nbsp;million instead, and thus set back exploration and development and, potentially, threatened jobs.

 As the secretary of the all-party offshore oil and gas industry group, I have to challenge the hon. Gentleman&#039;s assertions.

Of course it would like to have the money, but it is strange that the hon. Gentleman is pleading for the private companies. People would say that, when those companies make such a profit, they deserve to spend a little &#163;200&nbsp;million for public services.

<a name="60327-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_329">Having made my points about oil, I acknowledge that there were things to welcome in the Budget, not least the joint study with Norway on carbon capture. As I have said previously, that will commence with emissions from power stations to utilise some of the 750&nbsp;gigatonnes of capacity in wells in the North sea. However, if the Government were serious about encouraging the use of more renewables in the fight against global warming and climate change, the Budget would have been the opportunity to address an imbalance in connection charges, which are the single biggest financial obstacle to efficient, large-scale, offshore wind production of electricity as part of the UK&#039;s energy supply. It is ludicrous that generators can be subsidised by &#163;8.20&nbsp;a kW in the south of England, yet perhaps charged &#163;24.89&nbsp;to connect to the grid in the north of Scotland. That problem must be addressed if we are seriously to examine the massive potential for offshore wind and help to tackle climate change and global warming.

It is doubly fraught if it is based on a 2007&nbsp;growth forecast of between 2.75&nbsp;and 3.25&nbsp;per cent because the low end of that range is higher than the industry consensus. If the Government&#039;s forecasts on growth and the tax take are wrong&#151;we know that they were last year&#151;the economy could well be on a knife edge. We would be mortgaged to the hilt and massively in debt, with the family silver sold off. With spending forecast to rise by &#163;25&nbsp;billion, &#163;26&nbsp;billion, or &#163;27&nbsp;billion every year until 2010&#150;11, public sector debt forecast to rise year on year to &#163;610&nbsp;billion by 2010&#150;11&nbsp;and the treaty debt calculation due to rise year on year to &#163;700&nbsp;billion by 2010&#150;11, there will be no room to manoeuvre if any of the calculations are wrong.

That is vital, especially for us in Scotland. We recently identified three things for which English-only spending was attributed to Scotland. The numbers were simply fiddled and the accounts looked wrong. Those three things were the moneys that went to inward investment for England, to the English Tourism Council and to the English Prison Service. It was right and proper that all that money was spent wholly in England, and right and proper that none of it was spent in Scotland. It was ludicrous, therefore, that some of it should have been calculated or assessed as unidentifiable and an allocation then awarded to Scotland for spending that did not take place.

 It has been interesting to listen to the tone of the debate, but at least we are talking about resources. If we go back pre-1997, as some Conservative Members did, I remember that we were talking about high interest rates and hospital closures. The Government have been attacked on their handling of the NHS, but do hon. Members remember people sleeping on trolleys because they could not get beds? That is the Tory record that the Conservatives want to inflict on us if they ever get into power again. The House will no doubt remember the 3&nbsp;million to 4&nbsp;million unemployed. Many of those were young people.

<a name="stpa_341">The Government have pumped significant resources into education&#151;a subject that we have discussed a great deal tonight&#151;and the NHS. However, while I accept that they have pumped a lot of money into research and development and skills, they are still not doing enough, as has emerged in tonight&#039;s debate. The west midlands economy, for example, has a turnover of &#163;77&nbsp;million, which suggests what can be generated in a region that I have always considered to be the country&#039;s economic

<a name="60327-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_342">It could be argued that the west midlands is starting to swing away from manufacturing into service industries, but the region&#039;s MPs must make sure that there is proper investment in skills and manufacturing so that we can bolster manufacturing. As the House probably knows, Peugeot has still not made a declaration about the Coventry plant. I do not want to be alarmist, but people in Coventry want to know what is going on. I accept, however, that Ministers have taken part in discussions with the company about future investment. We should not forget the problems with Rover in the past few years, including recent problems in Coventry when some Jaguar operations moved from the city to other parts of the west midlands. We have not lost jobs overall in the west midlands, but we did lose jobs from the home of the Jag. Only two or three days ago, however, Ford announced more investment in research and development operations at Whitley, where 2,000&nbsp;to 3,000&nbsp;jobs will be created. Overall, Coventry has received about &#163;4&nbsp;billion in investment in the past few years, which says a lot about the Government, who have been accused of burdening business with red tape by some people.

 Wherever possible we must work towards harmonisation in the UK, and free travel is one service where we can achieve that. Most people, including pensioners, like to travel, so why not offer free extended travel across the border? From certain parts of Northumberland it takes only an hour to travel to Edinburgh, which enhances the case for free travel.

<a name="60327-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_344">I accept that the Government have done a great deal over the years for pensioners. However, as my right hon. Friend the Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers) said, politicians from all parties must stop playing political football with pensions and achieve consensus so that we can solve the problem. I do not accept that it is all the Chancellor&#039;s fault, because there are a number of factors at play. Nevertheless, there is a pensions problem and people up and down the country are awaiting the outcome of the Federal-Mogul case. Some hon. Members will have constituency experience of that case, as many people have been waiting two or three years to find out the future of their pension. Federal-Mogul is locked in the American courts, so I welcome the fact that the Government established the Pension Protection Fund. However, we must consider whether we should increase that fund, as there will be many demands on it in future. I believe that we should certainly look at ways and means of doing so.

<br>&nbsp;<br>the important thing is not to lose touch with the sharp end. Whether it is the reorganisation of the police force or the health service in the west midlands, we must not lose touch with the sharp end; otherwise the public will become disillusioned with the service that we are trying to provide.

<a name="60327-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_346">The other issue that is causing concern in places such as Stafford is the amalgamation of the ambulance service. People think they have a very good ambulance service and are worried that if it is amalgamated with the west midlands service they may not enjoy a service of the same standard in the future. We west midlands politicians must continue to put pressure on the Secretary of State to make sure that that does not happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_347">We cannot duck the issue of budget deficits in the health service. Those are not necessarily caused by the Government. The introduction of any new system&#151;in this case, a system of payment by results&#151;inevitably causes turmoil. That is recognised by most people who know about change and management. A further problem that has emerged in the health service, although we do not yet know the scale of it, arises from the use of a different method of accounting. It appears that in some instances deficits have been hidden for a number of years and are only now coming to light. The management of the health service needs to be sorted out, and its financial structure must be better managed and accounted for. I hope that compulsory redundancies can be avoided and that we can get some form of agreement with the trade unions.

<a name="60327-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_348">We heard earlier about a possible series of strikes over local authority pensions. We must get talks going to resolve the matter. It is not in the interest of those who will receive the pensions, any more than it is in our interest, to see such disputes continue. People feel that their pensions are to be changed, despite promises made to them by employers. We should repeat to the public sector what we have said to the private sector: employers should try, as far as possible, to meet those aspirations and the commitments that they gave.

<a name="stpa_349">Finally, the Budget was steady&#151;some might say neutral. It contained some encouraging items, such as nursery provision and an increase in family tax credits. The Government have continued to focus on poverty. Britain might be wealthy but there are pockets of great social deprivation, and as politicians of whichever party, we should never lose track of that. I welcome all the measures in the Budget that deal with social deprivation.

This is not a criticism specifically of the schools in my constituency, which do a very good job. However, of the businesses that responded to my survey, 64&nbsp;per cent. raised skills as the main problem for them, and of that group, 72&nbsp;per cent. said the problem was getting worse, not better. This is a fundamental issue for the competitiveness of the United Kingdom, and it needs to be addressed.

<p>
<a name="60327-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_352">Instead of raising the skills of our work force, one of the ways in which the Government have been tackling the skills gap has been to import skills from elsewhere. For example, my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski), whose constituency borders mine, regularly reminds the House that the shortage of dentists has been filled by dentists from his homeland, Poland. I have always taken his comments with a pinch of salt, but the point was graphically illustrated by the recent publication of an e-mail in which the British ambassador to Warsaw, Ambassador Crawford, stated that Her Majesty&#039;s Government have

I welcome more money for schools, although I have not been overwhelmed by the increase, which appears to be close to 1&nbsp;per cent. of the total schools budget, but it is welcome none the less. To echo the comment made by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), I urge the Government seriously to examine the allocation policy.

One area in my constituency is among the top 25&nbsp;most deprived areas in this country. The issue does not solely relate to urban areas, because deprivation occurs in rural areas, too, and I urge the Government to examine the funding formula.

<a name="stpa_355">On further education, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills has referred to a level playing field, which I would welcome, too, but I do not welcome the levelling of buildings. In my constituency, Bridgnorth college was closed last year and the site is being prepared for levelling. I urge the Financial Secretary to make a commitment in his winding-up speech that the proceeds raised by the sale of the sites of colleges of education that are being shut down in rural areas will be reinvested in the area where the facilities have been shut rather than being transferred to supposedly more deserving areas, which leaves even less provision for those in rural areas.

<a name="60327-32_para16">
<a name="stpa_357">Since the Budget, many commentators have referred to problems with the presentation of statistics. On Sunday, <i>The Business</i> carried an article in which its correspondent, Allister Heath, discussed the way in which the Chancellor has chosen to portray productivity in this country as improving rather than the actual trend, which is declining. When the Chancellor was appointed too many years ago, he saw productivity as one of the main benchmarks for his success, and the article discusses that point:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54">&quot;His main trick was to break down the UK&#039;s productivity performance into three periods: 1972&nbsp;to 1986; 1986&nbsp;to the first half of 1997; and Labour&#039;s election to the third quarter of 2001, a period he claimed to be the first half of the current cycle. This allowed him to claim that the growth in output per worker had hit 2.13&nbsp;per cent. a year in the final period against 1.93&nbsp;per cent. and 1.5&nbsp;per cent. in the previous two .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The truth, as the official figures for output per worker reveal, is the exact of the opposite of the great performance that Brown chose to boast about. Productivity growth averaged 2.6&nbsp;per cent. a year between 1992&nbsp;and 1997&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="stpa_359">It declined further to 1.3&nbsp;per cent. between 2001&nbsp;and 2005. In the past 12&nbsp;months, it has declined even further to 0.4&nbsp;per cent. So much for the Chancellor&#039;s productivity growth. I look forward to seeing how the ONS will portray that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-32_para19">
<a name="stpa_360">I turn to something that I suspect arrived in the Budget as an afterthought&#151;the assault on the trust industry. Several Members have referred to the impressive growth in, and our reliance on, financial services. The trust sector is a critical part of that. By seeking to impose such significant taxation changes on accumulation and maintenance trusts and other trust types, the Chancellor will drive a coach and horses through that industry and force it offshore. He may not have appreciated that many of these trusts have nothing to do with inheritance&#151;they are to do with protecting assets, initially for minors and then for other young people while they are still in their formative years. Some were set up during the crusades to help estates not to fall into the wrong hands in the event of knights being toppled from their chargers overseas. This is a serious measure to propose with the flick of a pen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-32_para20">
<a name="stpa_361">In the brief time that I have left, I should like to raise three issues that were not mentioned in the Budget. First, there is the credibility gap over pensions. The right hon. Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers) devoted much of his speech to that. I think that he was a bit economical as regards the way in which the Chancellor chose to present some of the pension-related measures in the Budget. A year ago, the Chancellor made great play of the fact that the council tax rebate for pensioners was being doubled from &#163;100&nbsp;to &#163;200. That was not mentioned last week when it was abolished, with the result that pensioners&#039; council tax will have soared by more than 20&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-32_para21">
<a name="stpa_362">The right hon. Member for North Tyneside also talked about Labour&#039;s responsibility for dealing with the pensions crisis that has been created. There is indeed a responsibility. I look forward to seeing what happens with Turner and deeply regret the fact that the Chancellor did not refer to that.

<a name="60327-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_364">I want to focus not only on education but on manufacturing policy, and particularly the interrelationship between the two. My basic point is that I find nothing more heartbreaking than able, well-educated young&#151;or not so young&#151;people in my constituency being faced with the stark choice between leaving their community to get a decent job or forfeiting that opportunity to be nearer to their families. People should not have to choose between their community and their career. Social justice does not depend on the town one calls home&#151;good jobs must be available wherever people live.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_365">As we have more than doubled the national average of people employed in manufacturing in Burnley, I am firmly convinced that British manufacturing can succeed in the 21st century. As an Amicus MP, I am proud to be part of the trade union that campaigned sincerely and hard for that success. I simply do not agree with people who say that manufacturing is something of the past&#151;a 20th century preoccupation that is destined to be replaced. Although the sector may have declined as a proportion of our economy, it is still strong and important, and with the right policies it can have a bright future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_366">The best of British manufacturing is definitely still the best in the world. I am proud to say that we have some of that excellence in my constituency, with companies such as Baxi Potterton, Aircelle, Tenneco Walker, TRW and Smiths Aerospace, to name but a few. The challenge we face, in Burnley or in Britain as a whole, is to ensure that we innovate to stay ahead in a fast-moving, competitive world. We do not want to&#151;and we should not&#151;compete on the basis of wages. Instead, we must compete by simply being the best. I want consumers around the world to choose British&#151;preferably Burnley&#151;products because they are the smartest, cleverest and most desirable bits of kit that money can buy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_367">To achieve that, our firms need continually to innovate and train to stay ahead of the competition. Most of the responsibility for that lies with managers. After all, they need to do it to satisfy their shareholders, but the Government can help and the Budget does that. It helps by extending the research and development tax credit to companies of between 250&nbsp;and 500&nbsp;employees; reaffirming our commitment to science and extending the remit of the technology strategy board; streamlining our support for small businesses and increasing the focus on the effect of Government procurement on the economy; supporting the manufacturing advisory service, which, in the north-west alone, has helped companies achieve &#163;120&nbsp;million in productivity improvements; and, of course, continuing to resource the regional development agencies.

<a name="stpa_368">In my constituency, the RDA is leading an exciting project, which is in its early stages. It is working with the University of Central Lancashire and the learning and skills council to bring a university campus to Burnley&#151;with, I hope, a professorship in advanced manufacturing&#151;alongside an enterprise centre and a revamped Burnley further education college. In the world of advanced, 21st century manufacturing, the availability of appropriate skills will ultimately determine where a firm locates. That is why the Chancellor is right to make this a Budget for education. School results are already improving under the Government and we must continue the reforms so that everyone, regardless of where they live or the school they attend, has the best possible education. I welcome the Budget&#039;s provisions to give more cash to schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_369">The main point about education that I want to highlight relates to the new deal. Although the Conservative party mocked and scorned it, hundreds of thousands of people are now in work, contributing to society and supporting their families because of the new deal. In my part of the world people are in work, but I often hear the complaint that the jobs are simply not good enough. People welcome the minimum wage, but they do not want to work in minimum wage jobs. The most important determinant of one&#039;s salary is the amount of training under one&#039;s belt. I have therefore long believed that the Government should not step away when someone enters employment. It is in the interests of Britain and the individual that the support should continue. We have conceded the principle for tax credits and we now need to do it for careers advice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_370">Once someone is in work, the priority must be to get the necessary training to climb rapidly up the ladder, bring more income home and get the skills that employers need for their companies to compete more effectively. The best way to get a good job is to get a job. We have invested in lifelong and adult learning, but we can be smarter. After all, the Government know who the low earners in the economy are because they have everyone&#039;s tax records. Why not use that information, in the confines of the law on data protection, to provide individualised careers advice, training and support for the lowest earners in society&#151;a new deal for those already in work? I warmly welcome the Chancellor&#039;s announcement in the Budget of the prospect of expanding the new deal for those in work who want to improve their skills. I look forward to the results of the review by Lord Leitch on what can be done.

<a name="60327-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_371">Social justice should not depend on the town we call home. We need to spread power, wealth and opportunity throughout poorer as well as richer areas.

Like her, I believe that there is a future for British manufacturing, but the key is continued investment in research and development so that we can innovate in the way she suggested.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_372">My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) cited many statistics, to which I would add one more. Output per worker failed to increase at all in the year to the third quarter of 2005, adding to the slip in productivity that we have seen over the past few years. The emphasis on productivity is essential for the future of jobs and wealth creation in this country, in terms of ensuring that we have a growing economy to which we can positively look forward. A number of elements will influence our productivity. One is research and development, to which I will return in a moment. Another is the focus on skills. We must ensure that we have a work force that is fit for purpose for delivering the productivity growth that will be essential if we are to compete in the global economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_373">The Government have announced their White Paper on further education today. They have obviously recognised the problem, in that they state:

We need to look forward to what will happen in the future, and Lord Leitch&#039;s interim report on the country&#039;s long-term skills needs to 2020&nbsp;is extremely informative in that regard. He highlights the fact that improving the skills only of young people will not be enough, given that 70&nbsp;per cent. of the working-age population in 2020&nbsp;will have already completed their compulsory school education, and that half the 2020&nbsp;work force is already over 25&nbsp;years old.

<br>&nbsp;<br>employees. During the course of an employee&#039;s lifetime in the workplace, there will be a continuing need for them to change and to be flexible. That is going to be more difficult for those who do not have basic numeracy or literacy skills. According to the CBI, eight out of 10&nbsp;jobs require basic competence in literacy and numeracy. Then there is the personal impact of the lack of those skills on individuals. Many employees without basic skills in reading, writing or adding up live in daily fear of being found out. They do not take promotion for fear that they will be unable to meet the challenges involved. They are afraid of being found out and perhaps losing their jobs.

<p>
<a name="60327-33_para15">
<a name="stpa_379">Those are the direct personal costs involved. It is interesting to hear that some companies are seeking to address the problem by offering what one might call shadow information and communications technology courses. There might be computers in the training room, but the emphasis for the employee is very much on basic skills in reading and writing, rather than on computer skills. I suppose that that highlights the ingrained challenges.

As I have highlighted, half of our 2020&nbsp;work force is already aged 25&nbsp;and over, and therefore will not be directly affected. The proposals do not deal with the basic skills that I have highlighted because they are pitched much higher. The initiatives do not address the fundamental issues of upskilling and ensuring that we meet the productivity challenge.

In many ways, the problem is that the Government have not provided enough encouragement and incentivisation for business to do that. Against the backdrop of heavy regulation and a heavy tax burden, firms are being actively discouraged from investing properly in their workers and ensuring training for their work force.

The problem is that that target will simply not be met. Despite being an apparent advocate of the Lisbon agenda, the Government&#039;s national action plan highlights their failure by admitting only to an &quot;ambition&quot; that R and D expenditure will reach 2.5&nbsp;per cent of GDP, and then only by 2014.

<a name="stpa_385">My constituency has a large skills gap at every level: at university level, in higher skills and in intermediate and basic skills. I am pleased that University College Northampton now has full university status, and I hope that that will both plug the skills gap at the higher level and serve to drive up standards across the whole school sector. I also welcome the Government&#039;s extra funding for our schools&#151;a total investment of &#163;115&nbsp;million in a major schools reorganisation, with the aim of improving on a history of under-achievement in schools in Northampton.

<a name="stpa_386">In that context, I welcome the announcements about extra spending in schools, which will build on the Government&#039;s good track record. I would, however, like more clarification. Our schools are all tied into a major private finance initiative scheme. I hope that there will be flexibility in the structuring of the extra finance so that we can improve some of the specifications of the PFI contract, or make it possible for head teachers to work collaboratively to commission some of the improved services that they want across the board.

<a name="stpa_387">I also welcome the changes proposed for further education, especially the recognition of the important role played by the sector in driving up skills standards and dealing with some of the areas of disadvantage with which other education sectors have not been able to deal. I welcome &quot;train to gain&quot;, because I think it important to ensure that when people are in work they do not simply stay at the level they have reached. It is well recognised that the Government have an obligation to improve their skills so that they can progress in their careers, and can retrain to meet changes in their sector of employment.

It can also be important in regenerating the economy in certain areas. We have observed the progress made by the street football schemes, and by some of the retraining schemes to help young people in the east end of London to become referees and coaches.

In real terms, investment has increased from &#163;51.9&nbsp;billion to &#163;81billion&#151;so health is getting the investment that it needs, and if there are problems with overspend, they must be examined at a local level.

I raise this issue today because I do not believe that the investment is being made in schools in England that is required to turn education round; rather, money is being invested in structural change, and massive sums are being invested in academies and specialist schools, which have yet to show that they can achieve what they are supposed to achieve.

Instead, this Government should be making proper quality assurance assessments. Such a body is to be set up, and someone described it as a quango, but quality assurance is about what happens in schools, the process that children experience as they go through school, and what happens when they leave.

No one is more impervious to change than the Chancellor. No Chancellor is more dogmatic or closed to fresh thinking. Yet again, we saw a Chancellor fixed on spending more, raising taxes and borrowing more. He has failed to learn the lesson that he cannot increase spending on public services without reforming them first.

Indeed, even the&nbsp;Education and Skills Committee&#039;s first report of the 2004&#150;05&nbsp;Session admits that there is no evidence to demonstrate that the spending increases under this Government have led to a step change in standards at GCSE level. Why has the increase in spending on education not flowed through to the step change in performance that our constituents and taxpayers have come to expect?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_413">Too often, spending priorities have been set by Departments to meet targets imposed by the Treasury, with no regard for effectiveness. Let us take just one example. Through ring-fenced programmes, the Government have spent nearly &#163;1&nbsp;billion to tackle the scourge of truancy in our schools, but since 1997&nbsp;truancy has increased by 30&nbsp;per cent. The money has been spent not on tackling the underlying causes, but to meet targets imposed on the Department for Education and Skills by the Chancellor.

Labour Members who block reforms aimed at improving the autonomy of our schools are blocking the step change in performance that our children need for their exam standards to increase.

<a name="stpa_416">On public spending, we have a Chancellor who is stuck in the past and who has yet to learn from his mistakes.

There continues to be a culture of central Government knowing best, and dictating how much money should be spent and how, rather than leaving those decisions in the hands of professionals. The failure to reform public services has meant that additional expenditure has failed to achieve a step change in performance. The Government have shied away from the reform of the public services needed to ensure that taxpayers get improvements in line with the increased expenditure: another lesson that the Chancellor&#151;the road block to reform&#151;has failed to learn.

There is nothing in the Budget to demonstrate that he understands the challenge that we face. Indeed, the tax burden is forecast to rise by &#163;5.5&nbsp;billion, not to fall.

That is why we now have the 10th highest rate of corporation tax among our competitors, rather than the 10th lowest, which he inherited from the Conservative party in 1997. On taxes, the Chancellor has failed to learn from his mistakes. He is stuck in the past, failing to act on the realities of a global economy, by not creating a tax system fit for the 21st century.

He is stuck in the past, failing to learn from his mistakes, failing to adjust to the global challenges from India, China and eastern Europe and failing to tackle the skills issues and deal with our increasingly complex tax base. High increases in spending have not led to the step change in public services that our economy and our country need, because reforms have been blocked. Money has been wasted, and to finance that spending he has taxed so much that our competitive position has been eroded. He has spent too much, taxed too much and borrowed too much. He is the road block to reform.

 This has been a shortened debate, but in a series of time-limited speeches&#151;there have been 15&nbsp;from Back Benchers on both sides of the House&#151;there have nevertheless been some important contributions. The themes ranged widely, but at the heart of the Budget and this debate on it, is the economy. As the Chancellor reported in the Budget, the British economy is stable, strong and strengthening. In each of his 10&nbsp;Budgets, he has been clear that his first priority for the UK economy has been, is, and will remain, stability. The decisive macro-economic reforms that he introduced in 1997&nbsp;to monetary policy, to fiscal policy and to the planning and control of public expenditure were designed first to establish and then to lock in stability and steady growth.

<p>
<a name="60327-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_425">For 50&nbsp;years, Britain&#039;s economy was prone to high and volatile levels of inflation. For 18&nbsp;years under the Tories, until 1997, Britain was the least stable of the major developed economies&#151;first in, last out, hardest hit by the recessions and world economic shocks. In contrast, in the Budget last week, the Chancellor reported that we have met our inflation target this year and in every year since 1997. In just a decade, long-term inflation expectations have virtually halved to 2&nbsp;per cent. Today, long-term interest rates are the lowest that they have been for 40&nbsp;years, at just 4&nbsp;per cent. He reported that inflation is currently 2&nbsp;per cent., which is on target. He reported that, in the latest quarter, the UK economy is growing at an annual rate of 2.5&nbsp;per cent., which is on target. He reported on broad tax revenue projections since the pre-Budget report, which are on target, and he reported on public finance figures against our fiscal rules, which are on target.

 If the hon. Gentleman looks at the public finance figures, he will see that, by 2007&#150;08, we will be spending &#163;6.4&nbsp;billion in capital investment in our schools. A high priority for that investment is science funding and science labs.

<a name="stpa_427">I will talk about the speeches from Front Benchers first. The hon.

There is nothing vague, as she put it, about the Chancellor&#039;s Budget commitments on education. First, there will be extra cash going directly to all head teachers from next month, with more to come next year. Secondly, there are hard figures on boosting the capital spending from &#163;5.6&nbsp;billion in our schools this year to &#163;8&nbsp;billion a year by 2010&#150;11, matching in five years for our state schools the capital spend per pupil currently going into private schools. The hon. Members for Brent, East and for Havant (Mr. Willetts) asked about the new money that will go directly to schools. There will be &#163;220&nbsp;million in the next financial year and &#163;365&nbsp;million in the year after that to boost personalised learning. More will go to schools with the greatest need and those with the pupils who are the lowest achievers.

<a name="stpa_428">One of the most important things that the hon.

 I thought I had made that clear in my speech, but I will try to give absolute clarity. Yes, we accept the increase in school spending and the capital spending pledge. We need more information about the time scale for the aspiration, although, of course, we support it. For us, the crucial aspiration is to match the standards in private education, not just the spending.

<p><a name="st_245"><a name="60327-37_spnew1"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 We have made progress since Budget day. Clearly the hon. Gentleman has disowned the comments made by his colleague, the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State earlier described the Conservative party&#039;s policy changes as flip-flops, and I have to say that she was right. The situation should concern everyone. I guess that there are some people who want to believe what the Leader of the Opposition says and his promises, but, frankly, the fiasco of the policy flip-flops following the Budget shows that when the Tories are put under pressure and the going gets tough, they give in.

Gentleman was also right to say that we need to boost research and development. However, he spoiled his comments by talking about the tax burden. He knows that this Labour Chancellor cut the main rate of corporation tax, the rate of small business corporation tax and the rate of capital gains on business assets. He knows that the tax burden is still lower than it was at its peak under Baroness Thatcher in 1984. He also knows that, according to the OECD, the net direct tax burden for the average working family has halved since the Labour Government came into office.

<a name="stpa_447">The great post-war Attlee Government identified three requirements for a just society&#151;free state education, free health care, and free access to justice. Although the provision of the last requirement has generally had a lower profile than the first two it is no less important. Protecting the vulnerable and ensuring the legal rights of everyone requires an efficient, effective and co-ordinated legal service. The Legal Services Commission and the CLS were established under the Access to Justice Act 1999. The vision behind the CLS was to ensure that everyone in society has access to justice through quality-assured legal advice, representation, education and information. It is not a single body or organisation&#151;it is defined in terms of its purpose, which is to promote the availability of legal services in civil law, including all the organisations and bodies that fund or provide civil legal advice services, with the Legal Services Commission acting as guardian of the service. Although an exciting concept, its very structure poses serious practical difficulties.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 653</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-37_para17">
<a name="stpa_448">It is perhaps easier to describe the CLS as a near-equivalent in law of the national health service. Like the NHS, the CLS should allow everyone the opportunity to receive specialist advice according to their need. As in medicine, legal advisers specialise in different fields. Welfare, education, employment rights and family law are just some of the common areas that the service covers. For the client to be best served, he or she should have access to the correct specialists. To continue the medical analogy, one would not go to see a dermatologist about a sore throat.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-37_para18">
<a name="stpa_449">I shall raise several issues in the debate. After six years, the challenges and problems that the service faces can be clearly identified. Research from the legal services research centre shows that there are likely to be over a million unsolved legal problems each year, and that only half of those with a legal problem choose to seek legal advice. Of those who do seek guidance, one in seven fail to receive any legal advice. It is also much more likely that if a client is facing one legal problem, they will also experience another related legal issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-37_para19">
<a name="stpa_450">The main challenges are the funding of the civil legal aid budget, the recruitment and retention of trained lawyers and advisers, the identification of the needs of the public, and the provision of a seamless legal advice service. The funding of the CLS has been identified as the most important concern of those working in the service. In spite of efforts to control spending, the annual legal aid budget has risen from &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion in 1997&#150;98, to over &#163;2.1&nbsp;billion last year, a rise of approximately 40&nbsp;per cent., or a 10&nbsp;per cent. increase in real terms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-37_para20">
<a name="stpa_451">Despite the rise, practitioners and consumers complain that the sum is not enough to retain good lawyers or to provide a first class service. The &#163;2.1&nbsp;billion funding has to be shared with the criminal defence service, as well as funding the administration of the Legal Services Commission. In the past seven years, spending on criminal legal aid rose by 37&nbsp;per cent. in real terms. As funding for civil legal aid is not ring-fenced, that rise has resulted in civil legal aid falling by 13&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-37_para21">
<a name="stpa_452">That has meant increasing pressure on legal advice providers in all areas that the CLS covers, and it is important that before the situation becomes critical, funding of the civil legal aid budget is put on a more sustainable and secure footing. This is a call not for unrestrained spending&#151;obviously, there is a limit to the amount that can be spent&#151;but to take forward proposals that can reduce pressure on the service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-37_para22">
<a name="stpa_453">Lord Carter seeks to provide a solution to the problems of funding legal aid. His recommendations include cutting the bureaucracy of the Legal Services Commission, and bringing in a market-based system for legal aid allocation and fixed-rate fees for certain types of cases. These proposals should be studied carefully. However, should the number of cases requiring criminal legal aid continue to rise, there will be a corresponding fall in the proportion of the budget allocated for the CLS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-37_para23">
<a name="stpa_454">Unfortunately, Lord Carter did not put the recruitment and retention of current legal aid practitioners in the terms of reference of his report.

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 654</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>The&nbsp;circumstances that the CLS faces in its efforts to provide legal advice have been well reported. It is a common sentiment of those working in legal aid that the system is facing a crisis, as more lawyers leave the service and fail to be replaced by younger newly qualified practitioners. Kevin Martin, president of the Law Society, has used such words as &quot;meltdown&quot; and &quot;disaster&quot;.

For example, the town of Leatherhead has not one single legal aid solicitor, and in the whole of Kent there are no legal aid solicitors offering housing advice. This puts advice organisations such as the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux in an impossible situation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-37_para25">
<a name="stpa_456">One bureau in the west midlands tried to advise a man whose ex-wife&#039;s new partner was in breach of a court order concerning access to the client&#039;s children. The client had a very real concern that his children were at risk from his ex-wife&#039;s partner, but the bureau was unable to find a community legal service solicitor within a 15-mile radius to help process an injunction. There are thousands of similar cases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-37_para26">
<a name="stpa_457">We must be clear that the failure to retain or recruit new solicitors for legal aid work is not the fault of those solicitors. It is not the case that these practitioners wish to work only on cases that pay well. Many newly qualified solicitors are likely to emerge in the legal world burdened with debt. After seven years of study, many students graduate holding loans of over &#163;20,000. A solicitor with a sense of social justice who practises wholly in legal aid is likely to earn less than a new recruit to the Metropolitan police. They must start paying back their debt and look to secure their future, but the amount that they would get paid under legal aid does not allow them to do so. We must wait for the final version of Lord Carter&#039;s report. I hope that it contains proposals on fixed-fee cases that are sufficiently attractive to halt or even reverse the decline in the number of legal aid solicitors.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-37_para27">
<a name="stpa_458">At the moment, two different services are attempting to cover the gaps in service left by those advice deserts. The specialist support service was created with organisations such as Shelter and the Child Poverty Action Group, and it includes people who have the relevant expertise to help those with problems in areas such as housing and family law. The tiny amount of &#163;2.9&nbsp;million a year is spent on the specialist support service, but, as my hon. Friends know, until last week the LSC had decided to terminate its funding. Last Wednesday, the LSC reversed that decision, and it will start a new consultation process, and I hope that the service and the consultation process will be improved. I welcome that U-turn and pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan), who led the campaign to get the LSC to reconsider its decision.

 I thank my hon. Friend for giving way and initiating this important debate. I know that he is as pleased as I am that the LSC has reversed its decision on the specialist support service following the Constitutional Affairs Committee report. Does he think that that threat to the specialist support 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 655</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>service showed the LSC&#039;s lack of understanding of the complex nature of the legal advice that is required? Citizens advice bureaux, other voluntary organisations and CLS direct need the back-up of the experts at the specialist support service to ensure that some of the most vulnerable people receive high quality legal advice.
</p>








<p><a name="st_254"><a name="60327-38_spnew1"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. As I have said, I believe that her leadership of the campaign resulted in the change. It is vital that we have a good consultation process, because if the consultation is good, the case will be made to keep the service going.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-38_para0">
<a name="stpa_459">The second service that was meant to relieve pressure on the Community Legal Service is CLS Direct, which is a telephone and internet service that members of the public approach directly. In some cases, an individual will have a query that can be answered without the need to see a solicitor. Last year, more than 210,000&nbsp;calls were made to the telephone service, with more than 500,000&nbsp;visitors to the website. This afternoon, my office phoned CLS Direct on behalf of Mrs. Valerie Volpi, who has suffered a fall, to see where and how she could seek guidance. After two attempts, we got through the automated system and managed to speak to a human being. We were told that unfortunately it could offer advice only on debt, housing and welfare benefits, but that it could provide Mrs. Volpi with the telephone number for her local CAB.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-38_para1">
<a name="stpa_460">The system is too bureaucratic. I have used the website and found it to be satisfactory in the way in which it provides explanations of basic points of law. With improvements, CLS Direct could be a very useful service, although there needs to be a campaign to raise awareness of its existence. I was very disappointed to find at a recent Select Committee meeting under the chairmanship of the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed that the acting chief executive of the LSC was unable to recall the number of the service, which is, for the benefit of the House, 0845 3454345. Although those services complement the work of the CLS, they cannot form a mainstream option for the provision of legal advice, because they will not be able to cope if the number of legal aid solicitors continues to decrease.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_461">The final area in which the CLS is under challenge concerns the clustering of legal problems. A survey showed that 46&nbsp;per cent. of all respondents with justice problems reported two or more problems, of whom 47&nbsp;per cent. reported three or more problems. Clustering can best be understood as a domino effect resulting from an initial legal aid problem. For example, a mother suffering from domestic violence due to her situation has a greater chance of becoming homeless, suffering poverty or experiencing other issues of family law. Of course, the longer it takes to deal with the initial situation, the more chance there is of its entering into other areas of civil, even criminal, law, requiring greater specialist knowledge, greater expense and the involvement of other authorities. Alternatively, situations can arise that immediately relate to several areas of law. It is incumbent on the Legal Services Commission to formulate a strategy that can quickly identify and deal with such cases to ensure a seamless service. That requires an holistic approach that has not yet been answered by the current network of CLS partnerships.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_462">In the five-year plan for the CLS that has just been published, the LSC informs us that it will abandon those partnerships and look towards the establishment and

<p><a name="st_255"><a name="60327-38_spnew2"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 I understand that 12&nbsp;of those centres are likely to be set up, including one in our own city of Leicester. Does my hon. Friend share my optimism about how they might operate, drawing on his distinguished service in the Belgrave law centre before he became an MP? Is he as happy as I am about the need to roll them out into the deserts that he mentioned? I am not sure that Leicester is necessarily one of those, but I am sure that it is a good place in which to pilot because of the multiple groupings of problems.
</p>








<p><a name="st_256"><a name="60327-38_spnew3"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. He is absolutely right. Leicester is a great place to pilot the new scheme. I am sure that that has nothing to do with the fact that I have secured this debate. One of the CLS&#039;s senior officials, the director of children&#039;s services, has said that it has had more pilots than British Airways. It is extremely important that we look carefully at the situation to assess whether the pilots are successful, but I am glad that they are coming to Leicester.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_463">I seek an assurance from the Minister that there is no question of the funding for the Law Centres Federation being removed. She comes from a long and distinguished tradition of involvement in this movement, and I would be very sad if she, of all Ministers, decided that this was the time to take away funding from Citizens Advice or from the Law Centres Federation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_464">Civil legal aid is usually overshadowed by the criminal legal aid branch. However, the CLS fulfils a vital role in ensuring a just and equitable society. For the clients involved, civil justice problems can have a devastating impact on their life. It is extremely important that we proceed to map out a very careful plan for the CLS. The Department for Constitutional Affairs, under the current Lord Chancellor, my right hon. and learned Friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton, and an excellent team of Ministers, has modernised our legal process beyond recognition, and that will be one of the true legacies of this Labour Government. However, it should not take away the intrinsic elements that have made our legal system the envy of the world.

<a name="stpa_465">I thank my hon. Friend for the warmth of the welcome that he gave me in my new portfolio of responsibilities. I particularly value it as it comes from him, as he has done so much in this House since 1987&nbsp;consistently to raise the issues of access to justice and the vital part that good quality legal services play in that. I hope that he will bear with me, as I took over this portfolio of responsibilities only last week.

<a name="60327-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_466">Like my hon. Friend, I am in politics because I want to be part of the effort to tackle poverty and social exclusion. Like him, I represent a constituency where 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 657</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>there are still problems of social exclusion. Like him, I regard it as important to ensure that my constituents have not only good schools and hospitals and a job, but their legal rights. We have tried&#151;indeed, he has been part of trying&#151;to make the law fairer. We have brought in laws that make things fairer for tenants, for employees, and for people who face discrimination. However, like him, I believe that there is only any point in those laws&#151;and all other laws that exist to make society fairer&#151;if everyone has access to good legal advice and the law is accessible to all. That has been our concern since we came into government in 1997.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-38_para8">
<a name="stpa_467">I acknowledge that, as my hon. Friend said, a great deal of unmet legal need continues to exist. Our concern about that was the basis of our introducing the Community Legal Service. Since then, I hope that there have not been too many legal initiatives, but several projects have tried to improve the quality of legal advice and assistance and get it to those who need it most. My hon. Friend mentioned CLS Direct. He is right that, as yet, it deals only with debt, housing and welfare benefits, but it already provides advice to 2,000&nbsp;people a week. Many of those would not get legal advice in any other way. That applies especially to young people, who want to get advice and information on the internet. However, I agree with my hon. Friend that the service needs further publicity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-38_para9">
<a name="stpa_468">We are also finding new ways to provide legal services so that, for example, we take them to where people are. That includes providing them at county court, where people face, for example, actions for housing possession, instead of expecting them to go to the lawyer&#039;s office. That helps 400&nbsp;people a week throughout the country. My hon. Friend rightly said that we need a seamless service instead of making people go from pillar to post. That lies behind the one-stop shop service in Leicester that he and my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) mentioned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-38_para10">
<a name="stpa_469">The number of people helped with legal advice for civil matters is 20&nbsp;per cent. higher than last year, especially with housing, mental health, debt and benefit problems. However, I am not here to tell hon. Members 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 658</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that all is rosy. We know that there is more to be done and that there are problems to tackle. The Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs highlighted those.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-38_para11">
<a name="stpa_470">One of the problems is that less money is spent on legal aid for family and civil cases now than in 1997. As my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East said, the overall legal aid budget has increased from &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion in 1997&nbsp;to &#163;2.1&nbsp;billion this year. However, that increase has been taken up with extra spending on criminal legal aid, which has increased from &#163;734&nbsp;million in 1997&nbsp;to &#163;1.169&nbsp;billion this year. That is a 37&nbsp;per cent. real increase against a background of a fall in the number of criminal cases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-38_para12">
<a name="stpa_471">However, the amount spent on civil and family legal aid has gone down from &#163;755&nbsp;million in 1997&nbsp;to &#163;722&nbsp;million, which, when one takes inflation into account, is the equivalent of a &#163;200&nbsp;million&#151;or 22&nbsp;per cent.&#151;real terms cut. That is one of the reasons why we have asked Lord Carter, to whom we are grateful, to review legal aid services. We are not simply waiting for his final report. We have already introduced the Criminal Defence Service Bill and tighter controls on the high cost criminal cases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60327-38_para13">
<a name="stpa_472">Our aim is to have a properly funded criminal legal aid system and to ensure that the civil and family system gets a larger share of the overall legal aid budget. My hon. Friend raised the important issue of specialist support services. He rightly paid tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan), who raised the matter not only in the Select Committee but in the Lobby with me on several occasions. She actively pressed that important point and I can confirm that the Legal Services Commission has committed itself to continuing to fund specialist support services while it undertakes a proper consultation on the future.
