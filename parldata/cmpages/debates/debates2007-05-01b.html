It is clear that the German Government would prefer to keep as much as possible of the constitutional treaty.

 The Foreign Secretary refers to the process of finding where consensus lies. In this House, we have found it extremely difficult to find out what the British Government&#146;s position is, never mind determining where consensus lies. Will she at least acknowledge that one of the biggest difficulties for the British Government is that there is a huge division between the needs of the countries in the eurozone, which will require greater political integration from such a document, and the needs of those that are outside it?</p>

 I believe that we have been quite clear about this. The Minister for Europe has set out on a number of occasions the principles on which we base our approach to the issue. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and the Dutch Prime Minister recently made it clear that we would certainly be looking not for a constitutional treaty but for an amending treaty that did not contain the characteristics of a constitution, but which might tidy up the rules of the European Union to make it operate more effectively. With regard to whether there is a difference of approach for those countries that are members of the eurozone, I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) takes a great interest in these matters, but, for my own part, I would be reluctant to say anything that encouraged the idea that there should be some kind of two-speed Europe.</p>

 Are not the mooted proposals for treaty change either so obviously in the interests of democracy and transparency, such as an increased role for national Parliaments, or so obviously in the national interest, such as reducing the numbers in the Commission while we keep a permanent seat, or reducing the current bias against us in the qualified majority voting system, that it is difficult to see how anyone could rationally want to oppose them? Furthermore, how could we possibly conceive of having a referendum on what are essentially procedural and administrative matters, or even on matters relating to personnel management and job description? If we are going to have a referendum on that kind of thing, surely we should simply put all the amendments in the Finance Bill this afternoon&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

 Following on from the interesting, predictable and common-sense view expressed by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), does my right hon. Friend agree that it is important in the public debate to draw the distinction between the management of the European Union&#151;especially in the Commission&#151;and the powers of its respective bodies?

 My hon. Friend makes an entirely sensible point. As the hon.

Members on both sides of the House have long called for a proper degree of greater subsidiarity.

They are being killed by sectarians: there are Sunni on Shi&#146;a murders, and Shi&#146;a on Sunni murders. Sometimes the murders are committed in Basra by criminal gangs, who are making millions out of smuggling petroleum products. My hon. Friend is right to highlight that. The British armed forces in Iraq are trying their best to make that country a much more stable and prosperous place than it is now. I believe that they will succeed when the Iraqis themselves have the will to take on that fight to provide the security that their people need. That is why we are helping, in very difficult circumstances, to train Iraqi policemen and soldiers.</p>

 Following on from what has been said about the tens of thousands of people who are now leaving Iraq and the internal conflict there, what prospect does the Minister think there is of the Iraqi Government hanging together in the near future given the enormous strains that are now on both Sunni and Shi&#146;a members of that Government?

 The hon.

I believe that that can be done. In the constitutional review that is under way in Iraq there will have to be imaginative thinking about, perhaps, forms of devolution and about trying to understand how it might be possible to reconcile the different pressures that there are in Iraq at present. That can be done, and in recent weeks Prime Minister Maliki has expressed a desire to do just that&#151;to make the Iraqi Government a more inclusive Government who reach out to encompass all parts of society.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has not had any discussions with the United Nations about the request to recover overpayments to claimants identified in the 2006 audit of the United Nations Compensation Commission. Her Majesty&#146;s Government, along with other permanent members of the governing council of the UNCC, agreed to the adoption of a &#147;best efforts&#148; approach to recover overpayments. We are taking such an approach in contacting concerned claimants. We are aware, however, that in some cases it will be difficult for claimants to repay the money, and we will handle them with due concern for the claimants&#146; welfare.</p>

 I certainly think that, in the case of my hon. Friend&#146;s constituent, that is an unreasonable demand. However, I am sure that he knows that there have been UNCC-approved compensation awards totalling $52 billion to 1.5 million claimants worldwide, and so far $21.8 billion has been paid out. That amounts to 5 per cent. of Iraqi oil revenues. The figures for Britain are that 5,000 United Kingdom claimants have received awards totalling $428 million. Those are large sums, but I take on board my hon.

For example, there is great concern about the implications that difficulties with the flow of the River Nile would have, both in Egypt and all along its course, and about the pressures caused by the possible migration of millions of people. My hon. Friend is therefore right to identify such challenges. It is very important that the countries of the world work together to adapt to the changes that are already inevitable and to head off those that are not, as they might be even more damaging.</p>

 One of the continuing obstacles to the middle east peace process is the presence of illegal settlements in the occupied territories. Notwithstanding the limited withdrawals from Gaza not long ago, the evidence is that the rate of increase of settlements on the west bank is growing; in fact, some settlers removed from Gaza are taking on new settlements in the west bank. What are the Government doing to increase pressure on Israel to stop the growth of illegal settlements in the occupied territories, which is now clearly undermining the peace process?</p>

The reason cited for the refusal is national security, but how can the Minister justify that cloak of secrecy when the paper was a draft document intended for publication, and when previous and subsequent drafts have been made available?

We want a political process pursued that can deliver lasting peace and stability and allow for much-needed humanitarian relief. The Government&#146;s annual development and humanitarian programmes provide &#163;21 million for Somalia, and the UK has provided a further &#163;3.5 million of humanitarian assistance following the fighting in recent months. We expect Somalia&#146;s transitional federal Government to show leadership and commitment in reaching out to all parts of Somali society and to intensify their dialogue with the clans in Mogadishu.</p>

 I thank the Minister for that response. Does he agree that considerable concern is growing about the role of the Ethiopian troops, and particularly about some of their activities in and around Mogadishu, and does he agree that we ought to do all that we can to support a political, rather than a military, solution?</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That is why we have engaged in the way that we have done.

 With permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I will bring the House up to date on the two security breaches of the medical training application service, MTAS, that arose last week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="70501-0003.htm_para3"><a name="07050142000169">As I explained in a written statement to the House last Friday, on Wednesday 25 April, a serious breach of security protection occurred on the MTAS website. To enable the necessary pre-employment checks to be carried out, personal details of medical graduate applicants for foundation programme posts were made available to the postgraduate deaneries on dedicated web pages. The information was loaded on to the site at about 8.30 am and the deaneries were notified of the relevant web page address for their area at 9.30 am. In making the information available to the deaneries, the MTAS contractor, Methods Consulting, failed to provide the usual and essential password security protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70501-0003.htm_para4"><a name="07050142000170">At about 2 pm, &#147;Channel 4 News&#148; became aware of the situation. At 4.35 pm &#147;Channel 4 News&#148; telephoned the Department of Health press office to inform it of the security breach. The Department checked the position and informed the contractor, who immediately arranged for all the personal details to be removed from the site. That was completed by 5.15 pm. The Department&#146;s security team undertook an immediate initial investigation, which has established that information on foundation programme applicants was accessed from just 21 different internet addresses, mostly belonging to postgraduate deaneries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70501-0003.htm_para5"><a name="07050142000171">The overwhelming majority of individual accesses before the security breach was closed came from an internet address belonging to ITN, the providers of &#147;Channel 4 News&#148;. The access by ITN began at about 2 pm and ceased at about 5 pm. More than two hours elapsed between ITN and &#147;Channel 4 News&#148; starting to access personal information and &#147;Channel 4 News&#148; actually notifying the Department of the security breach. <i> [Interruption.] </i>There is no evidence that members of the public or other commercial interests, apart from staff at ITN and &#147;Channel 4 News&#148;, accessed the site. None the less, it was an extremely serious breach of security, as well as a breach of contract between the IT provider and the Department of Health. The company concerned has taken appropriate action in relation to its staff, and it fully co-operated with our security investigations. We have already reported the situation to the Information Commissioner. I will also report it to Ofcom and draw it to the attention of the chairman of Channel 4 and ITN.</p>

It appears that, although the content of the message could be accessed, details of the sender and recipient could not be accessed. The Department of Health was advised of this second  <br>

problem at 3.45 pm on Thursday and informed the contractor, which closed the messaging facility. The whole site was then suspended just after 5 pm and remains suspended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70501-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07050142000173">In view of the two lapses, the IT contractor, Methods, immediately appointed an approved security company, MWR InfoSecurity, to carry out a full security review and penetration testing. Some weaknesses were identified and MWR InfoSecurity has been working with the contractor to rectify them. However, to provide further reassurance, the national technical authority for information assurance, Communications Electronic Security Group, is also advising the Department, and the MTAS site will be re-opened as soon as we have the necessary security assurances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="70501-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07050142000174">Those two security breaches were utterly deplorable.

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. There is no evidence that members of the public or other unauthorised people have in fact accessed personal information on MTAS. Furthermore, no applicant for the foundation programme or specialist training will be disadvantaged because of the two security breaches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="70501-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07050142000177">Already, following the recommendations of the review group chaired by Professor Neil Douglas, junior doctors have been offered the opportunity to change their training preferences. Following successful testing by junior doctors from the British Medical Association and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, nearly 26,000 specialist training applicants have reviewed their initial preferences and either revised or confirmed them. That process took place between 20 and 23 April, using MTAS, without security or technical problems. Where issues arose about a candidate&#146;s ineligibility, they will be resolved by the relevant deanery, which determines eligibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="70501-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07050142000178">As a result of the changes made to application preferences by junior doctors, around 15,500 additional interviews will be offered in England during the extended round 1. Although some interviews will be delayed because of the security problems, we still expect them to be completed by early June.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="70501-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07050142000179">There is no doubt that confidence in the applications system, MTAS, has been further damaged by these deplorable security breaches. That is why the Department and I are taking them extremely seriously and taking appropriate action. I apologise again to junior doctors or foundation programme applicants who have been caused anxiety or, in some cases, inconvenience as a result. I will, of course, continue to keep the House informed of further developments.</p>

 Once again, the Secretary of State has had to make a statement to the House about the appalling shambles that has become the Government&#146;s system of selecting training for junior doctors. I am sorry that the Secretary of State could not bring herself to say sorry. <i> [Interruption.]</i> It is interesting that in the copy of the statement that she sent to me beforehand, the word &#147;sorry&#148; does not appear at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="70501-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07050142000181">The right hon. Lady must understand that the most outrageous security breach has occurred.

It is astonishing that such an outrageous security breach could have happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="70501-0004.htm_para15"><a name="07050142000190">The Secretary of State went on to discuss what is happening now to junior doctors. She said that they are continuing to go through the process without further security or technical problems. I have received 14 examples of occasions when junior doctors have gone on to the site to try to book interviews. They have seen their preferences change; they have seen interviews being booked for two weeks prior to their application; they have seen double interviews; they have seen their eligibility disappear; and they have been told that there are no vacancies, but when they have telephoned, they have been told that there are choices. The system is not working. It is probably just as well that it has been suspended, because it needs to be suspended until we are satisfied about both security and the technical problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="70501-0004.htm_para16"><a name="07050142000191">How can the Secretary of State simply assume that the timetable will be met? According to the review group&#146;s plan, junior doctors should have started booking their interviews on Saturday and completed the process by this Thursday. We are four days into the process, and the site is still suspended. In theory, junior doctors have only 48 hours in which to book their interviews in order to maintain the timetable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="70501-0004.htm_para17"><a name="07050142000192">We had a debate last week, from which there are still outstanding questions that the Secretary of State must answer. Her Department asked trusts across the country through strategic health authorities to provide applications for additional training posts, and the trusts were asked to send in those applications by  27 April, which was last Friday. How many applications has she received? What opportunity is there now for additional training posts to provide the flexibility for junior doctors to have greater confidence? Will she assure the House that flexibility will be given to Professor Sir John Tooke&#146;s group for next year by adding training posts this year and next year and by ensuring that wherever possible temporary, one-year training posts are appointed this year, rather than all the posts going on run-through training posts?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="70501-0004.htm_para18"><a name="07050142000193">Does the Secretary of State not understand that the lamentable shambles that has brought her to this House on, I think, four occasions&#151;we have brought her here twice&#151;has done untold damage to the confidence of the medical profession in the way in which its education and training is being managed. It is down to the profession to restore confidence, and I hope that Sir John Tooke and his colleagues will be able to do so.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman asked a series of questions; let me deal with them in turn. He asked about who exactly accessed the site after the first breach.

I am confident, from that  <br>

investigation, that no members of the public or other commercial organisations accessed the site. Those investigations are continuing, and as more information is established appropriate action will be taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="70501-0004.htm_para20"><a name="07050142000196">The hon. Gentleman referred to shortlisters having access to applications. It was part of the system designed at the request of the postgraduate deaneries that those assessing applications should be able to access the full range of applications because in some cases multiple assessments were being made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="70501-0004.htm_para21"><a name="07050142000197">On the leak, we have still not been able to establish how &#147;Channel 4 News&#148; came to be told of the existence of these unprotected website pages. However, since the address of the website page for each of the postgraduate deans included a randomly allocated number, it seems highly unlikely that it was by accident. That is why my noble Friend Lord Hunt made the statement that he did on the morning following this outrageous security leak.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="70501-0004.htm_para22"><a name="07050142000198">The hon. Gentleman referred to the electronic patient record system. That is a completely separate system established under completely different security and governance arrangements and with a very well developed security compact with patients and the public. It is currently being trialled in various parts of the country, and so far patient response has been extremely good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="70501-0004.htm_para23"><a name="07050142000199">The hon. Gentleman referred to junior doctor candidates changing their preference for applications. It is perfectly true that in a relatively small number of cases people were told inaccurately, or rather were told that there were no vacancies or that there were question marks about their eligibility. That did not come from the MTAS site but was a matter for the deaneries. It was not a fault in the MTAS site, nor did it have anything to do with security breaches; it was a matter for the deaneries, and it is being sorted out where necessary between the individual postgraduate deaneries and individual applicants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="70501-0004.htm_para24"><a name="07050142000200">More than 40,000 interviews were arranged initially as part of round 1, and that part&#151;now round 1A&#151;has been completed. As I said, more than 15,000 new interviews are being made available in round 1B. Some of those appointments were sent to junior doctor applicants before the security breach and therefore the suspension of the site; others, of course, have not been confirmed because of the site&#146;s suspension. However, if the hon. Gentleman looks, for instance, at the London deaneries website, he will see that applicants have been informed through that site that interviews are planned to start on 8 May and that candidates will be contacted either through MTAS, when that is restored, or through other administrative arrangements if necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="70501-0004.htm_para25"><a name="07050142000201">I can confirm to the House that, as I said last week, we are working with postgraduate deaneries and with the service to create new training posts that will help to meet the aspirations of junior doctors but will also meet the needs of the service. We will confirm the number and the specific specialties, where they will be available, as quickly as we can.</p>

However, the security breach that occurred last Wednesday was simply due to a decision by an individual at the IT contractor.

 This recent debacle will have even more serious effects on family members and loved ones who are trying to get training posts. The BMA said this morning that 34,250 doctors were trying to find posts, but that only 18,500 posts were available. The BMA also said that the vast majority&#151;two thirds&#151;of those doctors will not stay in the NHS. This is a crazy situation. We need those doctors to stay in the NHS&#151;they have been paid for by taxpayers&#146; money&#151;but under this Secretary of State&#146;s leadership, if we can call it that, there is massive distrust in the system.</p>

 Having spent three decades in large-scale public sector IT, I must say that I tend to agree with the chairman of the BMA, in his letter to the Secretary of State this morning, that the IT system concerned is relatively simple, and that technological failings would tend to remove the confidence of patients in the care system being developed. Will the Secretary of State indicate how she will reassure the wider general public?

 I have already explained what we are doing about the two lapses that took place last week, and the failures of Methods&#151;human failings rather than inbuilt system failings&#151;which allowed that to happen. On the much broader issue of the electronic patient record, we have known from the beginning that it was essential to have the highest possible level of security before putting confidential medical details about NHS patients into an electronic system. It is well worth saying, however, that the current manual system is not exactly a model of security, and that regrettable breaches of privacy and confidentiality have been reported on various occasions over many years. Because of the concerns about electronic patient records, we have gone to considerable lengths over some years to put in place a carefully worked out patient record guarantee, and to discuss that with patient representative organisations, the BMA and many others in the medical profession. We are currently piloting the electronic patient record in a small number of places in the country, to establish that there is justified public confidence in the electronic patient record.</p>

 Is the Secretary of State briefed on a daily basis on the material on the Mums4Medics and Remedy UK websites? Does she agree that the interest of the broadcast and print media has brought to public attention many of the issues from which junior doctors were suffering without the knowledge of the outside world? Will she try to clear up the eligibility issue? When I took it up with a deanery, I was told that the issue was nationally determined, whereas the Secretary of State said that it was determined by deaneries. It should not be possible for deaneries to have inconsistent views on eligibility, so will she have a clearing desk at the Department? Finally, will she give an answer on whether it is possible to apply for round 2 without having applied for round 1, given that many doctors are waiting for exam results and, on advice, withheld their applications at the beginning?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="70501-0005.htm_para2"><a name="07050142000230">On the issue of eligibility, there is one set of rules about eligibility in relation to immigration status, and there are specific eligibility criteria that relate to different posts, at different levels of seniority, in different specialties. In both cases, the postgraduate deaneries check whether individual candidates are eligible, in relation to their immigration status and their educational qualifications and experience, for the jobs for which they have applied. As for round 2, the review group is considering that at the moment, and I shall make a further statement in due course.</p>

We are in the process of working through that, and I am grateful to the BMA and the academy for continuing to help us ensure that as quickly as possible we get junior doctors properly interviewed and job offers made&#151;and that we do that in a way that is absolutely fair to junior doctors and meets the needs of the service and, above all, of patients.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para0"><a name="07050142000263">In preparing today&#146;s Bill, I have been indebted to Juliet Lyon and Jenny Talbot of the Prison Reform Trust, and to Kamini Gadhok and Jane Mackenzie of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. The problem is simply stated: more than 60 per cent. of the 11,000-plus young offenders in institutions today lack the communication skills to engage effectively and profitably with educational programmes, with courses in behaviour and anger management, and with initiatives designed to enhance their thinking skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para1"><a name="07050142000264">The House will be aware, not least from the work of the educational charity I CAN, that it is estimated that the lifetime cost of the failure to treat communication disorders is of the magnitude of &#163;26 billion. We are also commonly reminded that some 80 per cent. of young offenders reoffend: they go through the revolving door of the criminal justice system over and over again. We also know from a vast literature of published evidence of repute and academic expertise that a lack of education and the inability to communicate are risk factors in reoffending. People in the situation that I have just described are less likely to obtain a qualification, less likely to land a job and less likely to find a home; conversely, they are more likely to suffer emotional and behavioural problems, more likely to experience mental health challenges, and more likely to commit, or to go on to recommit, crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para2"><a name="07050142000265">That is the situation with which this country is faced, and it prompts the obvious question: what can be done about it? I put it to the House that we could do a lot worse in dealing with this client group of people with severe communication disorders than to go for a significant, far-reaching and intensive programme of speech and language therapy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para3"><a name="07050142000266">As chief inspector of prisons, the then Sir David Ramsbotham&#151;now Lord Ramsbotham&#151;visited Polmont young offenders institution in Scotland. There, he had an intriguing and memorable conversation with the governor of the institution. Going round the prison estate, he was struck by the governor&#146;s observation that if by some mischance he was obliged to get rid of all the institution&#146;s staff, and if it was within his discretion, the last person to be let out of the gates would be his speech and language therapist, because of the invaluable extra that that person provided for the institution and the young people incarcerated there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para4"><a name="07050142000267">Sir David subsequently became aware, as others will have done, of the work undertaken on commission for the Home Office by the Learning and Skills Research Centre as long ago as 2001-02. A study of a particular group of young offenders in an institution found that when that group were given help with their oral communication skills, they were 50 per cent. less likely to reoffend in the year after release than the group who were not so helped. The reoffending rate was cut from a typical rate of 44 per cent. to 21 per cent. Armed with the impressionistic material and the empirical evidence,  <br>

the chief inspector of prisons said to the Home Office, &#147;I think that this is significant. I have taken advice and I am told that the most distinguished speech therapist in England is Professor Karen Bryan. I would like to undertake a two-year trial at particular institutions, to see whether help could effectively and cost-effectively be provided.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para5"><a name="07050142000268">It was agreed that the trial would go ahead, and it took place under the auspices of Professor Karen Bryan between 2003 and 2005. Speech therapists were appointed at Brinsford and Werrington young offenders institutions, both of which are in Staffordshire. Working to Professor Karen Bryan, their responsibility was to assess, to diagnose and to plan effective interventions to help those young people. The young offenders suffered from a miscellany of difficulties, but the significant point is that they suffered from difficulties of hearing, of listening, of understanding, of remembering, of relating to people and of expressing themselves in terms that were simultaneously comprehensible and legitimate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07050142000269">At the end of the two-year study, which was privately financed courtesy of Lady Helen Hamlyn, Professor Bryan concluded that 100 per cent. of the young offenders studied would benefit from, or&#151;to put it more strongly&#151;were palpably in need of speech and language therapy. The report went to the Government. What did Ministers say? They were full of plaudits. The response was laudatory. They were grateful for a striking, important and valuable piece of work. One could deduce from Ministers&#146; observations that the report would have a significant influence on future Government policy. Therefore, I am bound to inquire what, two years on and in the light of those public ministerial utterances, has happened. The answer is: absolutely nothing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para7"><a name="07050142000270">To add insult to injury, in December 2005 the Department for Education and Skills published a document entitled &#147;Reducing Re-offending Through Skills and Employment&#148;, which consisted of 47 pages, 20,000 words and no fewer than 58 footnotes, but made not one reference to speech and language therapy. In the House of Lords on 27 October, Baroness Scotland of Asthal said that there was no problem, because the service was &#147;already available&#148;. If people were identified as having a problem, they were referred. The unspoken message that we were entitled to take from those remarks was that if there was a problem, it was being handled and there was no reason to worry. That is cold comfort, and rings hollow to the people at the coal face who know that it simply is not the case. The impression was given that it was happening, but it is not; that people can get the help, when they cannot; and that the system will work, when it will not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para8"><a name="07050142000271">There is an institutional paralysis at the heart of the system, not noticed by the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) in dealing with the Offender Management Bill&#151;and it is the fact that the Home Office, the Department of Health, the Department for Education and Skills, the Youth Justice Board, the Prison Service and children&#146;s services are all involved. When everyone is responsible, no one is responsible. Nothing happens, nothing changes and nothing beneficial accrues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para9"><a name="07050142000272">The proposal in the Bill is simple. I suggest that we should cut the Gordian knot and place responsibility firmly in the hands of the Home Office. It provides that every young offenders institution&#151;all 18 of those that cater for young men and the four that cater for young women&#151;should be required to employ a speech and language therapist. That person would screen, diagnose and provide. The cost, at &#163;34,000 per therapist, is infinitesimally small compared with &#163;30 million spent on the respect agenda, or the &#163;80,000 per head cost of uselessly and unproductively incarcerating someone who, we can confidently predict, left untreated, unqualified, unreformed and unemployed, will come back into a young offenders institution all over again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para10"><a name="07050142000273">I understand the strength of public feeling that says that when people commit serious crimes they must be locked up and pay their dues. The deprivation of liberty must take place. But we have to give people hope. We have to do something to make a difference. My Bill is not a panacea, but it would improve lives, offer opportunities and do something to hold out the prospect that those young people who are on the wrong track can become productive, effective and worthwhile citizens. I am proud of my Bill, which enjoys cross-party support, and I commend it with enthusiasm to the House.</p>

Throughout that process, and indeed throughout the whole consultation period when developing the new pensions tax regime in the period up to A-day on 6 April 2006, the Government have consistently applied the PBR&#146;s principles for providing tax relief&#151;namely that such relief should support saving for an income in retirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para19"><a name="07050142000288">As we announced at the time of the pre-Budget report, we became aware in the summer and autumn of last year that the rapid growth of pension term assurance&#151;a life insurance death benefit that in most cases was providing no income in retirement&#151;was leading to rising costs and was clearly at odds with the principles we had set out. To deal with the problem, we announced in the pre-Budget report that we would work with the pensions industry to explore, in time for the Budget, how our principle that pensions should be tax-advantaged to provide an income in retirement could be applied to pension term assurance contracts. We announced that any changes we decided to make would not affect either personal arrangements entered into before 6 December 2006 or existing types of employer arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para20"><a name="07050142000289">Following detailed discussions with industry representative bodies, such as the Association of British Insurers, it became clear that a meaningful link could not be provided between those policies and pension saving without making the products commercially unviable or leading to high compliance and tax costs to Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and the Treasury. That is why the Budget announced the changes before us today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para21"><a name="07050142000290">In making the changes, we have worked with the industry to protect the position of consumers who had taken out policies before the pre-Budget report announcement in 2006 and, as I will set out in more detail later&#151;either in the debate on the amendments or in the wind-up&#151;we have tabled amendments to the transitional arrangements in schedule 18 to ensure that they work in the best interests of the consumer. On that basis, given the amendments we shall propose to the schedule, I commend the clause to the Committee.</p>

 As the Economic Secretary indicated, clause 67 abolishes pension term assurance, which was introduced in its current form in the Finance Act 2004 and was part of last year&#146;s A-day reforms to introduce pensions simplification. This is the third major pensions U-turn since the 2004 Act; it follows hard on the heels of taking residential property out of self-invested personal pensions and the changes to alternatively secured pensions foreshadowed last summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para22"><a name="07050142000292">I am concerned about the implications of the abolition of pension term insurance and I have four key questions.

The Economic Secretary gave us a flavour of that, to show that it had remained constant, but I contend that the Treasury&#146;s thinking has changed since the 2004 Act. Thirdly, how did the industry respond to the Government&#146;s concerns? Finally, what are the consequences both for the pensions life insurance industry and for consumers?</p>

 It is not something I am anticipating but if, unfortunately, I died while I was a Member my wife would receive a lump sum, which she could use to pay off our mortgage, thus freeing up income. Alternatively, she could invest the lump sum to provide an income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para24"><a name="07050142000296">A substitution effect arises from the death-in-service benefit. The lump sum can be invested either to generate an income or to pay off a mortgage to increase disposable income. The importance of that point will be apparent when I discuss the evolution of the Government&#146;s thought process a little later in my remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para25"><a name="07050142000297">I am very fortunate as a Member to have that benefit, but others are not so fortunate. People who are self-employed, for example, will not have the same benefit and will have to pay for it themselves. Prior to A-day, this type of cover could have been subject to tax relief as part of a pension policy. Now, however, as we shall see later, even that is not available to the self-employed. Anyone not covered by an employer&#146;s scheme will have to bear the full cost of cover&#151;something that we do not have to do. In fact, we are doubly lucky because in a sense the cost of the benefit is split between us and our employer. Someone who is self-employed will not only have to pay the full cost of a stand-alone policy, but will not receive any tax relief either. That raises real questions about the affordability of protection cover for many people on low or moderate incomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para26"><a name="07050142000298">The change that the Government have introduced creates some ironies. We will recollect that yesterday we discussed the incentives for incorporation in respect of small traders. As <i> Taxation</i> recently noted, if the policy is paid for by the employer, it is acceptable. That leads to the ridiculous situation whereby someone operating through a personal service company can get tax relief, but a sole trader or partner cannot. Yesterday, the Government tried to reduce the incentive for incorporation, but this afternoon we are discussing changes that have encouraged it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="70501-0006.htm_para27"><a name="07050142000299">When pension term insurance was introduced, the perspective from the industry was that it would lead to the closure of the protection gap. People out there on low and moderate incomes feel, as I said earlier, that they cannot afford life cover to provide for their dependants in the event of their death. It is worth reflecting on a recent article in <i> Money Marketing </i>by Vanessa Owen of Liverpool Victoria. I am afraid that I am going to refer back to it regularly throughout my remarks, because it provides an insightful view of the development of opinion in the industry about the introduction and development of this product and its subsequent abolition.

 It is interesting that the Minister raises that point, because the Government effectively reintroduced the relief in their A-day reforms for pension term assurance and they are now seeking to abolish it. What I aim to achieve this afternoon is to understand rather more about the Government&#146;s thinking on that matter, particularly why they felt it appropriate to introduce this tax relief in 2004, when they want to remove it 2007.

 I will not discuss the amendments at this point. I think that you indicated in your opening remarks, Sir Alan, that we may have a brief debate. We will support the amendments, because they help the Government to get out of a bit of a hole that they have created of their own volition. The Government dealt poorly with the transitional arrangements and there was a lack of clarity about the original statement that was made at the time of the pre-Budget report. That led to some concern and confusion about whether there would be relief for pension term assurance that was included within a pension policy and whether that tax relief would still continue. We have clarity now, whereas we did not have it in December. So, we will support the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="70501-0007.htm_para1"><a name="07050142000310">I am a little perplexed by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s remarks about the lack of concern in the financial press, because my reading of that press&#151;particularly at the time of the pre-Budget report&#151;was that there was a significant degree of concern among members of the industry. Certainly in conversations that I had in the aftermath of the pre-Budget report, there was quite significant concern, particularly given that so many industry members&#151;I will come on to this later&#151;had invested a significant sum in preparation for the launch of the policy. They are now left trying to administer a relatively small number of policyholders.</p>

<p><a name="st_o173"><a name="07050142000311"><a name="70501-0007.htm_spnew5"><a name="07050142000555"><b>Ed Balls:</b>
 To go back to the question of principle&#151;it is important that we establish the principles that are guiding us in these debates&#151;the hon. Gentleman quoted one of my predecessors, a former Financial Secretary, talking about tax relief for pensions. But term assurance is about not pension income but death benefit. It is a life insurance product. Does he accept that it was never our intention to tax-relieve non-pension savings in the manner that has transpired, or is he saying that introducing a tax relief for term assurance is his proposal to close the contributions gap&#151;as he referred to it?</p>

<p><a name="st_o174"><a name="07050142000312"><a name="70501-0007.htm_spnew6"><a name="07050142000556"><b>Mr. Hoban:</b>
 That is slightly curious. If it was not the Government&#146;s intention to introduce tax relief for pension term assurance, why on earth did they include it in the Finance Act 2004? The Government put the measure forward three years ago, in that Finance Act, but are now seeking to reverse it. If it was not their intention to have that provision, why did they include it in the first place? That is the problem that the Economic Secretary has to think about. The reality is that the measure was well understood by the industry. Perhaps the Economic Secretary will tell us why the Government included the provision in the Finance Act 2004, because the Committee would be interested to hear that. I would happily give way to enable him to give that explanation. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The Economic Secretary says that he will give an explanation in his speech. Well, we have heard that before.</p>
<a name="07050142000336">
<p>If we go back to the Committee <i> Hansard</i> for the 2004 Finance Bill, it is interesting to note that there was no discussion whatsoever on the introduction of pension term assurance. According to my reading of <i> Hansard</i>, that clause seemed to pass through without comment. The then Financial Secretary to the Treasury did not give the merest warning that abuse could lead to the scheme being closed down; that is in stark contrast to the warning that she gave about alternatively secured pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="70501-0007.htm_para2"><a name="07050142000313">The Government introduced the tax relief back in 2004, and when one talks to people involved in the industry, one finds that their view is that the Government should have been aware of the impact of the relief on the life assurance market. As the Association of British Insurers said:</p>
<a name="70501-0007.htm_brev1"><a name="07050142000354"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Even before this change was made, the insurance industry told the government of the positive effect this could have on the term assurance market.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="70501-0007.htm_para3"><a name="07050142000314">It was an opportunity for that market to rejuvenate itself. That should have come as no surprise to the Treasury. Indeed, some people were so concerned that the change would lead to a large-scale re-broking of business that they started to lobby the Treasury. I once again point out what Vanessa Owen of Liverpool Victoria said:</p>
<a name="70501-0007.htm_brev2"><a name="07050142000355"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;When I first read the proposed death benefit rules back in 2004, I wondered if boards of directors across the country would be turning pale at the risk of churning to in-force books. But after much lobbying, it became clear the rules were not going to change before A-day&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="70501-0007.htm_para4"><a name="07050142000315">There appears to have been plenty of discussion and debate before A-day, and what happened should have come as no surprise. Indeed, when I spoke to a group of industry experts in January this year, I specifically asked them whether the take-up of pension term assurance should have come as a surprise to the Treasury, and they emphatically said no; the Treasury should have been aware of the scale of interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="70501-0007.htm_para5"><a name="07050142000316">The effect of the A-day change was to encourage people to think again about life assurance, as they could pay their premiums net of the basic rate of tax, if they were basic rate taxpayers, or net of the higher rate of tax, if they were higher rate taxpayers. When consumers went to see their financial adviser or someone at the bank, the person giving them financial advice would have been remiss if they had failed to point out that they could take out pension term assurance at a lower cost than normal life assurance, because of the generous tax relief introduced by the Government in their Finance Act 2004. It is worth considering one insurer and the rates that it was offering. According to an article in <i> The Times</i>, a male non-smoker buying &#163;300,000 of level-term cover from Legal &amp; General would pay &#163;27.25 a month in cover. If he chose pension term assurance, he would pay &#163;25.25 a month in cover if he was a basic rate taxpayer, but if he was a higher rate taxpayer, he would pay only &#163;19.39. I suspect that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) is thinking about the difference between &#163;27.25 and &#163;25.25 and saying to himself, &#147;That does not sound like the basic rate reduction,&#148; and indeed it is not. There is recognition in the industry that the cost of pension term assurance cover was higher than the cost of basic cover, if we exclude tax relief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="70501-0007.htm_para6"><a name="07050142000317">There were significant caveats about pension term assurance cover. As Richard Eagling, the editor of <i> Investment, Life &amp; Pensions Moneyfacts</i> says:</p>
<a name="70501-0007.htm_brev3"><a name="07050142000356"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Although price is not the only differentiating factor to be considered when choosing between the two, the cost savings cannot be ignored, and for those clients who have no existing cover in place, the case for PTA is compelling.&#148;</p>
</ul><br>


<meta name="Date" content="1 May 2007">

<notus-date day="1" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>1 May 2007 : Column 1390</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="70501-0007.htm_para7"><a name="07050142000318">Consumers were warned that the policy might not be for them, as an article in <i> The Sunday Telegraph</i> said:</p>
<a name="70501-0007.htm_brev4"><a name="07050142000357"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;For a start, only basic life insurance is available with these PTA packages. The tax-breaks do not apply to extras that are often added on to conventional term assurance products, such as critical illness cover which pays out if you suffer a serious illness that leaves you unable to work. Family income benefit is not covered either&#151;this product pays out an annual income on death rather than a lump sum.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="70501-0007.htm_para8"><a name="07050142000319">So there were caveats in respect of the sale of such policies; it was not a straightforward slam dunk, as it were, to sell the policy to clients. There was a proper process that had to be gone through. Certainly, the increased affordability of term assurance would enable people who had previously found life cover prohibitive to take greater personal responsibility for their family, but as I said earlier, it also gave those with existing life cover the chance to see whether their cover could be re-broked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="70501-0007.htm_para9"><a name="07050142000320">Again, Vanessa Owen made some perceptive comments about what happened in the industry at the time. She said:</p>
<a name="70501-0007.htm_brev5"><a name="07050142000358"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;What we did find was that, although not a storm, life protection volumes started to pick up from all channels. Consumers were interested in the tax relief message which was clearly stimulating demand although, judging by our average premium levels, it was not wealthier clients who were buying but people on more modest means.</p>
</ul><a name="70501-0007.htm_brev6"><a name="07050142000359"><ul><p class="tabletext">In other words, it was not just the wealthy who were taking advantage of another opportunity to claw back higher-rate tax relief but also regular policyholders looking to take out life cover at a competitive rate.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="70501-0007.htm_para10"><a name="07050142000321">What about churning&#151;the re-broking of in-force life protection? Vanessa Owen said of the in-force life protection book:</p>
<a name="70501-0007.htm_brev7"><a name="07050142000360"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It has remained largely intact, with rebroking activity at a minimal level&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="70501-0007.htm_para11"><a name="07050142000322">so it appears from her evidence that people on low and moderate incomes were taking the opportunity to put in place cover that they may have considered too expensive before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="70501-0007.htm_para12"><a name="07050142000323">The interest in pension term assurance should have been apparent at the time. It certainly seemed to attract new customers. Has the Minister asked his officials to conduct any research into who purchased the products, and did the research that the Government conducted reflect Miss Owen&#146;s perception of the change of business in the market?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="70501-0007.htm_para13"><a name="07050142000324">If so many businesses were thinking of taking advantage of the introduction of pension term assurance&#151;clearly, the Liverpool Victoria thought about it&#151;why was that not obvious to the Treasury? Plenty of people seem to have told the Treasury. Why did not the Treasury realise sooner what the take-up rate would be, or was it so naive that it did not think it would happen after all, or so incompetent that it did not think of taking action prior to A-day?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="70501-0007.htm_para14"><a name="07050142000325">It is worth noting the cost of the Government&#146;s failure to take action. According to the regulatory impact assessment, the estimate of lost tax revenues if the clause is not reversed would be &#163;160 million, out of a total estimated cost of &#163;250 million for A-day reforms. What was the Government&#146;s original estimate of the amount of tax relief that would be claimed as a consequence of introducing pension term assurance? Presumably, in their calculation of the &#163;250 million,  <br>

they would have produced an estimate back in 2003-04. It would be interesting to understand the difference, from the Minister&#146;s perspective, between the original estimate and the current revised estimate, as set out in the regulatory impact assessment. If the Minister knows, I should be grateful if he enlightened me and the Committee about the difference between the estimate at the time that the A-day reforms were consulted on and the &#163;160 million cost referred to in the regulatory impact assessment.</p>

 I fear that the hon. Gentleman is in danger of misleading the Committee. The regulatory impact assessment refers to the cost that would arise to the Exchequer, had we not taken action at the time of the pre-Budget report. As I said, it was never the Government&#146;s intention to incentivise through pensions tax relief what became a rapid switch to pension term assurance. It was to prevent that cost from arising that we acted. I am still trying to work out whether the hon. Gentleman is supporting our action to protect the revenue base, or advocating a reversal of the 1984 decision not to tax advantage life assurance. On that question of principle, he still has not given us any clue.</p>

It would be interesting to know what they think the cost is now and what they thought the cost might have been. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The Economic Secretary says from a sedentary position that the cost at present is none, but we have had nine months of sales of the products. In a parliamentary answer, he told me the number of sales in the quarter to June and the quarter to September, so there would be some indication of the cost to the Exchequer. I am keen to understand what the Government&#146;s estimate of cost was at the time that they conducted their pre-A day consultation. The Minister still has not responded to that question.

 It is remarkable that the Government introduced a change that happened to slip unintentionally through the legislative process and past the eagle eyes of the Treasury and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and that it will cost nothing.

Does he expect growth to continue at the rate of the increase in sales that took place towards the end of last year prior to the closure of the schemes? Does he expect the rate of growth to plateau?

protection gap. One of the problems is that the Government have not properly thought through their A-day reforms; that is why this is the third U-turn on those reforms since they were enacted in the Finance Act 2004. Slowly but surely, the Economic Secretary is unpicking the work that one of his predecessors, the right hon. Member for Bolton, West, did when, as Financial Secretary, she was responsible for the same areas. I feel sorry for her at times. She must be wondering why on earth she spent so much time working on these reforms only for the Economic Secretary, who was at the Treasury at the time advising the Chancellor in some capacity, to conduct a series of U-turns once they were on the statute book.</p>

In the context of the Pensions Commission report, the 2006 Budget said that one of the five tests that the Chancellor set to see whether these reforms were acceptable to him was whether they would promote personal responsibility. Yet here we are with a product that would appear to promote personal responsibility and reduce dependency on the state but that the Government are seeking, through this clause, to abolish.</p>

 If one is a member of an occupational scheme, the contributions are subject to tax relief, and many such schemes clearly include death in service benefits. The Government are trying to remove the opportunity for those who are self-employed or not part of such a scheme to receive the tax relief on a stand-alone, pension term assurance policy. Another key principle that underpins the Government&#146;s approach to pensions tax relief emphasises that point. The Red Book states that</p>
<a name="70501-0008.htm_brev0"><a name="07050147000541"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;incentives for employer contributions are provided as it is more efficient for pensions to be provided on a collective basis through the employer&#148;.</p>

They will have to bite the bullet and not only pay the costs that we pay in our pension contributions and the sort of costs that the Exchequer pays into the parliamentary pension scheme, but get no tax relief. They are therefore hit by a triple whammy and in a far worse position than us as employees in the context of death in service benefit and how to fund it.</p>

but this is not the way to make policy. All sorts of changes had to be made by the industry: automated advice systems had to be amended to redirect customers to alternative products, for example, and the industry now has sub-scale portfolios of business to administer for the next 25 years or so.</p>

It has come forward with a series of proposals to facilitate the continuation of this type of business, as it recognises the importance of the protection market. It is also thinking of ways of avoiding writing off such a large investment in the new systems. It has proposed that all pension term assurance offers would contain clear information about the pension to which they were linked, including details of the provider and a policy number, reinforcing the link that the Government think is so important between the term assurance and the pension. That would produce an integrated policy that provided a pension and a lump sum death benefit. The industry made that proposal so that contributions could continue, but the Treasury rejected it. In effect, it rejected that position before A-day.</p>

The industry also suggested, as an alternative, that it would cap the amount of the lifetime allowance that could be utilised by taking out term assurance. A third of the allowance, about &#163;500,000, was suggested, but again the Treasury rejected this attempt by the industry to reach a workable compromise.</p>

There is an uneven playing field, which favours those who are lucky enough to be in jobs that have a death in service benefit as part of the package, and disadvantages those who are self-employed or contractors.

Gentleman started well in explaining the origins of pension term assurance, and making the point that it was an entirely innocent and reasonable way in which the industry should evolve. All individuals are faced with the question of how to hedge the risks when they look forward to their old age. There is the risk of death, and in that regard we provide for our dependants either in the form of a widow&#146;s pension or a lump sum. We must also hedge against the risk of living, and therefore provide an income for ourselves. It is entirely sensible and natural that the two sets of risks should be considered together, as many pensions providers do, and many of us are beneficiaries of such an arrangement. It was therefore natural that the industry should evolve a product that sought to provide those two activities together: pension term assurance. As the hon. Member for Fareham pointed out, in 2004, the Government saw no problem with that, and extended tax relief.</p>

He has laboured the point about the need to maintain the integrity of the distinction&#151;which he calls the principle, although it is probably more an established practice than a principle&#151;between tax relief for pensions and tax relief for life insurance. Clearly, that is established practice,   <br>

and must be maintained. The practical issue, however, is not so much the restatement of that principle as tax avoidance. There are clearly individuals who have seen, and would see in this new product, an opportunity to maximise tax relief on life insurance products, particularly if they have high incomes and are able to take advantage of higher rates of relief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="70501-0008.htm_para19"><a name="07050147000036">What I would like to know&#151;and the Economic Secretary might strengthen his case if he told us&#151;is how much of the &#163;150 million or so that the Government hope to retrieve originates in the higher tax relief. If it is true that, as the hon. Member for Fareham suggested, this product was designed principally for people on low incomes, we can see that it may have evolved in a fairly innocent way; but if it is designed for high earners&#151;we are talking about 40 per cent. tax relief&#151;I am more sympathetic to the Government&#146;s view that there is a potential for avoidance. It would be helpful if the Economic Secretary could give us an idea of the relative proportions.</p>

We are not trying to maximise the scope for tax relief. Generally, we have gone rather further than the Government in arguing that there is no justification for giving people on high incomes not just more tax relief, but higher rates of tax relief, on pensions, let alone life insurance. However, we agree with the Conservatives that the distinction between what happened in 2004 and what happens now has created confusion, and has not been terribly well handled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="70501-0008.htm_para22"><a name="07050147000039">If the Government&#146;s primary concern was to maintain the link between life insurance and pensions, organisations in the industry were willing to propose ways of checking that it was being maintained. They suggested, for instance, that if someone died and life insurance was claimed, it should be checked that there was a parallel pension product to maintain the integrity of the connection. Perhaps the Economic Secretary will tell us whether that proposal was explored, and whether it was deemed feasible. Organisations also suggested a limit on the tax relief that could be available, and a mechanism for fraud checking.</p>

Our stance on whether the clause should stand part will be determined partly by how they respond.</p>

comprehensive and thorough speech. I shall cover some of the same ground, however, because it would be difficult not to: my hon. Friend really did cover the waterfront. It is worth my repeating one or two of his points in the hope of provoking an answer from the Economic Secretary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70501-0008.htm_para24"><a name="07050147000042">It is not entirely clear what was the rationale for the simplification of the rules governing pension term assurance in the Finance Act 2004, which came into force on 6 April 2006. The Economic Secretary made it clear that it was never the Government&#146;s intention to encourage the granting of tax relief on products that were not connected with pensions, but that gives rise to one or two questions. There was no real explanation or debate about the issue during the passage of the 2004 Act. As for the rationale, as my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham pointed out, it was rather slipped through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="70501-0008.htm_para25"><a name="07050147000043">So what, if it was not simplification, was the justification for extending the relief to pension term assurance?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="70501-0008.htm_para26"><a name="07050147000044">What happened after 6 April 2006 to make the reforms in the Finance Act 2004 so unattractive and undesirable? We have had an answer from the Economic Secretary on that: the provision was used for non-pension purposes and for lump sum purposes. However, that begs the most important question, which my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham dwelt on: why was that not anticipated at the time?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="70501-0008.htm_para27"><a name="07050147000045">One has to put that in the context of a number of cases. Yesterday, we debated the rate of corporation tax for small businesses. We have seen change after change: the introduction of a 10 per cent. band, then a zero per cent. band, which was abolished last year, and now the small business rate is increasing. That is an example of the Government introducing a policy and businesses altering their behaviour accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="70501-0008.htm_para28"><a name="07050147000046">We have seen something similar with pension term assurance. Does it not worry Ministers that there often seems to be an almost systemic failure within the Treasury to anticipate the consequences of tax changes? Every year, a Finance Bill is presented and contains detailed provisions. The Treasury is keen to encourage certain types of behaviour and discourage others, yet it does not have a good record of judging what the consequences of the changes will be. This appears to be a very good example of that. Surely it could have been anticipated that pension term assurance would be used in the manner in which it has been. Within only a few months, the Treasury has been forced to change policy.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman may be right that those points were not made during the passage of the 2004 Finance Bill. One would have thought that the Treasury would be looking to spot those pratfalls. The Opposition do point out failures. I referred earlier to the zero per cent. band for corporation tax for small businesses, which was highlighted as a possible concern by Opposition MPs. There are times when things are not spotted by Opposition parties, but the hon. Gentleman will know&#151;he was heavily involved in opposition&#151;that our resources, compared with what is available to the Government and Treasury, are somewhat limited. He had access to a hotel room off Park lane, but those were perhaps the best facilities that any Opposition party has had. Often, one is talking about small numbers of people, but the Treasury is a mighty machine. It has the crème de la crème of the civil service working on these matters, yet constantly it seems to fail to spot some of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="70501-0009.htm_para0"><a name="07050147000049">I would have thought that Ministers are concerned about that. There is certainly an example here of the Treasury not spotting the way in which a tax change would affect behaviour. That is not necessarily a party point, but it is a concern.

 May I gently suggest to the hon. Gentleman that he is over-egging the pudding? Labour Members might take on board his point&#151;although we might not agree with every particular of it&#151;in respect of SIPPs or the incorporation issue when some individuals and organisations said at the time, &#147;Do you realise that such-and-such a change could lead to such-and-such a consequence?&#148; My somewhat hazy recollection from having served on the Finance Bill Standing Committee in 2004 is the same as that of the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban): no one was making that point. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) talks about resources in opposition, and I understand that point. However, any Member who has served on the Finance Bill Standing Committee, as he has, knows that members of that Committee get bombarded&#151;quite properly in a democracy&#151;with submissions from outside organisations, such as the Chartered Institute of Taxation, setting out their views on the proposed legislation. I stand to be corrected, but I do not think that there were any such submissions about this change in 2004, so it differs from the other two issues to which the hon. Gentleman has referred, which is why I suggest that he is over-egging the pudding.</p>

The area under discussion was simplified by the Finance Act 2004, and it is unsurprising that there were relatively few contributions from industry as&#151;I understand, because I was not a Member at the time&#151;it generally welcomed the contents of the 2004  <br>

Act. That might explain why fewer submissions were made, but circumstances in which tax change measures favour industry are perhaps those where the Treasury ought to be most alert and most alive to the potential impact.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point about the extent to which people advise us that specific changes will have adverse consequences. It is my understanding that the Treasury should have been aware of the take-up prior to A-day. Certainly the industry believes that that was discussed with the Treasury prior to A-day. Therefore, although it might not have been able to make any changes to the Finance Act 2004, it certainly could have done so in the Finance Act 2006 on which I served, along with the Economic Secretary and the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris). That might have been the forum in which to make such changes, because I understand that the Treasury was aware then of the issues we are discussing.</p>

I entirely understand my hon.

However, I hope that my hon. Friend agrees that, whatever the complexity of Government proposals, that is no excuse for unintelligibility. As a parliamentary point, let me say that when the Government decide that a change is needed, it is important that wherever possible that should be stated in clear terms in the Bill in question. Is my hon. Friend concerned that the order-making power in schedule 18 allows for regulations, the content and detail of which we in this House might not see until some time after we have voted for the legislation? That will not do, it is not satisfactory, it happens under Governments of both colours and it ought to be changed.</p>

What analysis has the Treasury conducted on who will lose as a consequence of this tax change? It seems that there are certain beneficiaries of the Finance Act 2004&#151;the self-employed, contract workers and so on, who would not normally be able to participate in occupational pension schemes that provide some kind of life assurance lump sum. The purpose of the 2004 changes might have been to simplify the system and to make  <br>

better provision for these people, but it seems that they have suffered as a consequence. I might be wrong, however, and I should be grateful for enlightenment from the Economic Secretary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="70501-0009.htm_para2"><a name="07050147000057">I should also be grateful if the Economic Secretary clarified the impact of the following development, which my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham addressed. My understanding is that before A-day&#151;6 April 2006&#151;tax relief was available for those individuals wanting to buy term assurance, if they were part of a pension plan that also provided pension benefits. As I understand it, that will no longer be the case, and I should be grateful&#151;</p>

 From a sedentary position, the Economic Secretary gives a conclusive, authoritative nod. Term assurance is therefore more limited than it was before A-day, so this is almost more than a U-turn. We are not just going back to the position before A-day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="70501-0009.htm_para3"><a name="07050147000060">I turn to my final point.</p>

 I am afraid so. I have a final question for the Economic Secretary, on stability in the pension system, which my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham discussed in his conclusion. There have been a number of tax changes to the pension system. Has the Treasury analysed the impact of these frequent changes? Is the Economic Secretary concerned that such frequent changes increase instability? If there is an unstable environment&#151;if people do not know where they will stand and what the tax system will be next year, or in two or three years&#146; time&#151;it does not encourage them to save. We surely need to look at that issue. I appreciate that there are difficulties and that we need to get the system right, but such constant tinkering&#151;the constant attempt to encourage a particular approach, only to discourage it on seeing its perhaps being overused&#151;is characteristic, I am afraid, of the way the Treasury has been run in the past 10 years. Such tinkering is not necessarily good for stability, or to the long-term benefit of this country.</p>

 I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. The immediate impact on consumers of change after change should rightly preoccupy us, but there is another respect in which constant changes and growing levels of complexity are unhelpful: they tend to discourage market entry by smaller-scale providers. One can end up, even without having intended this consequence, with a lack of competitiveness and a concentration of power in the hands of a relatively small number of highly powerful operators, who tend to enjoy better access to Ministers. That does not necessarily conduce to the public interest.</p>

 My hon. Friend again makes a very important point.

 I have three brief points to make. My hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) was right to take this opportunity to chide the Government for their conduct of the issue of pension term assurance. He did so with considerable skill and took us back through the historical development&#151;or lack of development&#151;of Government policy on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="70501-0009.htm_para5"><a name="07050147000067">When the then Financial Secretary&#151;now the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government&#151;introduced the proposals for pension simplification and A-day in Committee on the Finance Act 2004, she also described her intentions. She said:</p>
<a name="70501-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="07050147000546"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Our proposals will create a transparent, consistent and flexible system that is readily understood.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70501-0009.htm_para6"><a name="07050147000068">I am sure that we would all agree that had that happened, it would have been a sensible ambition. However, from what we have heard today, the then Financial Secretary, her advisers and the Treasury did not understand what they were introducing. Now, three years later, we have to use up four pages of the tax code in schedule 18 to undo the damage that was done in 2004. It is right, therefore, that we take this opportunity to remind Ministers, and the industry outside, of the way in which the Government have conducted affairs and the consequences of some of their policy implementation, which were not clearly understood at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70501-0009.htm_para7"><a name="07050147000069">The then Financial Secretary also said that the proposals would</p>
<a name="70501-0009.htm_brev1"><a name="07050147000547"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;make it easier for people to concentrate on things that matter, such as when and how much to save for their retirement, rather than on trying to understand anomalies between the different tax regimes.&#148;<i> &#151;&#151;[Official Report, Finance Public Bill Committee,  </i>8 June 2004; c. 427.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70501-0009.htm_para8"><a name="07050147000070">However, the provision is now being scrapped as a perceived anomaly that favours a particular type of life assurance cover over another, and it was introduced by this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70501-0009.htm_para9"><a name="07050147000071">The Association of British Insurers has not hesitated to point that out. It is perplexed that tax relief has been withdrawn from pension term assurance products, a market that the Government helped to create. It did not exist three years ago: it was the Government&#146;s measures in 2004 that brought it about. As my hon. Friend said earlier, the industry was in discussion with Government officials about the product. In the run-up to A-day, the Government were well aware that the product was being developed, but they did nothing to discourage that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70501-0009.htm_para10"><a name="07050147000072">My second point relates to the impact on policyholders. Research by Scottish Widows indicates that the households most at risk from this measure are not the wealthy, as suggested earlier, but those with an income above &#163;20,000&#151;so not the poorest, either&#151;but with less than &#163;30,000 in savings. They are middle Britain, and the people whom the Government should be encouraging to make provision for their retirement and unforeseen occurrences in their lives. Emma Walker from moneysupermarket.com has said that its research shows that some one in 10 life insurance customers have already made the switch from a conventional life insurance product to a pension term assurance product, so the change will affect a significant proportion of people.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making a valid point about whom the proposals will affect. However, does he agree that farming, where self-employment is rife, and the construction industry are among those sectors already hard hit by other economic factors that will be hit again by the proposed withdrawal of the measure?</p>

<p><a name="st_o210"><a name="07050147000074"><a name="70501-0009.htm_spnew16"><a name="07050147000587"><b>Mr. Dunne:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. Clearly, some sectors will be affected more than others, in that they will have been the focus for the marketing undertaken by the insurance companies providing the products that we are debating. The people affected may well include farmers, in both his constituency and mine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70501-0009.htm_para11"><a name="07050147000075">My final point has to do with the impact that the measure will have on the industry. The Government led the industry to develop these products: last September&#146;s pre-Budget report gave a clue that adjustments were likely, but not even the Budget itself made it clear that the policy would be scrapped. My hon. Friend the Member for Fareham was right to say that the details were hidden in the small print of the Finance Bill published in April. If the proposal comes into law, it will deal a hammer blow to the products under discussion. They will be killed stone dead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70501-0009.htm_para12"><a name="07050147000076">The industry has invested &#163;35 million in developing the products, but we are led to believe that that money will be written off, as there will be no return on it at all if the proposals in the Bill are accepted. In addition, over the next 25 years the industry will have to manage the run-off of the 50,000 or so policies that have been taken out, as they cannot be cancelled or exchanged. Companies that had anticipated building up large portfolios of such business over a number of years are now looking at having to manage a small portfolio of less than critical mass over 25 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70501-0009.htm_para13"><a name="07050147000077">That will add a cost burden to the industry for many years to come, even though the Government just now are seeking co-operation and assistance from everyone in the life assurance and pensions industries who is involved in the promotion of lifetime savings. The Government want to work with the industry, as much more substantial pension plans will come through in other legislation, but they have dealt it a difficult blow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70501-0009.htm_para14"><a name="07050147000078">I would not describe it as a body blow to the industry, as I do not want to exaggerate, but the industry has come to see that the Government who led it down a certain path three years ago have now moved  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="70501-0009.htm_para15"><a name="07050147000080">The hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) talked about the Government&#146;s principles, and almost got to the point of agreeing with them. I fear that the speeches of some other Opposition Members contradicted that approach, but that is by the by.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70501-0009.htm_para16"><a name="07050147000081">In a speech to the National Association of Pension Funds in March, I set out the principles that have guided, and continue to guide, the Government&#146;s approach to pensions tax relief. I shall set them out again for the Committee. First, we believe that generous tax relief is provided to support pension saving where that produces an income in retirement. Pensions tax relief is not there to support pre-retirement income, nor to support accumulation or inheritance. Secondly, we believe that pensions should be provided with more favourable tax treatment compared to other forms of saving, in recognition of the fact that they are less flexible than other savings and that they are locked away until retirement. Thirdly, we believe that incentives for employer contributions should be provided, as it is more efficient for pensions to be provided on a collective basis through the employer, Finally, we consider that pensions tax incentives must be affordable and fall within current fiscal projections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70501-0009.htm_para17"><a name="07050147000082">It is important to set out those principles again, as they have guided the Government&#146;s decisions over recent months and years. They have also guided our approach to term assurance and pension term assurance, and I shall refer back to them during the course of my speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="70501-0009.htm_para18"><a name="07050147000083">I also want to set out some history. In an intervention on the hon. Member for Fareham, I said that the Conservative Government of the day withdrew tax relief on life assurance premiums in the 1984 Finance Bill. The policy issues debated at the time were slightly different from those that pertain today, but I have read the debates and remain struck by the similarities and echoes between then and now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="70501-0009.htm_para19"><a name="07050147000084">In particular, it is clear that the Government of the day were concerned that the relief was being used for circumstances that were not intended. That meant that most of the relief was of no real benefit to the general body of taxpayers, and that any attempt to target the life assurance premium relief more precisely would be both potentially expensive and difficult. That was why the then Government decided that the only solution was to withdraw the tax relief altogether&#151;a pragmatic solution that took account all the different factors.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend recall that the 1984 abolition had an unintended consequence? I want to be generous to the Conservative Government of the time, but the consequence was that people getting mortgages stopped taking out the life assurance policies on which hitherto they had been able to get 15 per cent. tax relief, and piled into low-cost endowments that were widely mis-sold. This Government are still trying to sort out the mis-selling that was provoked as an unintended consequence of the Conservative Government&#146;s change of tax rule on life insurance premiums.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70501-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07050147000095">That was the background to the debate on the 2004 Finance Bill, when the then Financial Secretary undertook the pensions simplification process. However, there was no reference in the legislation to pension term assurance&#151;the expression did not exist at the time. The market for pensions-related term assurance was negligible at the time, and there was no intention to encourage a term-assurance market link to pensions, nor any discussion of such an intention during proceedings on the Finance Bill. There was a simplification of the pensions and tax regime to provide income in retirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70501-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07050147000096">There was some discussion between the industry and the Government as to whether the simplification would lead to the growth of a pension term assurance market and whether the changes in tax relief for pensions might lead to migration or churning in the term assurance market. However, there was no consensus for the view that the changes posed a material risk. Following discussions with industry players, the then Financial Secretary concluded that there was not a material risk that the changes we were making to tax relief for pensions retirement income would be likely to lead to a rapid growth in a pensions-related term assurance market.</p>

 We had an interesting debate on those matters earlier, when my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) referred to debates on past Finance Bills. In an intervention, I mentioned SIPPs. At the time, public debate and Members made it clear that there was concern that the SIPPs changes could have undesirable effects and the concerns were dealt with then. However, there was no discussion of the term assurance issue during the Finance Bill; it was never raised by Opposition Members and nor was it a subject of public debate. Technical discussions as to whether the changes posed a material risk concluded that they were not, and that the benefits of simplification outweighed the risk. It was not a mistake; it was a judgment that simplification benefits were more important than a risk that, at the time, was judged not to be material.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="70501-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07050147000099">That was the position for the next two years and during the run-up to A-day. However, by September 2006 it became clear that although the products were completely within the law&#151;they were not the means of tax avoidance&#151;a substantial re-badging of the term assurance market was taking place. Many life companies did not sell the products as pension term assurance, which would have been a confusing label as they had nothing to do with pensions; they were about death benefit. The policies were often marketed as term assurance with tax relief&#151;term assurance with the benefit of pension tax relief. In many cases, they were not marketed as pension tax relief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="70501-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07050147000100">I was asked for some figures. Before A-day the number of contracts sold that could be described as pension tax relief&#151;term assurance linked to pensions&#151;was in the low thousands; the number was  <br>

negligible. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the number of mortgage-related term assurance contracts sold was 238,154. From the beginning of 2006, when almost no policies were being sold, the number rose to 58,046 products&#151;from almost nothing to 20 per cent. of the term assurance market&#151;whereas the number of mortgage-related term assurance products fell from about 238,000 to 190,161. What happened was perfectly understandable and, in retrospect, predictable: a substantial, tax-driven switch from mortgage-related term assurance to a term assurance that qualified for pension tax relief, but was often not marketed as such because it had no pension income. To my mind, and that of several Members, including perhaps the hon. Member for Fareham, that was not what we intended; our intention was not that pension tax relief should be used to sell what was, in essence, a non-pension product.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70501-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07050147000101">Last autumn, it was put to me that costs anticipated as negligible to the Exchequer were set to rise from about &#163;25 million last year to about &#163;160 million a year in five years&#146; time&#151;as the hon. Member for Fareham pointed out. Over a five-year period there would be a cost to the Exchequer of slightly more than &#163;500 million. That is &#163;500 million of taxpayers&#146; money being spent on tax relief actions that people had previously taken without tax relief for, in essence, the same product&#151;a non-pensions-related death benefit that some years before we, as a country, had decided not to tax-advantage. All our consultation documents made it clear that was not our intention and that was why we decided to act in the pre-Budget report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="70501-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07050147000102">The report made a clear statement that there was a substantial risk to the taxpayer, that the practice was outside our intentions and that the right thing was to address it with immediate effect. That is what we did. However, we did not say that there was necessarily an end to any link between pensions and term assurance. With the pensions industry, we wanted to find out whether we could establish an ongoing, meaningful link between term assurance policies and saving for a pension, which would not have disproportionate costs and would not mean that a large proportion of the tax relief was going to a death benefit rather than to pension saving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70501-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07050147000103">We consulted the ABI, the Association of Independent Financial Advisers, the Society of Pension Consultants and the Investment and Life Assurance Group. The area is complex and we looked at several options: a test at the point of sale, to confirm that the policyholder was also a member of a relevant pension scheme; a cap on the total sum assured; a test at the point of claim; and ongoing sampling of policies by HMRC to check for fraud. Some in the industry, including the ABI, considered that some of the options might be workable, but after our consultation we found it impossible to set out a way forward that would be both commercially viable and consistent with our intentions and principles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70501-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07050147000104">The problem was that the checks needed to make sure that term assurance, which is a high-volume low-margin product, was genuinely pension-related were disproportionate to the administrative costs that the industry could bear.

forced to concede the sum of &#163;500 million over five years. The people selling those products would have been willing for us to make that decision, but we felt that we could not do so because we could not justify expenditure of &#163;500 million on what was largely a deadweight cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="70501-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07050147000105">That is why we decided to bring tax relief back into line with our intentions and to make it clear that we could not see a way forward that was consistent with our principles.

Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) asked about losers&#151;an issue also taken up in an intervention by the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne). The fact is that before A-day, the market barely existed: it was negligible. The market then grew very rapidly. Everyone who took advantage of it during that period is grandfathered&#151;we are not withdrawing tax relief from anyone who took out products up to the time of the pre-Budget report, or, indeed, for a period afterwards when transitional arrangements applied. Our tax changes take us back to the position ex ante. There are no losers, though people who might have benefited from the more lax regime in future will not do so now because we have gone back to the status quo. As I have explained, I think that the right decision was taken.</p>

 As I said, all the people who were taking advantage will have their benefits protected. It is not true to describe those people as either the very rich or tax avoiders. We are talking about people who previously took out mortgage-related term assurance or life assurance products and then benefited from the tax relief that came from the re-badging of those life assurance policies. It was never our intention&#151;nor, in my view, the intention of the House&#151;to tax advantage those life assurance policies. That is why we are returning to the status quo.</p>

assurance. I pressed the hon. Member for Fareham to agree with me a number of times about that and eventually, on my fourth attempt, he did. Unless the Conservative party is willing to put up the &#163;500 million to pay for an alternative proposal, I think that the hon. Gentleman and I are agreed that tax-advantaging life assurance products through pension tax relief is not the way forward. If so, we were right to sort out the problem at the earliest opportunity. We did so, despite the fact that in the period before we took our decision, we were not pressured by Opposition Members or anyone else to do so. As I said, we put transitional arrangements in place, which were widely communicated to the industry and, I think, welcomed by it as a way of sorting out the difficult pipeline cases. Indeed, we were praised by the ABI for so doing.</p>

It was never our intention to tax-advantage assurance. I do not think that the hon.

 I welcome the transitional dates in the amendments in the name of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The nationally known firm of independent financial advisers, Torquil Clark, is based in my constituency. Indeed, its office is about 100 m from my office and I know it quite well. In December I met people from that firm to discuss the announcement made in the pre-Budget report on the ending of tax relief on pension term assurance, and one of the things that they were concerned about was the suddenness of the transition. The amendments soften that somewhat, and they are welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="70501-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07050166000010">The hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) said that the transitional dates were not revealed until after this year&#146;s Budget, and he referred to April, but in fact they were revealed on 21 March, in paragraphs 3 to 5 on page 47 of the Budget notes. I think that the Government are right to close the loophole, and that is why I have just voted in favour of clause 67, which will introduce schedule 18 if we agree to that schedule, as I expect we will. The amendments are helpful, as they set out the dates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="70501-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07050166000011">Government amendment No. 9 includes what I regard as a major drafting error: the sub-paragraph that it inserts starts with the word &#147;But&#148;, and it should not do so. I hope that on Report, the Government will remove the word. In addition, in the third line of the amendment, the verb &#147;was&#148; is used, but I think that the verb is conditional and should take the subjunctive form. It should therefore be &#147;were&#148;, not &#147;was&#148;, and I hope that the Government will look at that on Report. However, I welcome the amendments.</p>

 I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#146;s contribution, which was detailed, incisive and informed, as always. As usual, he draws from the detail to make a wider point about the future direction of the country. On clause 67, I am grateful for his support for the intention behind the legislation. As he said, we consulted the industry in detail immediately after the pre-Budget report to make sure that we got the transitional arrangements right. It was put to me in our previous debate that the Government were slow in coming up with transitional arrangements; it was said that we did not do so until April. In fact, we had already come up with transitional pipeline arrangements, but the Association of British Insurers told us in April that some policies risked not getting the proper treatment because insurers had taken longer to process claims than they and the ABI had previously expected. That is why the amendments prolong the transitional period. I will reflect on the language issue; I will have to take advice on my hon. Friend&#146;s question about the word &#147;But&#148;&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Why?&#148;] Because I do not know the answer.</p>

I do not know where the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury or the shadow Chancellor were when that decision was made. We look forward to finding out where the shadow Chief Secretary will find the &#163;500 million that she will need to pay for that decision. I fear that the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) will have to find further public spending cuts to make in his tax policy commission report, which we look forward to with avid interest, as he will not only have to fund his proposed tax cuts, but pay for a &#163;500 million tax concession. We look forward to seeing those details, and I will reflect on the detail of the points raised. With that, I am happy to commend the amendments.</p>

 I want to pick up on a point made earlier about the use of the reserve powers to make regulations in the schedule. That is a complex subject. The Committee is in agreement&#151;or at least, Labour Members are&#151;on the intention behind the Bill but we want to make sure that future changes do not inadvertently lead to problems, and that is why we will not hesitate to use the secondary powers. The hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) expressed concerns, but if there is any question of those secondary, negative resolution powers being used, I will make sure that I, or my successors, inform Opposition Members in writing of our intention to use the powers in plenty of time, so that we can ensure full consultation and consideration of the matter, both in the House and outside. With that, I hope that we can agree to schedule 18.</p>

 I bear in mind the fact that we are in Committee, so I wish to make some more drafting suggestions to my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary. First, with the greatest respect to the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), he is wrong about what is now sub-paragraph (5A) of the schedule, as amended. If he looks at line 22 on page 218 of the Bill, he will see a reference to &#147;paragraph 5&#148;, which is not bracketed.

amendment No. 9, he will see that it follows sub-paragraph (5), and that is in brackets. He has miscounted, but he is right to be wary of the wording of the Bill. I suggest to my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary that the parliamentary drafting should not refer to &#147;premiums&#148; but to &#147;premia&#148;. &#147;Premiums&#148; occurs in lines 17, 20, 24, 28, 30, 31 and 39 of page 217 and in lines 2 and 20 of page 218.</p>

I urge the Treasury to have a word with its parliamentary draftspeople about the way in which the grammar of our language is used; after all, we are talking about statute.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman shouts that we should give my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) a job. I will reflect on the points raised. I do not want to get into the issue too deeply, but I am happy to consult Fowler&#146;s &#147;Dictionary of Modern English Usage&#148; on the matters that have been mentioned. I do not know about the use of the words &#147;premiums&#148; and &#147;premia&#148;, but I know that Fowler allows people to go either way on the question of split infinitives, depending on their predisposition, and it may be that Fowler will tell us that some discretion is allowed on that point. However, I hesitate to dwell on those issues too long. Remembering last year&#146;s Finance Bill, all I can say is that it was not our intention to make such mistakes. I await the Committee stage to find out the views of Mrs. Gauke on these matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="70501-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07050166000034">I have raised this matter on a number of occasions in the House. The first time was on 31 January on a point of order, on the eve of the implementation of the increase in taxes. As a result of Mr. Speaker&#146;s statement then, I applied for an Adjournment debate, which took place on 20 February. During the debate the Financial Secretary said that I would be able to return to the subject during the Budget debate and the Committee stage of the Finance Bill. He is right. I have taken up those opportunities, because we still do not seem to have persuaded the Government that they are doing the wrong thing by imposing retrospective taxation. That is why I hope the amendment will be supported this evening.</p>

 Can my hon. Friend confirm that the amendments before us leave behind the generality of the debate? This is no longer a debate about air passenger duty itself.

 My hon. Friend is right. I know that he would have been in the Lobby with us on 27 March had he been in the country, but he was away on overseas parliamentary business at that time. The amendment has been drafted so that it deals with the one-off period of seven weeks. It reflects the concerns shared by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition and my hon.

That is an indication of the extent of this stealth tax introduced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#151;a yield of about &#163;100 million in seven weeks. Some of my colleagues are sensitive about supporting an amendment that could be misrepresented by the Government, who might say that we have a black hole in our calculations, and ask how we will manage to balance the books when we get into government if we have voted against the retrospective nature of the air passenger duty increase.</p>

 Can my hon. Friend confirm that my memory is correct&#151;that when the extra tax was put on, we were told that it was nothing to do with general taxation or a black hole if it were not introduced? It was all to do with special measures that would be introduced in the future, which our amendment would simply delay by seven weeks.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. We are talking about a seven-week delay. Once the measure is introduced it will continue for ever and a day, unless or until it is changed.

looking at it would be to say that that &#163;100 million is only 1 per cent. of the money being wasted on the new NHS computer system. We are not talking about an enormous black hole that the Government can use to intimidate us into not voting against retrospective taxation.</p>

 If somebody bought a ticket before 6 December, when the announcement was made, and was travelling after 21 March, the date that the amendment suggests, would they not still be caught by the retrospective changes to the tax system?</p>

 The hon. Lady is right; the amendment is limited. I considered tabling another amendment stating that clause 12 should not apply in respect of anybody who paid for and ordered their tickets before 6 December. She has referred to another mischief, which is one of the reasons a number of us are concerned about clause 12 in general. In a sense, that is a separate argument. It is a strand of the same retrospection issue, but speaking in strict parliamentary terms, I am talking about not increasing taxes on people in this country without allowing Parliament to vote on those increases. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="70501-0011.htm_para24"><a name="07050166000049">Although the Government say that they have only one Budget a year, they are using the pre-Budget report as an opportunity to announce tax increases&#151;in this case, a tax increase of &#163;1 billion a year&#151;so the Chancellor can come along on Budget day and say, &#147;This is a neutral Budget.&#148; That is exactly what he did this time, having conveniently forgotten that he had already announced a &#163;1 billion tax increase in his pre-Budget report, for which he had not legislated or obtained parliamentary approval. The issue is important, and I am glad that there is concern among Conservative Front Benchers and in the wider House about retrospection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="70501-0011.htm_para25"><a name="07050166000050">I want briefly to examine the idea that the tax is somehow justifiable because it is &#147;green&#148; or &#147;environmental&#148;. I will not get into what I think is partly a semantic debate about whether this is a proper environmental tax&#151;although in my view it is not. Even if it were an environmental tax, Conservative party policy, which has been announced by my hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor, is that we support green taxes, but only if they are offset by reductions in taxes elsewhere. The shadow Chancellor put it this way when he addressed the issue in an interview in &#147;The World at One&#148; on 1 February, following my point of order on the previous day:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="70501-0011.htm_para27"><a name="07050166000052">The amendment is modest, and it does not go as far as some would wish, but it states the important principle, which we should stick to through thick and thin in this House, that we should not introduce retrospective taxation.</p>

 I oppose the amendment&#151;and will vote against it if the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) presses it&#151;for seven reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="70501-0012.htm_para0"><a name="07050166000054">First, the position adopted by Opposition Members&#151;this particularly applies to the Liberal Democrats&#151;is Augustinian. They want to be good, but not yet, so they will take any opportunity to push back the increase in tax. Secondly, the tax cannot be described as truly retrospective, when people had more than two months&#146; notice of the increase. Retrospection surely means increasing tax on things that people have already done. Thirdly, the practice adopted is not significantly different from the traditional practice with excise duties.</p>

<p><a name="st_o241"><a name="07050166000055"><a name="70501-0012.htm_spnew1"><a name="07050166000675"><b>Mr. Paul Goodman (Wycombe) (Con):</b>

 I have no idea. I did not know that the Government gave a year&#146;s notice last time. It was obviously not for the reason suggested by the hon. Member for Christchurch, because it would not take a year to go through the process that he is calling for.</p>

 Would the hon. Lady think it fair if the Government suddenly said that all the things that she had paid for over the past month would attract a special tax, which she had to pay although it had not been ratified by this House?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point is not significantly different from all sorts of taxes that we must pay. For example, the same applies to council tax&#151;when the local council issues a bill, one does not have time to move house.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="70501-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07050166000061">Fourthly, Conservative Members have clearly forgotten the action that they took in February 1985, when they changed the tax treatment of gilts. When the decision was taken, the Bank of England said that it could not possibly trade in the gilts market if it knew that that tax change was forthcoming, so it could not possibly wait until the Budget. A press notice was issued at 7 o&#146;clock in the morning, before the gilts market opened, so there were certainly no Budget resolutions on that occasion.</p>

 Fifthly, another key point is the behaviour of the airlines. The airlines frequently add charges, such as fuel surcharges and changes in airport taxes, after people have bought their tickets. They have protested about this measure, but their position is weak.</p>

 I wish to support the amendment. The hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) was surprised that people might wish to support it on its merits rather than on the basis of their political alignments, but it seems perfectly sensible and I am happy to do so.</p>

It is fair to say that there is not a basic theology about retrospective taxation, which has happened in the past. Indeed, when my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) wrote to the Economic Secretary to ask him for examples, he came up with several, but they related primarily to anti-avoidance measures. Nobody would remotely suggest that the people turning up at an airport and being asked to pay a levy on their tickets are in any sense involved in tax avoidance. That is a completely different concept; the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) made the distinction earlier.</p>

The first comprises travellers who bought their tickets before 6 September without any awareness that this was going to happen and will travel after 1 February. There are many people in that category. They are not business travellers, who normally buy tickets fairly close to the point of departure, but people planning a family holiday, probably with a substantial cost involved. The other group comprises travel agents who have decided to carry the cost themselves because they have no alternative, or to avoid alienating their customers. Several travel agents have made that point to me.</p>

I do not have much of a problem with that, because our approach to aviation taxation is not that it should be tax-neutral. We believe&#151;I do not know whether the hon.

 The hon. Gentleman makes my earlier point precisely. In his example, he takes possession of this hypothetical tie and would rightly feel aggrieved if there was a retrospective tax thereon. However, in the case of air passenger duty we are talking about advance payments for services&#151;in this case, flights&#151;that are not consumed at the point at which the tax bites.

It is enormously important for the economy, and for justice, that that should be the case. If there is any retrospectivity, neither of those conditions applies. When the transaction takes place, the parties involved need to know what are the costs, risks and benefits to all concerned. If the Government subsequently, in a way that those parties could not have anticipated, change the rules of the game&#151;the costs, risks or benefits emerging from the transaction&#151;they have acted retrospectively. That is unjustified morally and extremely dangerous economically.</p>

 It is a curious way to conduct a debate to try to refute an argument by saying that it is different from what was said by another person who took the same line but used different arguments in support of the same cause. That may well be the case, but I take my stand on the matter of retrospectivity. Such an important principle is at stake here that I will vote to defend it whether or not I am joined by the majority of my colleagues. We have heard some other good arguments. For example, the hon.

 The hon. Lady is right and I thank her for that additional argument, which reinforces my case, as it was intended to do. The important point is the conditions that apply when the transaction is made. Transactions are irrevocable&#151;one buys or one sells and, at that point, one must make a definitive calculation of the costs and gains. I repeat myself because I believe that the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland has some difficulty in grasping the notion of retrospectivity. If conditions are subsequently changed by a Government tax decision, which applies to the transaction, even though at the time no one could know that the change would occur, retrospectivity has clearly taken place.</p>

I have not made the calculation but I take on board the figure of &#163;100 million or &#163;120 million, which is not insubstantial. I am always careful about voting for a measure that will cost the taxpayer &#163;100 million to &#163;120 million.

 It happened when the service was performed. For example, if one engages a VAT-registered garden company and the VAT rate changes before the garden is done up, the higher rate has to be paid. It is not simply a matter of goods and services. The nature of the purchase of goods often means that ownership changes instantly whereas delivery of a service can be delayed.</p>

 My hon. Friend is as perspicacious as ever.

 We are hearing the most extraordinarily convoluted legal arguments from the Government about why this measure is not retrospective, and why it is a good thing that people will have to pay this tax in spite of having paid for their tickets in advance of its imposition. Perhaps the House should think about the underlying realities of the people for whom we are legislating today. We know that it is the Government&#146;s policy that only the rich should travel. Clause 12 is part of their policy that those on low incomes should be priced out of travelling by air. That is the purpose of the duty.

<a name="70501-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="07050166000624"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The fact that the Chancellor is in a tight position I think is clear...from the fact that he did not offset the rise in green taxation with a cut in other taxation, as he might have found appealing given the political debate&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="70501-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07050166000121">Martin Weale, also giving evidence, told me personally that APD</p>
<a name="70501-0013.htm_brev1"><a name="07050166000625"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;is very much at the level where it is just an additional tax rather than really going at changing behaviour.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="70501-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07050166000122">Likewise, the Institute of Chartered Accountants was of the opinion that APD did not demonstrably change behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="70501-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07050166000123">It took another three and a half months for the Treasury to concoct an explanation. When Mark Neale from the Treasury gave evidence on the Budget, he suddenly told me that</p>
<a name="70501-0013.htm_brev2"><a name="07050166000626"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the APD change came in quickly because there were pressing environmental reasons for bringing that change in quickly.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="70501-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07050166000124">I will not try to guess what those pressing environmental reasons were, but it remains my opinion that there were pressing economic reasons to grab the &#163;100 million on offer from seven extra weeks of increased yield. What we need from the Chancellor now and in the future is a much clearer differentiation between taxation to change behaviour and taxation simply to raise revenue.</p>

 The Treasury has at no stage said that the APD change will lead to a saving of 1.1 million tonnes of carbon each year. Its direct impact will be to save 0.3 million tonnes of carbon a year, as I and the Treasury have consistently made clear. Given the savings on other greenhouse gas-causing emissions, which are not CO2, its overall impact will be to save about 750,000 tonnes of carbon a year by 2010. I hope that that helps that hon.

You are policing the conduct of the debate as vigorously as ever, Mrs. Heal, which is entirely appropriate.

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="70501-0013.htm_para16"><a name="07050166000143">I think that the record will reflect that, essentially, the hon.

That is unfair to him: he has obtained an Adjournment debate on the subject, has campaigned persistently on the issue&#151;I have had dealings with him on it&#151;and takes the constitutional aspects of the business extremely seriously.

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="70501-0014.htm_para0"><a name="07050166000147">That was only a few years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="70501-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07050166000148">By contrast, the current rise was announced on 6 December last year, in the pre-Budget report, for implementation on 1 February this year&#151;not a year&#146;s notice or even six months&#146; notice, but less than two months&#146; notice. There was no question this time, then, of allowing airlines, tour operators and especially passengers &#147;plenty of time&#148; to adjust. Indeed, those passengers who had already bought tickets dated after 1 February, and to whom price rises were passed on, were given, as my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch said, no time to adjust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="70501-0014.htm_para2"><a name="07050166000149">The Treasury Committee elegantly described that as the &#147;first element of retrospection&#148; of the rise that the clause seeks to bring into effect. We are therefore bound to ask the Financial Secretary: why the rush? Why did Ministers give a year&#146;s notice of the last significant rise in APD, but less than two months&#146; notice of this one? I think that we know the answer, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree alluded in relation to the evidence heard by the Treasury Committee. The Chancellor was not, it seems, overcome by an urgent desire to hurry through a reduction in emissions by the means of APD, but simply grabbing the first instrument to hand to help him to pay off the &#163;153 billion that he plans to borrow over the next five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="70501-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07050166000150">There are more questions. For instance, what estimate has the Treasury made of the number of passengers who paid the new rates of APD on tickets dated after 1 February, when many airlines&#151;as the Treasury will have anticipated&#151;pass the cost of the rise to passengers, and what estimate has it made of the cost to those passengers? How much will they pay in total? Can the Minister confirm that the Federation of Tour Operators has issued judicial review proceedings against the Chancellor in relation to the rise, that the Government have acknowledged the service of the claim, that a judge has directed that they must serve their defence by this Friday, and that the court has directed that the case be heard quickly with the intention that judgment may be given by the end of July?</p>

Not just a tax continuation), and the fact that projected receipts from the change would not have been significantly affected by a delay in the implementation date (either from taxpayers taking account of the announcement, or external factors affecting the yield from the levy).&#148;</p>

This is a crucial point. Part of the debate has been conducted almost on the assumption that APD is paid directly by passengers, but in fact it is paid by the airlines. It is hard to see how the amendment would not simply result in a windfall for the airlines&#151;a windfall of some &#163;100 million, according to our calculations and my hon. Friend.</p>

 I think my hon. Friend has misunderstood my amendment.

Friend if he insists on pressing his amendment to a vote, we intend to table a new clause at a later stage that will prevent the Chancellor's successor from behaving in the same way in relation to APD. I hope that it will have the support of my hon. Friend as well as that of other Members.</p>
<a name="07050166000620">
<p>In conclusion, this retrospective rise should not have happened. As my right hon. Friend said, it may be found to be illegal by the courts. However, it is genuinely difficult at this stage to correct the effects on passengers of a change in duty that has already come into effect&#151;to put the genie back into the bottle or, groping for another clich&#233;, to lock the stable door after the horse has bolted. However, as I say, we intend to table a new clause to prevent the Chancellor&#146;s successor from carrying out such a retrospective manoeuvre again.</p>

 For the purposes of this debate, there are a number of precedents that I wish to cite. I set them out in some detail to the Chairman of the Procedure Committee, to which I will refer, to Conservative Front Benchers and to the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy), who speaks for the Liberal Democrats on the matter. What is clear is that aviation currently is responsible for nearly 6 per cent. of the United Kingdom&#146;s carbon dioxide emissions, but that figure is rising and aviation is also responsible for other non-carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change. Very few contest the case that that under-taxed industry should at least cover the climate change costs that it imposes, and very few contest that action is necessary to encourage aviation to reduce the climate change impact.</p>

That is what we said in the air transport White Paper in 2003, in the Budgets in 2004, 2005 and 2006 and in the energy review in 2006.</p>

 Of course I will, Mrs. Heal. It has been a wide-ranging debate to date. Let me return to the question of the air passenger duty and the proposals of the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="70501-0014.htm_para15"><a name="07050166000183">To be clear, air passenger duty is a tax on airlines, payable by airlines. It is charged per passenger at the point of departure from UK airports, so it is a departures tax. It is not a ticket tax, not a booking tax, not a purchase tax. Again, the tax point is the point of departure by the passenger from the UK airport, not the point of purchase of the flight ticket. That is just as it was in 1994 when the APD was introduced by the previous Government and it is just as it has been for every change since.</p>

 I cannot precisely, because clearly that is a commercial arrangement between the airlines and their passengers, but, for example, Ryanair e-mailed its customers who had pre-booked and direct debited the increase in the air passenger duty from those accounts. BMI and British Airways waived the increase and absorbed the costs. There was a variety of different responses from different commercial operators. The right hon. Gentleman would appreciate that that is properly a commercial matter for those companies in relation to their customers.</p>

Further to what my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) has said, the Minister has just said that the money is to be used to deal with the damage created by CO2. Therefore, I would like to ask him a specific question: how much of the &#163;100 million that is being raised will be used to deal with the damage that CO2 has created?</p>

 The Chancellor was clear in his pre-Budget statement and I have made the position clear since then in different debates and in Select Committee inquiries. The rise in the air passenger duty will contribute to the increase in spending that we are looking to be able to deploy to some of our priorities, including, specifically, transport and environmental protection. This may interest the hon. Gentleman. He mentions &#163;100 million, but in 2005-06, as the public expenditure statistical analysis confirms, we spent as a Government &#163;8.4 billion on environmental protection. He may have seen yesterday that we published the new PESA outturn estimates. For 2006-07, the spending on environmental protection was &#163;9.7 billion.</p>

The intention to introduce this legislation to Parliament was announced to Parliament in the pre-Budget report on 6 December and the change has effect for all flights departing after 1 February 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="70501-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07050166000189">I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Christchurch. As members of the Committee recognise, he has been dogged in his pursuit of the issue. He raised it on a point of order, in an Adjournment debate with me, in a debate on the Budget resolutions, although none of the others from his party who have signed his amendment did so, and of course he has raised the matter today. The decision that we have taken, the move that we have made and the provision in the Bill is not an illegal act, as he asserts. We will mount a strong defence in the case that the Federation of Tour Operators is bringing to the courts. I am confident that our arguments will carry the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="70501-0014.htm_para18"><a name="07050166000190">The hon. Gentleman advanced three arguments. Let me contest each and every one of them.

answered an oral question in this Chamber in January and I answered the hon. Gentleman's Adjournment debate in February. Finally, the House had the opportunity to debate the resolution over four days following the Budget, before the taxpayers concerned had to pay out any of the increased sums for which they were liable. At the end of those four days of debate on the Budget resolutions, the House voted on the proposals for APD announced in the pre-Budget report. The vote was carried by 296 to 84&#151;and I must say that the Whip, my right hon. Friend the Member for Rutherglen and Hamilton, West (Mr. McAvoy), would welcome a majority of 212 on several other issues that face us. We are also now having scrutiny and debate as part of our consideration of this Finance Bill. Therefore, the first assertion is not founded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="70501-0015.htm_para0"><a name="07050166000192">The second argument related to parliamentary precedent. In announcing and putting forward the provisions for the rise in APD, we have used provisions under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968. We followed established procedure that has been used on a number of occasions by this Government and previous Governments. I confirmed that to the Chairman of the Procedure Committee in March. I understand that that Committee has neither considered nor reported my letter, and I therefore wrote separately to the hon. Members for Chipping Barnet and for Falmouth and Camborne to make many of the same points as were made in the letter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="70501-0015.htm_para1"><a name="07050166000193">I wish to quote a couple of passages from that letter. The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) is right that some of the precedents relate to anti-avoidance, but by no means do all of them:</p>
<a name="70501-0015.htm_brev0"><a name="07050166000632"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Others include, for example, the resolution to charge income tax for the 2002-2003 financial year...at the specified rates.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="70501-0015.htm_para2"><a name="07050166000194">An older precedent mentioned was the petroleum revenue tax:</p>
<a name="70501-0015.htm_brev1"><a name="07050166000633"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In August 1978, the Government announced a package of changes to the tax, including an increase in the rate to 60 per cent. from 1 January 1979. The measure was not enacted until the post-election 1979 Finance Bill...These precedents are in addition to the one I cited in the House of the North Sea Oil taxation measures&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="70501-0015.htm_para5"><a name="07050166000197">Finally, let me turn to the third argument on retrospection. My hon. Friends the Members for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman), for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) and for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) understood the point to do with this clearly, although a number of other contributors did not. I must say to the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) that the arguments are not at all convoluted; they are straightforward. Far from being retrospective, this tax change was pre-announced. The pre-Budget report documents made it clear that the new rates would apply to passengers departing the UK from 1 February. I accept that there is an issue in respect of those passengers who pre-booked before the pre-Budget report of 6 December, but the airlines had almost two  <br>

months to deal with that. I say to the hon. Member for Wycombe that they are the liable parties. The airlines are responsible for payment: the airlines choose, and have chosen, whether to levy the APD increase on their passengers or to absorb the costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="70501-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07050166000198">Let me repeat that the distinction is principally to do not with goods and services, but with the point of tax. The point of tax is when a flight takes off, not when it is booked. All previous changes to APD have applied to both flights that were already booked at the time of announcement and to flights booked subsequently. That did not make those changes retrospective. How or whether to pass on the cost of the tax is a commercial matter for airlines. It is a matter to do with their pricing policy, their judgment and the terms and conditions of their ticket sales.</p>

<p><a name="st_o323"><a name="07050166000199"><a name="70501-0015.htm_spnew0"><a name="07050166000757"><b>Mr. Leigh:</b>
 This is a theological argument about dancing on the head of a pin. What about the public? They have no choice. It does not matter whether Ryanair keeps the money or gives it back. The Government can blame it or not. What about the public? What about somebody who has pre-booked his ticket and is now surcharged? Do such people not have any rights?</p>

 It is not a theological argument. It is a principled argument that is based on legislative and parliamentary precedent. For the hon. Gentleman&#146;s benefit, let me add that because APD is a tax on airlines and not passengers, if a flight that is booked is cancelled or not taken, no APD is liable. Whether an airline then repays to the customer the equivalent sums of the APD that they have already taken is a matter for the airlines, and a question to do with their terms and conditions. I and many other Members have had experience of constituents who have found it difficult to get that APD repaid when they have not taken flights that they have booked and paid for.</p>

 Many airline passengers are aware that the actual price of the service that they are buying is more likely to vary upwards than downwards and that it is more likely to do so the longer the interval between when they book and when they fly, because of fuel surcharges which are commonly added in by many airlines. Therefore, passengers are aware that prices can change.</p>

 It is also frequently the case that people or organisations make decisions on investments, purchases or pricing without having full knowledge of how the tax position may change.</p>

During those discussions, I was able to clarify a couple of points to them, on which I wish to update the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70501-0015.htm_para8"><a name="07050166000204">The hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) raised an issue to do with package travel regulations.

the flights on which APD is charged, are restricted by the Package Travel Regulations 1992 from passing on increased costs to customers. The European Commission is planning a review of the directive from which the regulations stem. We believe that it should be fundamental and wide-ranging. We expect the EC soon to issue a discussion document setting out options for the review, and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs has today written to the commissioner for consumer affairs underlining the importance that we place on the review of the directive and urging that any review should be wide-ranging and fundamental.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70501-0015.htm_para9"><a name="07050166000205">The next point relates to how APD is currently defined in terms of classes of travel; I think that the hon. Member for Christchurch referred to the consultation on this earlier. The aviation and tour operator industries have raised with me concerns about the current structure of APD, which has not changed since it was introduced more than 10 years ago, and in particular in relation to the treatment of seats on business-only flights or seats marked as premium economy. Following initial meetings with the industry, we announced in the Budget that we were open to reviewing the issue, given that the current structure might not send appropriate environmental signals and might cause market distortions. I can confirm today that HMRC has issued a consultation document seeking further information on possible options for change. I have placed a copy of that in the Library and it is also on the website.</p>

The arguments that he mounts that this is a move without parliamentary precedent and without legal basis, that it is retrospective and that it has not been subjected to parliamentary scrutiny and debate are all wrong.

 I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his response and for his comments about the package tour regulations, but I do not understand why the Government did not take account of them when they decided to double air passenger duty. Back in 1993, when those regulations were in place, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), the then Chancellor, introduced the concept of air passenger duty in his November autumn statement. He admitted that he did so because, unlike the present Chancellor, he was in need of extra money at the time.

That is why they find themselves in the courts, and why the Financial Secretary is desperately exchanging notes with the European Commission before Friday, when he has to hand in to the High Court his submission in answer to the judicial review.

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70501-0015.htm_para13"><a name="07050166000210">The Treasury must have known about this measure at the time of last year&#146;s pre-Budget report.

He gave a technical, carefully worded response, saying that this duty was not retrospective because under the terms of clause 12, all the taxpayers concerned will not have to pay out any sums incurred before the Budget. He means by that not our constituents&#151;the people who will pay these extra charges in order to travel by air&#151;but the airlines. He implied in that careful use of language that because, technically speaking, the taxpayer in this case is the airline concerned, rather than the customer of that airline, the duty is not retrospective. That is disingenuous beyond belief. Constituents who booked before 6 December holidays and flights taking place after 1 February, and who were charged a surcharge when they got to the airport, have written to me about this issue.</p>

It would not deal with those passengers who pre-booked their summer holidays, but it would provide relief for all those who booked in advance for their spring or half-term holidays, including most skiing holidays. As a matter of interest, I would probably be able to claim back money in respect of a foreign exchange to France by my son, who went to improve his French. That is not a significant issue; however, many other people would be in the same position if the amendment were carried.</p>

enable airlines to enjoy a windfall gain as a result of this tax not being retrospective. Airlines such as Ryanair&#151;I mention that one because it has spent a fortune on full-page advertisements campaigning on behalf of its customers against this awful tax&#151;would not refuse to reimburse its passengers who travelled on flights between 1 February and 21 March; to do so is unthinkable. My hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe has not adduced any evidence to suggest that these commercial organisations would refuse to refund the money. In fairness, he does them an injustice if he thinks that they would behave in that way.</p>

 I can give the hon. Gentleman some evidence, although it is an assumption so far as Ryanair is concerned. Ryanair is the kind of airline that used to charge passengers for using a wheelchair.</p>

 I know that Labour Members do not like Ryanair, which I think has been voted by its passengers the airline of the year and is one of the fastest growing, most successful airlines. My only regret is that it is not British-owned, but it is providing a very good service for its passengers. I am proud, as the Member of Parliament with Bournemouth international airport in his constituency, that Ryanair is one of its more popular operators. I hope that it will expand its number of routes next year.</p>

 In the event that my hon.

I welcome his re-stating our party&#146;s opposition to the principle of retrospection and his saying that we will table a new clause on Report, but actions speak louder than words, and the clearest message that our party could send tonight to our constituents is to vote against this example of retrospective legislation. It is very unfair and, as has been pointed out, it will be particularly damaging to those who booked their flights furthest in advance, who tend to be the weakest members of our society financially. It is time for us to give them some relief from this ghastly Government, so I hope that Members will support me in the Lobby this evening.</p>

<p><a name="70501-0016.htm_amdt1">(8) No order may be made under subsection (7) unless the Treasury has compiled and laid before the House of Commons a report containing an assessment of the impact of air passenger duty on the objective of reducing carbon emissions, and including an analysis of the comparative effectiveness in meeting that objective of the taxation of air passengers, on the one hand, and of aircraft according to their emissions levels, on the other.&#146;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70501-0016.htm_para0"><a name="07050166000519">In the debate that we have just had on retrospectivity, the discussion strayed into the environmental aspects of the tax, so some of the points that we are about to deal with have been covered already. I do not want to duplicate them, but this amendment would provide a mechanism obliging the Government to look more carefully at how environmental differentiation can be introduced into the taxation of the aviation industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70501-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07050166000520">In his reply to the previous debate, the Financial Secretary sought to justify the Government&#146;s proposals in environmental terms, and I think that he said that the air passenger duty was introduced in 1994. I have not checked on that year&#146;s Budget speech, but I should be very surprised if the word &#147;environment&#148; passed the then Chancellor&#146;s lips. It was an era when politicians who thought at all about the climate thought about global cooling rather than warming, so the eloquent argument about carbon emissions is something that we have discovered in retrospect.</p>

<p><a name="st_o333"><a name="07050166000521"><a name="70501-0016.htm_spnew1"><a name="07050166001060"><b>Mr. Paul Goodman:</b>

 Indeed, and the tax being proposed at that time was not an environmental tax at all, but a revenue measure. However, the Financial Secretary was right to say that we now confront a different kind of world, where there is a legitimate and powerful concern about the environment, and particularly about global warming. As he rightly said, carbon emissions from the aviation industry are substantial and growing very rapidly. The question is whether the air passenger duty is a reasonable proxy for an environmental tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70501-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07050166000523">Can the environment be taxed in a better way? There is a strong argument that the air passenger duty is a very clumsy way to tax the environment. That point was made in a brief interjection by the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), who was ruled out of order but whose point was nevertheless correct. The current duty penalises airlines that use their aircraft efficiently. The same aircraft travelling full pays twice as much duty as one travelling half empty, so there is no incentive to be efficient. Moreover, the duty is inequitable because it bears particularly heavily on low-cost airlines and their passengers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70501-0016.htm_para3"><a name="07050166000524">That is compounded by the fact that this country has a very inefficient system for allocating slots for landing and take off. They are allocated free, and are grandfathered. No consideration of efficiency is involved, so airlines are under no pressure to use their aircraft efficiently in terms of passenger use. Very often, slots are acquired and retained so that competitors are kept out of the business but, were they auctioned in a more economically rational way, there is no doubt that aircraft would be used more efficiently. The combination of inefficient allocation of airport slots and the existing taxation system is pretty rough and ready, and an ineffective environmental measure. However, no doubt the Minister&#146;s figures are right and he is working on Treasury assumptions about the elasticity of demand. Doubling the tax will no doubt have a rough and ready impact on carbon emissions. The question is whether it could be done significantly better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="70501-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07050166000525">This morning, the Treasury issued a ministerial statement. When I started to read it my heart jumped because the first sentence said that &#147;air passenger duty&#148;, as defined,</p>
<a name="70501-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="07050166000636"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;could send inappropriate environmental signals and cause market distortions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="70501-0016.htm_para5"><a name="07050166000526">At last, I thought, the Treasury has got the point and it will look at different options. However, it turned out that what was produced in a long and complicated consultation paper has nothing much at all to do with the environment; it would produce simply a more equitable sharing of the burden of air passenger duty between different categories of passenger. The Government have spotted that there are such things as airlines with only one travel class and their passengers may qualify for the lowest rate of duty. The Government are concerned about the anomalies and have produced a complicated consultation paper to deal with them. I have not yet had a chance to study it, but it does not seem at first sight&#151;the Minister may correct me&#151;to have much to do with environmentalism.</p>

<p><a name="st_o335"><a name="07050166000527"><a name="70501-0016.htm_spnew3"><a name="07050166001062"><b>Mr. Gummer:</b>
 Has the hon. Gentleman noticed that almost all the proposals will in fact increase the Treasury take with no noticeable environmental difference? Is not that all of a piece with the  legislation?</p>

<p><a name="st_o336"><a name="07050166000528"><a name="70501-0016.htm_spnew4"><a name="07050166001063"><b>Dr. Cable:</b>
 The right hon. Gentleman has the advantage over me, because he has had the chance to read the consultation paper carefully. I am sure what he says is true and that when I study the document that conclusion will emerge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="70501-0016.htm_para6"><a name="07050166000529">Is there a better way of taxing the aviation industry that captures more effectively the environmental impact? If we were starting from scratch and did not have to worry about legal constraints, the obvious thing would be to tax the fuel. That could be done on domestic flights, although they are only a small percentage of the total, but it would be difficult to implement internationally, partly for treaty reasons and partly because airlines would simply hop from one low-fuel jurisdiction to another and fill up where the duty was lowest. There would thus be no point in pursuing that theoretically attractive option.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="70501-0016.htm_para7"><a name="07050166000530">We suggest a simple mechanism, whereby the tax is applied in relation to the emissions produced by different types of aircraft. The model is the environmental differentiation in vehicle excise duty; different categories of vehicle are classified according to their carbon dioxide emissions and aircraft could be similarly banded. It would be a one-off tax at the point of departure, not at all complicated and probably simpler to administer than the present system. Because it would be a tax on departure and related to the CO2 emissions of a particular type of aircraft it would implicitly discriminate against short-haul flights. Paying the same duty whether the flight is to Edinburgh or Australia is not environmentally desirable because there are genuine alternatives to short-haul flights. There are no easier forms of public transport to Australia, but it is possible to switch to rail to travel to Edinburgh, Newcastle or even Cornwall, so a form of duty related to emissions makes more sense if it discriminates against short-haul flights. Environmentalists argue, too, that the greatest CO2 emissions are at take-off, when the booster impact of the engines is strongest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="70501-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07050166000531">No doubt there are technical problems that would have to be resolved, but we tabled the amendment to invite the Government to consider that option and to make a judgment about how such a system might operate before they proceed further down the route of more increases in air passenger duty. We merely ask them to study the feasibility of the alternatives. They are embarking on consultation about different methods of taxing aviation. I am surprised that its reach is so narrow and that the Government are not willing to look at the possibilities we have suggested, which are driven by environmental considerations.</p>

<p><a name="st_o337"><a name="07050166000532"><a name="70501-0016.htm_spnew5"><a name="07050166001064"><b>Mr. Paul Goodman:</b>
 It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Illsley. May I encapsulate what I want to say on behalf of the official Opposition about the amendment by saying to the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) that if his amendment had proposed only an assessment, we would have been tempted to vote for it? However, it does not do only that, so for that reason, as I shall explain, we do not propose to support it. Indeed, I shall explain why we believe that it is irresponsible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="70501-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07050166000533">Let me begin to consider the alternatives that the hon.

Perhaps the best way to start is to see what APD&#146;s most enthusiastic supporters, including the Financial Secretary, say about it. Apparently, APD is &#147;not an environmental tax&#148; and is not related to &#147;a concern about emissions&#148; or more efficient aircraft and &#147;not related at all&#148; to &#147;more efficient use&#148; of aircraft that are flying.</p>

As the hon. Member for Twickenham said, the Financial Secretary has placed a consultation document in the Library today, which relates to the industry&#146;s view that the way in which air passenger duty defines different classes of travel could send inappropriate signals and create market distortions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="70501-0016.htm_para13"><a name="07050166000537">In general terms, the Financial Secretary was very plain in his view of APD, so I think that we should return the compliment. We agree with the green critique that he set out. Indeed, we could scarcely put it better ourselves and I do not think that the hon. Member for Twickenham could put it any better either. The main points are well rehearsed: APD is not linked directly to emissions; it does not provide any incentives to use more fuel-efficient aircraft, and so forth.</p>

Indeed, my right hon. and learned Friend did not use the word &#147;environment&#148; at all. He said at the time, rather baldly, that air travel was &#147;under-taxed&#148; compared to other sectors of the economy. In short, APD is not a green tax, but an aviation tax.</p>

 Is it not also true that the inequality that the consultation document is attempting to resolve takes us back to the point for which air passenger duty was created? As well as airlines such as Eos today, back in 1984 we also had Concorde. Such airlines benefited from exactly the same differential impact.</p>

 I must confess that I have not yet got to the bottom of the consultation document, but if the hon. Lady is saying that APD is an aviation tax, I agree with her. Where we part company is that we are not opposed in principle to an aviation tax. I could not credibly stand at the Dispatch Box and argue that we were when my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe introduced it and set out the reasons for it so clearly. We support the principle of aviation taxation. We took that view in government, we have maintained it in opposition and we certainly do not intend to resile from it tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="70501-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07050166000541">That is a vital point when considering the Liberal amendment, which is designed to assess the merits of APD against the merits of alternative means of reducing emissions, while implementing a delay&#151;a key point&#151;in the APD increase proposed in clause 12. In other words, if the amendment were accepted, the increase would be delayed. It simply would not happen as envisaged.</p>

Our policy consultation document &#147;Greener skies&#148;, which quotes the Financial Secretary at length, confirms that, together with our quality of life policy group, we will consult the industry.</p>

 I wonder whether I can help my hon. Friend.

 That is why I would be extremely pleased&#151;as, doubtless, would the Liberals&#151;if the Financial Secretary said tonight that, once the clause is passed, the Government will carry out an assessment of a replacement for APD. The Financial Secretary has never ruled that out. I am interested to know whether he will do so when he responds to the debate. We believe that there should be an assessment. What I find hard to understand is why the Liberals believe that there should be an assessment. They have already announced their policy on aviation tax.

Why do they need the Treasury to assess their own policy? <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> They may say that their proposals involve a tax increase and that one cannot table an amendment that is in order if it involves a tax increase.

 They were both tax rises. The amendment that the hon. Lady tabled last year on VED was outside the scope of what was eligible to be tabled for debate. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Well, the Liberals will have to explain why they were so keen last year on tabling amendments that were not eligible for debate, but will not do so this year. I suspect that the  real reason is that, according to independent commentators&#151;I am not claiming that this analysis comes from us; it comes from the Institute for Fiscal Studies&#151;their green tax switch figures simply do not add up. That means that their proposal is not ready to fly. According to the IFS, the Liberals would fund their &#163;8.1 billion rise in green taxes partly by raising fuel duty in line with inflation. But according to the IFS, the Government have already pencilled that rise into their spending plans, leaving the future Liberal Government, which the Liberals presumably believe will take office after the next election, with a &#163;3 billion annual black hole in the public finances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70501-0016.htm_para18"><a name="07050166000554">That is just the start; according to the Liberals, that &#163;8.1 billion green tax rise is actually a &#163;20 billion green tax rise, but they will first have to produce an independent arbiter who supports their view that their new local income tax, house price tax and pensions stealth tax, which make up the remaining &#163;11.9 billion of their &#163;20 billion package, are somehow green taxes. I realise that the Liberals do not like to have those details ventilated in the Chamber, but it was the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and not us, that first raised those points. I would be out of order if I continued down that path, although I am certainly not out of order at the moment.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that amendment No. 13 shows the chaos of Liberal Democrat green tax policy? The Liberal Democrats want green taxes, not in order to change behaviour, but simply to enable a tax grab. They are not what most of us would think of as green taxes that change behaviour, and the amendment clearly shows that. The hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) has admitted to me in debate in the Chamber that the Liberal Democrats do not propose green taxes as a way of changing behaviour; they will carry on with green taxes regardless of any changes.</p>

 I certainly agree that the proposals are pretty chaotic. Again, I note that there is no substantial amendment setting out Liberal Democrat policies in any form.

different considerations apply, and I shall explain why. After the next election, there may be a Conservative majority, a Labour majority&#151;personally, I am rather doubtful about that&#151;or no majority at all in the House, but it is safe to say that there will not be a Liberal Democrat majority.

I presume that if they put their amendment to the vote this evening and it is defeated, they will vote against the clause, just as they voted against the measures in it at the conclusion of the Budget debate. In other words, tonight, they can cheerfully vote against the principle of aviation taxation, although they have no workable alternative to propose, knowing that they will not have to live with the consequences in office. That is not an approach that we can take. Unhappy as we are with air passenger duty as it stands, and with the Chancellor&#146;s handling of it, we simply do not believe that we can responsibly vote not to implement an aviation tax that we were responsible for designing, either by opposing the clause or by supporting the Liberal amendment.</p>

 I would like to be able to support the content of the Liberal amendment, because the Financial Secretary to the Treasury has been disingenuous in the way in which he has tried to defend the tax that we are discussing. The two arguments that he has used are flawed and damaging to the environment. His first argument was that air passenger duty is an environmental tax&#151;not a very good or effective one, and not one that he would have chosen if there were anything else around, but the only thing that he could scrabble together at the time. That, roughly speaking, is his view of the tax.</p>

The problem for me is simple. We will need regulation and a shift&#151;not an increase, but a shift&#151;in taxation from taxes on the family and taxes on business to taxes on pollution. However, if the country believes that that is not for the purpose of the environment, but is merely another sleight of hand, another stealth tax in order to gather money for the Treasury, that undermines our ability to take the nation with us in the tough measures that we will have to adopt.</p>

Even though my noble Friend the then Prime Minister allowed me to raise the rules for the defence of the sea because climate change was a real issue&#151;and that was in the early 1980s&#151;back in 1994, the emissions from aircraft were significant only to a very few. There were not many aircraft, the amount of emissions was not very great, and it paled into insignificance when compared with other things.

If they continue at the present rate, they will use up all the reductions that we can make in the immediate future in other areas of carbon emission. Of course we must be very tough about emissions from aircraft. We know that that is not easy, because many of the people who have taken advantage of cheap flights have found that that hugely improves their quality of life.

the Government are taxing the airlines, which will either pay the tax themselves or pass it on. The fault is the Government&#146;s, not anybody else&#146;s. My objection is that what the Government are doing with taxation is not helpful when it comes to emissions or green taxation generally.</p>

I am not opposed to examining that particular proposal, although it needs to be part of a whole package. We need to talk about slots.

 I agree with quite a lot of what the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) said in response to amendment No. 13, which I shall oppose. I do not wish the increase in air passenger duty to be delayed, and I do not think that it is right to put in statute a demand for an &#147;assessment&#148;. We need aviation taxes to raise revenue and to cover the externalities of air travel. We also need additional, not replacement, taxes to change behaviour. If, as I hope, behaviour changes as a result of these taxes, we will have had a positive result in terms of that desired outcome and the Government will not have to worry about revenues from green taxes, in this case on aviation, dropping. The central paradox, if not contradiction, in the Liberal Democrats&#146; position on green taxes is that they do not really want behaviour to change, because that would mean that tax revenue would drop and they would have an even bigger hole in their budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="70501-0017.htm_para14"><a name="07050166000575">Nevertheless, I have a lot of sympathy with what the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) said about aircraft movements. In 1994, when the tax was first introduced, it had a small aircraft-related element, in that aircraft weighing less than 10 tonnes were exempt. That was to do with flights of small planes from Scottish islands, Cornwall and so on. The Liberal Democrats have a point in saying that when we try to change behaviour we should tax the right thing, which is aircraft movement rather than people. As the hon. Member for Twickenham said&#151;this had not occurred to me and I thank him for raising it&#151;his proposals on taxing aircraft movement rather than passengers would have a differential effect domestically as against internationally, because, as it would be calculated per take off, proportionately speaking it would hit harder domestically. He is right to say that the substitution effect is possible domestically but not for long-distance international flights, although it is possible in the case of other countries in western Europe, where one can take the train, as I do.</p>

When I asked her whether she was going from Gatwick or Heathrow, she said that she was travelling from Sheffield to Manchester, flying from Manchester to London, and then flying on to Thailand on a different flight.

 The hon. Lady did not listen to me. I shall not give way again unless she listens. I clearly said that air passenger duty has an environmental impact. The consultation that I have confirmed today is about a point that business raised with me and has an environmental impact. For example, it has been put to me that the structure of air passenger duty makes it unsuitable for business-only flights, which may offer 100 business class seats on a plane designed to carry 300 passengers. Clearly, that has an environmental impact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="70501-0017.htm_para19"><a name="07050166000585">However, as I explained, air passenger duty is not principally an environmental tax in the same way as the landfill tax, the aggregates levy or the climate change levy, which are designed with an environmental impact specifically in mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="70501-0017.htm_para20"><a name="07050166000586">The problems with amendment No. 13 are not so much technical as legal. International laws, within which we must work, prevent taxing emissions from aviation inasmuch as they are linked to fuel consumption. Courts have successfully struck down taxes on that basis. In a Swedish case involving the Braathens Sverige airline, the European Court of Justice held that a tax that resembled a tax on fuel, such as a tax that related to carbon dioxide emissions, was incompatible with legislation predating the energy products directive. The judgment of the European Court, of course, binds the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="70501-0017.htm_para21"><a name="07050166000587">I have consistently said to Select Committees and to the House that our preferred policy for tackling the impact of aviation on climate change is the European Union emissions trading scheme. That is why we have worked so hard to press the case for, and achieve progress on, the inclusion of aviation in the scheme. I have also made it consistently clear over a number of years that APD is not the most environmentally effective tax for aviation. It is, however, established, available and compatible with international law. I should also add that, unlike some of the proposals suggested by others, it is a simple tax to operate and it imposes a small compliance burden on the industry and on air passengers. APD has a role to play in recognising the environmental costs of air travel, and in ensuring that air passengers understand and acknowledge the environmental costs of their actions.</p>

 I should like briefly to respond to some of the points raised in the debate. The hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) is normally quite thoughtful, but he seemed to feel that he had to make some terribly tribal points tonight in order to wriggle out of his desperate embarrassment at agreeing with the Liberal Democrats. We have a proposal but, as far as I am aware, his party does not have anything at all apart from a general commitment to raising revenue from the aviation sector. I think that his points were slightly unworthy of him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="70501-0017.htm_para24"><a name="07050166000592">I should also like to correct something for the record. We have submitted a balanced and tax-neutral alternative budget to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s colleagues got that far. We suggested a series of measures that were environmentally friendly and also fairer and more redistributive. The IFS acknowledged that our sums added up. The hon. Gentleman might not like the policies, but the sums certainly balanced. We acknowledge that, following the introduction of the Budget, which included at least some of the measures that we recommended, such as cutting the basic rate of income tax, we shall have to redo the numbers. We shall do that, and take into account the environmental tax implications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="70501-0017.htm_para25"><a name="07050166000593">The hon. Gentleman made a criticism that I did not fully understand. He started by asking why, since we had a workable alternative, we wanted to carry out a study on it. He finished by saying that we did not have a workable alternative, however, so I am not quite sure where his argument was leading. There are two reasons why we suggested that an evaluation was necessary. One is that any sensible party in any Government should do impact assessments even if it thinks that it has got the basic formula right. The present Government have structured that in, but not enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="70501-0017.htm_para26"><a name="07050166000594">Secondly, we are trying to find a mechanism to reach common ground with the Government. We know that they are not in the same position as us, and that they have embarked on a consultation exercise. It would be helpful if they widened that exercise; I do not see a problem with that. In his response, the Minister made what might well have been a valid point about the legal difficulties involved. We have looked at this, and we were persuaded that there would not be a problem, but perhaps there would. That is all the more reason for widening his consultation to try to answer that specific question.</p>

The reasonableness of an officer&#146;s thought can be challenged only through administrative court proceedings, which is a very long-winded way of arriving at the right decision.

I will not go into the distinction here. I am sure that we will have a chance to do so in Committee, but in recognition of the anxiety that has been expressed and in response to those representations that have been made, I intend to table an amendment in the Public Bill Committee to clause 96 and schedule 24 on civil penalties. However, it would be inappropriate to change the word &#147;thinks&#148; in clause 81, as her amendment suggests. I therefore hope that she will not press the amendment.</p>

Minister about how the proposed new powers will operate in practice and some guarantees&#151;I use that word deliberately&#151;that they will not be used arbitrarily to put undue pressure on legitimate taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="70501-0018.htm_para20"><a name="0705022000006">The background to all this is the merger of the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise, which was brought about by the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005, which received Royal Assent on  7 April 2005. Before the merger which created Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, the two heritage organisations had different roles and different powers accordingly. HM Customs and Excise has historically had relatively strong powers, including powers of arrest and seizure, which evolved from its role in fighting smugglers and more latterly drug traffickers. Before the merger, those powers were based on the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, or PACE as it is more generally referred to, and specifically section 114, which conferred specialist powers on Customs and Excise officers to help to fight crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="70501-0018.htm_para21"><a name="0705022000007">In contrast, the Inland Revenue was equipped with more restricted powers designed predominantly to help it to combat so-called white collar crime in areas such as financial services and the deliberate evasion of tax. Importantly, however, Inland Revenue officers did not usually have any powers of actual arrest and needed to be accompanied by a police officer if and when that became necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="70501-0018.htm_para22"><a name="0705022000008">In the spring of 2006, the Treasury initiated a consultation process on how the powers of the two heritage organisations might effectively be combined. There have now, in fairness, been three separate consultation documents relating to that process, including a second technical consultation in August 2006 and a third revised consultation in January this year. The consultation included a draft copy of the statutory instrument that the Government intend to use to initiate the powers contained in part 6 of the Bill. Therefore, we accept that the change has not come out of the blue and that the Treasury has received a considerable number of responses that have led, at least in part, to the drafting of part 6.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="70501-0018.htm_para23"><a name="0705022000009">Given that, we are not opposed in principle to combined powers for HMRC. Our concern is the extent of such powers and how they are likely to be employed in practice. The Treasury has apparently sought to reassure the professional bodies that those powers, including that of arrest, will be used sparingly; but, importantly, few such guarantees are stated in the Bill. My party is by no means alone in being concerned. The Chartered Institute of Taxation, in a consultation response of 16 February this year, stated:</p>
<a name="70501-0018.htm_brev3"><a name="0705022000470"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We continue to believe that, as a matter of principle,. HMRC should have civil powers to administer tax, whereas criminal matters should be for the police. We do not see any conflict between this and the need to ensure appropriate powers are available to tackle MTIC fraud and other attempts to steal from the taxpayer.&#148;</p>

fraud and tax credit fraud on a vast scale need to be tackled with an appropriate degree of tax specialist support. We believe that it is a mistake for tax officials (using the word &#145;tax&#146; in the widest sense) who may return to a normal tax environment at the end of their spell of duty in RCPO to investigate such organised crime.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para1"><a name="0705022000021">Given all those serious concerns, can the Minister now provide Parliament with some specific on-the-record assurances about how these powers will be exercised in practice? First, who can exercise the powers and how limited will their exercise be within HMRC? Our amendment No. 20 argues that the ability to exercise them should be confined to HMRC&#146;s criminal investigations directorate, which specialises in fighting fraud and criminal activity but does not ordinarily deal with day-to-day tax affairs. That might help reassure taxpayers, including businesses, that HMRC will not use the threat of powers of arrest as leverage in ordinary tax disputes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para2"><a name="0705022000022">The regulatory impact assessment that accompanied these proposals, under the heading &#147;Training given to HMRC officers&#148;, states:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para3"><a name="0705022000023">However, the RIA is not part of the Bill, which in clause 81(9)(2)(a) states:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para5"><a name="0705022000025">Secondly, in what circumstances will the powers be used? It is important to establish that such powers should be used only to fight suspected fraud or other related crime, and not as leverage in ordinary day-to-day tax disputes. What is important is not just the power of arrest but the threat of its use. It would be quite wrong for HMRC officers&#151;a number of whom are now incentivised regarding the annual revenue that they are targeted to bring in&#151;to use the threat of arrest by HMRC as leverage in a tax negotiation in which there is no real suspicion of fraud or other criminality.

We also presume that someone who is in dispute with HMRC over an attempt to recover an alleged tax credits overpayment&#151;there were a third of a million such people last year&#151;will not be threatened with arrest in any circumstances, save where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that they have been  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para10"><a name="0705022000030">Similarly, the RIA, under the heading &#147;Implementation and delivery plan&#148;, also states:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para12"><a name="0705022000032">In summary, we can understand why the Government might want to do this, following on from the HMRC merger. We accept that they have carried out a consultation exercise in advance of seeking to codify these combined powers in part 6 of the Bill. Nevertheless, we remain concerned by the extent of these powers and, specifically, how they might be exercised in practice. The concern spreads wider than just the Opposition. It includes the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the Law Society, the Professional Contractors Group and respected members of the accounting profession, including those from PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para13"><a name="0705022000033">Parliament must be reassured that the powers will not be used arbitrarily and that HMRC officials will not use them or threaten to use them simply as leverage in tax negotiations. We have already seen a significant hardening of HMRC&#146;s attitude in respect of the adjudication of tax credit overpayments and we are concerned that such a hardening in other areas could take place once the new powers have been granted to the combined organisation.</p>

 The full RIA outlines the necessary balance to be struck between meeting HMRC&#146;s needs and making the provisions consistent with PACE 1984, and safeguarding citizens. Amendments Nos. 2 and 20 make much sense, although amendment No. 2 makes more sense than amendment No. 20. If one is pressed to a Division, we would be more inclined to support the former.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para15"><a name="0705022000036">Amendment No. 2 makes sense because it outlines clear requirements for training, supervision and numbers. I would be interested to know where the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) got the number of 500 from, but it can be amended by order if it is not right, and that makes sense. It is also sensible to ensure that HMRC has to report back on the issue in its annual report. We need change, because PACE 1984 relies only on Customs and Excise and we do now have a merged organisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para16"><a name="0705022000037">Amendment No. 18 reflects our concerns that we are debating these powers without being clear about how they will be exercised, the circumstances in which they will be exercised and who will exercise them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para17"><a name="0705022000038">With any other Bill, the Government would have other opportunities&#151;such as before it went to the Lords, for instance&#151;to lay the code before the House, but the fact that this is the Finance Bill means that we will not have another chance to debate the matter after tonight. Moreover, we are holding the debate blind because we do not have the code, and that is why the amendment would ensure proper time for appropriate parliamentary scrutiny of this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para18"><a name="0705022000039">At the very least, I hope that the Minister will be able to assure the House that appropriate parliamentary time will be set aside to debate the code, when the Treasury makes it available. Although amendment No. 2 is better than No. 20, we cannot support it because, in reality, it is possible that only one officer will be present when an arrest has to be made. PACE was supposed to make sure that an arresting officer would be available when an arrest had to be made, so I hope that the Minister will respond to the proposition in our amendment No. 18.</p>

 I hope that my response will give the reassurances that the hon. Members for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) and for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) are looking for. The new powers in clause 81 and those that follow it are very important, and I hope that what I say will expedite the business on those further clauses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para19"><a name="0705022000041">The Bill is designed to improve HMRC&#146;s ability to respond to serious criminal attacks on the UK&#146;s tax and tax credit systems. HMRC&#146;s criminal investigation powers will be based on the modern standard already set by Parliament for other agencies facing similar threats&#151;that is, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. That Act is well understood by courts, lawyers  <br>

and law enforcement agencies. It has been in force for more than 20 years, and the former Lord Chief Justice, Lord Wolff, has said that it is central to the working of the criminal justice system. He said that it reflects Parliament&#146;s intention as to what should be the balance between the necessary protection of the rights of the individual citizen and the right of the public as a whole that those who commit crimes should be convicted and then punished.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para20"><a name="0705022000042">That is precisely what the 1984 Act&#146;s incorporation for HMRC is designed to do. As the hon. Member for Rayleigh said, it follows the merger of Inland Revenue and Customs and Revenue in 2005, which is when my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General launched the major review of powers. That review involved wide consultation about the powers and deterrents available to HMRC, and about the safeguards available to taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para21"><a name="0705022000043">Two elements of this year&#146;s Finance Bill cover criminal investigations and civil penalties that emerge from that review of powers. The proposals are based on extensive consultation that included discussion with the review&#146;s consultative committee of independent experts. In addition, there were three public consultation exercises, and meetings with representative bodies and legal experts from across the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para22"><a name="0705022000044">There was a time when the tax authority was a less obvious target for organised criminal attacks, but the threat of organised financial crime is now considerable and serious in both the public and private sectors. The MTIC fraud mentioned by the hon. Member for Rayleigh, and the organised criminal attack on the tax credit system that included the theft of thousands of identities from unsuspecting employees, are just two examples of what can happen. Staff at HMRC are uncovering serious criminal activity across a range of the agency&#146;s duties, and the globalisation of trade and financial services is enabling criminals to scale up the amounts involved in complex business frauds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para23"><a name="0705022000045">As a result, HMRC must have modern and effective powers to respond to the changing nature of the criminal threat. However, many of the powers inherited from the Inland Revenue and from Customs and Excise are no longer suited to that purpose. Furthermore, misalignment between the powers leads to confusion; for example, under existing legislation, an HMRC team investigating a case of fraud that covered direct and indirect tax would need two separate warrants to search premises, two separate teams to undertake the search and, if arrests were made, the suspect might have to be arrested twice&#151;once by an HMRC officer for the indirect tax fraud and once by the police. Clearly, that is nonsense and undermines the advantages of the alignment and modernisation that Parliament approved in the merger to create a single UK tax authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para24"><a name="0705022000046">The majority of responses to our consultation recognised the importance of consistent powers for all tax fraud investigated by HMRC and supported adoption of the relevant parts of PACE as a sensible way to achieve that. The Law Society of England and Wales supported the adoption of PACE on the principle that</p>
<a name="70501-0019.htm_brev6"><a name="0705022000484"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the powers should so far as possible be consistent with powers available to other agencies dealing with criminal offences.&#148;</p>

<notus-date day="1" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>1 May 2007 : Column 1468</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para25"><a name="0705022000047">The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne expressed concern about mission creep. Not all the PACE powers will be applicable to HMRC; indeed, the provisions we are debating would give HMRC access to only about one third of PACE. Powers not appropriate to the tax authority are not included; for example, PACE stop and search provisions and the powers to take fingerprints and to charge and bail suspects would not be available to HMRC. However, bringing HMRC criminal investigations into PACE would ensure that all the safeguards enshrined in that legislation are directly applied to those investigations. PACE codes of practice would apply to HMRC; they set out important safeguards, including that the powers of entry, search and seizure must be fully justified before use and that officers must consider less intrusive means before applying for search warrants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para26"><a name="0705022000048">Some people have argued that the exercise represents a levelling up of old Customs powers to the Revenue. That is not the case. In some instances, the provisions would introduce higher thresholds and stronger safeguards; they also mean a narrowing rather than an extension of the number of HMRC officers who can exercise the powers. The power of arrest would be restricted to authorised officers with the necessary training, who needed to perform an arrest in the course of their duties. That will mean removing the power of arrest from about 18,000 ex-Customs officers who at present have the power but no operational need to use it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para27"><a name="0705022000049">Some Members expressed concern that criminal and civil matters would get mixed up. I assure them that the law makes it clear that the powers we are considering can be used only where it is reasonable to suspect that a crime has been committed and only for the purposes of a criminal investigation into that crime. None of the powers can be used for civil matters. No HMRC officer is responsible for both civil and criminal inquiries. The only guidance not yet published by HMRC is on the detail of the training courses officers must complete before they are authorised to use the powers. As promised, the guidance will be published before any powers come into effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para28"><a name="0705022000050">Subsections (2B) and (2C) of amendment No. 2 seem to be intended to ensure that PACE powers are used only by HMRC officers who are properly trained and authorised. However, that objective is already ensured by the clause. Under subsection (8) and the draft regulations applying PACE to HMRC, which were published on 2 April, PACE powers and functions are available only to HMRC officers authorised by the commissioners. Under administrative law, the commissioners may delegate functions only to properly trained and supervised officers, and only officers who need to use those powers to carry out their duties will be authorised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para29"><a name="0705022000051">The procedures for ensuring that the rules for authorising officers are applied correctly are subject to independent inspection by Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary. It is correct that none of the powers will be made available to officers of HMRC who carry out more routine duties such as checking tax returns. By restricting the powers to those officers within HMRC who have a direct business need, the number of officers with the power of arrest will be reduced from a current total of about 24,500 to 6,500&#151;a reduction of less than a third and more than a quarter. Those 6,500 include 2,000 criminal investigators and about 4,500  <br>

officers working to protect the UK&#146;s borders, as mentioned by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath). Those officers need the powers to carry out their duties.</p>
<a name="ordayhd_22"><a name="70501-0019.htm_ordayhd1"><a name="0705022000486"><h5 align="left">10 pm</h5>
<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para30"><a name="0705022000052">That brings us to subsections (2D) and (2E), which are designed to limit the number of HMRC officers able to use PACE powers to 500&#151;a figure that could be varied by order. Frankly, that is a ridiculous proposal and a random number. HMRC currently has 1,500 officers trying to tackle MTIC fraud, about 500 of whom have access to criminal investigation powers. The amendment would mean that the 200 criminal investigation officers tackling tax credit frauds, another 160 officers working on complex business fraud, 500 combating smuggling and about 230 tackling criminal finance and money laundering would simply be prevented from exercising their duties. That would certainly apply without the constraint of the constant legal amendments required to do so. What is important for the Committee to note is that the powers are available only to trained officers who need them to carry out their duties, who work in the relevant sections of HMRC and whose work is properly supervised and inspected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para31"><a name="0705022000053">The hon. Member for Rayleigh may be aware that PACE provisions already require statistics to be kept and published. HMRC will in future continue to meet the relevant standards set by PACE as applied to all law enforcement agencies and then exceed them by continuing to publish a much wider range of statistics than it does currently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para32"><a name="0705022000054">Amendment No. 18, and the requirement to prepare codes of practice relating to the exercise of powers, is also unnecessary. PACE codes of practice have been approved by Parliament and are available to the public. Clause 81, as drafted, applies those codes directly to HMRC&#146;s criminal investigations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para33"><a name="0705022000055">Finally, on amendment No. 20, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome was again correct that it would restrict the exercise of PACE powers of arrest to officers currently and exclusively serving in the criminal investigation directorate. Although they require the power of arrest, it is also needed at the frontiers. It is obvious that officers at the frontier need to be able to arrest smugglers, where appropriate, as they are detected entering or leaving the UK. Officers carrying out that work are based in HMRC&#146;s detection directorate rather than its criminal investigation directorate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="70501-0019.htm_para34"><a name="0705022000056">On that basis, I hope that the hon. Members for Rayleigh and for Falmouth and Camborne feel that they have had their reassurances and that the hon. Gentleman will not press any of his amendments. If he does, I shall have to ask my hon. Friends to resist them. </p>

organised fraud against elements in our VAT and tax credit systems. I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s assurance that the powers will be used only for criminal, not civil, matters. That is an important assurance placed on the record in <i> Hansard </i>tonight<i> .</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="70501-0020.htm_para0"><a name="0705022000058">Nevertheless, the number of officers that the Minister mentioned as having been given these powers was 6,500. I understand, however, that in the Treasury&#146;s discussions with the professional groups, the limit was originally specified as 1,000. Then when the Treasury was pressed, it conceded that the figure might, at most, be 2,000. Now the Minister comes to the House and asks for 6,500 of these officers to be so empowered to arrest our citizens. We on the Conservative Benches feel that we need to place some constraint on that. We think that it is right that the powers should be given to specialised officers within HMRC, who are specially trained to use them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="70501-0020.htm_para1"><a name="0705022000059">Having listened to the Minister, I am minded to withdraw amendment No. 2, but to press amendment No. 20 to a vote, so that the powers would be confined to specially trained officers in HMRC&#146;s criminal investigations directorate and HMRC could then choose to deploy some of them at the border posts if it saw fit. If the Minister thinks that he can tell the professional groups that there will be only 1,000 officers, then that there will be at most 2,000, and then come to the House and say, &#147;Oops. I actually meant 6,500&#148;, he should know that we think that perhaps he has not behaved as well as he might.</p>

 Although we are covering quite a lot in this group of amendments, I shall try to be brief. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="70501-0020.htm_para15"><a name="07050217000020">I begin by referring the House to comments made on Second Reading by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris), who is not in his place at the moment, about the need for a carrot as well as a stick in encouraging environmental behaviour. The amendments and the new clause relate to clauses 20 and 21. In the Budget, it was announced with a great fanfare that people who produce electricity on domestic property through microgeneration would be exempt from income tax and, furthermore, that that exemption would extend to the sale of renewable obligations certificates. That announcement included income tax as well as any capital gains tax that people might otherwise have been liable to pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="70501-0020.htm_para16"><a name="07050217000021">Paragraph 7.43 of the Red Book states:</p>
<a name="70501-0020.htm_brev1"><a name="07050217000136"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;as announced in the Pre-Budget report, Finance Bill 2007 will legislate so that, where an individual householder installs microgeneration technology in their home for the purpose of generating power for their personal use, any payment or credit they receive from the sale of surplus power is not subject to income tax&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="70501-0020.htm_para17"><a name="07050217000022">The Red Book goes on to explain the freedom from income tax and capital gains tax for ROCs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70501-0020.htm_para18"><a name="07050217000023">Those measures in the Budget were accompanied by another announcement in the Chancellor&#146;s speech of further investment in the low-carbon buildings programme and that grants for the installation of microgeneration technology will be increased by another &#163;6 million. That announcement was in response to the massive popularity of the scheme, which was demonstrated by events on 1 March 2007 when the domestic grant allocation went on the first day of the month. I see that you are looking at me somewhat quizzically, Sir Alan. That point relates to our amendment (a) to new clause 1, which I will explain in due course&#151;I promise you that I shall be  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="1 May 2007">

<notus-date day="1" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>1 May 2007 : Column 1475</b><br>
brief, Sir Alan. Rather than increasing capacity, those events led to the suspension of the low-carbon buildings scheme for April. To date, the scheme is still not up and running.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70501-0020.htm_para19"><a name="07050217000024">Amendment (a) would introduce into new clause 1 a requirement on the Chancellor to consult Departments. We tabled the amendment because the low-carbon buildings programme and the extension of funding to it was such a mess. Perhaps the Treasury did not inform the Department of Trade and Industry that it was planning to make such a generous offer, even though the industry itself had asked for an extra &#163;15 million to deal with the popularity of the scheme. Because the DTI was not informed, the programme has been suspended rather than extended, and capacity has been reduced as a result, because members of staff are being laid off as a result of the suspension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="70501-0020.htm_para20"><a name="07050217000025">On the face of it, the provisions appear to fulfil the principle that the Chancellor outlined in his Budget speech, but there are significant limitations in terms of the qualifications placed on the exemption from income tax. Clause 20(1) says:</p>
<a name="70501-0020.htm_brev2"><a name="07050217000137"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;No liability to income tax arises in respect of income arising to an individual from the sale of electricity generated by a microgeneration system&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="70501-0020.htm_para21"><a name="07050217000026">Paragraph (a) says that it must be domestic microgeneration. That seems fair. However, paragraph (b) says that it must be the case that</p>
<a name="70501-0020.htm_brev3"><a name="07050217000138"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the individual intends that the amount of electricity generated by it will not significantly exceed the amount of electricity consumed in those premises.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="70501-0020.htm_para22"><a name="07050217000027">The phrase about intention as to the amount of electricity generated crops up again in clause 21 in relation to obligation certificates. The exemption from income tax applies only if someone intends not to generate more electricity than is required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="70501-0020.htm_para23"><a name="07050217000028">The point of the amendments is to ask the Minister why he thinks it necessary to include that qualification, given that the existing definition of &#147;microgeneration&#148; makes clear the limits of the income tax relief. Section 26 of the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 says that</p>
<a name="70501-0020.htm_brev4"><a name="07050217000139"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;&#145;microgeneration&#146; means the use for the generation of electricity or the production of heat of any plant&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="70501-0020.htm_para24"><a name="07050217000029">It then lists the sources of energy and technologies that must be used through microgeneration systems: biomass, biofuels, fuel cells, photovoltaics, water, wind, solar power, geothermals and combined heat and power systems. It also defines the capacity by a microgeneration system: 50 kW for the generation of electricity and 45 kW thermal for the production of heat. Given that, why is it necessary to introduce a further qualification whereby an individual installing a domestic microgeneration system has to intend that they are not going to exceed significantly the amount of electricity consumed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="70501-0020.htm_para25"><a name="07050217000030">If it is blowing a gale in the middle of the night, does that mean that the energy production of someone with a wind turbine will significantly exceed their requirements and they will therefore be unable to extend their exemption from income tax to the electricity generated in that situation? Surely we should be encouraging people to maximise the capacity of their microgeneration systems so that we are not placing such great demands on the national network  <br>

and on non-renewable energy sources. I do not understand why the Treasury thinks it necessary to introduce the qualification with regard to intention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="70501-0020.htm_para26"><a name="07050217000031">There is a practical issue as regards how the exemption from income tax will be measured and achieved. I notice that the Red Book contains no projections of the cost to the Treasury of providing it. Friends of the Earth raised a concern that it does not understand how its achievement can be physically measured. It said that, if the exemption were part of a wider scheme, with a roll-out of smart meters, it would be easier to do something. The chief executive of Scottish Power said that the policy would be meaningless without a wider roll-out of smart meters. Does the Chief Secretary intend to make the policy more meaningful?</p>

<a name="ordayhd_23"><a name="70501-0021.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="07050217000155"><h5 align="left">10.30 pm</h5>
<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="70501-0021.htm_para0"><a name="07050217000032">We are worried that the policy constitutes spin over substance. Organisations such as Friends of the Earth would have liked a package of measures to encourage microgeneration, not to limit it in the way in which the Bill does. I am worried that, in the case of climate change, a token gesture is worse than doing nothing because it fools people into believing that action is being taken, when it is actually limited. We do not know whether the income tax exemption will cost the Treasury anything. That shows its small scale given the few people who will benefit from it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="70501-0021.htm_para1"><a name="07050217000033">New clause 1 would provide for a package and extend the scheme to small-scale local energy generation. It would also create a sense of accountability by providing for the preparation of a report to show that the Government are consulting local authorities and other relevant bodies. We will support the new clause, which would provide for a wider approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="70501-0021.htm_para2"><a name="07050217000034">Amendment (a) to new clause 1 would allow for consultation to include other Departments. One would believe that that was a given in any Treasury consultation, but the experience of the low-carbon buildings programme and this year&#146;s fiasco suggests that it needs to be clearly set out to ensure that it happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="70501-0021.htm_para3"><a name="07050217000035">The amendments and the new clause propose comprehensive changes and signal a more strategic approach, which would significantly improve the scheme. I hope that they will help provide greater stability to schemes such as the low-carbon buildings programme and other cross-departmental work. They are reasonable proposals and I hope that the Chief Secretary will accept them.</p>

<p><a name="st_o381"><a name="07050217000036"><a name="70501-0021.htm_spnew0"><a name="07050217000165"><b>Alan Simpson (Nottingham, South) (Lab):</b>
 I wanted to speak briefly to support new clause 1, which addresses Treasury reporting on energy efficiency matters and microgeneration. I tabled the same amendment last year and I want to make it clear that it has cross-party support, which was reflected in the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006. That had the support of the whole House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="70501-0021.htm_para4"><a name="07050217000037">The key weakness in our current approach to reporting is that there is a range of departmental responsibilities, involving the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department for Communities and Local Government  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="1 May 2007">

and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, but in each case, the policies hit a brick wall in the absence of a commitment from the Treasury to be part of the reporting mechanism about fiscal measures, which promote microgeneration and energy efficiency. That is a glaring gap in the coherence of our approach to climate change policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="70501-0021.htm_para5"><a name="07050217000038">In other parts of Europe, Finance Ministries have been at the heart of driving climate change programmes and commitment to the shift to microgeneration and renewable energy. They have done that by placing themselves at the centre of parliamentary and democratic accountability. Yet whenever the matter has been raised in the House, the Treasury has refused to accept the reporting responsibilities that it quite happily places on other Departments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="70501-0021.htm_para6"><a name="07050217000039">There is a central point for the Committee to grasp: unless our climate change policies and the accountability for them are driven by the centre, we will not get the take-off points that will shift our economy into seriously promoting microgeneration, renewable energy and energy efficiency. That will not happen if there is a gap at the centre. I put it to Treasury Ministers that it is not enough to give the lead in policy pronouncements, or to be first off the blocks with the press releases. They need to be first out of the frame when it comes to holding themselves to account in such a way that we could then expect other Departments to follow suit. I make a plea to them that this should not be done in a way that will divide the House along party lines. It can be achieved with cross-party consensus, and if we were to do that, the whole House and the whole country would welcome it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o382"><a name="07050217000040"><a name="70501-0021.htm_spnew1"><a name="07050217000166"><b>Mr. Paul Goodman:</b>
 I am looking for a sentence that will sum up the what the official Opposition feel about clauses 20 and 21, about new clause 1, about the Liberal amendments to the clauses and to new clause 1, and about what the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) has just said. That sentence is: &#147;The Red Book only takes us so far.&#148; It takes us only so far in relation to the two clauses before us because, although they are microgeneration measures&#151;they are welcome, and we do not intend to oppose them&#151;page 177 of the Red Book does not tell us how effective the Treasury expects them to be. In other words, it does not say what it expects the incentive effects of them to be over what period of time, or how many extra microgeneration systems the Treasury expects to be installed by how many people over what period of time. The House would like to have that information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="70501-0021.htm_para7"><a name="07050217000041">The theme of the limitations of the Red Book brings me to new clause 1. Last year, this measure was proposed as new clause 9, and I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Nottingham, South for drafting it. It was voted on last year, and supported by the hon. Gentleman and other Labour Members, as well as by us and the Liberals. It was a good new clause, and it is worth returning to it this year, which is why we have re-tabled it.</p>

powerhouse. It has been powerhousing domestic politics since the war, and it does not grow any less powerful as the years go by. Indeed, under this Chancellor, it is growing more powerful. If the microgeneration drive is to be taken seriously, we do not simply need the description of what the Government are seeking to do, as outlined on page 177 of the Red Book. We need an annual assessment of how effective their strategy is, of its framework, of the take-up of the measures and of whether that take-up is successful. When the Financial Secretary responded to the debate on the proposal last year, he did a very workmanlike job, as he always does. He referred us back to the Red Book, but there is a prevailing feeling in the House now that that simply will not do if the Treasury is to drive this strategy forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="70501-0021.htm_para9"><a name="07050217000043">I agreed substantially with what the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) said about these proposals. She made a good case for her amendment to our new clause, and we certainly have no difficulty with it. She also asked the Minister some pertinent questions about the necessity of the subsections of the two clauses that would apparently limit the amount of energy produced by microgeneration. I shall not repeat her questions; I shall simply ask the Chief Secretary to respond to them in due course, and to give us some reason to believe that the Treasury really is going to put itself in the driving seat in relation to microgeneration, rather than leaving it to other Departments that do not have the Treasury&#146;s muscle.</p>

 We have had some interesting comments on the clauses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="70501-0021.htm_para10"><a name="07050217000045">Clause 20 builds on incentives already introduced to encourage development and growth in the take-up of microgeneration by householders, such as the DTI low-carbon buildings programme, to which the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) referred, and a reduced rate of VAT on the installation of microgeneration systems. As she said, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced in the Budget a further &#163;6 million for the low-carbon buildings programme for households, bringing the total to more than &#163;18 million for the coming year. We see that as a contribution towards a transition to a more mature market&#151;one that is not dependent on grants&#151;for microgeneration in the future. I reassure her, however, that the programme of household grants will resume allocation in May.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="70501-0021.htm_para11"><a name="07050217000046">Clause 20 removes a genuine barrier to the take-up of microgeneration by householders, and helps them to contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions. Let me explain how the barrier arises and how the clause addresses it. I hope that I will then be able to explain why the amendment is inappropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="70501-0021.htm_para12"><a name="07050217000047">Households that have invested in microgeneration will often produce more electricity than they require for their own use. Therefore, they have the opportunity to sell or export surplus electricity back to their energy supplier, and so earn additional income. In our discussions with the industry and environmental groups, it became clear that uncertainty about the tax treatment of that income has discouraged some householders from investing in microgeneration. I can   <br>

clarify today that the Government&#146;s view is that a tax charge will indeed arise, hence the need to rectify the position and ensure that there will be no income tax charge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="70501-0021.htm_para13"><a name="07050217000048">Therefore, clause 20 introduces a tax exemption for the income that individuals receive from exporting electricity back to their supplier. It ensures that where an individual installs microgeneration in their home to generate electricity for their own use, any payment or credit that they receive from the sale of surplus electricity is not subject to income tax. Therefore, it achieves clarity and certainty for householders and achieves investment in microgeneration in line with the Government&#146;s microgeneration strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="70501-0021.htm_para14"><a name="07050217000049">The clause is targeted at people whose primary intention is to consume in their home the electricity that they generate. I have suggested to the Committee that it would not be right to extend, as the amendment would, the exemption to everybody. If accepted, the amendment would provide an exemption for businesses selling electricity if they happen to be run by an individual on domestic premises. In the case of businesses, there is no uncertainty, as there is with householders, about the tax position. For businesses, therefore, there is not a barrier to the take-up of microgeneration, so I suggest that the clause does not need to be extended as the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne proposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="70501-0021.htm_para15"><a name="07050217000050">It would be rather peculiar to give incentives to electricity companies to set up power stations, albeit small ones, in people&#146;s homes. A business based on commercial microgeneration should pay tax on its profit, just like any other commercial activity. To do as the amendment proposes would be unfair, and addresses a problem&#151;uncertainty about the tax position&#151;that does not exist where the primary purpose is commercial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="70501-0021.htm_para16"><a name="07050217000051">A similar argument applies in the case of clause 21, which deals with renewables obligation certificates, the purpose of which is to certify the generation of electricity from a renewable source. The auction price of renewables obligation certificates has been remarkably stable, at around &#163;40 to &#163;50 per megawatt-hour, since the renewables obligation was introduced in 2002. As intended, it has proved to be an effective market-based mechanism for increasing renewable electricity generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="70501-0021.htm_para17"><a name="07050217000053">Those using microgeneration at home can receive ROCs in the same way as any other electricity generator. They can sell their certificates to energy companies seeking to fulfil their renewables obligations. In those circumstances, the tax consequences could be complex. Householders could find themselves liable to income tax when they received their ROCs, and to capital gains tax when they sold them. The clause avoids that complexity, and ensures that individuals will not be liable for either tax in respect of ROCs that they acquire for electricity generated through microgeneration in their homes. Together with the income tax exemption in the previous clause, it provides clarity and certainty, along with very a favourable tax treatment of the income that householders receive from microgeneration of electricity.</p>

 I think that it was the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) who described the Chancellor as being in the driving seat when it comes to such measures, but unfortunately it seems that the Treasury is trying to look like it is putting the foot on the accelerator, while at the same time it is slamming its foot on the brakes.

I am still not clear what the Chief Secretary meant when he talked about the potential for commercial gain. Surely either we want to increase take-up of microgeneration or we do not. If there is an exemption from personal income tax, surely that deals with the commercial issue. If he is concerned about the issue of exceeding the amount of electricity that the household requires, surely that should be a reason to look again at the definition of microgeneration, rather than trying to deal with it as the Bill proposes, which does not seem clear. People who take up the scheme will not know when they have significantly exceeded the amount that they were intended to generate. To what extent is the measure supposed to apply?</p>

 I have been fortunate during my years as a Member of this House to have secured a good few Adjournment debates, and I invariably devote them to constituency issues. However, there is another legitimate role that they can perform, which is to raise a series of questions on a topical issue that is difficult to pursue through oral and written questions.

The responsibilities of the Minister who is to reply to the debate cut across the Foreign Office and the DTI, which are both centrally involved. I have followed his remarks, and he has made some good, strong statements about the British Government&#146;s commitment to fighting corruption, notably in his speech in December to the United Nations convention against corruption. He said that fighting corruption was a key priority for the British Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para9"><a name="07050217000086">However, the working group is quite explicit in its criticisms. It noted after the 2005 inquiry that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para10"><a name="07050217000087">When the working group met last month, it introduced its comments on the United Kingdom in the following terms:</p>

It urged the UK to remedy these shortcomings as quickly as possible and decided to conduct a further examination of the UK&#146;s efforts to fight bribery.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para11"><a name="07050217000088">The personalisation spilled over, as the Minister knows, into a leading newspaper article last week, in which it was alleged that the British Government had sought to remove Mr. Pieth and had attacked the reputation of the secretary-general of the OECD. I was pleased that a Minister was able to write in very forthright terms dismissing these allegations; I am sure that that is absolutely appropriate. In order to round off this point, will the Minister present make it absolutely clear that the Government have complete confidence in the OECD working group and in its chair, as a necessary background to the inquiry that is due to take place in the next year?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para12"><a name="07050217000089">The second issue is the reaction of the United States, which has always taken the lead on this issue since the introduction in the mid-1970s of its own foreign corrupt practices legislation. Under President Clinton, the American Administration took the lead in trying to create a multilateral agreement&#151;probably primarily to protect American manufacturers and to create a level playing field. The Americans have apparently been leading criticism of the UK within the OECD working party. It was revealed last week by the <i> Financial Times</i> that a formal complaint, albeit an oral one, had been made in January to the Foreign Office about the termination of the Serious Fraud Office inquiry. If that is correct&#151;I have not heard it denied&#151;can the Minister confirm that the Americans did protest in that way? It is important to be clear on that point. Perhaps the Minister could say how significant that was. For all I know, the Americans may have protested to the  <br>

British Government about numerous issues over the years, or about very few. Perhaps he could say whether this was seen as a serious gesture by the United States. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para13"><a name="07050217000090">The other development affecting the United States emerged in response to a question that I put to the Solicitor-General on 1 March. I asked him whether meetings had taken place in the past 12 months between the SFO and representatives of the US Department of Justice concerning investigations into al-Yamamah contracts, and he replied:</p>
<a name="70501-0022.htm_brev6"><a name="07050217000151"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Serious Fraud Office has met with representatives of the US Department of Justice to discuss case related matters.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 1 March 2007; Vol. 457, c. 1452W.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para14"><a name="07050217000091">That implies that the British Government are co-operating with the US in what seems to be a preliminary inquiry into whether there has been a breach of US law in that matter. It would be helpful if the Government confirmed that that is indeed the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para15"><a name="07050217000092">The third issue relates to the Foreign Affairs Committee. The debate on al-Yamamah has often taken on a party political colouration, but what was important about the report published at the weekend was that it was an all-party report. Eight Labour, four Conservative and two Liberal Democrat Members produced a consensual report that had two very important conclusions. The first, in paragraph 42, reads:</p>
<a name="70501-0022.htm_brev7"><a name="07050217000152"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We conclude that the Government&#146;s decision to halt the inquiry into the al Yamamah arms deal may have caused severe damage to the reputation of the United Kingdom in the fight against corruption.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para16"><a name="07050217000093">That was the consensus view. I know that Lord Drayson has since contradicted it, but it was an important acknowledgement that serious damage has been caused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para17"><a name="07050217000094">That damage is of several kinds, including damage to the Government&#146;s reputation and to British business in general. In the past few months, leading institutions in the City&#151;for example, Hermes, and the F&amp;C Asset Management Group&#151;have corresponded with the Prime Minister, expressing concern about the way in which their reputations and those of the City and financial markets have been damaged by this affair. Leading business people&#151;for example, the chairman of Anglo&#151;have commented that the reputation of their companies has been indirectly affected. The reputational damage has gone quite far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para18"><a name="07050217000095">The issue also affects the ability of the British Government to give leadership in the field of overseas development. An excellent White Paper published in 2006 by the Secretary of State for International Development commented extensively on Britain&#146;s role in leading the fight against corruption. That is clearly seriously undermined if the British Government are criticised for their performance in implementation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para19"><a name="07050217000096">The second conclusion of the Foreign Affairs Committee is worth quoting. It notes:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para21"><a name="07050217000098">The Minister will of course give a considered reaction to the report, but he may wish to give some early indication of his views tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para22"><a name="07050217000099">My final comments relate to where we go from here. Over the next year, there will be a phase 2 inquiry by the OECD working group. It will relate, although not primarily, to one of the issues that has concerned the working group in the past&#151;the state of British law. A view has been expressed that the law that was introduced in 2001 to comply with the convention was simply not fit for purpose. I would be interested to know whether the Minister takes that view. Are the Government satisfied with the law as it stands, or do they feel that new legislation is required to meet the requirements of the convention?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para23"><a name="07050217000100">Phase 2 is not concerned so much with legislation as with implementation of the legislation. Several specific issues will be raised, and I raise them in advance tonight to establish the Government&#146;s broad reaction. The first is how seriously the Government are taking further investigations through the SFO. I have had helpful parliamentary answers suggesting that inquiries are continuing in respect of six cases. Those involve South Africa&#146;s Hawks deal with BAE Systems, Romania&#146;s fighter contracts, the Czech Republic, Tanzania air traffic control, Chilean frigates&#151;a matter that relates to the &#163;1 million alleged to have been paid to the late President Pinochet&#151;and Qatar. It would be helpful if the Minister was able to say whether the British Government are receiving full co-operation from each of the different Governments that are affected. Previous attempts to pursue the investigation in relation to Saudi Arabia were frustrated by a lack of co-operation from the other Governments. If Britain is to follow through on the inquiries, it is important for us to know whether the Governments involved are co-operating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para24"><a name="07050217000101">My second set of questions relates specifically to the Department of Trade and Industry. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) first brought into the public domain a description of the system of parallel contracts, a type of working relationship in which BAE Systems&#151;and perhaps other companies as well&#151;is involved. Under that system, an official contract is drawn up and published, but a separate and less official contract operates through a subsidiary company with an exotic name such as Red Diamond. That secondary contract arranges for funds to be paid through the British Virgin Islands, where financial disclosure is not required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para25"><a name="07050217000102">As has been reported many times, that system has been in operation with many of the contracts that have been the subject of controversy, and various individuals associated with BAE Systems have been involved. For instance, I believe that Lord Powell, an adviser to the group, has been involved in&#151;and also been a beneficiary of&#151;such an arrangement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para26"><a name="07050217000103">I have two questions for the Minister, in his capacity as a DTI Minister. First, is he satisfied that the arrangement involving a subsidiary company is entirely compatible with the system of company law and rules that the DTI oversees? At first sight, it seems odd that companies are able to set up subsidiaries that do not appear in their records, although I am sure that the Department has checked whether that is good practice, or even legal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para27"><a name="07050217000104">Secondly, are the Government satisfied that moneys can flow through the British Virgin Islands, and is that compatible with the Treasury&#146;s rules about money laundering? The working group will pursue those questions, but it will be useful to know the Government&#146;s broad approach in advance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para28"><a name="07050217000105">My final point about the future investigation&#151;which may have started already&#151;has to do with the Government&#146;s response to criticisms made in the past by the OECD working group in respect of article 5 of the convention, which specifically excludes commercial considerations when the Government make decisions about whether to proceed with a legal inquiry. The OECD has already expressed concern about the role of the Attorney-General, for the reason that it involves the possible consideration of UK interests that article 5 expressly prohibits in the context of decisions about foreign bribery cases. How such questions are answered will depend on how the working group investigates the decisions about al-Yamamah. It will want to know how the Government separated legitimate considerations of national security from commercial considerations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para29"><a name="07050217000106">One matter of some concern is that there have been reports that the key individual who communicated the Saudi Government&#146;s concerns was Prince Bandar, the former ambassador to the US. He visited this country on November 8, and I am pursuing through parliamentary questions the matter of which Ministers he met at the time to communicate his Government&#146;s concern. Unfortunately, the same individual is one of the three main people alleged to have been beneficiaries of the commercial arrangements, together with his father the Crown Prince and the Minister responsible for the air force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para30"><a name="07050217000107">Questions will be asked, and I am sure that they will be pursued, about how effectively the Government managed to separate the purely commercial aspects of their judgment from the entirely genuine national security concerns. This matter will keep coming back. I apologise to the House for running through the issues so quickly, because of the time, but I am grateful for this opportunity to raise it.</p>

effectively as I can by sending answers not only to him but to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and by placing them in the Library for the consideration of any Member who is interested in the issues and has concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para33"><a name="07050217000111">Let us first cast our minds back to where we have come from. A decade ago, negotiation of the OECD convention was not complete: the United Nations convention against corruption was not even a glint in the eyes of its founding fathers; Transparency International was a small non-governmental organisation, developing its now world-renowned anti-corruption tools; and the subject of corruption was still almost taboo at international meetings and in aid agencies. Businesses were almost universally shy of recognising that it existed, despite the fact that in many sectors in many countries, especially oil, gas and mining, defence procurement and construction, business depended on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para34"><a name="07050217000112">At the same time, corrupt leaders from Mobutu to Marcos and Abacha to Suharto had shown the breathtaking venality that consigned their people to abject poverty while they enjoyed lives of luxury with impunity&#151;all because the international community was yet to take its potential mission seriously, and the world&#146;s financial system did not yet have in place the controls that today we regard as commonplace to limit the opportunities for such grand corruption. The Government have played a major part in moving from that scenario to where we are today in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para35"><a name="07050217000113">The House does not need to take that only from me. As the hon. Gentleman rightly and fairly pointed out, Transparency International&#146;s corruption perceptions and bribe-payers&#146; indices ranked the UK as the highest and second-placed G7 country, respectively 11th of 160 and 6th of 30. That is many places above the United States and France, which, according to the media reports by which the hon. Gentleman seems to set such store, are our fiercest critics in the OECD. It is not just the Government&#146;s view that the UK is doing rather better than many people, including the hon. Gentleman, would have us believe. I shall give the House a few facts to show how distorted and unacceptable that picture is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="70501-0022.htm_para36"><a name="07050217000114">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development accounted for much of the work in his progress report to the Prime Minister, published on 12 March. I offer a few examples. First, we continue to push the anti-corruption agenda in international forums, such as the G8, the European Union and the UN, particularly the implementation of the UN convention against corruption, whose provisions on improving international co-operation on asset recovery are particularly important.</p>

Thirdly, thanks to funding of  &#163;6 million from DFID over three years, in recognition of the impact of the scourge on developing countries, we have strengthened the UK&#146;s law enforcement capacity to investigate allegations of foreign bribery and the laundering of corrupt assets by political elites. On the former, the City of London police are already supporting the Serious Fraud Office in five investigations and made arrests in January. On the  <br>

latter, the UK has restrained &#163;34.6 million of assets acquired through corruption by foreign political elites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="70501-0023.htm_para1"><a name="07050217000116">The Metropolitan police has established a strong operational relationship to bring specific cases to prosecution. The Met&#146;s arrest of the former Governor of Bayelsa state had a strong impact in deterring wealthy Nigerians from trying to launder money through London. The Met has also responded to requests from the Nigerian Government relating to a second former state governor. In one case, &#163;1 million was returned and in the other, property bought in London is about to be sold so that the proceeds can be returned to the people of Nigeria from whom they were stolen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="70501-0023.htm_para2"><a name="07050217000117">Let me provide other examples. Following an investigation by the Ministry of Defence police, an MOD official, Michael Hale, after taking bribes from a Californian company, was convicted earlier this month on nine counts of corruption. For the OECD, that case does not count, since the conviction was of the bribe taker rather than the bribe giver, but I stress that it shows that the legal framework and the requirement for the Attorney-General&#146;s consent worked as they should. It also showed the judge&#146;s resolve to punish such crimes with a custodial sentence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="70501-0023.htm_para3"><a name="07050217000118">Separately, a UK citizen, Joyce Oyebanjo, was convicted earlier this year of laundering &#163;1.4 million of stolen assets from Nigeria. She was sentenced to three years&#146; imprisonment. The Attorney-General has secured an extra &#163;22 million to fund Serious Fraud Office investigations arising from alleged corruption under the UN oil-for-food programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="70501-0023.htm_para4"><a name="07050217000120">On top of the hundreds of millions of pounds that the Department for International Development has already spent on improving governance in dozens of countries around the world, we recently launched a new &#163;100 million governance and transparency fund to strengthen the ability of civil society, parliamentarians, trade unions and a free media to hold their Governments to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="70501-0023.htm_para5"><a name="07050217000122">As well as boosting the UK&#146;s own capacity to investigate international corruption allegations, we have taken an important role in the International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities, set up by the Chinese to improve co-ordination and sharing of best practice among anti-corruption law enforcement authorities. Both the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland and the director of the Serious Fraud Office will help to direct the organisation. The UK&#146;s leadership on the extractive industries transparency initiative has allowed it to become widely recognised as the international standard for the management of public revenues from oil, gas and mining.</p>

oversight of our national contact point on the OECD guidelines on multinational enterprises. That is an important step towards boosting the credibility of this important complaints procedure.

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="70501-0023.htm_para8"><a name="07050217000125">We have been praised by the OECD, particularly for the work that we have done to train front-line officials and raise awareness in the UK business community&#151;both here in the UK and around the world. One of the ways in which we have done that is by commissioning a DVD. We are one of few Governments in the world training front-line staff to make them aware of the damage that corruption can cause and what their responsibilities are in helping to find it, bring it to court, stamp it out and bring to justice the people who are perpetrating it in the first place.</p>

Several other OECD countries have asked us for more details about our activities to help inform their own efforts. That, I must say to the hon. Member for Twickenham, does not show a laggard, self-interested or irresponsible response to the key issues of the day on these matters. His comments therefore bear no resemblance to reality.</p>

Will the Liberal Democrats give back the &#163;2.4 million that they received from Michael Brown, who was jailed for perjury and obtaining a passport by deception so he could go on the run? He is accused of money laundering. I have set out all that we have done, so the hon. Member for Twickenham has a personal responsibility not just to come here and pontificate, but, where corruption arises, to deal with it. I ask him to do just that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="70501-0023.htm_para13"><a name="07050217000130">I welcome the opportunity to share and debate policy reform and best practice. The hon. Gentleman raised genuine issues about improving our legislation. I give him a commitment that that is what I want to do, too. I will set out the details&#151;in terms of the questions that it may take some time to answer and the general aspects of what we want to achieve&#151;in a letter to the hon. Gentleman tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="70501-0023.htm_para14"><a name="07050217000131">We can all improve our performance on these matters. This is a difficult and complex area, but I want to make it absolutely clear that the Government are completely committed to doing the best by the British people and the international community. We are at the forefront of tackling corruption. In the last decade, we have made great strides. We are not squeamish about the role of the OECD. I am talking not just about our peer review, but about what happens in all international communities, whether we are thinking of the Human Rights Council or the OECD. We are very committed to peer review&#151;and that includes ourselves. Every time that there is a peer review, there is an example of improving practice. We accept that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="70501-0023.htm_para15"><a name="07050217000132">We play an active part in the OECD&#151;with the individuals and the institution. We also fund it and put in the right resources to make sure that we have an effective international legislative framework to expose and root out corruption where it exists and to repatriate the resources that corruption sucks out of states that mostly cannot afford to lose those resources in the first place. That money can then be put into education, health, transport and all the other key things that we take for granted in this country. Sadly, many countries that are victims of corruption lose out significantly in those areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o511"><a name="70501-0023.htm_para16"><a name="07050217000133">I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman on the general issues. As I said, I will deal with the specifics in correspondence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o512"><a name="70501-0023.htm_para17"><a name="07050217000134"><i> Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
