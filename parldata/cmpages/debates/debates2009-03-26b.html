 Welcome as it is to learn from the Chief Secretary that the Government are in dialogue about this subject, I ask her to consider the situation of a small company in my constituency. The premium for its trade credit insurance has risen from &#163;7,000 to &#163;21,000 a year, and that is unaffordable. It had hoped that in the light of the announcement by the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, the hon.

When will the Government formally address this problem and provide these companies with the help they need?</p>

He will be aware, however, that there is a private trade credit insurance market, and it is also important to ensure that we protect the taxpayers&#146; interests. He is calling for more action, and I respect that position and think it right that we try to do more, but he should also be prepared to put money behind that, and that is something that his party has persistently refused to do.</p>

 May I remind the Chief Secretary that in November I wrote a letter to the Chancellor and Lord Mandelson after discussions with Marsh insurers about credit insurance, and the situation is still precarious, so I think further negotiations need to take place in that area? Dare I also mention the remarks of the Governor of the Bank of England to the Treasury Committee the other day?

 My right hon. Friend is correct to say it is right to support the economy at this difficult time. That means providing support for businesses to deal with the pressures they are facing as a result of the global credit crunch, and particularly also support for those who are losing their jobs. That is why we are putting more than &#163;1 billion of additional funding into, for example, helping those who are losing their jobs&#151;investment that, sadly, is continuously opposed by the Conservative party.</p>

 The restoration of trust in the banking system is essential; it is a precondition of fixing the problems in the wider economy, here and across the world, and it is absolutely necessary. The second thing to say to the hon. Gentleman is that it was necessary, as I believe most people accept, for us to recapitalise the banks in October. It was also necessary to go further than that and to help to deal with the problem that we face of these banks having on their books assets for which there is no market or whose value has been much reduced. That is why we introduced the asset protection scheme&#151;the United States Government have announced something similar in its intent earlier this week, and other countries are doing that too. We have to make sure that we fix the banking conditions, because that is a precondition of sorting out the wider problems in the economy. Our approach is having an effect and will continue to have an effect. There is no overnight fix, but we are doing the right things to get lending and credit flowing in the economy, as well as supporting the wider economy and protecting jobs.</p>

We can&#146;t get it!&#148; That comes from sound, reliable businesses.

 Yes, and we will continue to do that. I can understand the frustrations of businesses and individuals when they find that a credit line that was available is no longer available, or that the price being charged has increased. Our objective in everything we are doing to support the banking system is to get credit flowing in the economy again. As I said a moment ago, that is essential. We will continue to monitor what banks are doing. There is some evidence that in several cases credit is now available, although as we continue through one of the severest downturns we have seen&#151;the House will have seen the figures from Japan and Germany earlier this week, which show a significant downturn&#151;it is necessary that we maintain the course that we have set and do everything that we can to get credit flowing again.

It did not put in enough capital and did not deal with the assets that had gone bad, and until one addresses those problems anything else that one might do will not have the full effect that is hoped for. The Japanese are now quite clear about what went wrong in the previous decade and that is why most countries are now at pains to avoid it. The very fact that Japanese exports have gone down by nearly 50 per cent. demonstrates the extraordinary circumstances that we face. When a country such as Japan is facing such problems, there is all the more reason for us not only to take action to deal with the bank problem and to sort that out, but to take whatever action is necessary to support the economy through fiscal stimulus. We have given the Bank of England additional firepower to put more money into the economy, because that is essential if we are to protect jobs in quite extraordinary conditions across the world.</p>

 I am quite clear that banks should not be lending to businesses when underlying weaknesses are not being properly addressed. However, it seems to me that in my constituency at least many decent businesses, without underlying weaknesses, are told when they apply for credit that they have to cover that advance many times over&#151;sometimes twice&#151;with securities. I believe that the banks have to take some of the risk themselves, rather than trying to transfer the whole amount to small business owners, who have wives, families and so on to keep. It is quite unrealistic to expect that level of cover from ordinary small businesses when advancing credit.</p>

 If my hon. Friend would let me have a note of some of the problems that his constituents have encountered, I would be happy to look at them. I agree that as part of the process of restoring trust in the banking system we have to be clear about banks&#146; responsibilities as well as the responsibilities of individuals and businesses. If someone takes out a loan, they have to be clear that they can repay it. Equally, banks have to be responsible in their lending and ensure that they are realistic and reasonable about the conditions that they impose. That is very important and it is all part of restoring trust in the system, which I regard as absolutely essential.</p>

 Does the Chancellor agree that with the declining prospect of growth in the economy, the banks are faced with an inevitable deterioration in the quality of their loan books, so that far from increasing their loans to businesses, they are likely to be seeking the whole time to increase their capital? How will that problem be overcome?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises a quite reasonable point. All over the world, we have this problem. We need to ensure that banks strengthen their capital position, because in the long term that is essential. Of course, if banks did that and there was no other intervention, there would be less credit in the economy and the economy would shrink further. The result would be that the bank assets that are currently impaired would become even worse. That is why we have not only taken action to recapitalise the banks&#151;in the case of RBS and Lloyds Group we have put additional capital in&#151;but put in place schemes such as the credit guarantee scheme, which is working very well, the special liquidity support system, which has provided liquidity for the banks, and, in addition, the asset protection scheme, which, as I have said, will go down a similar road to the scheme in the United States. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman recognises that, as he is in a minority in his party in that he sees the point and the reason behind Government intervention in such extraordinary circumstances. Government intervention is absolutely necessary to complement the process that he and I agree has to take place if we are to maintain credit in the economy.</p>

It is especially necessary for young people, to ensure that they get back into the workplace as quickly as possible. However, I repeat that it means that at some stage we have to be prepared to spend the money to back that up. My view is that it is money well spent, because the cost of doing nothing, which is what the Opposition urge us to do, would be far, far greater.</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend. The fall in world trade is one reason why industrial production is falling. It is interesting that, in the exchange of letters that I had with the Governor of the Bank of England, he made the point that in 54 of the 57 countries for which we have data, falls in industrial output were seen over the last quarter of 2008. That has had a devastating effect on economies, particularly in the far east.</p>

Nobody is saying that they need to turn up next Wednesday with a budget on the table, but we are saying that if countries act together the effect will be far greater.

It is important&#151;and no one should be in any doubt about this&#151;that, yes, we need to take measures now, as I have said, as the Governor has said, as the Prime has said, to support our economy, but all of three of us have also made the point that it is necessary to make sure that in the longer term we have a sustainable position and that all countries live within their means.

We ought to look at how we can protect manufacturing when the economy goes into growth, and the best way of doing so is through a short-term working subsidy. Will he look at that, and if he is looking at how we can fund it, he can always end the VAT cut early so that that much-needed measure can put the impetus back into manufacturing?</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend and he is right to draw attention to the range of measures that are in place to support the automotive industry.

If their income falls by &#163;40 a week, perhaps as a result of short-time working, the tax credit award could well go up by &#163;15 a week. So there is real and immediate help from the tax credit system to people in the position that my hon. Friend describes. We are looking at other options. We are looking, for example, at the possibility of a wage subsidy scheme that we have seen elsewhere, to see whether that could add to the real help that we are already giving. The car industry is making good use of the Train to Gain support of up to &#163;100 million, which my hon. Friend mentioned. We are giving the help that is needed.</p>

 My hon. Friend raises an understandable concern for pubs throughout the country. He will know the number of pubs in this country has been declining pretty steadily over the past 20 years or so. He is right to say that there are many factors that influence the price of beer that the customer pays in the pub.

Both are equally important, because it is important that people pay what is due. On the hon.

It is not just there for one month, and it was not just there for Christmas. It is there for a 13-month period, and it has to be seen alongside a range of other measures: reducing tax for basic rate taxpayers, help for families and pensioners, and measures to bring forward construction. The difference between the hon. Gentleman and me is that I believe that Government have a duty to help the economy&#151;and should do so&#151;through times such as this, and he does not think so. The country will judge, but the lesson from the &#146;80s and &#146;90s is that if you do nothing, you will pay a heavy price.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman should know, as he was a Treasury Minister during the last recession, that there is a difference between the Bank of England&#146;s base rate, what is charged for lending and what banks offer savers. Some banks are trying to offer a higher rate to savers, which in turn has to be paid for by a higher rate for borrowers. In general, low interest rates benefit people, such as those on tracker mortgages and so on, and many are seeing the benefit of lower rates. However, as I said earlier, the key is to ensure that we have sufficient credit, and credit at a price that helps the economy, which is what our measures are geared to do.</p>

 On the Coroners and Justice Bill, if we had not had a programme motion, we might have ended up with two days&#146; discussion of inquests in camera. Twenty-five Members contributed to the first debate, which is why time was squeezed for the important discussions on murder. Because so many Members wanted to contribute to the first debate, exceptionally we allowed two days. If we had not had a programme motion, we would have ended up with two days&#146; debate on the first question. The programme motion ensured that on the second day we discussed incitement to homophobic hatred and a Government amendment tabled in response to complaints from the Opposition and others about our data-sharing measures.

 I reinforce the points that I have made about Naomi House providing an important service for families with children who need hospice care, and I know that my hon. Friend values that work. Naomi House was particularly unfortunate, because some 60 per cent. of its reserves were in one Icelandic bank. We want to ensure that the administrators ultimately cover all the deposits and that, ultimately, Naomi House gets its money back. However, that is not the point; the point is that Naomi House should be able to carry on doing its good work and extend it as planned. Last week, I spoke to the Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Phil Hope), about the matter, and meetings are taking place between Naomi House and the local primary care trusts and strategic health authority.

In Wales and England, a commitment has been made to secure 3 per cent. more efficiency in how public money is spent, but the Scottish Executive want to sign up to only 2 per cent.&#151;that is 1 per cent. less than in England and Wales.

Members surely wish to be able to hold RDAs to account for the balance of spending within a region, and the best way of doing that is by being on the relevant Regional Committee.

 I think that when the Chief Whip said that he thought 5 per cent. of Labour MPs were not pulling their weight he was confused; what we have seen today is that about 5 per cent. of Labour MPs are pulling their weight&#151;and that does include the Leader of the House. I hope she can use her weight to get a debate on the lack of educational psychologists in this country, particularly in Lancashire. One of my constituents wrote to me about the cancellation of an appointment with an educational psychologist. When I wrote to the county council, it said it was having great difficulty recruiting any educational psychologists. There is clearly a lack of them throughout the country, so can we have a debate on the issue?</p>

 No, he should not. I did not watch all of Treasury questions, so I do not know whether this matter was raised. The focus of Ministers, particularly Lord Myners, in relation to Royal Bank of Scotland was on the fact that one of the biggest banks in the world was about to go off the edge of a cliff. His and our determination was to ensure that that did not happen, as it would have had catastrophic effects on all the staff in the organisation and on the whole banking system&#151;in particular, on depositors. That was the main focus of his work, and it was the correct one. We are looking to see whether the pension arrangements really do hold water legally.</p>

 With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a statement on council tax in England and the capping action that the Government propose to take for 2009-10. Today, the Department has released figures showing that the average band D council tax increase in England next year will be 3 per cent., the lowest increase for 15 years. The average council tax rise for all households will be 2.6 per cent., the lowest ever since the council tax was introduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="90326-0006.htm_para1"><a name="09032638000273">There are three reasons for that. First, Government funding for local services is rising by 4.2 per cent. in 2009-10&#151;an extra &#163;3 billion and the 12th successive annual increase above inflation for local government since 1997. Secondly, local authorities are taking seriously their responsibility to residents to tighten their belts and operate more efficiently. Thirdly, although I know local government does not like it, council tax capping helps concentrate the minds of councils. I have consistently said that we will take tough action when it is necessary to protect council tax payers against excessive increases&#151;I said so to the House in November in my statement on the provisional local government finance settlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="90326-0006.htm_para2"><a name="09032638000274">I therefore want to set out for the House the action that we are now taking. Our capping principles relate both to an authority&#146;s council tax and to its budget requirement, which, broadly speaking, is the spending financed through the formula grant and council tax. I can confirm that our capping principles are that authorities&#146; 2009-10 requirements are excessive if they set a budget requirement increase of more than 4 per cent. for 2009-10 or a band D council tax increase of more than 5 per cent. For an authority that was set a notional budget requirement following capping action in 2008-09, these principles operate by reference to that notional budget requirement and a related notional amount of council tax calculated for that year. The principles are described in more detail in a report that I am placing in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="90326-0006.htm_para3"><a name="09032638000275">I realise&#151;especially as I look around the Chamber&#151;that not all Members will be familiar with the concept of a notional budget requirement. Put simply, it is one of our capping options. It involves the Government&#146;s setting figures for an authority against which their future increases are compared&#151;last year, those figures were equal to the caps that would otherwise have been imposed in year in 2008-09. The requirement puts a greater onus on authorities to control their budget and council tax the following year, as they are measured against the lower baseline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="90326-0006.htm_para4"><a name="09032638000276">Of the eight authorities against which we took capping action in 2008-09, four were set notional budget requirements. They were Bedfordshire, Norfolk and Surrey police authorities and Portsmouth city council. This year, two authorities have exceeded the principles I have announced. They are the police authorities of Derbyshire and Surrey. All other councils, police authorities and fire and rescue authorities have set increases within the limits I am confirming today.</p>

levels set last year. I am disappointed that Surrey has set an excessive increase for a second successive year. This is the first time under current legislation that we have had to take action against an authority more than once.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="90326-0007.htm_para1"><a name="09032638000278">Let me make it clear to the House that I am not announcing a cap on the council tax of Derbyshire and Surrey police authorities. I am starting a process that could lead to that. The authorities have a right under the legislation to challenge the proposed cap and to seek to justify their decisions. We will consider carefully all the representations the authorities may make before reaching any final decisions. Today I am writing to the chairs of the two police authorities confirming that I and my hon. Friend the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing will meet them personally to hear their case in person. After that, when we have considered any case made by the authorities, we can proceed either to designate&#151;or cap&#151;the authority for 2009-10, either at the level proposed today or at another level, or to nominate an authority, which means either capping the authority for next year, 2010-11, or setting a notional budget requirement for 2009-10 as the baseline for any future capping decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="90326-0007.htm_para2"><a name="09032638000279">Confirming a cap for this year would require the authority to re-bill residents for a lower council tax, with the cost falling on the capped authority. All authorities set their budget requirements and council tax in the full knowledge that excessive increases could lead to re-billing, so they can have no complaints about this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="90326-0007.htm_para3"><a name="09032638000280">The capping principles I have announced today are expressed in terms of band D council tax. That is because the band D amount that authorities are required to determine is set out by the legislation. However, the average household pays around &#163;240 less than the band D amount and the increase for average council tax next year is 2.6 per cent, the lowest increase ever since the council tax was first introduced by the Conservatives in 1993.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="90326-0007.htm_para4"><a name="09032638000281">I would like to end by looking ahead. Central Government funding increases, the concerted efficiency effort of many authorities and our commitment to tough capping action have resulted in some of the lowest council tax increases ever seen. Nevertheless, council tax payers will not be pleased to see that 86 authorities have set band D increases of more than 4.5 per cent., especially during this period of economic pressure all round, while 39 of these authorities have set rises of between 4.9 per cent and 5 per cent. Some suggest that that is because such authorities believe the Government have in place some standing 5 per cent cap. That is not the case. The Government have always been clear that our purpose when setting capping principles is to protect council tax payers from excessive increases. In the current economic climate, keeping council tax under control is more important than ever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="90326-0007.htm_para5"><a name="09032638000282">So, I put all authorities on notice for next year. It would be a serious mistake for any local authority to assume that the principles I have announced today for this year are in any way a guide to the approach or the levels I may set in future years. I commend the statement to the House.</p>

Is not the reality behind the Minister&#146;s words and this year&#146;s figures the fact that since 1997 council tax bills will have risen by &#163;726 a year on band D, the band that is the basis of the statutory measure? Given that has happened across the board, in councils of all types and all political compositions, will the Minister accept that the Government must take responsibility for these hikes? Council tax bills are rising by &#163;41 this April, compounding those previous rises. At a time when millions face losing their jobs or are suffering pay freezes, is that good sense? Is it sustainable that council tax bills are taking almost &#163;120 from the pockets of families? Is it acceptable that council tax has gone up by an inflation-busting 105 per cent. on this Government&#146;s watch? Is not the reality that the Government inherited a local government finance system that worked and that has at least been consistent&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I simply refer to a comment made by the Government in their 1998 local government Green Paper. It said:</p>
<a name="90326-0007.htm_brev0"><a name="09032638000816"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The council tax is working well as a local tax. It has been widely accepted and is generally very well understood.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="90326-0007.htm_para8"><a name="09032638000286">I hope that the Minister can help me on a couple of other specifics. Is not the 4.2 per cent. figure that he uses less than the whole picture? It relates to an increase in all grants, whereas the increase in formula grant&#151;the only area where local councils have discretion&#151;is considerably less?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="90326-0007.htm_para9"><a name="09032638000287">The Minister is right that the efforts of local authorities should be appreciated, but might not that be because the Conservative party controls more councils than Labour and the Liberal Democrats put together? Would he care to reflect on that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="90326-0007.htm_para10"><a name="09032638000288">Will the Minister confirm that one third of the basic state pension has been taken up in these council tax increases?

Why has the Audit Commission raised concerns about the method of funding distribution? It has said that</p>
<a name="90326-0007.htm_brev1"><a name="09032638000817"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;grant redistribution...has led to some councils putting up council tax more than others.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="90326-0007.htm_para11"><a name="09032638000289">Does that not raise the suspicion of fiddled funding? Is there not a need for a clearer and more transparent basis for setting the criteria for formula grant allocation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="90326-0007.htm_para12"><a name="09032638000290">Can the Minister help me in relation to capping? Is he aware that the small print of the statistical release shows increases in parish precepts of 5.8 per cent., which come on top of the 8.1 per cent. rise last year and the 6.7 per cent. increase the year before?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="90326-0007.htm_para13"><a name="09032638000291">The Minister referred to the increase in the grant for police authorities, and two questions arise from that. First, is there not a need for greater and more direct electoral accountability of police authorities? Secondly, is there not a need for a control that is more effective than the crude capping device? Instead of imposing a cap, would it not be better to give local residents the opportunity to decide in a local referendum?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="90326-0007.htm_para15"><a name="09032638000293">Will the Minister confirm whether the Government intend to carry out a revaluation after the next general election? He will know that the suspicion is that they do: if so, that will be a further council tax stealth tax. Otherwise, can he explain why the Valuation Office Agency recently renewed its contract with Rightmove, which allows it to plunder estate agency records to find out how many bedrooms, bathrooms and parking spaces each home has? If there are no revaluation preparations, why has the contract been removed and public money spent on it? It was said to have been drawn up explicitly for a revaluation. I remind the House that the VOA is the same agency that made such a mess of the ports revaluation that we debated in this House only yesterday.</p>

 I shall try to respond to the wide range of questions posed by the hon. Gentleman, but he can hardly say that the council tax is a stealth tax. Each year, the council tax settlement is debated and approved in this House, and the Minister in charge makes a statement, as I have done today. One of the difficulties is that the council tax is one of the most visible taxes, given the bills that residents receive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="90326-0007.htm_para18"><a name="09032638000297">At the outset, the hon. Gentleman asked me to make the case for the level of local government funding. Next year, there will be a 4.2 per cent. increase in the total Government grant to local authorities, which means that, for the 12th year in succession, local councils will get an above-inflation annual increase from this Government. The direct comparison is that they suffered a 7 per cent. cut in real terms in the last four years of the previous Conservative Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="90326-0007.htm_para19"><a name="09032638000298">I did not want to make this debate political, but the hon. Gentleman asked me to say what the position really is. I can tell him that the council tax for the average home is &#163;204 lower in Labour areas than in Tory areas, and &#163;134 lower than in Liberal areas. The rise this year in Labour areas is lower than in both Tory and Liberal areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="90326-0007.htm_para20"><a name="09032638000299">The hon. Gentleman asked about the grant distribution and pensioner take-up of council tax benefit. Both matters were debated last month when this House examined and approved the local government finance settlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="90326-0007.htm_para21"><a name="09032638000300">Finally, it is true that we do not have the legislative powers to take action against excessive rises in parish council precepts. We expect parish councils to set their budgets prudently and to take residents&#146; views into account and to respond to them. However, if it is necessary to take further steps or powers to deal with parish and town council precepts that become excessive for local council tax payers, we will do just that.</p>

 I thank the Minister for giving me advance notice of his statement. He lauds the 3 per cent. rise in council tax as a success, but does he recognise that it is still higher than inflation&#151;as it has been every year? Does he also recognise that council tax is felt more keenly than any other tax, because it is paid straight out of people&#146;s disposable income? As he acknowledged, many families are finding it very difficult to make ends meet at the moment. If both partners lose their job, they receive council tax benefit to meet the cost of the tax, but does he accept that the family will get landed with a large and unaffordable bill if just one partner becomes unemployed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="90326-0007.htm_para22"><a name="09032638000302">Does the Minister also recognise that what is happening in many families is that, although people are not necessarily losing their jobs, their employers are cutting back on their hours because of the recession?

In the light of that, will he commit to a moratorium on unfunded Government mandates to local authorities? Does he recognise that they will only make things worse?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="90326-0007.htm_para24"><a name="09032638000304">I was aghast to hear the final sentence in the Minister&#146;s statement.

Instead, we go through the same macho charade every year: the Government threaten councils with draconian action but will not tell them what they need to do to avoid the penalty, and the inevitable result is that council tax payers pick up the bill for the cost of rebilling local residents. Worse, that approach destroys any constructive relationship between central Government and local government.

 The Government promised to bring in proposals for reform of the local government superannuation pension scheme by 1 March. What has happened to those proposals, and does the Minister accept that what he has been saying is far too complacent? Collectively, local authorities have record levels of debt and unsustainable pension schemes.

 Among the 86 authorities whose council tax increase has been between 4.5 and 5 per cent. this year is Slough, despite its having an excellent Labour council. The reason is that Slough has more people than was estimated by the Office for National Statistics. I am deeply concerned that we shall continue to be bumping at the top level of council tax increases, because on the basis of the three-year settlement, Government grant will not be able to meet the needs of Slough&#146;s growing population. Can my right hon. Friend offer any comfort to my local council tax payers and my local council that they will have the services they need, properly funded, in future years?</p>

 The short answer to my hon. Friend is yes. Partly prompted by the case that she has made so assiduously in recent years, we now have a very detailed programme to improve population and migration statistics. We will make sure that those improvements take place, so that for the next spending review period, any decisions on local government funding, or other public sector funding that draws on those statistics, can be based on the improved population and migration statistics. She is right about the quality of her Labour council, which has a new leader, Rob Anderson. I visited the area several weeks ago to see for myself the innovation, the new services, and the serious way in which the council is going about not just managing the financial pressures that it is under, but making sure that it can improve services for people right across Slough.</p>

 I think that I can help in two ways. First, I can help by setting out, as I have done already, the funding that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s council, and other councils, can expect from central Government for the full three years of this settlement period. That will mean that they know where they stand, and can plan and manage for that period. Secondly, I point out that the regional improvement efficiency partnerships are in place. They are led by local government experts and specialists in the field. They have the sort of expertise from which his council may well benefit, as it prepares to manage its services this year and plan ahead for next year. I will ensure that the regional partnership gets in touch with his chief executive and offers what help it can, as the council looks ahead to next year. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to make representations to me about the funding for his council in the third year of the three-year settlement, I will of course see him at the appropriate time.</p>

 May I say to my right hon. Friend the Minister how much I welcome the extra &#163;3 billion for local authorities this year, but could he provide us with a little more information?

 We do not, at present, collect that information council by council, but we publish annually the reserves that local councils have in total. The last figures that we published put the figure at almost &#163;14 billion. That is clearly part of the financial calculation and budget planning undertaken by all local councils. Particularly during this period of economic pressure, it makes sense for councils to look hard at the level of their reserves. Having sufficient reserves is necessary if there is to be prudential management, but the high level of reserves held by some councils might, in this period of pressure, be put to good use to maintain services and to keep council tax pressures down.</p>

 Many councillors and tax payers in Cambridgeshire and many other areas will listen with astonishment to the Minister bragging about an increase of 4.2 per cent. in central Government funding when they see that the figure for their council is closer to just 1 per cent. Is it any surprise that they will naturally conclude that many other authorities must be getting considerably more than 4.2 per cent.? They will not be surprised to hear the Minister say that Labour councils are levying a lower average tax rise, because it is quite clear that the Government look after their own.

distributing funding to local councils. It applies equally across the country. He will also be aware that this Government introduced a system of floors. Without it, some of the councils that he may have in mind would, by rights, get less than they do. That floor is funded by taking the money off the rises for other authorities. He asks whether the residents of Cambridgeshire are aware of that; I ask him whether they are aware that his party plans, if it gets into power, to slash grants to local councils by &#163;240 million from next month.

 I note that in his inquiries about a possible capping of authorities, my right hon. Friend is including both the budget and the council tax levied by those authorities.

Is he therefore looking at measures to provide, in future years, a more accurate depiction of what may be excessive council tax increases? As far as capping is concerned, does he accept that if the Opposition had their way&#151;they want to freeze council tax for a period, and would apparently never change the basis on which council tax is valued or charged&#151;council tax would be centralised to such an extent that local authorities would not even have the choice of whether to levy a low council tax or a high council tax?</p>

 My hon. Friend is right, in that what we have heard from the Conservative party is a con. It is a con in two ways. First, it is a con to suggest that it will be a freeze for all councils, as has been promised, because the freeze will apply only to those that join the scheme. Secondly, it is a con to suggest that somehow that will give more power and decisions to the local area, because the constraints will still be set at the centre. He asked me whether I am considering seriously some of the principles of council tax. I know that he follows the subject, and is a source of fresh policy thinking almost without compare in this House. I am seriously considering a set of suggestions, and am looking very carefully at the ideas that he has submitted. I have a good deal of interest in them, and look forward to discussing them with him.</p>

 For the benefit of the House, LGR is local government reorganisation. Members should not make the mistake of accepting the hon. Gentleman&#146;s description of the way in which it is being handled. The short answer to his question is no, because from the outset of the process, we made it clear that if local authorities were going to play a part, they should cover the costs. We also made it clear that those costs should not be excessive. Clearly, councils that choose to use the legal process to try to influence the policy process should account for those costs to local residents. Finally, the important LGR process started with proposals that we received from councils, including councils within his area&#151;</p>

Closer to home, two lives have been appallingly lost on our own streets, with the murder of Sappers Patrick Azimkar and Mark Quinsey in Northern Ireland on 7 March. I cannot imagine that they envisaged being gunned down in cold blood at their base as they bought a final pizza before deploying to Afghanistan. Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with the families of these brave people and with those rebuilding their lives after serious wounds. Those who sacrifice most are quite rightly at the centre of the agenda and of media coverage, but the armed forces do not view themselves as victims. They stand for far more than that: honour; duty; sacrifice; commitment. Oft mocked as unfashionable, but they are surely qualities to which the whole of society should aspire. It is a privilege from a personal point of view to work with these extraordinary people.</p>

Every day, the men and women of our armed forces are asked to do incredibly difficult things on our behalf in some of the most dangerous countries in the world. Tragically, some of them pay the ultimate price. It is therefore our duty to ensure that the balance between what they do for us and what we do for them in return is correct. We must look carefully at the interdependence that exists between the armed forces, the society from which they recruit and to which they ultimately return, and the Government who require so much of them.</p>

I drifted on to the conservativehome website the other day, as I do from time to time, and I looked at the debate there. That is part of the democratic process, and I accept that parties have to have these debates, but it would be enormously helpful to the people who provide that service to our nation if Opposition Members clarified&#151;they can do so now, if they wish, or in their speeches&#151;their support or otherwise for that continued provision.</p>

 I very much agree with the aspiration that the Minister describes for the Army and, on the whole, that is how it is. Does he agree, nevertheless, that those values were sorely lacking at Deepcut Army barracks, and that the death of four recruits there in the most unusual circumstances was the antithesis of what the Army should be about? Can he explain why, even now, 14 years after the death of Cheryl James, we still have not had the release of important information, such as the report by Devon and Cornwall police on the Surrey police investigation into her death? Does he agree that for the Army to achieve exactly what he says, we must have transparency, the absence of which suggests to me that she was murdered and that this is a cover-up?</p>

 The Government pot is as big as it is, no matter where it comes from.

The House will be aware of our ongoing strategic review of the reserve forces. The review will ensure that we have reserve forces that meet defence needs now and into the future.

I hope he will be able to say that part of the reason is that the terms of reference do not preclude those carrying out the review from examining the gross misuse of the reserves over the past few years, as the current Government have sought to use them to make up for the very serious lack in regular forces during that period.</p>

 That is a travesty of the facts, if I may say so. Yes, we are behind on our original desire in respect of the review&#146;s time scale. But I have never been in any doubt that it was better for it to be done correctly than quickly, so I have never put the people involved in the review under any pressure to meet those deadlines and we have allowed the review not to meet the original times. Yes, the reserves have increasingly augmented our activities on operations, and when I meet and talk to them, I see that they do not mind that at all. What the reserves want is for their increased involvement to be reflected in their training and support, so our strategic thinking needs to some extent to catch up with what they have been delivering.</p>

by the amount of technological know-how that is required of our servicemen and women and how quickly they learn it. We must reinforce that aptitude as they retire from service. That is why the Command Paper now entitles all those who have served six years or more to free education up to degree level on retirement from the forces. That is a tremendous package to help our people to transfer successfully back into civilian life. The extraordinary opportunities offered during a services career now continue beyond it.

 May I add my condolences and those of my colleagues to those expressed by the Minister? Our thoughts and prayers are with the families, not only of those killed in action but of those who have been injured, in their ongoing suffering. The House should remember the sacrifices that they, too, have made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="90326-0010.htm_para2"><a name="09032638000409">It has been a privilege for me, like the Minister, to visit our armed forces in different parts of the UK, in Iraq and in Afghanistan, and to share the pride in and enthusiasm for what they do in our name. It is because of the esteem in which we hold our armed forces that so many of us were outraged by the events mentioned by the Minister involving those who chose to protest against the bravery and professionalism of our troops returning home from operations. I am sure that the whole House agrees that those returning from overseas deserve the full support of the British public, and nothing less. I think that decent-minded people were appalled and disgusted by the actions of unrepresentative extremists at the welcome home parade in Luton. It is, after all, thanks to the bravery and commitment of the men and women in our armed forces over many years that we have the freedom of speech that those nasty individuals were abusing, and they should be reminded of that fact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="90326-0010.htm_para3"><a name="09032638000410">The best way for us, as a society, to show our contempt for those people and our support for our troops is not to ban protests, as some have suggested, but to outnumber the protesters and drown them out. What could be a better response to what we saw in Luton than to see huge supportive crowds cheering home our returning forces? Our deeds, not our words, will show what we really stand for. That fact was demonstrated a few days after the Luton parade, in Watford, where a parade by the Royal Anglian Regiment drew out thousands of people cheering as the troops marched through the town centre. The crowed was supportive, appreciative and, in some ways, defiant&#151;a complete contrast to those ungrateful, unrepresentative extremists in Luton. Too often we allow minority voices to hijack the debate. The British public, the Government and Parliament must do all we can to encourage public support for the armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="90326-0010.htm_para4"><a name="09032638000411">As we debate the subject of defence in the United Kingdom, we would be negligent if we overlooked two major elements underpinning our nation&#146;s defence and, indeed, our role in the world: our nuclear deterrent and our ability to project power with aircraft carriers. I shall discuss the carriers first.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="90326-0010.htm_para5"><a name="09032638000412">An argument is made in some quarters that the carriers are useless because they will be of no help in the sort of conflict we face in Afghanistan. As things stand in the deserts of Helmand province, that is true, but it is beside the point. Nobody has ever tried to make an argument for the carriers on the basis that we needed them for current operations in Afghanistan, but I remind sceptics that there was a time, in the early days of the conflict in Afghanistan, when aircraft carriers were vital. For example, HMS Illustrious, with its 16 Harriers,  <br>

which took part in the initial attack in October 2001, when there was no regional airbase that could quickly and easily be used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="90326-0010.htm_para6"><a name="09032638000413">The argument against the carriers is also based on the false assumption that state-on-state conflict is a thing of the past. Unfortunately, history shows differently. Possessing the aircraft carriers in the 21st century will allow us to project power, influence and force in a way that would not otherwise be possible. In an era of globalisation, Britain&#146;s economic, trade and security interests are not only to be found here at home, in Gibraltar or in the Falklands, but around the globe, from the strait of Hormuz to the Malacca strait and most everywhere in between. In this complex world, British interests and the defence of the UK have no geographical boundaries, in the way that perhaps they did in the past. Because of that, we must have the ability to project power, influence and, if necessary, military force around the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="90326-0010.htm_para7"><a name="09032638000414">It is unfortunate that the Government have presided over delay after delay in the two carriers. They have now been in planning and design for twice the duration of the second world war. In December, right before the Christmas recess, we learned from a written statement that we can expect a further delay of up to two years. That was initially blamed on the joint strike fighter&#146;s entry into service, but we have since learned that that was not the main reason at all. I welcome the carriers as an important addition to the fleet and call on the Government to do everything they can to ensure their timely entry into service. However, we might ask why, when the Government are talking about bringing forward spending projects as part of the fiscal stimulus, major defence projects are being put back. But the current delay is only the tip of the iceberg in this Government&#146;s treatment of the Royal Navy. The journey that has led us to where our Navy is today has been one of serial betrayal by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="90326-0010.htm_para8"><a name="09032638000415">Time and again since the 1998 strategic defence review, our Navy has been blackmailed into accepting cuts to its fleet to ensure the eventual addition of the two new carriers that are so desperately needed. Back then, our Navy agreed to cut its fleet of 12 attack submarines to 10 and its fleet of 35 destroyers and frigates to 32, in return for the promise of the two carriers. A decade later, we find our Navy with only eight attack submarines, with a probable future reduction to six or seven, and an astonishingly low number&#151;22&#151;of destroyers and frigates. Maritime commitments have not decreased since 1998&#151;in fact, they have risen at a time when our Navy has been slashed, mothballed or, in some cases, sold off. Having an aircraft carrier capability allows us better to protect our global interests, but it cannot be used as an excuse for any further cuts to the capabilities of our Navy.</p>

 Surely the hon. Gentleman recognises that the biggest recent peacetime naval building programme is going on in the country.</p>

 Yes, and as I will say later, that programme is over schedule and over budget, and it comes in a period when the Navy has suffered unprecedented cuts but is still being asked to carry out a wide range of functions. The Navy was told that it needed a certain number of frigates and destroyers to carry out the tasks set out in the strategic defence review, but year on year, the Government cut back on those. It is only the astonishing  <br>

professionalism of the Royal Navy that has enabled us to carry out so many of the tasks so well during that difficult period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="90326-0010.htm_para9"><a name="09032638000418">Many of the same arguments for supporting the carrier programme are applicable to the nuclear deterrent. The Minister began by asking about the commitment of my party to a nuclear deterrent. If hon. Members think back, they will remember that my party has always been committed to such a deterrent. It was those on the left who tried throughout the 1980s to go for unilateral nuclear disarmament and who did not support the nuclear deterrent. There are three reasons why we must have a nuclear deterrent. The first is the unpredictable nature of the post-cold war era. The harsh reality is that in many ways we had it easy with the bipolarity and general predictability of the cold war. As opposed to the concept of east versus west, or democracy versus communism, the global security environment in which we are now forced to operate more closely resembles the multipolarity of the 19th century&#151;not the 20th century, for which our instruments of national defence are structured. No one can accurately predict the threats that the UK will face between 2025 and 2055, when the next generation of the deterrent will be in service, just as no one 20 years ago could have predicted the speed of the collapse of the Soviet Union or the nature of the conflicts in which we are involved in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="90326-0010.htm_para10"><a name="09032638000419">Secondly, nuclear weapons simply cannot be uninvented; they will remain part of the international security picture in the future. The acquisition of nuclear weapons by North Korea and their attempted acquisition by Iran are real threats to our security. We do not have the right to gamble with the security of future generations. Thirdly, the United Kingdom has traditionally played a bigger role in acting on a number of global security-related issues than many of our medium-sized allies, especially in Europe. Consequently, we are more susceptible to future nuclear blackmail by rogue states in possession of nuclear arms.</p>

<p><a name="st_o248"><a name="09032638000420"><a name="90326-0010.htm_spnew4"><a name="09032638001114"><b>Nick Harvey (North Devon) (LD):</b>
 I am listening closely to the hon. Gentleman. Do I understand the logic of his argument to be that there are no circumstances in which it would ever be possible for the UK to renounce its nuclear weapons?</p>

<p><a name="st_o249"><a name="09032638000421"><a name="90326-0010.htm_spnew5"><a name="09032638001115"><b>Dr. Fox:</b>
 If, in the improbable event that we were able to technically uninvent nuclear weapons, they did not exist in any other part of the globe and there was no chance of them coming into existence in any other part of the globe, that might be a realistic suggestion, but while they do exist and while this country may be threatened or subjected to nuclear blackmail, we must maintain a minimum nuclear deterrent. There are strong arguments for big reductions in the number of warheads held globally. There is a strong economic, moral, political and military argument for big reductions in the stockpiles of Russia and America, and I can see no strong argument against such reductions, but we in the United Kingdom have to be the arbiters of our own destiny. We have to be able to determine our own security, and while nuclear weapons exist, we in the UK are prudent and wise to retain and maintain a minimum effective nuclear deterrent.</p>

 In the light of what the hon. Gentleman said, what does he make in the letter of 16 January in <i> The Times</i> in the names of Field Marshal Lord Bramall, General Lord Ramsbottom and General Sir Hugh Beach&#151;people who would not normally be partial on these things&#151;which was headlined, &#147;The UK does not need a nuclear deterrent&#148;?

 They are perfectly entitled to their opinion. I happen to think that it is wrong. The nature of the threats that we face has changed quickly from the relative symmetry of the cold war to a range of other asymmetric and complex threats, and it could very well change again. Ultimately, the onus of explanation is not on those of us who wish to retain a deterrent, but on those who want to scrap it. They must tell us why they believe that they can predict the risks that we will face in half a century&#146;s time. The Government&#146;s White Paper, published in 2006, described the independent British nuclear deterrent as</p>
<a name="90326-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="09032638000424"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;an essential part of our insurance against the uncertainties and risks of the future&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="90326-0010.htm_para11"><a name="09032638000425">I fully endorse that sentiment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="90326-0010.htm_para12"><a name="09032638000426">It is an interesting element of the political debate that many of the opponents of the carrier programme and our nuclear deterrent are the same individuals who at other times claim that Britain is already too dependent on, and too close to, American foreign and defence policy. In fact, not having the aircraft carriers or a nuclear deterrent would make us even more dependent on the United States for our security. While British and American interests are likely to coincide in the future, and the Anglo-American relationship remains our most important strategic alliance, the UK must ultimately be able to guarantee its own security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="90326-0010.htm_para13"><a name="09032638000427">It has been widely reported in the media and written answers that Russia has once again taken up its cold war habit of probing UK airspace. I understand, as we all do, that for operational security reasons the Government are unable to comment in detail on the Floor of the House on what actions have been taken to deal with Russia&#146;s actions, but I hope that in his winding-up speech this evening, the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones), will be able to give us an idea of the number and frequency of incursions and offer the House assurances that procedures are fully in place to deal with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="90326-0010.htm_para14"><a name="09032638000428">In addition, will the Minister say whether his Department has seen an increase in Russian submarine incursions into British territorial waters? We hear often about Russian planes challenging the integrity of our airspace, but seldom, if ever, about what is going on below the surface. There is good reason to be believe that such incursions are occurring, and as we are an island nation with only three naval bases, it is an important matter. I hope that he will address it.</p>

On the contrary, it looks like it is spending at an ever-increasing rate. Russia may  <br>

be building up from a low base, given the degraded state of its conventional forces, and it may not pose a direct threat to the security of this country, but the Russian leadership has shown in Georgia how it could destabilise our allies and threaten our security indirectly through a stranglehold on energy supplies. The cyber-attacks in Estonia, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan, for which the finger points at Russia, mean that we must maintain our vigilance and invest in the technology to deal with threats that could in future occur in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="90326-0010.htm_para16"><a name="09032638000430">Our armed forces have seen a lot of combat in recent years, in the Gulf war, the Balkans, Sierra Leone, Iraq and Afghanistan. Improvements in body armour and vehicles have meant that many injuries that were once fatal are now survivable. We will see many disabled young veterans, and our society will have to adjust to that. However, that is only the visible damage: what is invisible must concern us as well. I would like the topic of mental health in the armed forces to be much higher up this country&#146;s political agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="90326-0010.htm_para17"><a name="09032638000431">The Under-Secretary of State for Defence, the hon. Member for North Durham, told GMTV earlier this week that a study had shown that</p>

That is a lot of individuals requiring a lot of care. The hon. Gentleman went on to claim that the study showed that those who had not been deployed on operations suffered more than those who had. There was something unclear about that, as it is true only of those suffering from mood disorders and depressive episodes. In fact, the report clearly states that the rate of post-traumatic stress disorder was higher among those deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan than among those not deployed there.</p>

 The Minister says that he said that, which I accept. However, PTSD often takes a long time to manifest itself. I fear that, with deployment after deployment, year after year, the mental health problems we face now, if unchecked, could become a mental health crisis, partly because our armed forces are operating at a tempo for which they are neither fully resourced nor fully manned.</p>

 I recognise the problem of PTSD, but does the hon. Gentleman not recognise that the number of people involved is small? It is higher among those deployed, as we would expect, but the important thing is to ensure that we do not confuse the broader issue of the mental health disorders that members of the armed forces face by concentrating overmuch on PTSD.</p>

 Clearly they are separate, if related, issues, but the point about PTSD is that the number of people affected now are, almost by definition, the tip of the iceberg, because of the late presentation of the condition. We can expect to see more cases in future, and we as a society have a moral duty to prepare for that. We cannot only look after the physical injuries of those who fight in our name. We must place equal importance on those who suffer mental trauma.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a very powerful point about this problem, which affects very damaged people, albeit a small number, who need help. Does he agree that perhaps the most disadvantaged group of all is those who have served in the reserves and cannot go back to a unit that is there full-time to look after them? Does he agree also that we could make far more use of reserve medical officers, who know what it is like to serve in uniform but are already embedded in the NHS, in solving the problem?</p>

 I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend. Indeed, our servicemen and women in the Territorial Army experience a further, unique set of problems. When a member of the TA returns home from operations, there is little or no formal support group or structure to fall back on, or camaraderie with fellow troops who have had similar experiences. There are no familiar faces on a base and no friends to meet for a pint to talk about what they have gone through. More often than not, TA service members simply return to their civilian jobs and go back to family life without the safety net apparatus that is provided by being a member of the regular forces. They are at particular risk. We have a duty to recognise that and put in place mechanisms to guarantee their safety.</p>

That is putting great strain on the charity&#146;s resources. Given that the disorder arises directly from employment in Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces, is that not something that we really have to address?</p>

 Indeed it is. Mental health services are the Cinderella service in the NHS, and as a society we must re-evaluate whether the way in which we treat those with mental health problems represents the social values that we would like to see in the world&#146;s fifth richest country in the 21st century. I met representatives of Combat Stress yesterday. Such charities do a wonderful job, but we will have to do a lot more if we are properly to fulfil our obligations to those who, as my hon.

By contrast, the House might be interested to know that Foreign Office officials in Afghanistan get two weeks&#146; compulsory decompression for every six to seven weeks in theatre. Even better, Department for International Development officials are entitled to the same two-week break away from post for every six weeks in theatre, but they can take a break anywhere in the world on condition that the cost is equal to or less than that of a flight back to the UK.

The Nimrod MRA4 project, which is delayed by 92 months, is &#163;789 million over budget, and the order size has been reduced from 21 to 12. The Astute class submarine, which is delayed by 47 months, is &#163;1.228 billion over budget. The Type 45 destroyer is delayed by 42 months and is &#163;989 million over budget.</p>

Our attack submarines are down by four, our frigates and destroyers by 12, our aircraft carriers by one, fixed-wing aircraft by 168, infantry battalions by four, and armoured fighting vehicles by 479. According to the Government&#146;s own figures, 31 out of 36 infantry battalions are under-strength, the shortage being equivalent to four battalions-worth of soldiers. Twelve out of 14 TA infantry battalions are under-strength.</p>

Despite the two wars, this year&#146;s defence spending, at 2.2 per cent. of GDP, is the lowest since the 1930s. To cap it all, the Government have not conducted a strategic defence review for this country in 12 years. It is a desperately sorry record, which will take a very different Government a long time to put right.</p>

 I thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to speak in this afternoon&#146;s debate. I pay tribute to the magnificence of our armed forces and their daily heroism, which we witness across the world. They are engaged on a number of fronts that nobody predicted or imagined.

the most important areas, although it is often neglected and not fully discussed in the House: armed forces training. We can only have the best armed forces in the world&#151;I happen to think that we have&#151;if we provide them with the best possible training in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="90326-0011.htm_para5"><a name="09032638000449">Since the end of the cold war, UK defence policy has gone through major changes, to which the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) referred. Through a series of defence reviews, we have reconfigured our force structures and armed forces to meet the new challenges resulting from the great unpredictability in the world. We need the ability to respond, which we have had in the past eight years, to unexpected challenges, to be flexible, to have much greater reach, and to be much more effective all round in different scenarios. The predictable scenarios of the cold war no longer exist, so we have, by and large, reconfigured our forces. Although there is some debate over that, it is generally agreed that it was necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="90326-0011.htm_para6"><a name="09032638000450">We have reconfigured our kit to meet some of the new challenges. The aircraft carriers are on-stream to give us power projection worldwide. The one area that we have not reconfigured, however, is arguably the most important: the training of our enlisted men, ratings and NCOs. The training of the officer corps in the British forces in leadership and management has been successfully modernised and transformed, as the Select Committee on Defence saw on its visit to the defence academy at Shrivenham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="90326-0011.htm_para7"><a name="09032638000451">The big challenge is modernising and transforming the rest of the services, particularly the skills and technical training of our armed forces. Eight years after the Government published a report stating that our training regime had to be modernised, we are nearing the end of delivering that for our armed forces. The defence training rationalisation programme is well advanced. The Minister made a statement recently in which he said that progress on that vital and radical project is on track and progressing well. Two weeks ago, a minute before the House extended the contingent liability to &#163;40 million for the biggest Government PFI undertaken in any Department, to allow advanced design work and preparation for the scheme to continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="90326-0011.htm_para8"><a name="09032638000452">The project will completely transform and modernise our delivery of training. It will compress all our training in engineering, mechanical engineering, aeronautical engineering, electro-engineering, computer science and information technology, into one site in my constituency, at St. Athan. It will be the largest technical college by far in the United Kingdom, and one of the largest technical colleges and centres for technical excellence in the world. It will offer British armed forces, especially new, young recruits, the best technical training in the world. Nothing will compare with it anywhere else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="90326-0011.htm_para9"><a name="09032638000453">All that training will be recognised in the civilian community, because qualifications will be civilian as well as military. I learned a skill in the armed forces in the 1960s, but it was no good to me when I finished, and I had to retrain. Many of our servicemen and women still have to do that today, despite the fact that 90 per cent. of them get civilian occupations within 28 days of leaving the forces, which is a tribute to their calibre and quality. However, the new training regime, at the defence technical college at St. Athan, will ensure that all our military personnel will leave with civilian qualifications. That is good for recruitment, because it will make a career in the armed forces much more attractive. It is  <br>

also good for society, because the engineers who will be turned out over the next 30 years&#151;the duration of the PFI&#151;will serve the community at large. They will be provided with the most modern training environment in the world, using modern, computer-based equipment, virtual training techniques, and student-based and task-oriented training, not the traditional chalk and talk, which has served us well for many years but is out of date for the 21st century and the challenges that we face.</p>

 I will refer specifically to the timetable, because I think that it is critical at present. As I have said, the project is on course, but Members should bear it in mind that it is one of the largest and most complex PFI projects ever tackled. The idea that no complexities, problems or challenges will arise throughout its duration is absurd. There are bound to be challenges, but I believe that there is a clear timetable.</p>

It is detailed planning, for a massive 600-acre new-build development. This thing is gigantic. The construction programme alone is on a par with the one for the London Olympics. It is therefore understandable that there will be some delays. However, we can reasonably expect construction to begin in August 2010, phase 1 to be completed by the beginning of 2014, and phase 2 to be completed by 2015.</p>

I apologise for possibly accentuating my argument a bit too much. The term that I used was not intended to be derogatory towards the current providers, who supply excellent training on the nine legacy sites and the three existing military technical colleges.

wish for a better site than St Athan, which will be a purpose-built facility. I recall with horror and terror going to my first camp, as a young recruit, on a dark December evening. I thought that I had descended into hell. There was no heating. It was an old second world war barracks in Newark, for goodness&#146; sake. It was a quite terrifying experience. These youngsters, however, will enter one of the most modern learning environments imaginable: brand new, and offering the best training&#151;largely from the private sector&#151;and the best trainers in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90326-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09032638000462">Furthermore, during their stay at St Athan, the length of which will vary, men and women will have a choice. They will be able to go sailing along the beautiful heritage coast in the morning, go climbing in the Brecon Beacons in the afternoon, and at night go clubbing in Cardiff, one of the fastest-growing and most popular cities in Europe. What more could we offer them?</p>

 I have been listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman, and he must forgive me if I have forgotten, but I am not sure whether he has mentioned the overall cost of this magnificent project at St Athan, which is due to begin in 2010. What investment is required from the British taxpayer?</p>

 Very little. This is a &#163;12 billion PFI project spread over 25 to 30 years, but much of the risk will be carried by the private sector, and in particular by the two equity partners in Metrix, QinetiQ and Sodexo. This is a PFI project with much of the risk shifted to one side.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="90326-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09032638000465">As for the cost to the taxpayer, not only will we benefit from the most modern training in the world, but we will save money. The cost savings associated with reducing nine sites to one and getting rid of the current duplication in parts of our training provision over the next 25 years could be enormous. We win both ways. We win by securing the most modern training on offer in the most fantastic environment for learning, and we win by, over time, saving money in the defence training budget. That is what makes the project so attractive, and that is why&#151;certainly in Wales&#151;it has received all-party support from day one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="90326-0011.htm_para18"><a name="09032638000466">Progress is being made, and it is being made well. We want that progress to continue until construction starts next year. The facility will provide 1,200 courses. Up to 6,000 recruits at any one time, and up to 25,000 military personnel per year, will be trained on the purpose-built site. The MOD and the Metrix consortium have worked very closely with members of the local community, and have adapted some of their proposals after consulting them. We expect the detailed planning for this huge development to proceed relatively seamlessly in the spring because of the involvement of the community.</p>

It is sometimes forgotten that the better trained and better equipped our armed forces are, the fewer casualties result when they engage in warfare. Superior training is much more valuable than large numbers.</p>

One of the reasons the Russians are considering modernising their forces is that, by and large, that invasion was a disaster. There was little control over the military personnel.

The men and women who represent this country so courageously every day in some of the most difficult environments imaginable&#151;in recent years, the Defence Committee has had the privilege of visiting some of them&#151;deserve nothing less than the best possible training in the world.

 Like the Minister and the shadow Secretary of State, I start by expressing condolences in respect of those who have died recently not only in Afghanistan, but, as we have heard, tragically and appallingly in Northern Ireland. The Minister pointed out that that takes the count of those who have died in Afghanistan to 152. Each of those casualties is an individual tragedy not only personally, but collectively for our armed forces. In addition to those 152 deaths, we must remember those who have been seriously injured or wounded, some of whom have been wounded in life-changing ways. We do not discuss those people as often as we should. There is something rather British about that, and it is certainly conspicuous that the Americans and, I think, the Canadians often pay greater tribute to their wounded personnel than us.</p>

Although the figure of 152 deaths is shocking, if one considers the length of time that we have been in Afghanistan, the huge number of our personnel who have served there and the extraordinarily dangerous work, it is worth pausing and counting our blessings that that number is not a great deal higher. I take the view that that figure might have been higher, which would certainly have been the case in the past. Among other things, we should pay tribute to the advances in medical expertise that have prevented the situation from being a great deal worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="90326-0011.htm_para26"><a name="09032638000475">Both Front Benchers rightly referred to the disgraceful scenes when the Royal Anglian Regiment paraded in Luton, and I echo the sentiments expressed by other hon. Members. It occurs to me that those who mounted those ill-judged protests shot themselves in the foot in terms of the cause that they were trying to promote. The overall effect was to give far more public attention to the home-coming parade than might otherwise have been the case and to unite public opinion in appreciation of what those troops have done on our behalf and in abhorrence at the protestors and their message. The public are now showing a greater appreciation of our armed forces; that has increased a lot in a remarkably short period of time. The regular scenes in Wootton Bassett that we have heard about are a leading example of that. In previous debates in this House, many Members have made the point that our work in Afghanistan is sometimes misunderstood by the British public, but I draw some encouragement from the fact that there is now growing appreciation of what we are trying to achieve there.</p>

I particularly welcome the announcement of a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq, and I recall with some amusement that when we Liberal Democrats argued previously for that, we were lampooned on the basis that we could not have a timetable for withdrawal and it was naive of us to think that such a thing could be done as we should never signal our intentions to the enemy. However, we said at the time that the day would inevitably come when the Government would announce a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq, and they have now done so, and so too have the Americans. It is my sincere belief&#151;as it was when my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell) first suggested to this House that there ought to be a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq&#151;that that is long overdue and could have been done a great deal earlier.</p>

As has been said, it is perfectly true that there has been substantial and significant reorganisation of our armed forces since the end of the cold war, but it is still possible to level the criticism that we remain too much configured along cold war lines and that there is a need for further reorganisation to get us configured for the modern-day realities. America has, I believe, woken up to this; President Obama is planning an overhaul of US defence procurement and strategy, bringing it out of the cold war era. When, I wonder, will we? In every debate Ministers are urged to set up a new strategic defence review so that we can reassess and realign defence, where necessary, and make new decisions about how to face future threats and challenges, yet still they resist any suggestion that that should happen. I am confident that after the next election, whatever its outcome, a strategic defence review will be set up, but it could be doing its work a great deal sooner if some of the scoping of it were to be set in train now and were to be subject to some debate before the election.</p>

I hope that lessons will also be learned for operations in Afghanistan, where there are still many challenges ahead, most notably the real problem of overspill into Pakistan, which is, itself, very unstable at the moment.

Estimates of true defence inflation vary; some say that it is at least 3 per cent., whereas other figures that are cited are higher. It is clear that the defence industry is not going to remain untouched by the current economic difficulties, and this will bring uncertain consequences for the skills bases, contracts and projects involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="90326-0012.htm_para4"><a name="09032638000487">In these uncertain times, the defence industry is partly immune from the wider malaise, but we must be careful to ensure that the economic difficulties do not impede further our activities overseas or the delivery of vital resources to the front line. The recent Defence Committee report highlighted that, even now, there are problems with equipment. Our track record on procurement is like a broken record: delayed, over budget and below requirement. The Government have yet to face up to the reality of how on earth they will be able to afford all the programmes that are still in place in principle on the budget that is available at the moment and what they will do to get industry on board, to try to make the delivery of existing projects more efficient.</p>

We have heard that Nimrod is to be grounded, which is an admission that the fleet is not fit to fly. It seems to have taken Ministers a long time to arrive at that conclusion, whereas aircrew, coroners and others have been saying for some time that the aircraft are not airworthy. It does not surprise me, in the light of the current economic storm, that Trident and the proposal to renew it has been mentioned. We heard from the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) that some distinguished retired military figures have been debating it. We heard from the Minister that people have been debating it on the ConservativeHome website. There is renewed interest in the subject in the light of the economic crisis.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point. It is right to ask questions about this issue. We believe that the House was premature in seeking to make a decision two years ago. A final decision does not have to be made, and in truth will not be made, until main gate, which is the point at which the Thatcher Government made the political decision about Trident. The significant costs of Trident replacement will begin to rack up only midway through the next decade. I do not suggest that the questions need to be answered today, any more than they had to be two years ago, but it is right that the questions are being asked. They will continue to be asked from now right through to the time at which any decision is made. It is especially apt that the questions arise at the moment, as we progress towards the 2010 non-proliferation treaty conference talks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="90326-0012.htm_para6"><a name="09032638000491">I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox), who expressed his sincerely held view, which can be fairly characterised as being that there were no circumstances in which he thought it would ever be possible for the UK to give up its nuclear deterrent. That is a point of view, and he is entitled to hold it, but if he, as a Minister, were to articulate that position on behalf of the UK, it would undoubtedly put us in breach of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. We have binding and solemn commitments under that treaty that it is our duty to try to fulfil at all times.</p>

Withdrawing from Iraq will alleviate some of the burden, but Afghanistan will continue to take its toll. The mental health casualties will start to become more apparent in the coming years, and we surely all agree that more needs to be done to tackle this issue head on. However, I welcome the progress that has been made recently. We still have a huge problem of alcohol and substance abuse among former personnel, and a high proportion of prisoners&#151;one in 11, or some 8,000&#151;are ex-services.</p>

For service personnel and their families we must do more to honour our commitments. In particular, a recent National Audit Office report revealed that housing was still in a sorry state. As I have said before in these debates, at the current rate of progress, it will take 20 years to bring all the housing up to scratch. That was widely pooh-poohed at the time, but I was intrigued to note that the NAO report arrived at the same figure.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that that is a legacy of the privatisation by the previous Government of the MOD housing stock to Annington Homes? It also represents the failure of this Government to address the problem, because 12 years down the line the public purse is still spending a small fortune for property that it does not, and will never, own unless legislation is introduced to bring MOD housing back under MOD ownership.</p>

 There is no doubt in my mind that the Annington deal was a bad deal for the taxpayer and that we have, in a sense, been paying a price for that ever since.

Although we must continue to have a strong bilateral partnership with the United States, it is in its interest as well as ours to have a stronger European partner this side of the Atlantic.

drunk man uses the lamp post&#151;for support rather than illumination. The Minister and the Government know as well as the rest of us that although those statistics might have some technical accuracy, they are combined with equally important facts that were referred to by my hon. Friend the shadow Defence Secretary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="90326-0012.htm_para14"><a name="09032638000504">Over the past 12 years, we have seen a dramatic reduction in the number of aircraft and combat ships and in the manpower of the armed forces. We have also seen the Government&#146;s inability to carry out the task that they have appointed for themselves without extraordinary overstretch for the armed forces and an unprecedented use of our reserve forces, to which I shall return in a few moments&#146; time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="90326-0012.htm_para15"><a name="09032638000505">So, how does one explain the fact that despite real growth the outcome is so depressing? Part of it, as my hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) said, was that the increase in the cost of procurement projects is vastly greater than any retail prices index might show when it is used to determine the defence budget. That is clearly part of the explanation, but another element has been the continuing and increasing pressure to improve&#151;quite rightly, in many ways&#151;the pay and allowances for our armed forces. That, too, is something that we welcome, but it has the consequences to which I have referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="90326-0012.htm_para16"><a name="09032638000506">However, the Government cannot escape the fact that another part of the explanation is that their policy over the past 12 years has resulted in far greater use of our armed forces in a series of wars, conflicts and operations. That has not been funded simply by the reserve, because it has involved a much greater utilisation of equipment. The fact that that equipment is used far more often means that it has a shorter life and constantly needs to be repaired and improved, and the overall impact has been of a very serious order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="90326-0012.htm_para17"><a name="09032638000507">I freely acknowledge&#151;indeed, I take great pride in the fact&#151;that, after the US, the UK and France are the only countries that can claim a significant ability to deploy armed forces around the world. There are larger armies&#151;in Russia, India and China, and so forth&#151;but, for various reasons with which I am sure that the House is familiar, the UK and France remain very important countries. I deliberately include France in this regard because it is comparable with the UK in the sense that both countries are able to match diplomacy with military capability, where that is appropriate. That is hugely desirable but, despite the incredible economic growth we are told we have had over the past 12 years and the huge cash going to the MOD, there has still been extraordinary overstretch in all sorts of ways. If that has been true during the years of plenty, what do we have to look forward to now, given that we have entered a period for which there are extremely lean implications?</p>

I think that he is right, but we must clarify what we mean by that. In a sense, I am addressing my comments on this matter to both Front-Bench teams because, although there will undoubtedly be a need for a review, it cannot be only a defence review or limited to our armed forces. Any review must combine the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with the Ministry of Defence in a way that has not happened before. Only then will we end up with a coherent and deliverable policy that does not repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="90326-0012.htm_para19"><a name="09032638000509">Most of the time, our defence and armed forces are not an end in themselves but the means to an end determined by our foreign policy. Defence is the handmaiden of foreign policy: it is one of the means&#151;although not the only one&#151;by which we sometimes have to implement or advance our foreign policy objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="90326-0012.htm_para20"><a name="09032638000510">Frederick the Great once remarked that diplomacy without arms is like music without instruments. Over the past 12 years, our armed forces have been used to a degree unprecedented since 1945. Under Mr. Blair, and the trend has continued under this Government, we have had a series of wars. Of course, wars did not begin in 1997, but what has been unprecedented is that most of the wars since then have not been wars of necessity. Instead, they have been wars of choice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="90326-0012.htm_para21"><a name="09032638000511">I do not want to go today into the question of whether the choices were right or wrong. That is a separate issue but, in the past, most of the wars that we found ourselves in were ones in which either we or our allies had been attacked. War therefore became necessary, because no other option was available. However, the wars in Kosovo and Iraq were wars of choice, and the same is true of what happened in Sierra Leone: even though that was a very small combat operation, it was still a war of choice on the Government&#146;s part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="90326-0012.htm_para22"><a name="09032638000512">I concede that the war in Afghanistan is more difficult to determine, because of 9/11 and the rest of the background. One could say that it was an intervention of necessity, but in every other respect the operations that have been putting such huge pressure on our armed forces were not imposed on the British Government. They were something no Government could have ignored; they were decisions, right or wrong, that the Government chose to take. If we are in that world, it is crucial that this essential review&#151;whether the Government are Labour, or indeed Conservative&#151;not just takes into account the foreign policy that the Government of the day want to pursue, but must actually be based on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="90326-0012.htm_para23"><a name="09032638000513">I have made no secret of my dislike of the policy of using our armed forces to intervene in other people&#146;s wars, but I want the United Kingdom to continue to have a global world role. We have much to contribute to the world and, for the most part, our contribution is highly beneficial, but the worst possible outcome would be for us to continue to have aspirations towards a global foreign policy while we refuse or are unable to provide the means to implement it, in particular its military component, whenever it may prove necessary. That would be the worst of all possible worlds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="90326-0012.htm_para24"><a name="09032638000514">I point out to my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis), perhaps more than to the Government&#151;they are at the end of their term and we are about to begin ours&#151;that implementing that role will be a crucial requirement. We know that the Government have been reluctant to deal with the comprehensive spending review, no doubt because they have problems not just with defence but with all sorts of areas of expenditure. However, with the exception of health and, I think, overseas development, there would be no ring-fencing of any budget by a future Conservative Government. In a way, I welcome that; it is right and proper that such matters are examined without preconditions and without too many pre-qualifications, but it is crucial that the next Conservative Government deal with the problem&#151;as much as the Labour Government have failed to&#151;in a way that does not continue the desperately serious overstretch of recent times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para0"><a name="09032638000515">In the second half of my remarks, which is linked to the first, I shall concentrate on our reserve forces. I declare an interest as I was for eight years the honorary colonel of a Territorial Army regiment. Hearing about the invitation to do that was as much of a surprise to me as it may be to other Members. Normally when someone ceases to be Secretary of State for Defence, the armed forces never wish to see them or hear of them again, regardless of personality or the colour of the Government concerned, so the invitation was unusual and a great privilege. One day I must table a parliamentary question to find out how many Secretaries of State for Defence in the Labour Government were so approached after their term of office. I suspect that the answer would cheer me up enormously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para1"><a name="09032638000516">The way in which the Territorial Army has been used over the past 12 years has been one of the most serious examples of problems in resources leading to policy decisions that have had, and continue to have, serious implications of a considerable kind. I remind the House that until the Reserve Forces Act 1996, the reserves had not been used since 1945. Such was the legal position throughout those years that there had either to be general mobilisation of the whole Territorial Army or no use of the reserves at all. For example, the Territorial Army was never used in the Gulf war or the Falklands war, because there was no legal basis that would have permitted that without mobilising the whole reserve force. That caused considerable frustration. Many individual reservists, having received splendid training, wanted to be able to use the skills they had been given.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para2"><a name="09032638000517">As Secretary of State, I initiated the policy changes that led to the 1996 Act and I am delighted that we introduced it. However, the Act has been used in ways far different from anything that was contemplated. Under the Act, it was contemplated that it would be possible to use individual units for a particular short-term operation, or to fill some immediate gap to deal with what nowadays we would call a &#147;surge requirement&#148; for a limited period, but that is not what has happened. There has, in fact, been a continuous use of the reserves in the wars and operations that have continued without interruption since the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. In the case of Afghanistan, our involvement looks like continuing for a number of years to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para3"><a name="09032638000518">We had better be clear about the implications of that. The Labour Government&#146;s general attitude towards the reservists has, I fear, been pretty shabby. One of the decisions that they took in the 1998 strategic defence review was to make a massive reduction in the size of the Territorial Army. It was 56,000-strong at that time; it has 36,000 people today. Over the past 12 years, we have entered the worst of all possible worlds; there has been unprecedented use of our reservists exactly when their numbers have been dramatically reduced to their lowest level for many generations, if not ever. It is that dysfunction and disharmony that is so indefensible, in my judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para4"><a name="09032638000519">Let me give the House figures relating to what has happened since 1997. Since 2003&#151;that is, since our involvement with Iraq, Afghanistan and so forth&#151;17,000 reservists have been mobilised. That represents 9 per cent. of those mobilised in Afghanistan, and 4 per cent. of those mobilised in Iraq. I draw attention to a particular  <br>

point: when we passed the 1996 Act, we did not envisage those sorts of numbers. We said that the use of an individual reservist should be such that his or her cumulative exposure should be a maximum of one year in three. That remains, I think, the legal position today. The Ministry of Defence handout, &#147;Future use of the UK&#146;s Reserve Forces&#148;, published on 7 February 2005, says, in referring to the massive mobilisation that the 1996 Act never envisaged:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para8"><a name="09032638000523">In other words, the Government make the concession, and make it meaningless, in the same sentence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para9"><a name="09032638000524">It is not sustainable to continue with that policy. I say that to the Government and, indeed, to my right hon. and hon. Friends, because I suspect that they will have responsibility for the matter in the not-too-distant future. We already know the consequences. Reservists have been voting with their feet. After the Iraq war, between 2003 and 2005, some 15,000 reservists quit, and they have not been replaced. I mentioned earlier that the size of the Territorial Army is 36,000. That is not its authorised strength; its authorised strength is 42,000. The reason it has only 36,000 people is that it has not been able to recruit the numbers required. People have not been willing or able to join in the numbers that the Government presumably think necessary. That should cause serious concern to the Government Front-Bench team.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para10"><a name="09032638000525">I make one final point in drawing to the end of my remarks. It may be said, &#147;Well, you know, it is not just reservists whom we have had problems recruiting; the regular forces have had similar difficulties.&#148; That is true, but there is a crucial distinction that I do not think has yet been mentioned. Over the past few years, we have gone through a period of very low unemployment. Historically, when unemployment is low, the regular forces have difficulty recruiting to the extent required. For very sad reasons, that will now change. Now that unemployment is becoming a serious problem, it is likely that the regular forces will not have anything like the same difficulty recruiting. Although that will benefit the regular forces, exactly the opposite argument will apply to the Territorial Army. Precisely because unemployment is increasing and getting very high indeed, employers will have not the slightest incentive, when they have such a vast number of people from whom they can recruit, to chose those who, for one year in three, or whatever the period will be, are required by the Government to fill the gaps that they are not prepared to fill through the regular Army.</p>

think that it is an absolute disgrace that the Government are within a week of implementing a new pay round, and none of our professional men and women in the services have any idea what pay they will be entitled to from Wednesday of next week? When he was Secretary of State for Defence, would he have allowed such a shambolic situation?</p>

 I would certainly have tried to prevent it, but whether the Treasury would have allowed me to do so is the question that must be addressed. I have not the slightest doubt that the Ministry of Defence could make the announcement today if it were permitted to do so. Another part of Government is creating the problem, and it is a disgrace. My hon. Friend is right to refer to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para11"><a name="09032638000528">The Minister was good enough to allow me to intervene on him to raise the review of the reserve forces. I welcome the fact that that review is taking a lot longer than originally intended&#151;I make no complaint about that. However, looking at the review&#146;s terms of reference, I am not convinced that those conducting it will be able to address the questions that I have raised today. I hope that they will do so&#151;I hope that when the review is published, it will refer to the gross overstretch and misuse of the reserve forces. It is not good enough for the Minister simply to say that individual reservists like going out on operations&#151;of course they do, I have not the slightest doubt about that, but it is not just about their personal interest. Their families and employers are also involved in the process, and the Government know perfectly well that the strains that have developed in recent years have made the current policy unsustainable.</p>

Secondly, if the Government&#151;whoever they are, Labour or Conservative&#151;wish, as I hope they will, to have a world view and a global foreign policy, it is no longer possible to resist the argument that the regular forces in particular have to have the manpower compatible with that aspiration. While the reservists can help and may be used for special occasions, such as surge requirements, and to fill particular gaps&#151;that is what they are there for; I do not have a problem with that&#151;the idea that they can be a permanent way of supplementing the regular forces and getting regular soldiers on the cheap should never have come into play. It must stop, and the quicker it does, the better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para14"><a name="09032638000532">I am afraid, Madam Deputy Speaker, that you may have a little difficulty keeping us in order, because the title of the debate is, at best, not very helpful and, at worst, utterly meaningless. It gives the impression of &#147;Dad&#146;s Army.&#148; While many of our forces are of course deployed abroad, there is also a plucky home guard ready to fight off the Russians if they turn the wrong way coming out of the northern approaches. As a title, &#147;Defence in the UK&#148; is complete rubbish. The Defence Committee is currently doing an inquiry into our relations with Russia. I shall confide to the House, hoping that it goes no further, that we do not consider ourselves under imminent threat of invasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para15"><a name="09032638000533">We can, of course, in this debate discuss home basing issues, and I intend to say a little about Project Belvedere. We can discuss some of the training issues, in so far as training takes place in the UK, and we have heard from the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (John Smith) about St. Athan, which was a surprise to all of us. But &#147;Defence in the UK&#148;? Modern defence is not a geographical thing. It rests on industry, which is global, on our alliances, which are global, on our interests, which are global, and above all on our people in the armed forces, to whom I pay a very great tribute, and there are now few of them who stay in the UK for very long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para16"><a name="09032638000534">Whatever we do has an effect elsewhere. What happens in Pakistan, whether it is an attack by an American drone based in Afghanistan on insurgents in South Waziristan, or the attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Pakistan, affects attitudes in the Pakistani community and in other communities in the UK, because the media are global too. Communication is now instant. To distinguish between the UK and Pakistan or Afghanistan is becoming increasingly pointless, since everything that happens there will instantly affect what happens here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para17"><a name="09032638000535">And that is what this country does not get. It is what this continent, Europe, does not get. They do not understand that leakage of nuclear weapons technology, as has already happened in Pakistan, thanks to A.Q. Khan, is just as likely to lead to a nuclear bomb going off in London as it is to one going off in Islamabad&#151;in fact, rather more so. The people of this country, of this continent, do not believe and do not understand that if we allow the region of Pakistan and Afghanistan to become even more unstable than it already is, it is not the Islamic countries that will be the targets of the new rulers of those countries. It will be us, here in the UK, so we cannot afford to fail there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para18"><a name="09032638000536">But for reasons that my right hon. and learned Friend has just set out so eloquently, it looks as though, in financial terms, we cannot even afford to try to succeed. We are devoting to that particular struggle one twentieth of the number of troops and one fiftieth of the amount of aid that we devoted to the much richer and more stable area of Bosnia. We are using up our kit five times faster than we can replace it. We are fighting a war with a peacetime mentality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para19"><a name="09032638000537">That is because nobody is effectively proclaiming in this country or this continent that defence is good, that we have the right to defend our values, and that we have the duty to do so.

There is a sense of treading water. Afghan operations must not mean that the Ministry of Defence or the armed forces will in  <br>

a few years be trapped in a time warp. There needs to be new thinking now, thinking ahead for future challenges, because they are not even future challenges&#151;they are challenges that we face now. It is just that we have not recognised how serious they are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para20"><a name="09032638000538">To give him his due, I believe that the Secretary of State for Defence believes in defence. I believe that of the whole defence ministerial team. However, the Ministry of Defence team alone does not have the capacity to deliver on the need to inspire and give the country the sort of warnings that Winston Churchill was giving in the 1930s. It needs the whole Government, including the Prime Minister, to pull in the same direction and they need to take the House, which is now nearly empty, with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para21"><a name="09032638000539">This may seem a cheap point, but it happens to be true. To most hon. Members, a defence debate means an opportunity not to discuss matters fundamental to the survival of this country and our values, but to go to their constituencies. Yes, their work there is important, but it is rarely a matter of life and death, as what we are discussing today is. The Government need to take the country with them, but the plain truth is that the absence of Russian hordes in the northern approaches has meant that defence has become something that we have taken for granted and that some people, such as those involved in the Campaign Against Arms Trade, are even uncomfortable with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para22"><a name="09032638000540">In the House, there used to be three individual service day debates and two days&#146; debate on the statement on the defence estimate. All that became meaningless as the services did more and more on a joint basis, and it rightly changed in the late 1990s and the early part of this century. However, now there are three debates on policy, procurement and personnel, and two more were added&#151;on defence in the world and defence in the UK&#151;to make up for the defence estimates debate, those last two being particularly unfortunately named. We need a return to two days&#146; debate at a set time each year&#151;perhaps when the MOD&#146;s annual report is issued, so that there can be a useful focus. We need five general days&#146; debate on defence, and perhaps more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para23"><a name="09032638000541">I said earlier that I would say a little about the basing decision involved in Project Belvedere. For some time, the Ministry of Defence has been considering whether to re-base the Chinook helicopters that are currently at RAF Odiham. In the last debate on defence personnel, I discussed the issue at some length. I shall not do so again today; suffice it to say that the Chinooks should stay where they are. However, I want to say one thing. The Minister said that he was trying to bring the issue to a conclusion as soon as possible and that no decision had yet been made. Today we are having a debate on defence in the UK, and today would be the correct time to announce that the Chinooks will stay where they are. We all know that there is no money and no appetite to move them. The only obstacle in the way of the announcement of the decision, and in the way of some welcome clarity and direction for those who have been abortively slaving away at this ghastly project for years, is chronic indecision. I ask the Minister to make the announcement&#151;just get it over with. He will feel a lot better for doing so, and so will we.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para24"><a name="09032638000542">Frankly, the design and implementation of the joint personnel administration system, or JPA, has been a disaster. Its failings were broadly responsible for the Comptroller and Auditor General&#146;s qualifying the Ministry of Defence&#146;s accounts. Neither the Ministry of Defence nor those, such as the Defence Committee, who scrutinise it, can see what is going on. Many personnel data are provisional, projected or uncertain and that has been the case for the past couple of years. In its quarterly reports, the Ministry of Defence cannot even properly report against some of its new departmental strategic objectives, because it does not have the necessary data.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para25"><a name="09032638000543">Those failings may sound technical, but they have caused profound unhappiness among service personnel. Today I heard about the case of an Army captain who was posted abroad and was not paid for three months. When he got back, he discovered that his credit rating had been severely damaged. The response was: &#147;It&#146;s your fault. You should have looked on the internet to see that things were working properly.&#148; Well, let us remind our soldiers to take their laptops with them to Musa Qala in future. We cannot treat our soldiers in this way.</p>

We need to treat those people properly&#151;in their housing, in relation to their families, in their medical care, in their pay and conditions, and in their life after they leave the armed forces. That is not just because we need them, although we truly do, and not just because they are courageous and effective, although they really are, but because it should and must be a matter of honour for us to recognise and appreciate that they sacrifice everything for their country and for our values. They give us our freedom, and we owe them more than we can express.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I want particularly to raise two issues that are of great concern to my constituency and have been raised with me by a considerable number of constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="90326-0013.htm_para27"><a name="09032638000546">The first issue, which has already been raised by several hon. Members, is Britain&#146;s possession of nuclear weapons, particularly the decision to renew and replace the current Trident nuclear weapons system. As the Minister will be aware, this has for many generations been higher up the political agenda in Scotland than in other parts of the United Kingdom. There has traditionally been a far higher level of opposition to nuclear weapons in Scotland, for a variety of reasons.</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090326/debtext/90326-0014.htm"/>



<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="90326-0014.htm_para0"><a name="09032638000547">From the 1950s, we have had ongoing campaigns against nuclear weapons, so the issue has been very visible in the public eye. Since the 1950s, we have seen considerable shifts to the left in public opinion. Parties of the left are far stronger in Scotland than in other parts of the UK, and social democratic ideas are much more central in the political establishment. There is also the fact that nuclear weapons systems&#151;Polaris, Poseidon and Trident&#151;have been physically based on the west coast of Scotland, which is our major population base. In constituencies such as mine, we do on occasion see the submarines travelling up and down the Clyde, so people feel that this is far closer to them. That cuts both  <br>

ways. A number of jobs are provided at the Faslane nuclear weapons base, but there is awareness of and concern about the situation and a debate about whether it is appropriate for Britain to possess nuclear weapons at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="90326-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09032638000548">I welcome some of the statements recently made by the Government, particularly by the Prime Minister, on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and their possession by countries throughout the world. Those statements are reinforced by what is being said by the newly elected Administration in the United States of America. As the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey) said, we are moving towards next year&#146;s non-proliferation treaty review conference. It is therefore appropriate that the British Government are trying to put this issue far higher up the political agenda, not only because of the new US Administration but because of the greater risks that we all face in the world as the years go by.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="90326-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09032638000549">The position taken by the Conservative Front-Bench spokesperson, the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox), suggests that his party sees no circumstances whatsoever in which Britain could move towards not having nuclear weapons. My fear for many years has been that many of the arguments made for Britain&#146;s possession of nuclear weapons could be used by any country in the world. The implication of those arguments is that any and every country in the world will possess nuclear weapons as time goes on, and that is a world that we should all fear. We need to put moves on restricting and removing weapons of mass destruction at the top of the international agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="90326-0014.htm_para3"><a name="09032638000550">Such points have been put to me repeatedly by my constituents, and increasingly in the last few months I been asked whether, given the current difficult economic circumstances, it is appropriate for Britain to be spending something in the region of &#163;76 billion on these weapons. The figure is indeterminate; we do not know exactly what it will cost to replace the current Trident nuclear weapons systems, but we know that historically such projects have tended to end up being more expensive than originally envisaged. Whatever the cost, it is likely to be huge, and given some of the other comments made in the debate about our armed personnel and the support that people receive not just through pay, but when they return home having been in the military&#151;particularly those suffering from physical or psychological injury&#151;we have to question whether that is the best use of the nation&#146;s resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="90326-0014.htm_para4"><a name="09032638000551">I place on the record my hope that the Government will look again at the issue of Trident renewal, and use opportunities available in the coming debates on the non-proliferation treaty to consider ways whereby Britain can move to a non-nuclear future, and perhaps more importantly, to use that as mechanism to ensure that we restrict as much as possible the possession of such weapons of mass destruction throughout the world. Any other position that Britain took would be hypocritical. If we say that it is good enough for us, it is difficult to say that it is not good enough for other nations. In our foreign policy in general, such hypocrisy has damaged us, particularly in the past few years in the lead-up to the Iraq war, and in the repercussions of that war and the war on terror. It would be a significant failing if we continued down that path.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="90326-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09032638000552">The other issue I want to talk about is the future of the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency, which affects my constituents and those of a number of other  <br>

hon. Members. The DSDA was formed three years ago after the Ministry of Defence won an in-house bid in competition with two private sector companies. Indeed, since its formation, another look has been taken at whether the service should be privatised or remain in house.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="90326-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09032638000553">There was great concern that in the pre-Budget review before Christmas the DSDA, along with a wide range of other public sector organisations, was named as an organisation that would be looked at again for efficiency savings, and to establish whether it is an appropriate part of the public sector to consider for outsourcing, privatisation or some other model. More than 250 privatisation programmes are running in the Ministry of Defence, and an operational efficiency programme is currently being looked at by the Treasury to determine whether the DSDA should be looked at again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="90326-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09032638000554">Approximately 350 people are employed in a military depot in my constituency by DSDA, and there is a great deal of concern about the proposals. I have written to the Secretary of State and asked him, along with Treasury officials, to meet the relevant staff trade unions to talk through the process. I have also asked them to meet not just myself but other interested MPs in whose constituencies affected depots are sited, on a cross-party basis. We understand that there might be some kind of announcement on the issue in the Budget, so I ask Ministers again whether such a meeting could be set up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="90326-0014.htm_para8"><a name="09032638000555">One frustration is that since the announcement, it has been difficult to get information about the process. This might be an early stage, and there might not be a huge amount of information to share, but there is concern that there might be an announcement in the Budget when staff have not had an opportunity to take part in the process. Will Ministers get back to us on that, either in the debate or in the next few days, and will they meet the relevant Members? There is a great deal of concern, given the Ministry of Defence&#146;s history on the issues of privatisation and job security. I therefore ask Ministers to reconsider the matter, and I would appreciate it if they would come back to us with some dates for a meeting.</p>

 It is a pleasure to speak in what has so far, quite rightly, been a wide-ranging debate. I begin by paying tribute to those who have given their lives in the service of this country since the last defence debate, and to their families, who are left to bear the burden for a very long time.</p>

mind is how Members of all parties think that that can be paid for. The current Government will not be holding the reins, because I do not believe that they will be returned to office at the next general election. That very difficult question will therefore have to be dealt with by the Conservative party, if, as I hope, we are on the other side of the House.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend believe that the problem that she has set out was significantly exacerbated by the announcement in December of, in essence, the postponement of all major defence procurement decisions until just after the next general election?</p>

 That is the point that I was seeking to make, and my right hon. Friend has made it much more succinctly. Of course, he is absolutely correct. Decisions are being made now, but the payment problem will not arise until after the next general election. That will exacerbate the situation by limiting the choices of an incoming Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="90326-0014.htm_para11"><a name="09032638000561">No one in this House or the UK doubts for one minute the bravery, determination and skill of our armed forces, but we as a nation have failed in our engagement in Iraq, and although heavily committed in Afghanistan, our forces are struggling from a lack of appropriate equipment, especially protected vehicles and air power. Iraq and Afghanistan are two wars for which the United Kingdom, and more specifically the Army, was totally unprepared in terms of both weaponry and training. On more than one occasion, I have welcomed new kit, which has proved most excellent, but we still lack sufficient numbers of protected vehicles, helicopters and airlift capacity. Both training and weaponry have been more suited to conventional warfare than to the sort of counter-insurgency operations to which our troops have more recently been committed. The United Kingdom is now too small, militarily speaking, to engage well in both conventional and counter-insurgency warfare. We have recently been most heavily involved in the latter, and given the present instability in various parts of the world, that is unlikely to change in the near future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="90326-0014.htm_para12"><a name="09032638000562">The future Army structure, for which the Army has been completely reorganised, is concentrated on a medium-weight capability based on airlift. With the life of the Hercules C-130K coming to an end in 2012 and the J-type not due in service until 2026, combined with the A400M programme looking extremely dubious, a hopeless mess is likely in a few years unless a decision is taken in the near future. Otherwise, some difficult decisions will have to be made by an incoming Government. It is highly likely that not one A400M will be delivered within the framework of the contract for the whole order of 25 aircraft. The Minister will not disclose in answer to my parliamentary questions what the penalty clauses are or who will pay the damages for late delivery. I should have thought that quite an important point.</p>

Navy Mk 1 costs a cool &#163;39 million, and their running costs are &#163;34,000 and &#163;42,000 per hour respectively. Yet the Merlin cannot fly in Afghanistan without, according to a parliamentary answer, a &#163;1.8 million upgrade to each aircraft to fit new blades&#151;presumably Carson blades&#151;because the aircraft cannot fly hot and high, which the Huey helicopter could do more than 40 years ago in the Vietnam era.</p>

It is time that Ministers came clean and admitted that the decision that there would, in effect, be no choice was made at the top.

I believe that it would merely kick the whole subject into the long grass once again. We know what the problems are today. Incoming Governments&#151;all Governments&#151;are there to make decisions, and to justify them in the light of circumstances and the money that is available at the time. As we all know, however, the United Kingdom has committed its forces to counter-insurgency warfare of the most difficult and treacherous kind, and that should at present be its first priority. Surely, therefore, the UK has a moral obligation to provide the very best and most appropriate equipment to protect the lives of our fighting men and women. If it cannot or is unwilling to do so, it should withdraw from those engagements and never again commit the lives of our armed services to similar situations.</p>

We used to excel, but to be successful in the future, as we undoubtedly were in the past, requires us to rededicate ourselves and provide the means to reinforce our will to win. We must make a decision soon about the type of future war to which we will commit our troops. In other words, we must decide in which direction we wish the Army and other services to go. Having made that decision, we must ensure that sufficient funding and equipment are available at the outset of any campaign. Finally, we must make the vital decision to remain an independent United Kingdom force, rather than become merely part of a European Union force, with all that that implies militarily and in relation to procurement. If we do not make those right decisions, the back of the British Army will be broken; and that is not a situation that I, for one, would find tolerable.</p>

Later in the day, I had the opportunity to talk to some of the soldiers and their families who had taken part in the parade.

In the west midlands, for example, the potential sites for those soldiers include MOD Stafford, Cosford and Shrewsbury. As will become clear a little later, the base in Stafford is not remote and is part of the town. One reason why soldiers have found the civilian population so welcoming is that soldiers and civilians live cheek by jowl in the town. Will the Minister say a little about the emerging thinking on venues in the west midlands for troops returning from Germany under Operation Borona and about the present thinking on Cosford, Shrewsbury and Stafford?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09032638000583">Let me say a little about Stafford and its welcome for the military. There are now Gurkhas among the soldiers of 22 Signal Regiment who are with us. It has been a delight to see how the people of Stafford have taken to their hearts Gurkha soldiers and their children, who are now in our schools&#151;some of them needing and receiving some support with English as an additional language&#151;and how warm and welcoming the people of Stafford have been to Gurkhas&#146; wives, who have joined us and want to work in our local community. Some of them have needed support with English as a second language, too, and it was a joy to me to hear the principal of Stafford college say that, whether or not he got funding, they were going to get that help for free at his college. That was a great contribution by that college to the warmth of the welcome to our armed forces and their families in Stafford. Many of the Gurkhas&#146; wives have now been helped into work in the local community by Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para2"><a name="09032638000584">The new forces have been integrated into Stafford very well. As Members would expect, however, there is a growing challenge in accommodation. The accommodation provided for service personnel on the base is full, and there is a question about how we provide more accommodation, especially if more troops are coming to Stafford. Accommodation off the base is also an issue. Some soldiers and their families will want to buy homes locally, and people who want to stay in the area after they retire from the Stafford base will also want homes in Stafford. Clearly, whatever else happens in terms of population growth in the west midlands, we are going to need more homes for soldiers and their families in the Stafford area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para3"><a name="09032638000585">Now is a crucial time in Stafford. We are at the point when the local authority, Stafford borough council, is consulting on its local development framework, which includes where to put more houses. As all Members know, whenever there is talk of putting more houses anywhere, existing communities have great concerns about where those houses might go. That is an important message for the planners of Stafford to remember, but so too is the fact that there will have to be more homes because of the growth of the base at Stafford. Defence Estates must engage now with the planners at Stafford borough council. I am pleased to say that the news that comes to me suggests that that is happening, but it is important that they keep at it.</p>

Later this year, we will have the first armed forces and veterans day. The month after that, there will be an open day at MOD Stafford. I am certain that the warmth we saw from the public towards our military in Stafford town centre on 28 February will be repeated on that day in June, and repeated again on that day in July, and long may that be so.</p>

The Argylls returned from Afghanistan with one young man killed and their commanding officer severely wounded, but despite that he is still commanding the regiment while recovering from an extremely bad gunshot wound. There were other wounded among the ranks of the Argylls and the soldiers of the 3rd Battalion TPWRR, who went to serve with them. Canterbury is extremely proud of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para5"><a name="09032638000588">Despite the title of this debate, it is inevitable that all speakers will be tempted to stray into operations outside the UK, but I wish to make a wider point. The shadow Secretary of State made the point that defence planning assumptions are never right, whoever is in charge; one can never gaze into a crystal ball. It is worth reflecting on what a large proportion of the operations we have been involved in over the past 100 years were wholly unexpected. Had we been sitting in a debate of this kind in 1914&#151;it is interesting to read the record of House of Commons debates at the time&#151;we would have found that all serious opinion, or very nearly all of it, was focused on the homeland. We would have been talking about defence in the UK, because the crisis in Ireland was so bad, with guns being run in huge numbers into the island by those on both sides of the argument. Those who talked about the possibility of a continental war were thought to be eccentric.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para6"><a name="09032638000589">In 1982, nobody expected the Falklands war the week before the Argentines attacked the islands; in 1990, we had ruled out, only three months before the first Gulf war, the possibility of deploying armoured vehicles outside the NATO area; and, of course, today&#146;s operations were wholly unexpected on 10 September 2001. I could give other examples, but the fact is that, with the one important exception of the second world war, nearly all the large-scale operations in which we have been involved were unexpected a relatively short period beforehand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para7"><a name="09032638000590">That is why I say that although I listen with huge respect to all those who are rightly saying that we owe it to our forces to do the best possible job in supporting them on existing operations, it would be a disaster if we ever designed our armed forces entirely around existing operations. In his excellent speech, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) touched on a paradox that we face. We seem to be increasingly widely committed and there are so many threats out there&#151;a number of colleagues have talked of threats outside this country, but there are some clear and distinct threats that particularly concern us today&#151;that whoever is in government will face a huge mismatch between the resources that realistically will be made available and the potential demands on them. I make no apology for saying that the reserve forces play an extremely important role in other English-speaking countries in squaring that imbalance, and they could play a bigger role here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para8"><a name="09032638000591">Although my right hon. and learned Friend gave a brilliant summary of the problems in the reserve forces, I disagreed with him on one area. For the moment, however, I wish to pay tribute to the Government and to the Minister for the Armed Forces in particular. This small-scale but thoroughly worth while review, which was largely his brainchild and&#151;perhaps I know more than I should do&#151;was pushed through despite considerable opposition within substantial elements of the Ministry  <br>

of Defence, both uniformed and civilian, has shed some light on opportunities missed and on things that need tackling. I very much look forward to seeing it come before the House, and I welcome the comment that there would be an oral statement and that, courteously, the team would be brought to meet the all-party group so that we can have a full discussion on the detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para9"><a name="09032638000592">I think that General Nick Cottam did an extremely good job, although I pulled his leg quite publicly on disappearing to St. Paul&#146;s just before the job was finished, in engaging with the reserve forces. He and his team got round and talked turkey with people making huge sacrifices on what was, after all, a secondary activity for them. None the less, that activity resulted in almost exactly one in every 1,000 on operations being killed in action, and we would do well to remember that; I believe that the tally is 17 at the moment&#151;16 Terroritorials and one air reservist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para10"><a name="09032638000593">I will not repeat the statistics showing the large role that the reserve forces, despite their proportionately small size, have played in Iraq and Afghanistan, and earlier in the Balkans. Instead, I wish to focus on how an imaginative, forward-looking Government could make more use of reserve forces to square the resource circle. Reserve forces cannot solve the problem entirely, but they can contribute to the solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para11"><a name="09032638000594">Compared with the other major models for all-volunteer forces&#151;the US, Australia and Canada, but not France, where that model is new&#151;we have a much smaller proportion of reserve forces. Broadly speaking, half the land forces in those countries are reservist&#151;the figure is just over in the US, and just under for the other two&#151;and their air and naval reserves are very large, whereas ours are very small as a proportion of the total.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para12"><a name="09032638000595">I have four examples to give. First, 2 Signals Brigade exists to provide communications in the event of a nuclear strike or a major disruption, such as after a large-scale terrorist action. The brigade is not used for operations and sends relatively few people to operational theatres because it has a niche capability that we do not need for current operations. Hon. Members should consider how much less expensive 2 Signals Brigade is than keeping that capability within the regular forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para13"><a name="09032638000596">Secondly, why&#151;at a time when there is so little money and so much more that needs doing&#151;do we retain air defence regiments in the regular Army? I know people will say that they can be used in a different role in operational theatres, but they have a niche capability and, while we should retain it within the British armed forces, the likelihood that it will need to be used in the near future is very low. In fact, I suggest that the possibility of a major terrorist strike that disrupts our communications is more likely than the need to fight an enemy with a superior air force in the near future. Have we thought about how we could release funds for other desperately needed priorities if that role were given to the reserve forces?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para14"><a name="09032638000597">My third example is mine clearing. Traditionally, that was performed mainly by the Royal Naval Reserve, although of course some capability is needed in the regular Navy. It is an odd function, because most of the time, even on operations, it is not needed, but when it is needed we need a lot of it in a hurry. The two most obvious areas for our focus would be if the situation in the Gulf took an unexpected turn such as in a confrontation with Iran. I know from having worked in that region  <br>

that there is an enormous area of very shallow water, where mine warfare could easily be conducted. The second is the waters around the UK, which is the subject of today&#146;s debate. Many of our ports have long, shallow approaches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para15"><a name="09032638000598">How is our mine warfare capability currently organised? Almost all of it is within the regular Royal Navy. Therefore, I would argue, we have the worst of all worlds. We have expensive mine-clearing vessels, which carry people with very important skills, many of which are widely available in the civilian world, including deep-sea diving, survey work and so on. Each vessel has one, very expensive regular crew. If some vessels instead had two or three reservist crews, they would be much cheaper&#151;a reservist crew is roughly a fifth of the cost of a regular crew&#151;and, crucially, we would have a surge capability. God knows, mines are easy to lay these days, and if there was a mining threat and we had to try to clear all our major ports at once&#151;if a couple of mines had gone off, we would not know where the others were&#151;we would be able to work the vessels round the clock, which cannot be done with a single crew, especially as some of the skills involved, such as diving, are very tiring. An individual can dive for only a few hours a day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para16"><a name="09032638000599">My fourth example concerns unmanned aerial vehicles. I have not had time to pursue this subject matter through parliamentary questions, but somewhere there is a bit of a story about cost overruns, with which I suspect the Minister is familiar. Very small numbers of UAVs play a significant role in Afghanistan. They are very expensive and, I am told, the exercise is turning into rather an expensive one to man. I suggest that that is an area where reservists would be ideal&#151;the skills involved in operating a UAV are widely available outside: hand-eye co-ordination, understanding of IT systems and a range of other skills in which it would not be difficult to train reservists. There must also be opportunities, particularly if we need a surge capability, to think about how we can transfer that role, at least in part, to the reserve forces, as we proposed in our all-party group report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para17"><a name="09032638000600">I have given four specific examples; let me now give a general one. To my mind, it is quite astonishing that our air reserves are so tiny. The Americans have a third of all their fast jet fighter formed units and getting on for half of all their pilots in their volunteer reserve&#151;that is, the air national guard and the US air reserve. In the Air Force, we have a total of 28 reserve pilots, nearly all of whom are Hercules pilots. That is all. A phenomenal investment goes into training a pilot, even before we think about fast jet pilots and if we consider only helicopter training. The cheque is torn up, in Britain, as soon as the man leaves the service. The Australians and, in particular, the Canadians have made slightly more use than we have of their flying reserves and the Americans have made vastly more use of them. There must be more scope for this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para18"><a name="09032638000601">The Territorial Army has a highly successful small helicopter regiment that will be disbanded in a few months&#146; time, which seems extraordinary to me. The Navy has a very well developed air reserve, with more pilots than the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. Few people from the air reserve have been deployed in operations, although one or two have, but its members have played a significant role in substituting for regulars and saving a lot of money in the training pipeline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para19"><a name="09032638000602">Unbelievably, the Royal Naval Reserve officer who commands the air reserve, which has been consistently up to strength, has been downgraded by one rank. His regular staff officer is being taken away, and the next stage&#151;which will mean that he will be unable to do his job&#151;will be his replacement by a regular officer. The Royal Navy has, shamefully, already decided to replace the commander of the Maritime Reserves with a full-time regular officer who had never done a civilian job. It is no criticism of the individual concerned to say that that will not provide leadership to people who are giving up their free time or provide understanding to his regular brother officers in the RNR about what royal naval reservists can do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para20"><a name="09032638000603">The situation in the volunteer reserves at the moment is, in many areas, fairly dire. I agree with most of what my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) said. In a recent presentation to the all-party group, Air Vice-Marshal Paul Luker, who is an ex-regular and the chief executive of the Council of Reserve Forces and Cadets Associations, commented on an establishment of 42,000, although he said that the true figure is probably not much over 30,000. He said that officer recruitment was generally poor and that it was proving difficult to maintain the officer corps, which is at the absolute heart of a successful service. He also said that he was concerned that some aspects of recruiting were so focused on the next operational tour that it was losing sight of building the unit and nurturing the cadre of officers and NCOs needed to maintain its ethos and cohesion. He said that that was particularly true of the Royal Marine Reserve and the Auxiliary Air Force squadrons, which had been used even more heavily than the Territorial Army. I welcome the review, which I think will provide some modest steps in the right direction. We are all anxiously waiting for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para21"><a name="09032638000604">I turn now to the One Army Recruiting process and its two single-service counterparts. Paul Luker said that the process was not really delivering. In the old days, the reserve forces and cadets associations ran recruiting, and he did not make a bid for that to be restored, but I firmly believe that, although centralised recruiting can lead to significant economies of scale in such matters as the purchasing of television time and so on, the remaining local element of recruiting should be given back to the RFCAs. They have the people&#151;on their council, or in the media and local communities&#151;who have the feel for local areas that regional brigades do not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para22"><a name="09032638000605">The local regional brigade commander in my constituency is excellent. Indeed, he is one of the best people to have held that post in all the time I have been the MP, but the occupant of that role is changed every two years. The result is that no one, however good he is, can have quite the same relationship with the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para23"><a name="09032638000606">We need to address the issue of officer training, some of which can be done very cheaply and easily. In the Officer Training Corps, the University Royal Naval Units and the University Air Squadrons, we have a substantial resource that we do not tap sufficiently. Very little effort is made in the central planning undertaken by the Army and the other two services to make use of them for the volunteer reserve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para24"><a name="09032638000607">I was very proud to see my son, a medical student at King&#146;s, pass out of the first phase of the London OTC. It was a family occasion, because the commanding officer was his first cousin once removed&#151;that is, my wife&#146;s first cousin. However, it is a measure of how much the Army has lost its way in respect of the OTC that my son has been told that choosing to sign up for a cadetship would mean that he would be required to leave the that splendid organisation. The reason is that he might be subject to an operational deployment, which would cost him a year in his planning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para25"><a name="09032638000608">The solution, as we said in our report, would be for the senior Army medical staff to get off their butts&#151;if the House will forgive the expression&#151;and sort the problem out with the royal colleges. That would be better than the present situation, which is that they just say, &#147;Well, people serving in TA medical units can suffer from that, but we are not having our regular Army people, including cadets, suffer in that way.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para26"><a name="09032638000609">I want to focus on the OTCs for a moment longer and try to explain what I mean. Coming through a typical OTC are large numbers of very keen young men and women, a few of whom will join the regular Army and some of whom might make good Territorials. However, whereas the arrangements in a university regiment in Australia or in a reserve officer training corps unit in America are closely tied into the training cycle&#151;for the Army Reserve in Australia or the National Guard in America&#151;that is not the case here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para27"><a name="09032638000610">For example, a person who has served with the OTC, completed a commissioning course from Sandhurst and wants to do a special-to-arm course cannot schedule it to fit into the same university vacation. Such a person cannot therefore get right through the system while at university, but the Americans and Australians have recognised that students are short of money but rich in time&#151;exactly the opposite of what they will experience afterwards. With proper organisation, we could have an officer corps whose members were very well trained when they reached the end of their time at university.</p>

 I apologise to my hon. Friend for not being here earlier, but I saw his name on the monitor and came in. I joined the Territorial Army when I was at university, for the adventure and experience that it would give me and because it meant that I could work on Sundays as well as Saturdays at a time when I needed the money. Had I had the opportunity to do much more training, I would have taken it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para28"><a name="09032638000613">I have talked about recruitment. I end with what is at the heart of the problem of retention of officers and senior and junior NCOs in the Territorial Army. As a result of the reserves review, the word &#147;offer&#148; has come into the vocabulary. If we want people to give up their time and to face serious penalties in their civilian career, what are we offering? The answer has to be: worthwhile and interesting commands, opportunities to train with those commands, whether it is a corporal commanding a section or a major commanding a squadron or company and, in extremis, the opportunity to take those commands on active service on an operational tour. That is why the National Guard almost always deploys formed units.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para29"><a name="09032638000614">There is terrific tension in the MOD between people who recognise that and those who see the TA simply as a feeder to pad out regular units. The Royal Marine Reserve, which has had some outstanding people, including Corporal Matt Croucher, who received the George cross, has chosen to go entirely down the latter route. That is why the RFCA identified the RMR as having serious trouble in retaining officer and NCO structures&#151;its fabric is under threat. Ironically, some other units that one might think comparable, such as 21 and 23 SAS&#151;I was privileged to serve with 21 SAS some years ago&#151;and 131 Commando squadron, the sapper unit that supports the Royal Marines, have all gone down the route of sending formed sub-units commanded by volunteer reserve officers, and they have all done exceptionally well. One of 131 Squadron&#146;s more ambitious operations in the Gulf got on to the front page of <i> The Times. </i>I cannot give more detail but the special forces regiments have taken decorations, as the Minister knows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="90326-0015.htm_para30"><a name="09032638000615">The future for the reserve forces lies in formed sub-unit deployments, although they can also provide limited padding for regular units. That brings me to my last point, which is the only one where I disagree with my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea. He said that the reserve forces provided only surge capability, but that they were very good at it. I would go a little further. The reserve forces are willing to go on being used in continuing operations if they are used in the right way&#151;provided they have the resources and, crucially, provided they have the support in the local community that is present in America but is, I fear, pretty indifferent in Britain. Reserve forces are there to support the regular forces, but to do that job they need resources, training, an officer corps and the support of the country. I look forward to the Government&#146;s reserves review.</p>

 It is a particular pleasure to follow my hon.

It was also a pleasure to listen to the hon.

When I was a child growing up in Salisbury in the 1950s, a substantial proportion&#151;perhaps 20 per cent.&#151;of the people on the streets, particularly at weekends, would have been in uniform. In a garrison town, surrounded by garrison towns on Salisbury plain, I recognised the importance of the military and may even have taken it for granted. Now, Her Majesty&#146;s forces have as much popularity, status and respect as at any time since the 1950s, when of course they were regarded as the saviours of our country, which indeed they were. Now, they again enjoy great status.</p>

earlier in March, one finds that the Royal Navy is held in the highest regard there. Its visits, such as the visit of HMS Illustrious to Tallinn later this year, are anticipated enormously by the whole population, not least because the Royal Navy helped the Estonians in their independence war in 1919. The Royal Navy should have more status. People do not recognise the purple role that it plays now, or how prominent it is in running our operation in Afghanistan. It may have fewer ships than it did but, my goodness, it is proving its expertise, not just at sea but in military theatres generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="90326-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09032638000619">I want to mention rehabilitation for Her Majesty&#146;s forces at places such as Headley court near Leatherhead. The need for a special swimming pool there led to the remarkable establishment of Help for Heroes by my constituents, Bryn and Emma Parry. It has caught the imagination of the nation. It started with a swimming pool and it has grown and grown. The attention that we are at last beginning to give to stress disorders and mental disorders among serving and former members of Her Majesty&#146;s forces has led to new support for Combat Stress, for example. The Army Benevolent Fund has never been busier, along with the Army Families Federation and its sister organisations for the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force.</p>

Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) will know a great deal about that&#151;is reflected throughout the country in the welcome home parades for soldiers returning from active service held in many of our towns and cities. Only last week&#151;indeed, the process finished this week&#151;we reformed legislation governing the way in which Her Majesty&#146;s coroners carry out their duties with regard to military inquests. We can at last say that we are doing the decent thing by military families.</p>

Flags will fly throughout the country for the whole of that week, and we will show our appreciation. Yet when the pollsters and focus groups report their figures, that support is not translated into political priorities, so political parties do not respond by giving defence a higher spending priority. For example, the Ipsos MORI poll of October 2008&#151;the latest one that I have been able to find&#151;found that over four fifths, or 81 per cent., of British adults say that they are favourable towards UK armed forces. That is the highest figure that MORI has recorded since that tracking study began in 2003. Only a tiny minority&#151;3 per cent.&#151;are unfavourable. Some 52 per cent. support the UK armed forces&#146; presence in Afghanistan, while just over a third&#151;35 per cent.&#151;oppose it. Some 43 per cent. support the UK armed forces&#146; presence in Iraq, and 45 per cent. do not. Levels of support for both those operations are higher than they were last year.</p>

There is much greater casualty sensitivity in the west than there was. There has been a growing polarisation of religious belief across the world. There is growing concern for universal human rights across the world, and prosperity has emerged as the overriding socio-political value when considering defence, rather than territorial gain, or Russian tanks rolling across the north European plain.</p>

More than 90 per cent. of our imports come in by sea, and those trade routes and vessels must be secure against foreign state intervention, as well as terrorism and piracy. That is why our forces must have global reach, and that is why they need aircraft carriers. They must have power projection by land, sea and air, and that must include amphibious capability and unmanned maritime systems, increasing use of unmanned combat air systems and space-based remote sensors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="90326-0016.htm_para18"><a name="09032638000639">The story of Chemring Countermeasures goes back a very long time and is typical of defence procurement companies all over the country. It started back in 1941 with Chemring developing processes for metallising fabrics, which sounds an unlikely link, but it went back longer than that. In 1933 the Wessex Aircraft Engineering Company was set up. It was taken over by Bryant and May. Eventually that became Schermuly, which in turn became the British Match Corporation, incorporated with Wilkinson Sword. It is an extraordinary story of the interlinking of defence industries within the manufacturing base of our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90326-0016.htm_para19"><a name="09032638000640">Eventually the business all came together in 1997 as Chemring Ltd. On this important day for that company in my constituency, I pay tribute to the company and to the work force that has made it so important as part of the everyday life of our servicemen and women at the sharp end, not just on land, but in the air and at sea, because that remarkable company provides countermeasures and flares for all three services, and sells substantially into our NATO allies as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="90326-0016.htm_para20"><a name="09032638000641">I finish by making another point about defence spending in this country. Sometimes senior figures in the shadow Cabinet groan when they see me coming because they know that I will say we should double defence spending. I know that that wish is unlikely to come to fruition in current economic circumstances. We all have to be hard-nosed about that, but we should seriously consider why we have the lowest defence spending as a proportion of our gross national product since the 1930s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="90326-0016.htm_para21"><a name="09032638000642">It would have an electrifying effect on the country&#146;s economy and much else for which this nation stands if we were to rebuild confidence in our nationhood, as well as in our defence industries and the armed forces, by increasing substantially the defence budget. This, I believe, would not be resisted by the electorate because of the paradox with which I started. We know that Her Majesty&#146;s forces have never been held in higher regard except during the second world war and the years immediately afterwards. Why can we not match that former regard, and remind people that their quality of life, standard of living and ability to buy white goods in the sheds on the edges of our towns and cities depend on the defence budget and the dedication of all three forces? We should start arguing from that point of view. Defence is very much in our national interest in respect of consumer spending, energy, water supply and climate change, because it changes all our economic and political perceptions. If we harness that fund of support for Her Majesty&#146;s forces, we will do the nation a service, and&#151;above all&#151;say to those forces, &#147;Well done and thank you.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="90326-0016.htm_para22"><a name="09032638000644">The Minister probably struck the right focus in explaining the title as a reference to a consideration of the relationship between the armed forces and the people of this country. As my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Robert Key) has just said, according to the opinion polls, our electorates focus on the economy, health and education. In our debates, we therefore have a responsibility to rehearse the issues and emphasise the importance of the defence and security of this country. My remarks will focus particularly on our alliances, which are essential for the projection of our foreign policy. We should consider our alliance with the United States and the relationship between Europe and the United States; that may change and develop under the new US Administration. I particularly want to focus on the relationship between the EU and NATO.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="90326-0016.htm_para23"><a name="09032638000645">In a week or so, we will celebrate 60 years of NATO, and this month we also celebrate NATO&#146;s major expansion of 10 years ago, when the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and the Baltic states joined the organisation. It is important to reflect on that. I want to mention the European security and defence policy, or ESDP, because its most ardent supporters and fiercest critics possibly misunderstand it. It is not collective European defence, or &#147;d&#233;fense Europe&#148; as the French would call it, and it never could be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="90326-0016.htm_para24"><a name="09032638000646">Sixty-one years ago, on 17 March 1948, the Brussels treaty was signed, laying the foundations for a European defence process. The treaty was modified in 1954 and the Western European Union came into being. The key provision of that modified Brussels treaty is its collective defence clause. In parallel, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the other collective security organisation, was also coming into being; it was established on 4 April 1949. It, too, makes provision for a collective response to an attack on individual members. However, in contrast to the modified Brussels treaty, it involves our transatlantic partners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="90326-0016.htm_para25"><a name="09032638000647">Over the past 60 years, the collective defence clause in article 5 of the NATO treaty has been invoked only once&#151;following the 11 September terrorist attacks in the United States&#151; and it can be argued with some justification that the fact that it was invoked only once was a result of the west&#146;s successful deterrence policy over the cold war period. The main focus of development in recent years, in Europe and in NATO, has been crisis management activities. As we approach the 60th anniversary of the alliance, the question we should ask ourselves is: &#147;Where is all this leading?&#148; Will NATO and the European Union, through its ESDP, be able to meet the challenges of the 21st century?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="90326-0016.htm_para26"><a name="09032638000648">After the end of the cold war, the organisation of security and defence in Europe started to evolve, with NATO and the EU both embarking on an enlargement process. Since the NATO alliance was created in 1949, its membership has grown through five rounds of enlargement from 12 founding members to today&#146;s 26 members, and NATO&#146;s door remains open to any European country in a position to subscribe to the commitments and obligations of membership and to  <br>

contribute to security in the Euro-Atlantic area. In parallel, the European Community, subsequently the European Union, has grown from six founding member states in 1951 to today&#146;s 27 EU member states, following six rounds of enlargement, and is also open to other European countries willing and able to join.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="90326-0016.htm_para27"><a name="09032638000649">Let us look at the added value in the defence and security arena of NATO and the European Union&#146;s ESDP. What is the added value of NATO? Its strong, integrated chain of command gives it the ability to conduct difficult combat missions. This multinational military structure is unique in the world. Neither the United Nations nor the EU has anything on such a scale. In contrast, the trademark of the ESDP is the EU&#146;s ability to deploy a wide range of instruments for monitoring, policing, peacekeeping and rule-of-law missions, including relatively high-risk military operations such as the one in Chad, which concluded a couple of weeks ago, and the anti-piracy mission off the coast of Somalia. The EU can also apply economic, political and diplomatic pressure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="90326-0016.htm_para28"><a name="09032638000650">Like many other members of the European Security and Defence Assembly&#151;formerly the Assembly of the Western European Union&#151;I have worked hard over the years to ensure that the ESDP has developed in such a way as to complement NATO rather than compete with it. That makes sense in practical as well as political terms given that 21 EU countries are also members of NATO, and their troops can be used for EU-led or NATO operations, depending on requirements. The WEU, which in the past played a major role in establishing Europe&#146;s defence capability, drew up the Petersberg tasks in 1992. They covered a wide spectrum of activities, including humanitarian rescue, peacekeeping and crisis management missions, and were incorporated into the common foreign and security policy under the 1997 treaty of Amsterdam. In parallel, at the 1996 NATO summit in Berlin, the idea of creating a European security and defence identity in NATO emerged. A key development since then has been the Berlin-plus arrangements, which gave first the WEU and later the EU the possibility of drawing on NATO assets for military missions sponsored by them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="90326-0016.htm_para29"><a name="09032638000651">All this is good, and much progress has been made, but perhaps the time has come for our Governments to agree to go a little further than the Berlin-plus arrangements and overcome the current political obstacles that are preventing NATO-ESDP co-operation from moving on to the next phase, which is so crucial if we are to meet all our global obligations and enhance the security of our peoples. The announcement by President Sarkozy of full French reintegration into NATO is an important step. It should also be taken as a sign that France recognises that defence in Europe is not a choice between the EU and NATO but complementary. As I said, the ESDP is not &#147;d&#233;fense Europe&#148; or collective European defence. Nothing in the EU meets the provisions of article 5&#151;not even the Lisbon treaty, if it is finally ratified. It does not, and cannot, provide the kind of collective defence commitment that membership of NATO implies.</p>

Turkey and Iceland. A strong commitment by the European NATO members is wanted and needed by the alliance&#151;a commitment not just to deployment but to spending and capacity building&#151;and that would be welcomed by the United States. EU-NATO relations need reviewing, and such a review would be useful on the strategic and institutional level as well as on the operational one. Both organisations run operations in a number of places: in Kosovo in the western Balkans, in Afghanistan and in Africa. But can we honestly say that they are deployed &#147;together&#148;? Is it not the case that they are being deployed alongside each other? Perhaps I might give a few examples that illustrate why the relationship between the EU and NATO is far from perfect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para1"><a name="09032638000653">An EU naval force is currently involved in the anti-piracy Operation Atalanta, off the coast of Somalia Together with a number of colleagues, I recently visited the headquarters of that naval anti-piracy operation at Northwood. Securing our trade routes is important to all of us; 90 per cent. of global trade is carried out with merchant ships. The sea off the coast of Somalia has been the scene of an alarming number of pirate attacks recently, with the result that some merchant lines have changed their routes. Those attacks have reduced considerably since the launch of the Atalanta mission, which obviously has a deterrent effect on potential pirates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para2"><a name="09032638000654">Operation Atalanta is run by the EU in the framework of the ESDP. The 10 or so participating nations are all members of NATO. Norway, another NATO member, has just announced that it will contribute a vessel to the operation, and others may join soon. Five nations&#151;France, Germany, Greece, Spain and the United Kingdom&#151;are responsible for ensuring a permanent operational capability. However, these nations are not using NATO communications and intelligence systems. Instead, some ships have had to install a new, civilian system for satellite communications. I am told that when the navies of NATO member states go on joint exercises, they are normally quite happy to use the NATO communication system. We must look into why a special arrangement was necessary in this case. Why does Berlin-plus not extend to such operations?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para3"><a name="09032638000655">Another example is at the political level, in joint meetings of EU and NATO ambassadors. This example concerns the regular meetings that are held between the EU Political and Security Committee and the North Atlantic Council, which bring together the permanent ambassadors of both organisations&#146; member states in Brussels. There was one such meeting on Monday of this week. The 21 EU member states that are also members of NATO are represented twice&#151;by their NATO ambassador and by their PSC representative. Both are usually supported by different administrative structures and both may receive instructions from different hierarchical levels in their respective capitals. These parallel structures do not necessarily share a common culture. Moreover, the NATO ambassador is generally the more senior and higher-ranking of the two, which means that in practice only one of them speaks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para4"><a name="09032638000656">These joint meetings are described by those attending them as sometimes rather sterile. They leave participants with a certain degree of frustration because of the particularities of the EU-NATO relationship, which is based on the so-called Berlin-plus agreements. The agreements consist of a number of unpublished documents  <br>

that have never been subject to parliamentary scrutiny or ratification. The limits of Berlin-plus in practice confine EU-NATO dialogue to the Berlin-plus Operation Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina and a joint EU-NATO working group on capabilities, and prevent NATO and the EU from jointly discussing pressing issues such as terrorism, Afghanistan or the middle east. The underlying problem is the unresolved dispute between Turkey and Cyprus. Turkey is a substantial contributor to ESDP missions and has vital interests in connection with its ongoing candidacy for EU accession. However, as soon as the suggestion arises of discussing issues that are not part of the limited agenda of the current military co-operation between the EU and NATO under Berlin-plus, Cyprus is not allowed around the table because it is not part of the partnership for peace programme and does not have security clearance for access to NATO classified documents. Conversely, the EU refuses to deal with anything other than Berlin-plus matters unless all 27 member states are present.</p>

 Will my hon. Friend share his perspective on the problem that Macedonia&#146;s name holds for the Greeks, who hold the right to block any progress for that new democracy because of the disputed name?</p>

<p><a name="st_o305"><a name="09032638000658"><a name="90326-0017.htm_spnew1"><a name="09032638001171"><b>Mr. Walter:</b>
 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention and share his frustration about the Greek veto over Macedonia&#146;s participation in NATO. If we can, we ought to knock some heads together. I remember being in Skopje not long ago with a former Greek Defence Minister, who as we walked into the meeting said that he could not give a stuff what they called their country, but as soon as we were in the meeting steadfastly defended the Greek line on the name. We have to move on, because such ridiculous problems&#151;although the Turkey-Cyprus problem is not ridiculous to a Cypriot&#151;are blocking the co-operation that is essential if we are to move forward. I understand where the political rationale for Turkey vis- -vis the EU lies, but we all need to look at the bigger picture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para5"><a name="09032638000659">The bigger picture is where my third and last illustration of the current difficulties in EU-NATO relations comes from. It is Afghanistan, where the EU is not a very big player. However, there is a police mission run within the ESDP framework, and both the European Commission and EU member states spend large amounts of money in that country. EUPOL Afghanistan, the EU police mission, is suffering from the difficulties that participating EU member states have in finding police officers who are willing to work in such a challenging environment. The security of the police is obviously crucial to the success of the operation. However, due to the difficulties that I have just mentioned, the EU is not able to obtain a global security arrangement with NATO in Afghanistan, so it was necessary to negotiate individual security provisions with every provincial reconstruction team on the ground. What is more, intelligence sharing is made more complicated by the absence of a relevant EU-NATO agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para6"><a name="09032638000660">Those examples show clearly that we need to find a way to improve the relationship between the two organisations. Beyond those examples, which could be regarded as anecdotes, there are deeper reasons for the current difficulties. First, I believe that, for a long time, the United States Government and many in this country have looked at the EU and the development of ESDP  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="26 Mar 2009">

with a certain degree of suspicion. There has been a fear of duplication and the feeling that emancipation could lead to separation. None of that is true. ESDP is a process of consolidating, improving and extending member states&#146; capabilities. It has created a new potential actor, ready to stand in when NATO cannot or does not want to get involved. Now is the time to draw the two actors and their member states closer together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para7"><a name="09032638000661">There is, of course, an opposite view. Some believe that closer relations between the EU and NATO would result in too much influence for the USA. I hope that if such fears have ever been justified, they are less urgent with the election of the new President. The announcement made by President Sarkozy that he will take France back into NATO&#146;s integrated military structure is a clear signal of new thinking on that issue. There is a new window of opportunity. The new Administration in Washington are interested in good relations with Europeans and recognise the added value of effective multilateral institutions. That should not only help to improve relations between the EU and NATO, but provide us with a vision to help shape the role of both organisations in our security in the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para8"><a name="09032638000662">I shall take as an example the situation of countries to the east of the EU and NATO border. NATO enlargement might not always be the best answer to their concerns and ours, but if it is not the right thing for those countries, what else can we propose, and what can the EU in particular offer them? Could the nascent EU eastern partnership initiative be developed into a transatlantic one?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para9"><a name="09032638000663">It is probably too early for President Obama and his new team to come up with any far-reaching proposals in early April at the NATO anniversary summit or at the EU-US summit the following day. But the different tone and style of the new American President could lay the basis of a positive review. One year from now, there could be a real breakthrough. We need the EU-NATO relationship to be clarified sooner rather than later, not least because we need our own minds made up before we face others who challenge the existing security architecture. I refer to the Russian President, Mr. Medvedev, his recent remarks about the weakness of the European security system and his proposal for a new European security treaty. In that regard at least, we know what we do not want&#151;the unravelling of the Helsinki principles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para10"><a name="09032638000664">I conclude with two thoughts. First, we need to review not only the EU-NATO relationship but the EU-US relationship, and focus those relations more on security issues. We in Europe need to ask ourselves: do we want to be an attractive partner to the United States both inside and outside NATO? Do we want to contribute to the resolution of the huge challenges ahead of us? The Spanish Government, who take over the EU presidency in 2010, are considering the issue with a view to relaunching an EU-US initiative. In Madrid, in 1995, they launched a new transatlantic agenda, and this would be a new, new transatlantic agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para11"><a name="09032638000665">Given the limited capabilities and our scarce financial resources, which will not only not grow but come under immense pressure once the current financial crisis has had its full impact on our real economy, we need to be innovative and imaginative in finding ways of co-operation and co-ordination. We need to be able to make the best use of the capabilities of both organisations and their   <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09032638000666">Secondly, as I said at the start, electorates tend to put schools, hospitals and health care before spending on helicopters, guns and missiles. However, we need to realise that we live in dangerous times and a harsh world, and if we want to make a difference and guarantee the security of our citizens, such investment is inevitable. We must also explain to our people that military operations, such as the one in Afghanistan, are not about remote conflicts, but directly concern security at home.</p>

It is important to ensure a real democratic debate on transatlantic and European security challenges, and to promote bold ideas to enable NATO and the EU to meet those challenges.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter), whose expertise on matters European is second to none.

Through my own ignorance, I never quite discovered what either organisation was for, what their purpose was, or whether they have one&#151;to this day, no one has explained what it is.

My view is that the European Union is a first-class trading organisation among independent nation states, and the notion that it could have anything called ESDP is nonsensical. Why on earth the EU is busily engaging in a very good operation in Somalia defeats me. What on earth it is doing there I cannot imagine. Nor do I know why it is doing policing in Kabul. Those things can be done either by NATO or independent nation states, and I fear that I have a deep cynicism about whether European co-operation of the kind that my hon.

I readily say, however, that that is simply because of my bog-standard little Englander ignorance, and I am sure that I can be educated in such matters as time goes on.</p>

None the less, I feel that the present structure of our defence debates is rather false, and does not quite work.

There are others who would say that although we could always do with more, we have enough to manage with. That, broadly speaking, is the Government&#146;s line. I think everyone would agree, however, that the way in which our joint helicopter force&#151;Army, Navy and Air Force helicopters&#151;are currently managed is not ideal. The helicopters are based in a variety of places around Britain, and there is very little coherence. Joint Helicopter Command, which I believe was created only a year or two ago, experiences some difficulty in acting as a coherent &#147;purple&#148; organisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para18"><a name="09032638000673">There has been a strong demand from Joint Helicopter Command, and from the three services, for a move towards the establishment of a single unified base for, in particular, RAF and Army helicopters. That strikes me as an immensely laudable and hugely sensible ambition with a great deal to be deal to be said for it, and I think that just about everyone in the defence world agrees that it should be realised. One senior officer involved with helicopters said to me the other day, referring to Project Belvedere&#151;which is what we are talking about&#151;&#147;They cannot afford to do it, but they also cannot afford not to do it.&#148; I think that there is a good deal of truth in that, and I shall return to it in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para19"><a name="09032638000674">There is a reason for my interest in Project Belvedere. The House will recall that some eight or nine years ago it was announced that the C130K fleet of Hercules aircraft based at RAF Lyneham, in my constituency, would reach the end of their useful life in 2012&#151;or would progressively approach the end of their useful life in the years leading up to 2012&#151;and that, at that stage, the C130J fleet of modern planes would be transferred to RAF Brize Norton, just down the road. All the RAF&#146;s transport capabilities for passengers, freight and tankers would be based there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para20"><a name="09032638000675">Many of us argued strongly against that decision, which was advanced for two main reasons. First, it was claimed that combining the two bases would produce a cost saving. That may be the case, although a substantial capital cost will be involved in the move, and only accountants will be able to tell us how long it will take for the modest year-by-year saving to pay that off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para21"><a name="09032638000676">I was talking to one of the base commanders&#151;I will not say who it was&#151;who would be involved in Project Belvedere and in the transfer of his helicopters to RAF Lyneham if that were to happen. He maintained that the cost would be so large that it would take 50 years to repay it. I said, &#147;That is a very interesting argument. If that applies to your helicopters being moved from base X&#148;&#151;which I will not name&#151;&#147;to Lyneham, how much longer would it take to repay the vast amount that it will cost to move our Hercules fleet from Lyneham to Brize Norton?&#148; He said, &#147;Well, it is certainly 50 or 100 years, and it is possibly never.&#148; I said, &#147;I will not name you, but I will quote you,&#148; which I have happily done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para22"><a name="09032638000677">The accountants are going to have to answer much more clearly on how they can add the thing together to make a sum that justifies shifting 3,500 RAF people and up to 50 planes from RAF Lyneham to RAF Brize Norton, which is already too small. Anyone who has had the misfortune to travel courtesy of crab air to Afghanistan or Iraq, which I have done two or three times recently, will know that RAF Brize Norton is already one of the least hospitable bases and that it is demonstrably too small for the job that it does at the moment. If about 50 Hercules, A400Ms&#151;if they arrive&#151;or C-17s were also operating out of the base, goodness knows what it would be like.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para23"><a name="09032638000678">At the moment, three tactical runways, two of which are at RAF Lyneham and one of which is at Brize Norton, are used for transport. If we were to bring everything together in one place at Brize Norton, all our eggs would be in one basket&#151;there would be only one runway, and there are many reasons why it might be inoperable. I was there the other day waiting to fly out to Afghanistan. I was delayed for 12 hours because of ice on the runway. If all our transport capability&#151;refuelling, transport and passenger planes&#151;were in Brize Norton, who knows what the end result would be? The first argument in favour of collocating everything at Brize Norton, namely cost, is questionable, and perhaps the accountants will have a second look.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para24"><a name="09032638000679">The second argument for collocation at Brize Norton advanced at the time was that the A400M was coming in by 2012, that it would be the greatest thing since sliced bread, that it was a European co-operative project and that it would be a superb aeroplane. We all know that the project has been delayed&#151;the latest I have heard is that it will be delayed by up to four years, although no doubt the delay will be longer than that. The Secretary of State has made it plain in a couple of interventions from the Dispatch Box that he is by no means confident that the A400M will be bought by the British forces, at least to the extent that we said we would buy it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para25"><a name="09032638000680">The whole future of transport is questionable. Most people in the RAF would prefer to see a fleet consisting of Hercules and C-17s, which is the ideal combination of sizes. From memory, we already have six C-17s&#151;perhaps the figure is eight&#151;and we can certainly buy or lease more. Hercules and C-17s seems like a nice combination to me. That combination operates nicely out of RAF Lyneham, and there is no reason why it would have to be based at Brize Norton. At the time, the argument was that the runways at RAF Lyneham are too short for the A400M to take off or land. That is demonstrably not the case, and that excuse was used to achieve other things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para26"><a name="09032638000681">I would prefer to see RAF Lyneham remain the same as it is at the moment. I hope that the delays with the A400M and/or the delays in rebuilding RAF Brize Norton will lead to that outcome. I hope that that door is not entirely closed. Without being party political about it, if there is a Conservative Government at some stage in the future&#151;of course, there might not be&#151;perhaps Conservative Front Benchers will consider reversing that decision. There may well be good economic reasons why it is impossible, but I hope that they do. In a recent informal conversation with one of my Front-Bench colleagues, I was encouraged to hear him say that Conservative policy is not to close RAF bases. We have to keep RAF bases open&#151;in 1942, we discovered that we did not have enough. That was an informal remark, and I may be corrected by other Front Benchers, but I will seek to persuade them to keep RAF Lyneham as it is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para27"><a name="09032638000682">Let us assume that for good reasons advanced by accountants or others, it is not possible to keep RAF Lyneham as it is. At the moment, 3,500 service personnel and 750 civilians work on the base. If one brings those people&#146;s other halves into the calculation, some 10,000 people in my constituency owe their livelihood one way or another to RAF Lyneham, and there are also retired service personnel. It is, therefore, a major part of my little constituency, and plays a very significant part in its economy, so the future of RAF Lyneham is of gigantic importance to me as a constituency MP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="90326-0017.htm_para28"><a name="09032638000683">I hope and think that I speak for the vast bulk of my constituents in saying that we would very much like Lyneham to remain military. We do not think it is right to convert it to any other use. We do not want a new town&#151;an extension of Swindon, perhaps&#151;or a refuelling base for Virgin Atlantic; that is a proposal I have heard, but it would certainly not be appropriate. We do not want it to become a gigantic industrial site either. We would very much like it to remain military. Wiltshire is home to the military, and the military are home for us in a very real way. We are very proud of our contribution to the military; half of the British Army is in Wiltshire. We want Lyneham to remain military&#151;either RAF or, potentially, Army.</p>

That would involve 15,000 people and 230 helicopters, so there would be quite a significant environmental price to pay&#151;although I am encouraged to hear my right hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hampshire telling me that in all his time he has only had one or two complaints about noise from Chinooks. Nevertheless, I am aware that if we were to have 230 helicopters operating from RAF Lyneham and 15,000 people, compared with the 3,500 we have at present, there would be a price to pay in terms of developing the air base. My soundings so far&#151;I cannot claim to speak for everyone by any stretch of the imagination&#151;are that the vast bulk of the population would be ready to accept that environmental price under certain conditions, which I will return to in a moment, in return for the continuing economic viability of the area.

with helicopter noise, which is a little bit noisier than Hercules noise, is something that I think the vast bulk of my constituents&#151;although not all of them by any stretch&#151;would be ready to accept.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="90326-0018.htm_para1"><a name="09032638000685">In that context, I say to the Minister that if Project Belvedere goes ahead, it would be nice to enter into a period of negotiation with the RAF and the Army about flying protocols, so that we could minimise the disruption to the surrounding areas. I have already had brief discussions with the Army, who tell me that the majority of flights would be in a narrow corridor going from Lyneham down towards Salisbury plain, and we could enter into negotiations to minimise disruption and noise for local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="90326-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09032638000686">The main problem is not knowing. In recent weeks, I have had a number of discussions about this matter with the Minister, as has my right hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hampshire, and rumours have flown to and fro&#151;&#147;Belvedere is on. Belvedere is off. Who knows what&#146;s happening? We haven&#146;t got the money, but we need to do this,&#148; and so on. It is important that a decision is made soon. Rumours coming back from various people in the MOD suggest that there is a plethora of committees and commands, and reports going to and fro and minutes of meetings, and that no one can make up their mind what to do. It is important now that the MOD decides either to go ahead with Project Belvedere or a lesser form of it, or&#151;although I am very opposed to this&#151;not to go ahead with it at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="90326-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09032638000687">If the MOD comes to that final conclusion, the last thing I would say on this subject&#151;I am sorry to have bored the House by focusing on what is largely a constituency matter&#151;is as follows. I have seen what happened to RAF Wroughton, which my own Conservative Government made the foolish decision to close in 1995 or so. It lay empty for many years, and there was vandalism and dereliction and total waste. I have seen the same in the town of Corsham in my constituency. The Army moved out in the &#146;50s or &#146;60s, and the town went down for a long time, although it is now coming back up again because of investment through the Defence Information Infrastructure process at Rudloe Manor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="90326-0018.htm_para4"><a name="09032638000688">The one thing I would not want to see at Lyneham is indecision and its lying vacant. We must not pull out the Hercules and then have nothing happening there at all. We must have clarity in terms of what is happening. The military might want it for some purpose&#151;perhaps a garrison returning from Germany. Alternatively, if the military come to the clear conclusion that they do not need it and that they will leave in 2014 and hand it over to the local authorities and others who will make something out of it, I would welcome that, too. It is important that we now start to get a little bit of clarity about what the future holds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="90326-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09032638000689">I repeat my main point: I hope very much that we can keep the Hercules fleet at Lyneham. If we do not, I hope that we can get Project Belvedere and get the helicopters there. If we do not, I hope that we will find some other military use for Lyneham. If none of those three options works, all I would say is, for heaven&#146;s sake let us have a clear decision and let us get on with the next stage in our life.</p>

 One is sadly accustomed in these debates to paying tribute to service personnel who have been killed in theatre, previously in Iraq and currently in Afghanistan. One did not expect to have to refer to the murder, for that is what it was, of two young soldiers in Northern Ireland on the eve of their bravely flying out into theatre in Afghanistan, where they would have faced danger from a more recognisable enemy. I would like to raise, in a gentle way, for Ministers&#146; consideration, one small issue that has not been raised today. They may not be aware of a petition that has drawn attention to the fact that these two young soldiers have not been accorded the same sort of ceremonial honour in being returned to the mainland of the UK that they would have been accorded had they died on active service in Afghanistan. These young men did die on active service, just as much as if they had been killed in Afghanistan, and it is only right and proper that they should be accorded the same sort of ceremonial honours. I hope that something can be done in that respect, particularly as it appears that one of their last acts was selflessly to try to protect their comrades as they came under fire.</p>

No Liberal Back Benchers have made a speech, despite the heroic efforts at in-flight refuelling by two Back Benchers making short interventions. In a debate on a subject of such breadth and importance, it behoves both the Government and those other parties that purport to be part of the Opposition to make sure that they are here in strength to speak up for their various views of the interests of the armed forces.</p>

It appears to have been a timely speech, given the likely contents of a report&#151;still embargoed, but due out tomorrow&#151;that might have taken the edge off it. The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) spoke warmly of the support for the armed forces, and especially for the Gurkhas, shown by his constituents. My hon.

It must be said that he has a special interest&#151;perhaps he ought to have declared a family interest&#151;in the aircraft carriers, given the excellent news that his nephew has been recently appointed to command HMS Illustrious.

He has the freedom to make that point, but I do not, although I shall be returning to that area a little later.</p>

The answer is that if it ever happened&#151;God forbid that it should&#151;it would not be paid for in any planned sort of way. We do not go out and about looking for state-on-state warfare: we tend to get involved in such warfare when we are attacked by large, hostile states. What we have to do then, frankly, is find the resources irrespective of whether we can afford them. What we have to do in times of peace is at least retain the nucleus for expansion across the spectrum of armed forces capabilities, so that if we ever do have to fight for our very lives in or around our homeland, we would at least have the potential for expansion, which we would not have if we closed things down, bulldozed the sites and said that we would never do anything other than counter-insurgency in the future.</p>

Friend the Member for North-East Hampshire (Mr. Arbuthnot), the Chairman of the Defence Committee, that his Committee has decided that we are not under imminent threat of invasion from Russia. Indeed, I would have hoped that his Committee took the same view even throughout the cold war. One of the reasons why we were never under threat of imminent invasion was that we were sensible enough to keep our defences strong, not least by retaining a nuclear deterrent that made it clear to any other power that no matter, how many times over they could obliterate this country, they would not be able to do it without paying an unacceptable price.</p>

I agree that questions could be asked about the parameters of these debates. I have tended to look at this one not as &#147;Defence in the UK&#148;, but &#147;Defence of the UK&#148;, as it complements the subject of defence in the rest of the world.

His observations on the use of the reserves as a substitute&#151;not from time to time or to fill particular gaps, but as a cheap alternative to adequate regular forces&#151;were very well made indeed. The consequences of what he talked about&#151;the under-resourcing of defence as a whole&#151;are clear for all to see. One has only to look at the reports of the breakdown of relationships between the service chiefs, when they spend time rubbishing the projects of the other armed services in order to try to get a better share of an inadequate cake, to realise the poisonous effect of what has been done to the harmony, efficiency and future potential of the armed forces.</p>

We cannot go on as we are. We were spending 2.5 per cent. on defence when we went into Afghanistan and, as Tony Blair said in his valedictory speech on HMS Albion, we are still spending 2.5 per cent. on defence if the extra cost of Iraq and Afghanistan is added.

That is not happening at the moment, and it must mean that there will have to be either greater funding in the future or fewer commitments. Which of those two it will be, or whether it will be some point in between, will be revealed nearer the time.

 Does my hon.

 I do indeed. I also remember during the cold war years&#151;like many middle-aged men who were involved in those arguments at the time, I am prone to looking back to that time too often&#151;the argument was always to ask why Britain was spending a greater proportion on defence than most of our NATO partners when our European colleagues and partners in NATO were spending much less. In fact, we were spending more than just about all of them except for the Americans. As somebody once pointed out, that was the wrong comparison. Those other countries were on our side. We should have been looking at what was being spent by our potential adversaries rather than what was being spent by our allies. We have to spend as much as the country can afford to fulfil as many military commitments as we need to undertake.

at least one case, under budget. As for other countries, they will not make a decision to acquire nuclear weapons because Britain, an existing nuclear power, continues to maintain a minimum nuclear deterrent as long as other countries still have nuclear weapons themselves. Whether countries acquire nuclear weapons or not is a matter of their hard-headed interpretations of their own strategic interests. Throughout the cold war and subsequently, whenever people on that side of the argument were challenged to name a particular nuclear or near-nuclear country that would follow suit if we unilaterally gave up our nuclear deterrent, they have never been able to give an example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="90326-0018.htm_para18"><a name="09032638000705">As for the letter from the three generals, I would like to think of one of the three, Sir Hugh Beach, as a friend of mine. He is a very gallant and courteous man, who won a military cross fighting the Nazis in world war two. I think very highly of him, but he has always been against Britain&#146;s having an independent nuclear deterrent. I was pleased that, when the Royal United Services Institute invited him to write a long article for its journal, I was encouraged to write the rejoinder for the opposite side of the case. I invite anoraks on this subject to get hold of the February 2009 edition and immerse themselves in those two articles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="90326-0018.htm_para19"><a name="09032638000706">As well as being one of the most decent Members of this House, my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) is certainly one of the most respected on the subject of reserves, but I want to concentrate on another aspect of his excellent speech. He went to the heart of the matter when he pointed out that virtually all the wars and conflicts in which we have been engaged in recent history took us completely by surprise. He gave a long and extremely impressive list, but I should like to add one more example. In the 1920s, this country&#146;s armed forces were so unclear about where the next war was likely to come from that each of them prepared its own hypothetical contingency plans against entirely different potential enemies&#151;the Royal Navy against Japan, the Army against Russia, and the Royal Air Force against France. At least one of them got it right, but I leave it to hon. Members to decide which.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90326-0018.htm_para20"><a name="09032638000707">I turn now to the contribution made by the Minister for the Armed Forces. I was surprised at his feeble attempt to suggest that the Conservative policy on the maintenance of Trident was unclear. The Conservative party is only major party in this House that has supported the maintenance of the strategic nuclear deterrent ever since Britain acquired one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="90326-0018.htm_para21"><a name="09032638000708">I take the Minister back to that happy day of 14 March 2007, when this House voted by 409 votes to 161 to proceed with the steps necessary to renew Trident and keep the nuclear deterrent for a new generation. On that day, 87 Labour MPs joined the Liberal Democrats in opposing the motion. If the Conservative party had done what the Liberal Democrats did and found an excuse to vote against the Government, the Government would have been defeated. So it really ill behoves the Government to say that the Conservative party, which saved their correct policy to go on with the nuclear deterrent, is in any way uncertain about the matter. If the Minister had any doubts in that regard before today, the excellent speech from my hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox), the shadow Secretary of State, means that he can have no more in the future.</p>

 Absolutely, we certainly have it now, but it is something that the shadow Chancellor will have to bear in mind when he draws up his plans. As I said, the Conservative party must somehow stretch its ambitions around the money that it is applying, and the two do not match.</p>

<p><a name="st_o313"><a name="09032638000712"><a name="90326-0018.htm_spnew6"><a name="09032638001179"><b>Dr. Lewis:</b>
 Here is a litmus test for the Minister: when he sees that my hon. Friends the Members for Woodspring and for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth)&#151;and, I venture to say, myself&#151;have been quietly shifted away from the defence portfolio to other responsibilities, he may have some grounds for suggesting that there is something in what he has said. One never knows, as all such matters are in the lap of the gods&#151;or, in this case, my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), the leader of my party, whom we all greatly admire and respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="90326-0018.htm_para22"><a name="09032638000713">I particularly admire and respect my right hon. Friend because I remember his excellent response to Tony Blair at the end of 2006, when the statement about the Government&#146;s intention to go on with a new generation of the nuclear deterrent was made. I was somewhat involved in the drafting of that reply and my right hon. Friend made only two alterations, both of which made it even tougher than it had been in the original draft. I therefore have no doubts whatsoever on that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="90326-0018.htm_para23"><a name="09032638000714">I turn now to the contribution from the Liberal Democrat spokesman, the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey). I think that I dealt at the time with his bizarre claim that his party had been vindicated by the fact that a timetable had been set for withdrawal from Iraq, now that the insurgency has been brought so massively under control. The Liberal Democrats were advocating a timetable for withdrawal while the outcome of the conflict was still in doubt. I have argued before that counter-insurgency involves four elements: identification of the enemy, isolation of the enemy, neutralisation of the enemy and negotiation with realistic parts of the enemy to deal with the irreconcilables so that peace can then prevail. That is precisely what has happened in this case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="90326-0018.htm_para24"><a name="09032638000715">The hon. Gentleman&#146;s remarks about the protesters were well made and his commitment to a strategic defence review is good. It is a pity that it came so long after my party&#146;s calls for one, not only now but every four years. One of the interventions made during his speech seemed to suggest that we needed a strategic defence review because the last one had been tailored to the cold war. That is the opposite of the truth: the last strategic defence review, which we all, on both sides of the House, said at the time was a pretty good piece of work, was precisely tailored to the post-cold war world.</p>

 I am glad the hon. Gentleman sees that. Perhaps that was why he described the intervention as &#147;interesting&#148; rather than giving it more positive support.</p>

 As usual, the debate has been wide ranging. The contributions were not only well informed but covered interesting subjects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="90326-0019.htm_para1"><a name="09032638000722">Today, on the Conservative Front Bench we saw the neo-cons versus the Cameroons. The hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) is a strong advocate for the nuclear deterrent&#151;I would recommend to anyone his pamphlet arguing the case for it. It would be interesting if there were a Conservative Government&#151;I shall not say that I look forward to the day&#151;and the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) was at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the hon. Member for New Forest, East at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, with the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) running some bit of Government equivalent to a Siberian power station.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="90326-0019.htm_para2"><a name="09032638000723">Today, the Conservatives have set out clearly that the nuclear deterrent is not up for negotiation. The reason that clarity is important is that sad anoraks, such as me, who read ConservativeHome can see that the central hierarchy of the party are trying to test the water&#151;to find out whether negotiation would be possible. The clarity we have heard today is very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="90326-0019.htm_para3"><a name="09032638000724">The hon. Member for Woodspring made an interesting speech and, in his usual way, covered a large number of subjects. He seems to think that the Navy is separate from the rest of the defence budget. He talked about the Navy being betrayed. I want to reinforce the point made by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces. We have the largest building programme ever for the Royal Navy&#151;&#163;14 billion over the next 10 years. That is a clear commitment from the Government to the Navy. It is important to ensure not only that we equip the Navy with the ships it requires but that we have the skills to produce those ships in UK yards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="90326-0019.htm_para4"><a name="09032638000725">Resources were mentioned. I look forward to hearing debates on the issue as the election gets closer. The hon. Member for Aldershot is clear about his position; he said on &#147;Newsnight&#148; on 6 September 2007 that it was absolutely crystal clear that if his party came into office on the next day, they would spend more money on defence. Clearly, that line has now changed. I think that when it comes to the defence budget, we will see more confusion of the sort that we saw on tax policy this week in the Conservative party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="90326-0019.htm_para6"><a name="09032638000729">The hon. Member for Woodspring mentioned Russia; I know that he raised the issue on another occasion, too. He asked whether there had been increased submarine activity. There has not been any increase in the usual levels of activity. There has been an increase in surface activity, but I think he will appreciate that I do not want to go into too much detail about that. Cyber-security needs to be taken seriously not only by the Ministry of Defence, but across Government. It is a new field that will increasingly play an important part in any type of attack in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="90326-0019.htm_para7"><a name="09032638000730">The hon. Member for Woodspring rightly referred to the increased body armour provided in armed vehicles. More armed forces men and women in Afghanistan and Iraq are now surviving attacks, not just because of the skill of our medical staff but because of the protection they get. That leaves issues to do with rehabilitation, and I am certainly committed to ensuring that those concerned get support.</p>

Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey). The hon. Member for Woodspring asked whether the issue was at the centre of the Ministry of Defence&#146;s concerns. I am determined to make it so, not just for the ministerial team, but within the chain of command, because all the evidence is there. We have to be careful not to use intemperate language when talking about the numbers. The numbers are quite small, but that does not detract from the fact that if just one single person suffers from post traumatic stress disorder, it is a personal tragedy for that individual and their family. We must do our utmost to protect them. I am working with service charities and other sectors on the welfare pathway, which will be announced later this year. It will look at the support that we give to our men and women not only when in service, but once they leave service.</p>

Every time I have been to theatre, I have asked about the issue. I was in Afghanistan a few weeks ago and asked again whether the decompression period was long enough. It is 48 hours in Cyprus. Every single time, both commanders and normal soldiers tell me that that is long enough. I have said this to the hon. Gentleman before: I ask him not to downgrade in any way the role of our civil servants serving overseas. I do not think that he did so intentionally. Those staff are volunteers, and many are doing dangerous jobs in dangerous situations. We should thank them for the role they play.</p>

A lot of Members have asked where the new facility is, and I had to think very hard about whether it actually was in his constituency. I pay tribute, as he did, to the brigadier and the project team who are delivering that facility.

I was a little concerned, because I know that he is a former Foreign Secretary, and he used the words, &#147;wars of choice&#148;. I am worried that that may be interpreted as our being able to pick and choose the conflicts in which we become involved. I accept that he is not an isolationist who thinks that England can somehow divorce itself from the rest of world. However&#151;and he knows this from his experience in the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence&#151;one of those Departments may not think about the implications for others of its decisions.

Hampshire raised the issue of JPA&#151;the organisation that procured it is based in his constituency. May I say&#151;and I have said this before&#151;that it is a standing issue when I meet the head of defence personnel? There have been problems, but it is a remarkably successful IT project compared with those in other Government Departments. The important point about JPA, which I want to push, is how we achieve increased access to it. Internet access is the way forward. There are some security issues, but we are addressing them.</p>

She takes a close interest in protected vehicles, and in a previous debate expressed thanks and recognised the advances that had been made. She asked for numbers, but I do not want to give the number of individual vehicles for operational reasons. Great advances have been made. When I was in Afghanistan a few weeks ago, I saw not only how they saved people&#146;s lives but the adaptations that had been made in theatre. We can rightly be proud of that.</p>

As a result, the number of flying hours that we are getting out of helicopters in Afghanistan has substantially increased.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="90326-0019.htm_para23"><a name="09032638000750">One of the privileges of my job is to work with armed forces charities, which do a fantastic job. I am not one who thinks that Government can do everything. The charities have an important role. I hope that many people take part in armed forces day on 27 June and give the recognition and support that our troops deserve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="90326-0019.htm_para24"><a name="09032638000751">We heard a fascinating contribution from the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter), which showed the tensions in the Conservative party on Europe. I am glad that he and the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) are now in the ascendancy again in the party. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech was well argued. Britain cannot do anything alone. Working with European partners and NATO is important. We need to explain that and fight back against little Englanders such as the hon. Member for North Wiltshire. I wish the hon. Member for North Dorset well in his campaign to educate the more recalcitrant members of the Conservative party about the benefits of the European Community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="90326-0019.htm_para25"><a name="09032638000752">I have already mentioned Project Belvedere, which was also raised by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire.

Whenever I meet them, whether in this country or abroad, I realise that they are young men and women carrying huge burdens of responsibility. In my first contribution to one of these debates, I said that I would like to continue the bipartisan approach in the House, which we certainly had in the Defence Committee, so that we are united in thanking and supporting the members of our armed forces who are doing very difficult jobs on our behalf.</p>

 I thank Mr. Speaker for awarding me this debate and the Minister for staying behind to reply to it. I say affectionately to the Minister that the pub industry and certain products in which it deals are close to his heart, as they are to mine. We share a number of interests, including horse racing and the odd social half hour in the bar downstairs. I am delighted that this Minister is replying to the debate. I am also grateful to the British Beer and Pub Association and the all-party beer group. My hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans), a member of the group, is here today to take part in the debate. I should also thank my local landlord, Mr. David Baker of the Village Inn in Twyning, for advice, facts and figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="90326-0019.htm_para30"><a name="09032638000758">Obviously, pubs are historic institutions and go back many centuries. The Royal Hop Pole in my constituency was mentioned by Charles Dickens in &#147;The Pickwick Papers&#148;. Pubs represent a big industry; there are more than 62,000 in Great Britain today and 84 per cent. of them are family-run businesses, which adds a certain importance to them. I notice that the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan), chairman of the all-party beer group, is here; I paid tribute to it a moment ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="90326-0019.htm_para31"><a name="09032638000759">Pubs are extremely valuable to communities; they act as meeting places and many friendships are formed in them. Many groups are set up through pubs&#151;pub football teams and golf societies, for example. Fairly recently I managed to win the tournament put on by my local golf society. I was very proud of that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o324"><a name="09032638000760"><a name="90326-0019.htm_spnew7"><a name="09032638001190"><b>Mr. Nigel Evans (Ribble Valley) (Con):</b>

 I can tell my hon. Friend that, yes, others did enter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="90326-0019.htm_para32"><a name="09032638000762">Pubs play host to skittles matches, card games, dominos, darts and pool, as well as many other activities. They are headquarters for various societies, and&#151;even more so these days&#151;provide meals for families and individuals. In fact, almost 40 per cent. of pubs&#146; turnover comes from food sales. People watch sports in pubs and pubs provide supervised drinking, an important point to which I will return in a minute. Some provide wonderful examples of fine architecture and many raise money for charities. Furthermore, they are particularly, although not exclusively, important in rural areas. They have been described as a uniquely British institution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="90326-0019.htm_para33"><a name="09032638000763">Pubs also make an important economic contribution, particularly through tax; according to the House of Commons Library, the drinks industry alone contributes &#163;14.79 billion a year. Each pub contributes an average of about &#163;90,000 in taxes, which is an awful lot of money. When we next go to our local pub, we should think about the &#163;90,000 contributed just by that pub; we will then realise pubs&#146; economic value to the country as well as to the community. At a time when people who enjoy a social drink are under pressure because of the misuse of alcohol by the few, we should remember how much money people who enjoy a drink contribute to the Exchequer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="90326-0020.htm_para0"><a name="09032638000764">Some 350,000 people are directly employed by pubs, but a large number are also indirectly employed by them. On average, each pub contributes about &#163;3,000 to charities in their areas. I pay tribute to all the landlords and landladies who have run such fine institutions over the years and provided such a great contribution to their communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="90326-0020.htm_para1"><a name="09032638000765">Alas, however, there are problems, and that is the main reason for my wanting to hold this debate. I am thinking particularly of pub closures. Pubs are closing at a rate of 39 every single week. That is bad enough, but an even bigger problem is that the rate is accelerating. Since the last Budget, more than 2,000 pubs have closed, costing the Government &#163;180 million in lost revenue, with the loss of 20,000 jobs&#151;that is a lot of jobs to lose. In my own constituency, 11 pubs have closed since June 2005, including one very recently that I really would not have expected to close. Of course, in some areas, where the market might be saturated, a few pub closures are to be expected now and again, but this trend represents more than that, and it is very worrying. I would suggest that there are other reasons for it apart from the economic downturn, which obviously is not helping any business. I will name just a few: high tax; competition with supermarkets; pubcos, which are the organisations that own the pubs; the weak pound, to some extent; and the smoking ban. All those problems have contributed; I should like to take each of them in turn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="90326-0020.htm_para2"><a name="09032638000766">There are two worries as regards tax. It is sometimes difficult to get exact figures for tax on beer, but it seems that it accounts for 28 per cent. of the price of a pint in the pub. Over the years, the sale of beer has declined dramatically. Now there is the question of what the Chancellor of the Exchequer will do in a few weeks&#146; time in his Budget. It is feared that the escalator that was imposed, which meant that beer duty would increase by the retail prices index plus 2 per cent., will create further problems for the pub industry. A while ago, VAT was reduced for almost all goods and services across the country, but that did not apply to drinks&#151;beer, in particular&#151;because the duty was put up to ensure that the price of alcohol did not fall. The beer industry did not get any boost from that reduction in VAT&#151;although I doubt that any industry did, as it was a futile measure&#151;because it, together with smoking, was singled out as an area that should not benefit. That is bad enough, but when VAT is restored to 17.5 per cent., it will face an even bigger increase because the duty was adjusted when the rate was reduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="90326-0020.htm_para3"><a name="09032638000767">I do not have anything against supermarkets, but there are two problems: first, their provision of very cheap alcohol, usually through using it as a loss-leader to get people into them in the first place; and secondly, their power of purchase, also used against farmers, which enables them to refuse to accept increases that breweries might feel the need to pass on to them, even when the tax paid by the brewery has gone up. All the people who buy from supermarkets then drink unsupervised. Pubs provide a supervised forum for drinking; supermarkets do not. Under-age people are often&#151;not always, by any means&#151;able to get alcohol from supermarkets very cheaply and cause trouble in communities as a result. In pubs, tax forms about 28 per cent. of a pint of beer; in supermarkets, and in the off trade  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="26 Mar 2009">

<notus-date day="26" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>26 Mar 2009 : Column 548</b><br>
generally, it forms 50 per cent. That reflects the different prices that are charged. I am informed that in the 1990s the on-off ratio&#151;the price in a pub compared with the price outside the pub&#151;was 2:1; now, it is 7:1. The very cheap alcohol that is available in supermarkets has a big effect in terms of social behaviour, as well as on pubs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="90326-0020.htm_para4"><a name="09032638000768">There is also the question of pubcos. Punch Taverns, Enterprise Inns and many other companies own pubs that were once owned by breweries. Bass, for example, which was a brewer but also a pub owner, had 7,190 pubs in 1989. In 2007, Punch Taverns had 9,095 pubs. The ownership of pubs is very different now. Why is that important? All four or five of us in the Chamber today realise that a monopolistic situation exists&#151;vertical integration might be a better way to describe it. The Select Committee on Business and Enterprise finished a report on that recently, but unfortunately it has not been published&#151;we look forward to it. I am not against pubcos, but the fact that they act as a middleman, buying beer and then charging extra for providing it to pubs, which could get it directly from the breweries if they were not tied to the pubco, makes beer a lot more expensive for those who go into pubs. And we can see that the situation is worse for pubs when we compare their prices to those of supermarkets. I referred to my own pub, and Punch Taverns recently ordered a 10p a pint increase there because of the pressure it is subject to from breweries due to extra tax pressure, but it could add a bit more if it so wished. That said, only 14 per cent. of closures are of pubs owned by any of the top six pubcos; I am not saying that they do not do a good job in some cases, but I am highlighting a difficulty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="90326-0020.htm_para5"><a name="09032638000769">I mentioned the weak pound. I do not want to say too much about that, but if we buy alcohol from abroad, it will be dearer. I now come to the smoking ban. I realise that this will be the most contentious part of my speech, but that has never worried me before. I spoke against the ban on smoking in public places, not because I do not respect the right of people to enjoy themselves in smoke-free environments, but because I felt that it was up to the local landlord to know his potential customers and decide what was best for them. There can be no doubt that beer sales have fallen. There may be a few extra people who come into pubs because they are smoke-free&#151;I do not think that there are many&#151;but we could have had high-quality extractor units and separate areas in pubs, and things could have been so much better. I do not mean this discourteously, but if people are fair-weather patrons of pubs, they do not spend much money. They are entitled to sit in the corner with an orange juice all night&#151;that is their privilege and I defend their right to do so&#151;but that does not keep the pubs going. It is the more regular patrons, such as myself and many others, who provide more of the money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="90326-0020.htm_para6"><a name="09032638000770">Another aspect of that problem relates to the supermarkets selling alcohol very cheaply. People might be persuaded to stay at home, drinking cheap and probably stronger alcohol in greater measures, while smoking in front of children. Previously they would have smoked in a pub in front of adults who had a choice of whether to be there or not. The ban has not helped in any respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="90326-0020.htm_para7"><a name="09032638000771">Rate relief and rural rate relief are helpful, but are seen as rather inadequate because qualifying levels are far too low. They are also discretionary and perhaps  <br>

they should be mandatory. Business rates will increase by 5 per cent. in a few days&#146; time across the board, including for pubs, even though that increase is based on September&#146;s retail prices index. I do not think there is an RPI at the moment&#151;I think that it is nil&#151;but there will still be an increase, which seems unfair.</p>

 On the subject of rate relief, does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is a strong case for extending rate relief not just to village pubs, but to those in market towns and suburbs? Any pub that calls itself a community pub should be able to apply for such rate relief&#151;such a measure might be of some assistance.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman. That would help, although it would not entirely rescue the situation. We must consider the position of small businesses. They have to pay money out before they have earned any. That payment is not based on their activity, and they really are in a difficult situation. I hope that the Government will do something about that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o328"><a name="09032638000774"><a name="90326-0020.htm_spnew2"><a name="09032638001194"><b>Mr. Evans:</b>
 Does my hon. Friend agree that something else that disadvantages a lot of small pubs with high rateable values is the fact that they are unable to put on Sky Sports, and particularly some football matches, because the charges are so prohibitively large? That is another reason why people are staying at home. They watch football there, because they are unable to do so in a lot of pubs, particularly in rural areas.</p>

<p><a name="st_o329"><a name="09032638000775"><a name="90326-0020.htm_spnew3"><a name="09032638001195"><b>Mr. Robertson:</b>
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I have seen examples of that situation, which has a bad effect. My sister has a bar in Spain, and when there is a world cup tournament on, or cricket, football or whatever it is, the takings rise greatly. If that facility cannot be made available by pubs in this country, for the reasons that my hon. Friend gives, it is a setback.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="90326-0020.htm_para8"><a name="09032638000776">I suggest that there should be no increase in alcohol tax in the Budget. I know that the Government are looking to get back the billions of pounds that the Prime Minister has spent on rescuing failing banks and now on effectively printing money, but I think that an increase would be counter-productive. Oxford Economics estimates that an increase would cost a further 75,000 jobs over the next two years, which is a lot of jobs. Those people would then be unemployed, and the situation would get worse. The tax should be frozen. Actually, I would like it to be reduced, particularly on beer. I do not suppose that the Government will do that, but the situation is certainly becoming urgent when 39 pubs a week are closing. If people continue to turn away from pubs, it will be counter-productive from a health point of view because supermarkets will fill the void in a dangerous way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="90326-0020.htm_para9"><a name="09032638000777">I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister say recently, when there was a suggestion of a minimum price per unit of alcohol, that other methods should be chosen to counter the problems that are related perhaps to alcohol, but more particularly to people&#146;s bad behaviour. That is what we should put them down to. Yes, the low price of alcohol is fuelling the problems in certain places, but we should not lose sight of the fact that it is people&#146;s bad behaviour that is causing them.</p>

debate&#151;the hon. Gentleman raised some of the issues in that regard. We need to consider the role of tied houses and other pub companies, which, through differential pricing and the rents charged, have an impact on landlords. Although I understand the issues in relation to duty and regulation, I will discuss with colleagues in the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform how we can better understand the sector and provide help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="90326-0020.htm_para16"><a name="09032638000785">The ideas about the role that community pubs can play are excellent. The hon.

In a rural setting, the pub is important in providing services to the local community. We need to consider those matters.</p>

Given my role before I became an MP, he will not be surprised that workers&#146; rights and public health are close to my heart. I believe that the restrictions introduced were the right way forward. A number of pubs have come up with ingenious solutions, in consultation with local authorities, to enable them to accommodate smokers. The debate will rumble on, but the majority of people backed our efforts.</p>

He will be concerned, as I am and many responsible pub owners are, about alcohol-related crime and disorder, and the need to treat and deal with those who cannot handle drink and commit crime as a result. In many cases, customers are put off going to pubs in town centres, for example, because of the violence that takes place. We want to see the growth of community pubs, but we must acknowledge the wider public intentions of policy to tackle such problems. We want to achieve a balance.</p>

Whatever the group feels about the outcome, I want to ensure that the message gets through that Ministers are aware of the current campaign and that the concerns are being heard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="90326-0020.htm_para20"><a name="09032638000789">We have taken some measures, such as the decision to extend the enterprise credit guarantee scheme to all types of smaller pubs, which has helped many tied pubs in particular. In relation to legislation for which I am responsible in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, I have placed orders before the House that would introduce a simpler process for making minor variations to licences, and to increase the stakes and prizes for pub gaming machines. Previously, I have also committed myself to measures to improve other aspects of the licensing regime. We will reflect on the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="90326-0020.htm_para21"><a name="09032638000790">Although the measures that we can take are important, they will not in themselves secure the viability of the trade or ensure that it can see out the economic downturn.  <br>

How, then, should the pub trade help itself to respond to the challenges? The hon. Gentleman has already offered some solutions, but let me repeat that, in my view, community pubs could have a bright future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="90326-0020.htm_para22"><a name="09032638000791">The issues raised by the hon. Gentleman were reflected in a recent seminar conducted by the Institute for Public Policy Research, which presented all sides of the argument. I was particularly pleased to hear a representative of Alcohol Concern say that the idea of community pubs service was a good one. The debate about alcohol-related health problems has sometimes featured the argument that those who are concerned about them do not understand the issues surrounding pubs, but Alcohol Concern was clearly prepared to support community pubs because they promoted responsible drinking. I consider that to be a major breakthrough. It is possible that pubs could become community businesses. I know that my colleagues in the Department for Communities and Local Government are discussing the possibility that rate support and other support could be given to pubs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="90326-0020.htm_para23"><a name="09032638000792">Pubs have a great record of reinventing themselves and adjusting to changing demands&#151;by offering better food, as many now do, or by offering more family-friendly premises. Sunday afternoon satellite television is important in securing the football market. I note what was said about that by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley. We must get that right. We speak of the decade of sport and the need to persuade more people to participate in sport. People want to see their role models on television, particularly footballers. We need to speak to representatives of Sky and Setanta, and similar providers, to see what they can do for the smaller pub&#151;for pubs that are not part of a big chain that can afford the fee. I undertake to ensure that we at least talk to them about the possibility. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the wider review of issues related to sport shown on terrestrial television, in which my hon. Friend the Member for Selby is heavily involved, but I think that he made a fair point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="90326-0020.htm_para24"><a name="09032638000793">The editor of the <i> Morning Advertiser </i>wrote in June last year that some of the current challenges had accelerated the decline in pubs that could not adapt to modern demands. That loss is sad, but we must ensure that we provide an opportunity for the pubs that remain to emerge successfully from the present downturn. I believe that that can be done if we adopt a positive attitude. Yes, there are issues to which the Government should respond with tax-related and other measures, although they should be seen in the round and in the context of all the other spending issues with which Government are faced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="90326-0020.htm_para25"><a name="09032638000794">Given that the all-party beer group is the largest group in Parliament, it is perhaps surprising that only five of us are present this afternoon. However, I am sure that the group&#146;s other members will be watching our debate avidly on television, back in their constituencies, to see what I have to say about the outcome for pubs.</p>

 On their pub televisions, yes. Certainly the group is concerned about the impact of what is happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="90326-0020.htm_para27"><a name="09032638000798">Drinking habits are an issue. Social changes are taking place: people are turning from beer to wine, and more drinking takes place at home. Let me make a point now in case I am challenged on the matter in future. What we are talking about is responsible drinking, supervised drinking, and ensuring that people drink reasonably in a safe environment.</p>
