The Secretary of State has said elsewhere that the momentum of reform will be maintained, even without the Bill, and the Minister hinted in her answer that the Bill may come back somehow or other in future.

Although the Bill has 300 clauses, it is the least party politically contentious and the bulk of the work has been done, given the very good pre-legislative scrutiny. What has the Secretary of State said to the people who make the decisions about the parliamentary programme and timetable? What representations has he made?

Among the Bill&#146;s proposals were plans to streamline the complicated and often deeply confusing rules surrounding the protection of the UK&#146;s heritage buildings. Such streamlining would speed up regeneration. Will she reassure the House that the first possible opportunity for the Bill will be taken?

First, the sports Minister is seeking a meeting with Ofwat to see what can be done nationally to ensure that sports clubs&#146; needs are taken into account. My hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale and Darwen needs to be aware that United Utilities is one of two companies nationwide that adopted a policy of calculating rates based on the total area of land, and clubs may need help in explaining their bills to the company, and in challenging those bills.

We are tremendously encouraged that 80 per cent. of councils have opted in to offer free swimming for the over-60s and that some 60 per cent. of councils will make swimming free for under-16s from April.

Those are not optional extras, they are critical targets if a sport wants to benefit from public funding.</p>

 May I thank my right hon. Friend for visiting two sports clubs in my constituency a few days ago, both of which offer cricket as one of their sports? Does he know from his constituency that such clubs are already under pressure as a result of reduced bar takings and three bad summers, which have meant reduced spectator takings? On top of that, very few of them are now able to employ a professional cricketer during the summer period, which has also resulted in fewer spectators and lower takings. If the surface water drainage charges are accepted, particularly in the way in which United Utilities is applying them to cricket clubs in my area of the north-west, it will be the last straw for cricket in many villages and many parts of Bolton.</p>

 I was pleased to visit the two cricket clubs, Darcy Lever and Bolton Indians, recently. It was not the first time that I had done so, because I used to play in the Bolton association league and was on the end of beatings handed out at both those grounds many times. I know the strength of cricket in my hon. Friend&#146;s local area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="90119-0002.htm_para1"><a name="0901194000065">I have two points. First, cricket is the largest beneficiary under the new whole sport plan process that my hon. Friend the sports Minister put in place with Sport England. More money is being directed to the development of cricket, in recognition of the fact that cricket has big needs and faces big costs for its facilities. Secondly, my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) is right that water charges have a great impact on cricket clubs, given the surface area of most of them. It is important that we pursue the discussions that I mentioned and reach a good solution for cricket, recognising the particular needs of cricket clubs. I assure him that I will work diligently on all those things.</p>

 According to the DCMS&#146;s own figures, funding for community sport has gone down by &#163;15 million in the past three years. At a time when central Government have to tighten their belt, is this not precisely the moment that the lottery was set up for? Will the Secretary of State, perhaps with the zeal of a repenting sinner, finally consider returning the lottery to its original pillars so that sport can get the help that it so desperately needs?</p>

 First, may I offer the hon. Gentleman congratulations on two counts? I am sure that I speak for all Labour Members in giving him our warmest wishes on his recent engagement. I also congratulate him on retaining his Front-Bench position, although I do not know whether he is pleased or disappointed about that; we hope that he is pleased.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="90119-0002.htm_para2"><a name="0901194000068">The hon. Gentleman repeatedly misses a point in the debate, and he has done so again.

not previously invest in the statutory sector. Following on from that, my right hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Tessa Jowell) brought a major national initiative to fruition, which saw&#151;from memory&#151; around &#163;750 million invested in school sport UK wide. That created a network of flood-lit, astro-turf pitches in my constituency, which are heavily used during the school day, at evenings and weekends. I am incredibly proud of that. The investment would not have gone to schools if we had left the lottery as it was. I therefore make no apology for enhancing sports facilities in schools in that way.</p>

 But the Secretary of State misses the crucial point that my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) made: there is a big increase in the drop-off rate of people taking part in sport when they leave school. That is why we need to continue to invest in not only school sport but community sports clubs. Funding for the latter has been cut. According to yesterday&#146;s papers, the Secretary of State has been hosting &#163;3,000-a-head dinner parties for the great and the good. Is not that the wrong way to spend the Department&#146;s money at a time of economic crisis, when sports club budgets are being cut, and was not his spokeswoman wrong yesterday to say describe it as a coup for Britain?</p>

 With respect, the hon. Gentleman again misunderstands our policy. We have said that more money will be channelled through the national governing bodies of sport because they are the experts and should be able to decide which clubs to build up and which deserve more support. <i> [Interruption.]</i> Well, I will send him the figures. The funding will increase significantly in the next few years, when more than &#163;90 million extra will be spent on improving sports clubs. I repeat that I will send him the figures. The community sports club fund has decreased, but because more money is going to the clubs through national governing bodies&#151;I wish he would understand that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="90119-0002.htm_para3"><a name="0901194000071">On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s second point, let us be clear about the event. It was the launch of an international forum to promote Britain as the natural home of the creative industries. As part of that, we have recruited 25 of the biggest names&#151;the biggest players&#151;in the world in the creative industries. [Hon. Members: &#147;Name them.&#148;] I can name them, and I will write to the hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt). The event happened because they will give their time for free to advise this country on ensuring that we build on our strength in the creative industries. I am proud of the fact that this country has strength in those industries. The hon. Gentleman might be happy with the newspaper headlines that he has got, but he should not misrepresent the event or what it seeks to achieve.</p>

He has been there so long that he probably deserves honorary druid status. Unfortunately, however, the same cannot be said of the Government. They have spent &#163;30 million on paper exercises, and still nothing happens. How long do we have to wait for some leadership? A Tory social action project would have had the work done by now. What is staggering is that we are the fifth biggest economic power in the world and the sixth most popular country to visit, and still we cannot even build a half-decent visitor centre for our top outdoor tourist attraction.

 I thank the Minister for his answer. Is he aware of the Scottish national issue and the announcement by Newsquest that it is to cut 40 editorial positions at the Glasgow <i> Herald</i>? The company is giving almost all the journalists redundancy and asking them to reapply for their jobs, despite making &#163;23 million in Scotland in 2007. Will the Secretary of State agree to meet the National Union of Journalists to discuss not just that issue, but the wider issue of the press?</p>

 Like everybody, I feel for those people who have lost their jobs at the Glasgow <i> Herald</i>. I will certainly agree to my hon. Friend&#146;s request for a meeting with the NUJ, although I should point out that many of the policy responsibilities in that area are the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. However, I recognise that local newspapers face pressures both from the current economic climate and from structural changes in the media industries. Only a few years ago the press accounted for 54 per cent. of the advertising spend in this country, but the figure is now down to 43 per cent., so there are real structural changes taking place. We need to take a careful look at local news outlets in the current climate and see whether more creative ways can be found to sustain high-quality media at the local level. Lord Carter will take forward that work in &#147;Digital Britain&#148;, but I am sure that colleagues in all parts of the House will want to pay close attention to the issue.</p>

 The <i> Evening Standard</i> is indeed a well-loved part of London life&#151;a view held on both sides of the House, I hasten to add&#151;and, whatever changes are in the offing, it should maintain its character and journalistic standards on all counts. I am sure that, like me, the hon. Gentleman will accept that what matters is not an individual&#146;s nationality but the plans that they have to uphold those standards and that character.

between the BBC and ITV in the regions would be a good way of sharing costs and sustaining those important news services. I am encouraged by reports that the two sides have made good progress on establishing a partnership arrangement. Ofcom will say more this week about public service broadcasting, in the culmination of its second stage review. We will need to consider all these matters in the round when we come to make our decisions, but there is good progress to report and I hope that my hon.

 My right hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Tessa Jowell) set up the BBC Trust to examine precisely the issue that the hon. Gentleman has raised. It not only looks at the desire of the BBC to launch new services but applies a wider public value test so that the actions of the BBC can be considered in terms of the effect that they will have on other parts of the media industry. The hon. Gentleman will know that the BBC&#146;s local video service was tested by the trust on that basis, and the trust made its decision late last year. Listening to his question, I imagine that he will have found that decision favourable. Obviously, these issues need to be carefully considered. The local media are an important part of the health of our democracy in every hon.

 With reference to the earlier question about the possibility of the London <i> Evening Standard</i> being bought up by a Russian oligarch, and given that Roman Abramovich is reported to be trying to sell off Chelsea to middle eastern interests, how long will it be before Londoners see their evening paper being traded from an oligarch to the middle east?</p>

 There is obviously a limit to what I can say on this matter. Indeed, the policy responsibility rests with the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. However, as I have said many times in relation to the ownership of football clubs, it is not nationality that matters, but the importance of any individual who purports to own an important part of British national life having the best of intentions and seeking to uphold its standards, character and integrity.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on today&#146;s announcements on bank lending. The House will, I hope, understand that it was necessary to issue a market notice this morning in the usual way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para0"><a name="0901194000143">In the last few months our priorities have been: first, to prevent the collapse of the banking system; secondly, to support the economy; and, thirdly, to ensure that we get lending going again. That problem is also faced by Governments across the world and it is therefore necessary to achieve the maximum degree of international co-operation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para1"><a name="0901194000144">We are taking steps not just to support the banking sector but, importantly, to safeguard the millions of jobs that could be put at risk by the continuing difficulties in the international financial system. Extending the banks&#146; ability to lend is an essential part of the economic recovery, so today I am proposing further measures to meet two objectives. The first is to begin to replace the lending capacity lost by the withdrawal of foreign banks and other institutions, and the second is to remove the barriers that are preventing UK banks from expanding their lending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0901194000145">I want to set out the new measures in the context of the strategy we have put in place to steer the country though the worst global economic crisis for generations. Over recent months, banks have faced increasingly difficult conditions, as we have seen everywhere around the world, with the Bank of America rescued last week, with Citigroup&#151;one of the largest banks&#151;broken up, with Anglo Irish nationalised, with Commerzbank rescued in Germany and with RBS today reporting substantial write-offs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0901194000146">Last October, faced with the potential collapse of the banking system, we recapitalised the banks, strengthening their position. As a result, the Government took temporary stakes in two British banks, but, as I said then, we have a clear view that British banks are best managed and owned commercially and not by the Government. That remains our position. As a result of the action we took, no savers in UK banks have lost money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0901194000147">In the pre-Budget report, I announced substantial extra help for people and for businesses. Lower income tax, more capital investment now and lower VAT, hand in hand with interest rate cuts and lower inflation, will support the economy and jobs. There is clear international consensus that putting money into the economy now, to counter the recession and to help people, is the right thing to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0901194000148">The cost of doing nothing would be substantially greater. In almost every country, fiscal expansion policies have now been agreed&#151;including Germany only last week. In the United States, President-elect Obama has already signalled the scale of the fiscal expansion there, but as the President-elect said only yesterday,</p>
<a name="90119-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="0901194000300"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;restoring the economy requires that we maintain the flow of credit to families and businesses.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para6"><a name="0901194000149">In the UK, the total amount of lending available still falls short of meeting the needs of the economy. Over the last 10 years, lending by foreign banks and non-bank institutions accounted for over half of new corporate  <br>

loans and 45 per cent. of new mortgages here. A significant amount of lending capacity&#151;by those foreign-owned banks and specialist lenders, for example&#151;has been withdrawn or has been returned to their home markets, demonstrating again the need for co-ordinated international action. On top of that, in the last few weeks the world economic downturn has intensified everywhere: the US, the euro area, and now spreading to Asia, including China, which are all seeing weaker production, companies in trouble and fewer jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0901194000150">As we go into what will be a difficult year, dealing with this global financial crisis will need continuous effort. There is no single remedy. There is no instant solution. We will need a range of measures designed to support lending, help businesses and protect jobs. Together, my measures today remove uncertainty and accelerate a resumption of lending&#151;a necessary precondition for recovery both here and around the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0901194000151">There are three measures to address the capacity reduction in the banking sector. First, because of current conditions, companies are finding it harder to get loans, so the Government have today authorised the Bank of England to create, for the first time, a new &#163;50 billion fund that will help increase the amount of funding available to companies&#151;by purchasing corporate assets from the banks&#151;enabling them to invest. That will help large companies and complement the substantial measures announced last week by my right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to support small and medium businesses. The fund will buy assets from banks, financial institutions and financial markets, with finance provided by the Treasury. The Treasury is also supporting the fund with an indemnity. It will initially purchase high-quality private sector assets, such as corporate bonds, commercial paper and syndicated loans, which companies use to finance their business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0901194000152">The assets purchased by the Bank of England will be good-quality investments, which will eventually be sold, so the taxpayers&#146; interests are protected, and will enable larger companies to get the funding they need at a lower cost. The operating remit of the scheme will be set by the Government, but it will be run on an independent basis by the Bank of England. When purchasing those assets, the Bank of England will ensure that the total amount of money in the economy does not increase. In future, the Monetary Policy Committee will keep under review whether the facility could be used as an additional way of meeting the inflation target, in line with similar operations at the US Federal Reserve. In such circumstances, I will decide the overall scale of the scheme, and I will keep the House informed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para10"><a name="0901194000153">Secondly, to maintain some of the capacity being lost in the mortgage market, I have decided that Northern Rock will no longer pursue a policy of rapidly reducing its mortgage book. In addition, looking at when the housing market recovers, I am considering whether, and if so how, Northern Rock or other UK lenders can best support prudent lending to creditworthy customers who need mortgages but can only afford deposits of less than 25 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para11"><a name="0901194000154">Thirdly, to ensure that RBS, which owns NatWest and a number of other banks, can continue to support lending, I am taking action to strengthen its position. When the Government purchased their stake in the bank in December, a new management team was put in  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="19 Jan 2009">

place. The company has announced further losses today, many of which are associated with its investments in the US following its takeover of a Dutch bank, ABN, in 2007, so I have agreed to its request to convert the Government&#146;s stake of preference shares into ordinary shares. The Government could now own up to 70 per cent. of RBS. In return, we have agreed with RBS an extension of lending commitments to large companies, and an increase in lending of &#163;6 billion in the next 12 months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para12"><a name="0901194000155">As well as taking action to maintain lending capacity, I want to remove some of the barriers and uncertainty preventing the existing banks from lending further, but in return for that we intend to negotiate with each bank a lending agreement. Those agreements will be specific, covering both the quantity and type of lending made available to people and businesses across the country, just as we have done with RBS today. These commitments will be binding and externally audited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para13"><a name="0901194000156">In return, the banks will get access to support measures: first, a new scheme under which the Treasury will insure certain bank assets, for a commercial fee, against losses on banks&#146; existing loans. The purpose of the protection is to allow the expansion of lending, so the pricing has to be fair and reflect all our objectives. The banks&#146; problems stem from uncertainty about the value of their assets, and faced with that uncertainty, individual banks are reluctant to lend to businesses and companies. This reduces the banks&#146; exposure to risks and will give them the room that they need to lend more. We will insist on the highest international standards of public disclosure and transparency in the operation of the scheme. Countries all over the world are considering similar proposals, and we will work with them to take action together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para14"><a name="0901194000157">The second step towards removing barriers to lending is an expansion of the funding capacity in the financial markets. The credit guarantee scheme that I announced in October will be extended beyond its current end date of April this year, so that it will run until the end of 2009, subject to state aid approval. That scheme guarantees new unsecured borrowing, and so far over &#163;100 billion of the guarantees have been taken up. These guarantees have been successful in helping to bring down the inter-bank lending rate from 6 to 2.25 per cent. To complement that, the Bank of England will continue to provide similar types of liquidity support when the special liquidity scheme expires at the end of this month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para15"><a name="0901194000158">Until recently, up to half of UK mortgages were funded from the wholesale markets. At the time of the pre-Budget report, I accepted the recommendations in the Crosby report on mortgage finance markets. I have announced that the Government will provide up to &#163;50 billion of guarantees, initially on new mortgage lending and eventually on other assets. Overall, the liabilities taken on will be backed by financial assets, and fees will be charged for guarantees and insurance, which will safeguard the taxpayer&#146;s interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para16"><a name="0901194000159">Thirdly, the Financial Services Authority has set out today its policy on capital requirements. It has set out the level of capital that individual banks need to keep on their books to allow them to withstand the slow-down and maintain lending. It will be a key signal that banks   <br>

should allow their capital to be used to absorb the losses from investments, while not unnecessarily restricting their lending. And because the regulation of capital is fundamentally an international matter, tomorrow I will present our plans to European Finance Ministers in Brussels, and I hope that we can agree similar capital policy changes there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para17"><a name="0901194000160">This financial crisis is affecting every country in the world, so it is crucial that other countries, too, take steps to support their banking sectors. We cannot risk a damaging worldwide spiral of weakened confidence and national-only policy solutions. Stronger international collaboration will be strengthened with the arrival of the new US Administration, and we must not give way to financial protectionism, which could be every bit as damaging now as it was to trade in the 1930s. Instead, we must look to the causes of this international financial crisis; we must strengthen the supervisory and regulatory regime both here and internationally. I shall publish proposals on the regulatory framework for the banks in the spring, together with the FSA&#146;s own review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para18"><a name="0901194000161">Internationally, we will be actively pursuing that, as part of our presidency of the G20 throughout 2009. Our objectives in the G20 will be to continue to take action jointly to support the world economy, to act together to restore the flow of credit and to improve the international regulatory regime. This is a continuing effort. Countries all over the world are united in supporting their economies, maintaining lending and protecting jobs. We are ready to do whatever it takes, and I commend this statement to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o91"><a name="0901194000162"><a name="90119-0004.htm_spnew0"><a name="0901194000417"><b>Mr. George Osborne (Tatton) (Con):</b>
 I begin by thanking the Chancellor for his statement, but he should have been straighter with the British people about the announcements that he is making today. This is not some long-planned, carefully thought-through second phase of Government policy; it is instead the clearest possible admission that the first bail-out of the banks has failed, and now the Government have no option but to attempt a second bail-out&#151;a bail-out whose size we still do not know, whose details remain a mystery and whose ultimate cost to the people of Britain will be known only when this Government have long gone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para19"><a name="0901194000163">Of course we cannot allow the banking system to fail&#151;but for two months now, the Opposition have warned the Government that bank recapitalisation was not working, that the cost of the preference shares was too high, that the liquidity operations had to be extended, that the promised lending to businesses was not taking place, and that Government guarantees to get lending flowing to the real economy were needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para20"><a name="0901194000164">For almost a year we have argued for countercyclical rules that control bank lending in a boom and encourage it in a bust. Each one of those arguments was dismissed by the Government, and each one is today accepted by them. The Prime Minister has finally been forced to confront the truth: he has not saved the world, he certainly has not saved the economy, and he has not even saved the British banks yet. Let us remember what he promised last autumn. He said at the Dispatch Box that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para21"><a name="0901194000165">Yet he did nothing to make that happen, and the result has been dozens of companies going bust through lack of credit, and thousands of jobs being lost, while the Prime Minister and the Chancellor wasted their time on a temporary VAT cut that the country could not afford.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para22"><a name="0901194000166">The Prime Minister also said at the time of the first bail-out in October:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para24"><a name="0901194000168">Well, perhaps the Chancellor could confirm today that on current market valuations the taxpayer has lost almost &#163;17 billion on those shares. We now discover that the Government really did not have a clue about what they were buying, and they did not bother to find out. They did not appear to know that the Royal Bank of Scotland was preparing to post the largest loss in British corporate history. Indeed, on today&#146;s share price, the entire bank is now worth less than the &#163;5 billion of preference shares that the Chancellor is swapping.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para25"><a name="0901194000169">The Prime Minister says in interviews that he is angry with the banks. What about the anger of the taxpayers who trusted him with their money? So when the banks come to the Government and say, &#147;Please can we have some more?&#148; we expect the Prime Minister and the Chancellor to answer the following questions before they say yes. First, will the Government conduct their own full, independent audit, not just of the agreements signed, which the Chancellor mentioned in his statement, but of the balance sheets of the banks, so that we know exactly what we, the taxpayers, are now underwriting?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para26"><a name="0901194000170">The Prime Minister called this weekend for the banks to come clean about their losses. Instead of pleading with them, why does he not insist? That is what the Swedish Government did when they pursued the bad bank model in the early 1990s. That is the minimum required if we are to price correctly the insurance that the Government are offering and protect the taxpayer from catastrophic loss. It is the minimum if we are to reassure the public that there is some control over their losses, and that they are not writing a blank cheque.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para27"><a name="0901194000171">That brings me to the second question that the Chancellor must answer. How much is the taxpayer in for? What is the potential loss this time? He could not tell us this morning on the radio, even as the Treasury appeared to be briefing people that the amount was &#163;200 billion. What is the correct figure? What is his estimate? Surely that is the very least that Parliament and the public have a right to know. We need to be absolutely sure that the threat of insolvent banks does not turn into the threat of an insolvent country. We need to be clear that our country&#146;s reputation in global markets, and its credit rating, is not put at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para28"><a name="0901194000172">Finally, will the Chancellor be straight with people about the announcement today of an asset purchase facility? He mentioned it in his statement, but he did not spell out that it could have implications for the whole country for years to come. That asset purchase facility gives the Bank of England the power to use asset purchases for monetary policy purposes. That amounts to a programme of &#147;quantitative easing&#148;&#151;the modern equivalent of printing money. While no one rules it out, it is the last resort for Governments who have run out of other options. Two weeks ago the Chancellor said in Liverpool that it was &#147;an entirely  <br>

hypothetical debate&#148;; that was the phrase that he used. Two weeks later, it has become a real option for which the Government are clearly preparing. What has changed in the space of a fortnight?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para29"><a name="0901194000173">The first bail-out has failed. The VAT cut has failed. None of the endless summits and initiatives has worked. Unemployment continues to rise. New figures out this morning show that Britain is set to have the deepest recession of any major economy in the world. The Government have achieved nothing. As the Prime Minister and the Chancellor ask the British people to put more of their money on the line, surely the time has come for the Prime Minister and Chancellor to stop blaming everyone else and start accepting their responsibility for the boom that turned to bust. When will they accept that, ultimately, the buck stops with them?</p>

<p><a name="st_o92"><a name="0901194000174"><a name="90119-0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="0901194000418"><b>Mr. Darling:</b>
 Let me deal with the various points that the hon. Gentleman made. First, let me deal with his point about the bank rescue scheme that we put in place last October. His criticism would have much more strength if, in fact, he had not at the time supported what we were doing. There was cross-party consensus that what we did to recapitalise British banks was the right thing to do, because we faced a situation in which the system, not just here but in different parts of the world, faced collapse. That is why we took action, and why it was followed in just about every other developed country, and the hon. Gentleman supported it at the time&#151;although he subsequently found it convenient to move away from that and take up a different position, as the truce the Opposition promised, with cross-party co-operation, appeared to break down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para30"><a name="0901194000175">Secondly, in relation to the support we have announced today, we have done so, because it is quite obvious not just in this country&#151;and it is happening here&#151;but in other countries across the world that economic conditions have deteriorated over the past few months. That is blindingly obvious to everyone, and it is affecting every country in the world. We are seeing it in America and in the euro area. In Germany we have recently seen the effect in industrial production and growing job losses. Growth in China has dropped quite dramatically in the past few months, which in turn has had an impact on confidence in banks and on their reluctance to lend. That is why I have introduced a range of measures to try to unblock some of the problems that we face, as well as providing greater security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="90119-0004.htm_para31"><a name="0901194000176">The hon. Gentleman asked about costs, and in October and again today, I have set out the costs that we anticipate. He should remember that many of the up-front costs are offset to a large extent by the fact that the Bank of England or the Government will take securities, or fees will be charged to protect the taxpayer&#146;s interest. However, the cost of doing nothing would be far, far greater and far, far more damaging for the country as a whole. He rightly said that if the Government are to insure, acting as backstop, some assets, there must be a thorough audit so that we understand exactly the risks to which we are exposed. The reason why I announced today that we would offer that scheme is that it is now necessary for us to enter into discussions with individual banks, to see what we are prepared to insure. At that point, I will be able to come back to the House and explain exactly what the Government are taking on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="90119-0005.htm_para0"><a name="0901194000177">However, I must tell the hon. Gentleman again that we are not the only country doing this. Unless we are prepared to use the power of government to get lending going again, the problems will simply be compounded as more and more firms get into difficulties&#151;they cannot get access to credit and so get into difficulty&#151;which feeds back into the effect on the banks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="90119-0005.htm_para1"><a name="0901194000178">The hon. Gentleman is right&#151;I agree with him&#151;and I said in my statement that we needed to have a thorough audit, openness and substantially more transparency than we have seen in the banking system over the past few years. The last thing about which he asked was the question of monetary policy and quantitative easing, which I mentioned quite deliberately in my statement, because I wanted to tell the House exactly what we are doing. Under the scheme that we are proposing, there would be no increase in the amount of money going into the economy, because for any additional money that the Bank of England puts in through normal market operations, an equivalent sum will be taken out, so that it will not affect the quantity of money in the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="90119-0005.htm_para2"><a name="0901194000179">I did say, however, that by having this mechanism it is possible that if, at some point in the future, we wanted to use it for monetary purposes, it could be so used, but that is not what we are doing at the moment. I shall repeat to the House what I said this morning: if that policy changes, I shall tell the House. At the moment, although our interest rates are low at 1.5 per cent., we are not in the same position as they are in America, where interest rates are virtually zero. I have been very up-front: I have said to the House that this is exactly what the position is just now, but if the policy changes, I will tell the House. I would, however, say in conclusion that I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman and the Conservatives could not maintain cross-party support. I really do think that at this time, when we face such serious economic conditions across the world, that all of us should work together to help get credit going again, to help the wider economy, and to help the people of this country and of countries around the world.</p>

 It is clear from the statement today that the crisis in the banking system is even more serious than it appeared three months ago, that the economy is in an even more vicious downward spiral, and that the bank rescue did not work. The Government increasingly resemble somebody who is trying to give the kiss of life to a corpse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="90119-0005.htm_para3"><a name="0901194000181">But before we discuss the latest resuscitation techniques, may I go back to the bank rescue that we had? It was a &#163;37 billion recapitalisation: what happened to the &#163;37 billion? Where did it go? The Government tell us that they are putting in place new lending agreements, but when the &#163;37 billion was put in we were told that there was conditionality and that there were lending agreements.

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="90119-0005.htm_para5"><a name="0901194000183">On the new &#163;100 billion guarantee scheme, how is it possible to insure enormous amounts of bad debt if the insurer does not know the risk, and if the risk cannot be evaluated until we have a valuation of the bad debts, which nobody yet has? Are the Government not operating the scheme in a falling asset market, with potentially enormous losses coming through on commercial property, for example? This morning, one of the brokers in the City estimated that in a falling asset market, the &#163;100 billion insurance scheme could produce losses for the taxpayer of &#163;30 billion to &#163;40 billion. We are talking about an amount the size of the defence budget, which could go down the pan if this is wrongly timed and wrongly operated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="90119-0005.htm_para6"><a name="0901194000184">May I get to what I think we all agree is the central issue, which is how we get new lending going to sound commercial and household borrowers? I welcome the change of direction at Northern Rock; it had to happen. But the key is what the Government are doing with NatWest-Royal Bank of Scotland. The Government have increased their share from 58 per cent. to 70 per cent. Is that not nationalisation in all but name? Why do we not just say so, and why do the Government not spell out the implications of acquiring a bank whose balance sheet is bigger than the British economy? Why do they not explain to us, for example, why this bank managed to lose &#163;2.5 billion through lending money to a Russian oligarch? This is not just about the past. I have been corresponding with the chairman about the bank&#146;s loans to another oligarch, Mr. Deripaska. The chairman tells me that it is a commercial matter&#151;but it is not a commercial matter but a public policy issue. Another public policy issue is what happens to the hundreds of billions&#151;not tens of billions&#151;of toxic paper in the investment bank, because the taxpayer now has responsibility for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="90119-0005.htm_para7"><a name="0901194000185">I want to conclude on this point. The Government now effectively control one of the largest banks in the world. They will almost certainly have to put more money in, and they may well acquire other banks. Why do they not now focus on the issue of how to get those banks&#151;those enormous institutions&#151;channelling funds into the British economy, and concentrate on that single-mindedly as their major objective?</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman to this extent: the key for us, as for other Governments, is to get lending going into the wider economy. But I disagree with him in that I think that that has to be done not just through one particular bank, but through the banking system in general. The proposals that I have made aim to do that.</p>

The majority shareholding in RBS was acquired by the Government in December, and overall lending by RBS did increase as part of that wider agreement. Indeed, today, in return for converting our preference shares into ordinary shares, RBS has agreed to extend its lending by &#163;6 billion. In relation to the other bank in which we have a shareholding&#151;the Lloyds group&#151;it is only today that that new organisation has come into force because of the procedures that had to be followed through. I agree with the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) that it is important that we, and indeed banks, are clear as to what exactly is on their balance sheets. Clearly, in the case of RBS, the decision to acquire ABN a couple of years ago, with all the problems that have followed from that, caused that bank some very substantial problems.</p>

That process is difficult when conditions are deteriorating, and it takes time. However, I thought it right to tell the House what the Government&#146;s intentions are in that respect. I agree with him that the key thing is to ensure that we take action to get borrowing going into the economy, but that has to be done through the whole banking system, not just part of it.</p>

Let us be clear that the reason for today&#146;s injection is the lack of openness and honesty by the banks on the amount of bad debts that they have on their books. That amount has had an almost fatal influence on the lack of confidence in the financial sector.

 In relation to RBS, the Government acquired their shareholding about five weeks ago. A new management team was put in, and a new chief executive, and one of their jobs was to go through the books and find out what their liabilities were. Until that time we did not have the power to go in and conduct that examination, because it was a privately owned bank; it was not owned by the state. That has been possible only since we got that shareholding and put in the different team. Of course, the reporting requirements of the markets mean that these things are reported to the stock market rather than to the House of Commons. I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman that very many people in this country are justifiably angry about what has happened. We need to sort the matter out, and we need to ensure that we can sort out the particular problems in the banks that we own, but above all we need to ensure that we can get credit flowing again.</p>

 I thank my right hon. Friend and support his statement today, particularly his clear stand about an obligation on banks to start lending to our citizens and to our companies in the wider economy. In his negotiations with banks, what obligations will he place on them to deal more fairly with borrowers from low-income families? For the past few years, banks have failed abysmally to offer those people proper facilities and resources to bank in an adequate way, leading them sometimes to be the victim of loan sharks. Can he give some indication of what banks will now be expected to do to assist this huge group of people in Britain who are suffering very badly in the current crisis?</p>

 My right hon. Friend has a long and distinguished record of putting in place measures to help people on low incomes who have found themselves in the hands of loan sharks. There are two aspects to this issue. One relates to the specific and quantifiable commitments on increasing lending. The other thing that irritates people is the banks&#146; conduct of business and the way in which they communicate with customers. Many people&#151;I have constituents who have had problems like this&#151;say that they have had a perfectly happy existence with their bank for many years, but then suddenly get a letter saying, &#147;By the way, your facilities have been withdrawn or changed&#151;and here&#146;s a fee.&#148; My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. It is not just a matter of the lending conditions and getting lending going; customers have to be treated fairly. Institutions often fall over themselves to sign people on, but they need to show exactly the same consideration to people who, in some cases, have been customers for many years.</p>

 I am grateful to the Chancellor for his past courtesy in correspondence and in his offer of meetings. I welcome in today&#146;s announcement the embedding of the principle that there must be a quid pro quo: if guarantees have been given by the taxpayer, transparency and legal obligations are incumbent upon the banks. Will he consider how he might generalise that in his proposals for international reform, for instance, through international monetary exchanges? Market transactions would continue, and they would be balanced by central bank guarantees, but only in return for a greater degree of transparency that would allow some regulation, and a financial contribution from the transacting parties that ultimately could provide reinsurance to replace Government guarantees. Would that not be a better way of internationally combining the market with central Government assistance and guarantees?</p>

 My right hon. Friend has indeed been in correspondence with me on this subject. I repeat that I would be very happy to meet him to discuss it further. As I said in that correspondence, the question turns on just how much risk the state should be prepared to take on what might be a long-term basis. A balance has to be struck. In the position that we face, every Government will have to do things that they might have thought unimaginable a couple of years ago. It would be foolish to rule out from the start all sorts of things that might be necessary or possible in the future, but a balance has to be struck between what risks we can reasonably expect institutions to take on and those that the state might take on.

 In relation to the hon.

I made the point earlier that I am afraid that it is necessary for the Government to take action. The action that Governments take may vary in approach. Some favour the &#147;good bank, bad bank&#148; approach, and others are considering insurance, but whatever happens, the position now&#151;none of us wants to be in it&#151;is that the world and countries depend on the banking system working efficiently, so we must carry out that investigation.</p>

 The Chancellor has many times told the House that the crisis that arose last October was the reason that he invested taxpayers&#146; money, to the tune of &#163;37 billion, in the banks. Have we learnt the lesson? I have studied the views of many people, including expert economists and those from the City and in finance. They warned that what was happening in this country&#151;excessive, irresponsible lending and borrowing&#151;could not go on. Why did the Government not act sooner? Coming from a smaller business background, I certainly would have.</p>

 First, in relation to the recapitalisation of the banks, there are not that many people around who would argue that we were wrong to take the action that we did. We had to do it, and we had to do it pretty quickly, because we were facing a pretty dire situation. The hon. Gentleman raises a far broader point, however, which is that over a number of years we have seen massive credit flows going from the developing countries to developed countries, particularly the United States. Many people commented on those imbalances and wrote about them, but unfortunately the world&#146;s international financial institutions were not, I think, up to the task of ensuring that we did something about them. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right: that is an area that needs considerable strengthening, and it is precisely one of the areas that we will be pursuing through our presidency of the G20&#151;the largest group of developed countries&#151;at a meeting that we will have in London in April.</p>

Does he share my concern that, with many people in negative equity, the prospects of finding a better deal elsewhere are nil? Such people rely entirely on their lender treating them fairly; this relates to the conversation about treating customers fairly that we had back in October. This issue is critical, so I rather hope that the Government will now insist that the Financial Services Authority use its regulatory powers to make bankers and lenders treat customers fairly, because some of them are not doing so.</p>

Northern Rock has been reducing those sums and is ahead of its repayment schedule. However, given everything that I have said about capacity, it is now time to look at that policy again, because it does not make any sense to take people off the books of Northern Rock. In some cases they find it acutely difficult to find somewhere else. I therefore agree with the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) on that point.</p>

 As I have said, if banks take advantage of the facilities that I have outlined today, they will have to enter into specific, legally binding agreements, and people will be entitled to see those agreements. The agreements that have been reached so far attach only to the RBS group, because the Lloyds group came into existence only today. The RBS and other banks have increased lending, although it is becoming very obvious that, when we start to break down the figures, the picture can be very different in different sectors and different parts of the country.

 We would have to look at the loans that a bank had as a whole.

It is important that we understand what is being insured, and that is the difficulty that banks all over the world are facing, because there has sometimes been a lot less clarity on that than we would have hoped.</p>

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a further statement to the House on Gaza.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="90119-0006.htm_para6"><a name="0901194000250">From the outset of the conflict, the UK has called and worked for an immediate ceasefire. I know from questions on my statement last week that the whole House will have felt enormous relief on Saturday night when Israel halted its military operations in Gaza, and on Sunday when Hamas stopped its rocket fire. Our relief at the ceasefire is matched by our distress that it has taken so long to be achieved. The respite has come too late for too many.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="90119-0006.htm_para7"><a name="0901194000251">A ceasefire, as Security Council resolution 1860 made clear, was always going to be the essential first step. We urge Israel to complete the withdrawal of its troops from Gaza with all due speed. Hamas must put a definitive end to rocket fire at Israel. That is why the Prime Minister travelled to Sharm-el-Sheikh and Israel yesterday to join other world leaders in starting to embed that ceasefire and ensure it becomes the durable and fully respected ceasefire that we and the Security Council have called for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="90119-0006.htm_para8"><a name="0901194000252">In the last 22 days of the Israeli offensive, more than 1,200 Palestinians have been killed, many more injured, countless thousands displaced and critical infrastructure destroyed. We are yet to know the full extent of the destruction, but horrific accounts and images already fill our news bulletins and we can be sure that life for Gazans, which was already grim, has become desperate. Systems for power, sewage and food distribution are broken or under strain. Meanwhile rockets have reached further than ever from Gaza into Israel. Israel has lost nine soldiers and four civilians.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="90119-0006.htm_para9"><a name="0901194000253">The Gaza crisis has reverberated around the world. There have been large demonstrations in the middle east, but also in the west. The conflict has also been used to whip up hatred, including in this country, and I am sure the whole House will want to send a very clear and cross-party message that we all denounce the anti-Semitic attacks that have taken place and vow to work for their elimination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="90119-0006.htm_para10"><a name="0901194000254">We are faced with two immediate challenges: stopping the flow of arms and starting the flow of aid into Gaza. In respect of trafficking in arms, as the Prime Minister announced yesterday, we are ready to play our part. The immediate security responsibility lies with Egypt, but the origin of these arms stretches way beyond the Egypt-Gaza border. This is where international help, aimed at interdiction, using intelligence and a range of military assets, is important.</p>

The closure of the crossings has also created a thriving illegal trade in necessities, which has filled Hamas&#146;s coffers without providing Gazans the basics that they require. Hand in hand with closing illegal traffic must go a vast increase in legal traffic. The immediate priority is to meet the desperate humanitarian needs. That means not simply food and medicine but, for example, sanitation equipment. Then there are all the supplies that are required to repair Gaza&#146;s ruined infrastructure and return power and water. The Government have pledged  <br>

a further &#163;20 million, on top of the &#163;6.8 million that we pledged earlier in the conflict. British charities have raised millions more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="90119-0007.htm_para1"><a name="0901194000256">The Prime Minister made it clear in Egypt and in Israel that reopening the crossings would be vital. The 2005 movement and access agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority should provide the framework. We are ready to help, including by reinstating and, if necessary, extending the EU border assistance mission at the Rafah crossing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="90119-0007.htm_para2"><a name="0901194000257">Smuggling and the crossings will be at the heart of the discussions this Wednesday evening, when all 27 EU Foreign Ministers meet Foreign Minister Livni, and on Sunday evening, when we meet our Palestinian, Egyptian, Jordanian and Turkish counterparts. However, the critical actors alongside Israel in securing progress, never mind peace, are the Palestinians themselves. Full humanitarian reconstruction will be impossible unless accompanied by political reconstruction. Unity in Palestinian politics is vital to so many things&#151;to rebuilding Gaza, to holding elections, to delivering peace. It is for President Abbas to lead that process. The Arab League and Egyptian commitments of last November point the way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="90119-0007.htm_para3"><a name="0901194000258">At a time of enormous loss for Palestinians, one thing should not be forgotten. Palestinians on the west bank did not respond to Hamas&#146;s calls for a third intifada. In fact, the Government of Prime Minister Fayyad on the west bank showed clearly in their management&#151;political, economic and security management&#151;that given half a chance, Palestinian government can be hugely effective and provide a real partner for peace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="90119-0007.htm_para4"><a name="0901194000259">At the UN and in the House last week, I said that the Gaza crisis was a symptom of political failure. To avoid its repetition we need a political process&#151;a strong one. The Arab League showed in its letter to President-elect Obama in December that it was serious about its ground-breaking offer of peace embodied in the Arab peace initiative: the creation of a Palestinian state in return for Arab normalisation of relations with Israel, a genuine 23-state solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="90119-0007.htm_para5"><a name="0901194000260">The challenge is to ensure that this Gaza crisis does not simply provide another grim milestone in an endless conflict. As we help Gazans to rebuild their lives, we must find a way to ensure that this is the last time they will have to do so. That means showing serious progress towards a Palestinian state alongside improved Israeli security. It means a peace process in which closed-door negotiations are buttressed by Israel and the Arab world taking steps to support rather than undermine the peace process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="90119-0007.htm_para6"><a name="0901194000261">However, anyone who doubts that peace in the middle east requires the full, intense engagement of the international community needs only to look at the streets of Gaza today. International engagement that is full and intense includes the immediate engagement of the new American President and Administration. President-elect Obama and his Secretary of State-designate Hillary Clinton have made clear that they understand the urgency and are committed to acting. This will certainly be the first topic raised when I speak to the new Secretary of State this week.</p>

 I thank the Foreign Secretary for his statement. Of course, in common with him, we welcome the ceasefire that took effect at the weekend and the withdrawal of Israeli defence forces from Gaza. I join him immediately in sending the united message from the House to which he referred: whatever the very strong debates about this conflict, they must never be the excuse for anti-Semitism or any other kind of hatred. I also join him immediately in the tribute that he paid to the Administration of Prime Minister Salam Fayyad on the west bank, whose conduct is in such stark contrast to that of the Hamas leaders in Gaza.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="90119-0007.htm_para8"><a name="0901194000264">Although there is no doubt that the immediate trigger for this crisis was the barrage of rocket attacks against Israel from Hamas, I know that the Foreign Secretary will agree with us that it was very much in Israel&#146;s own interests to bring the conflict to an end. While it is alleged that Hamas may often have used civilians as human shields and fired rockets from civilian areas, it is also clear that the civilian toll in Gaza and the number of attacks on United Nations-run schools and compounds, which have yet to be explained, have caused damage to the reputation of Israel in the wider world. The Foreign Secretary did not tell us in his statement&#151;I hope he will do so now&#151;whether the Government believe that these incidents should be investigated, by whom they think they should be investigated, and whether the issue was discussed at the summit in Sharm-el-Sheikh at the weekend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="90119-0007.htm_para9"><a name="0901194000265">There are three issues on which I want to ask the Foreign Secretary a few quick questions: how we can bolster what is currently a fragile ceasefire, how to ensure a quick and effective aid supply to the people of Gaza, and how to ensure an early return to the middle east peace process. On the bolstering of the ceasefire, can the Foreign Secretary be a little more specific? There is the Israel-US agreement on preventing arms smuggling, and it is reported that under that agreement the United States will act to block the transfer of rockets from Iran to Sinai and the Gaza strip via the sea and through east Africa. Can the right hon. Gentleman confirm reports that Israel has approached European states, including Britain, to reach similar agreements? As part of the ceasefire agreement, the Prime Minister has offered Royal Navy support. Can the Foreign Secretary say what form that will take, and what impact it will have on the many competing priorities of the Royal Navy at a time of serious overstretch? Can he also say who will lead this mission? Will it be NATO, the EU or a coalition of the willing, and what will be the legal mandate for the mission?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="90119-0007.htm_para10"><a name="0901194000266">My second few questions for the Foreign Secretary are about the imperative of getting aid to the people of Gaza. We welcome the announcement of his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development that Britain will be making available an additional &#163;20 million in humanitarian aid. Does the Foreign Secretary believe that the scale of the relief effort overall is likely to be sufficient, and will sufficient technical assistance be available quickly in Gaza to restore the  <br>

basic infrastructure and prevent the spread of disease, which is always a great worry in these situations? Given the obvious need to open the crossings if aid and assistance is to enter Gaza on the scale needed, can he confirm that the Israeli Government have indicated that the crossings are starting to open from today? What role will be played by the Palestinian Authority at those crossings, and what will happen to the Hamas representatives who are on the ground there? Are there any plans for a broader international monitoring mission to be put in place? Can the Foreign Secretary therefore say precisely what role the EU proposes to assume on Gaza&#146;s crossings, and how close we are to an agreement on how this will operate?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="90119-0007.htm_para11"><a name="0901194000267">Thirdly and finally, the House is obviously united in agreeing that an early return to the middle east peace process is vital. We all want to see this as a top priority for the incoming US Administration right from tomorrow. When the Foreign Secretary speaks, as he said he would do this week, to the incoming Secretary of State, will he make the point that it is vital in that process that the following three things now happen: international pressure and attention to encourage Israelis and Palestinians to make the compromises necessary to achieve long-term peace, including over settlements on the west bank; continuous, albeit cautious, dialogue with Syria; and, on Iran, the stepping up of European pressure against her nuclear programme to buttress any new approaches on this issue by the United States? Is it not the case that we need all those three things to happen together in order to set the region on a path to long-term peace and stability&#151;a vital objective for this Government, and so many other Governments, in the months ahead?</p>

 I will go through the three sets of specific questions that the right hon. Gentleman raised. Before raising them, however, he referred to the investigation of serious allegations of war crimes and other misdemeanours, and he will know that I said very clearly in my statement last week that those allegations must be closely and speedily investigated. Obviously, the three key parties to that investigation are the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Government of Israel, and we are in touch with all of them. I should also point out that however heinous is the crime of using people as &#147;human shields&#148;&#151;a terrible phrase&#151;that does not change the responsibilities of parties to the conflict to spare the lives of civilians; it is important not to forget that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="90119-0007.htm_para12"><a name="0901194000269">In respect of the ceasefire, we will hear more from the Israeli Foreign Minister on Wednesday. I spoke to her on Friday, and we will have to wait and see where the Israelis&#146; thinking has got to on the smuggling issue and the suggestion of further memorandums of understanding. Obviously, we want to make sure that we make a practical difference in respect of the smuggling, which is in part a local issue across the Egypt-Gaza border, but which is also a wider one given the regional and even global flows of arms that take place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="90119-0007.htm_para13"><a name="0901194000270">There are three limits on how much detail I can provide. First, by definition, since the people trying to do the smuggling are acting illicitly, there are natural limits on how much we will ever be able to reveal. Secondly, discussions are under way about the precise combination of different countries and different assets that will be deployed. Thirdly, the legal mandate also  <br>

needs to be worked through. What was significant about the meeting in Sharm-el-Sheikh yesterday, and the one in Israel, was the commitment of the international community to make a difference on that issue. That is definitely a step change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="90119-0007.htm_para14"><a name="0901194000271">On the humanitarian situation, it is very important to distinguish between immediate relief&#151;the matter of life and death, in some cases, in respect of medical supplies now&#151;and the reconstruction that will have to take place in due course. The right hon. Gentleman asked whether I was confident that there was enough; one can never be confident that there is enough, not least in circumstances such as these. Although I understand that the number of lorries going through the crossings has increased over the past day or two&#151;I hoped to have the exact figure when I came to the House, but it had not arrived by the time I left for here&#151;it would be foolish to say that I was confident that the organisation and the amount will meet the need. That is because the need is huge and, as was pointed out last week, given that journalists have not been to the area, the extent of the need is only now being sketched out. A joint EU-UN mission&#151;a so-called &#147;needs assessment mission&#148;&#151;will go in precisely to get to the bottom of the extent of the need. I think that to pronounce confidence now would be complacent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="90119-0007.htm_para15"><a name="0901194000272">On the role of the European border assistance mission, the 2005 agreement provides the basis for it and the personnel are in place and waiting, but, of course, very difficult political issues are associated with it. It was an agreement between the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Government, and both insist that they should be the partners of the EU force at any crossings. There are seven crossings in total&#151;one of them into Egypt&#151;and we need to ensure that the management arrangements are appropriate for all of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="90119-0007.htm_para16"><a name="0901194000273">Finally, on the wider comprehensive peace that is sought, one of the casualties of this crisis has, of course, been the Israel-Syria talks, which were broken off at its beginning. The comprehensive peace to which we are committed, as I believe are the right hon. Gentleman and his party, does indeed require compromises, but it also requires a process. That process will have to be akin more to the Madrid process of the early 1990s than to the Annapolis process of the past year&#151;the key difference being the breadth of the Madrid process compared with the relatively narrow focus of the Annapolis process, however worthy and important it has been.</p>

 Unilateralism is not enough. Does the Foreign Secretary agree that however welcome these temporary ceasefires, they do not necessarily mean that there will be a long-term solution? Will he urgently discuss with his colleagues in the Security Council the implications of the rejection of its resolution 1860 by both Israel and Hamas 10 days ago? Will he try to ensure that if we do get a longer-term ceasefire, it is on a permanent basis? Does he not think that it is necessary to engage with Hamas to secure that?</p>

 I admire my hon. Friend&#146;s ingenuity in asking those questions. Of course, he is right to say that the focus must be on making a permanent peace. That is certainly what we are focused on, in terms of not only the immediate issues relating to what remains a dangerously fragile ceasefire, but the longer-term issues. We are, of course, in touch with all our Security Council counterparts; a discussion took place last week and there will doubtless be further discussions in future. We will have to think through precisely the sort of discussion that he describes, given that our immediate focus is on the situation on the ground, but I hear what he has had to say.</p>

 Does the Foreign Secretary share my concern that Hamas, unlike the Israelis, has committed itself only to a six-day ceasefire and has refused to contemplate a permanent ceasefire? Does he agree that if the Hamas group resumes hostilities unilaterally, it will not only show its indifference to the welfare of the Palestinians, but bear the prime responsibility for any further hostilities that follow such an action?</p>

 As I said in my statement, we want Hamas to put a definitive end to its rocket attacks, and a six-day ceasefire does not constitute the definitive end that we seek. It is vital that over the next few days those with influence on Hamas should explain the gravity of the situation facing the Palestinian people and put humanitarian need before internal political divisions. In that context, I spoke to the Syrian Foreign Minister yesterday and expressed the very strong view that I hoped that he would use his influence to ensure that Hamas understood its responsibilities.</p>

At the moment, that engagement is about the ceasefire&#151;and rightly so, because the ceasefire must be kept in place. That is the right way forward.

has been used. However, as with all conflicts, we will take into account the recent conflict and the conduct and methods of the Israeli defence force in that conflict in the assessment of future export licences. To put it on record again, as I did last week, the policy is absolutely clear: where there is a clear risk of shipments of exports being used either for internal repression or for external aggression the export licence is not granted.

 Getting fresh water into Gaza and dealing with the sewage problems must be a priority, and should be considered as one.

Although he is absolutely right in saying that UNRWA will lead on the emergency services needed in Gaza, it will not necessarily lead on reconstruction, so given the British Government&#146;s recent experience in both Afghanistan and Iraq, will he state today that Britain will take the lead and convene a conference in London to plan the long-term reconstruction of Gaza?</p>

 When I was in the Gaza strip on 14 April last year, the first thing that we came across, just inside the Erez crossing, was a large lagoon of sewage, in which a five-year-old boy had already died. Raw sewage was pouring into the sea 24/7, and there were piles of rotting rubbish lying in all the streets because the refuse vehicles could not function. Does my right hon.

The emphasis that I have placed on the issue, by talking about not just food and fuel but emergency sanitation equipment, speaks directly to the point that he makes about the sewerage system, or lack of it.

 First, may I remind the Foreign Secretary that there was a ceasefire before, and the consequence was that Israel tightened and tightened the siege, then it started the bombing in early November that broke the ceasefire? Secondly, there is no peace process, because Israel keeps breaking the Geneva convention, building more settlements and the wall, and the roads are subject to closure. We will not achieve progress without action on Israel, requiring it to comply with international law. We need action in the Security Council to set up a war crimes tribunal&#151;that is how we can get action.

 I said last week in this House that, although the immediate trigger for the crisis was the upsurge in rocket attacks after 19 December, as the right hon. Lady rightly says, in the preceding six months there was a ceasefire only in name, because there were rocket attacks, a tightening of the blockade, a further closing of the crossings and a deterioration in the humanitarian situation. I do not quite subscribe to the sequence that she put on those three facts, because I think that they all happened at the same time: there were further attacks, a further tightening of the blockade and a further deterioration of the humanitarian situation. It is obviously vital not just that the Security Council remain engaged&#151;that is why I was in New York last week, and why we continue to believe that the Security Council has an important role to play. It is also why I emphasised the Madrid model&#151;it is not the exact model for the future, but it engaged the international community fundamentally in those issues. It is important, too, that every signatory to any international convention adhere to its requirements and to international humanitarian law in general.</p>

To date, we have made good progress. Since 1997, crime is down by nearly 40 per cent.; burglary and car crime has more than halved; we have invested more than &#163;1 billion to establish neighbourhood policing across England and Wales; there are almost 14,500 more officers in the police force, alongside police community support officers and backed by more civilian staff and a major increase in funding; and the likelihood of being a victim of crime is now lower than at any time in more than 25 years.</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes an important point about a project in which he has taken a personal interest. I am sure that he will be interested to know that through the tackling knives action programme, the project is being extended into the 10 areas that we are working with. The link between accident and emergency departments and the local police is being extended so that they can work together to tackle, and reduce, the amount of knife crime. We are determined to build on that solid foundation, and the measures in the Bill will enable us to do that by increasing the effectiveness of the police and by enhancing local accountability in order to build even greater public confidence in the police force. Those measures will underpin our ability to tackle thugs and criminals at local, national and international level, and reinforce our powers to protect some of the most vulnerable in our society.</p>

 In the past, attempts have been made to engage the community through the use of neighbourhood panels, but sometimes the police reject the involvement of local residents associations. I have one such very strong association in my area, Spring Park residents association, which has been denied representation on that panel. Would the new legislation make it easier for strong residents associations to be represented on those important neighbourhood panels, which, in turn, support the police?</p>

 I obviously do not know the details of the circumstances that the hon.

 The hon. Gentleman is exactly right. In the tiered approach that we propose for tackling under-age drinking, we have made more specific provision that parents should be involved, and at an early stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="90119-0009.htm_para6"><a name="09011923000018">To return to police reform, even with the great strides that we have made there is still scope to do more. The policing Green Paper set out a radical programme of reform designed to make the police service more efficient, visible and accountable to the public whom it serves. We are already seeing the benefits of those changes. For example, all 43 police forces in England and Wales signed up to the policing pledge, setting out the minimum standards that people can expect from their police service. It represents a major milestone in engaging communities and helping local people to set the right policing priorities for their area. Monthly meetings and local crime maps are already helping local people to influence local action, which is a crucial step in generating greater confidence across communities and creating a more responsive police service.</p>

 I am sorry to interrupt the Home Secretary&#146;s paean of self-congratulatory humbug. Perhaps she would like to explain to my constituents why, since 2004, she and her predecessors have consistently failed properly to fund local police authorities such as Cambridgeshire to deal with the impact of EU migration, which has had a massive and demonstrable impact on crime and policing in our area. Despite promises from the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing, who is sitting next to her, we are still not properly funded and we are still in the bottom five funded authorities in the country.</p>

 Some of the congratulations that I offered were to the police themselves. As the hon.

Opposition Members would be better off charging their Front Benchers with ensuring that they continue even our level of support for police authorities such as Cambridgeshire before they start pleading for more.</p>

 What steps is the Home Secretary taking to ensure that her Department passes on the good practice of some police authorities, such as what the Select Committee on Home Affairs saw on a visit to Staffordshire? The authority there had reduced greatly the amount of paperwork involved in processing particular crimes. It is important to pass that good practice on to other police authorities and, even though all the authorities are different, to try to get some standardisation of good practice in the police force.</p>

 I am sure that my right hon. Friend will therefore be pleased to know that I said just before Christmas that the sort of scheme that he saw in Staffordshire should be available throughout the country, in the same way that good practice in the use of hand-held computer devices and the scrapping of the stop and account form are now available across the country. That is driving good practice and efficiency among police forces. Of course, we have also stripped away national crime targets for the police, leaving just a single target for each force to satisfy&#151;increasing public confidence. That is crucial, because reinforcing confidence in a fair criminal justice system is the key to maintaining the support and active involvement of the public in our fight against crime and disorder.</p>

In that context, will she ensure that the police use new technologies to engage with communities as well as evening meetings? Mums do not do evening meetings, so we need to use BlackBerries, as Bedfordshire police does, and online consultations to ensure that the public really can engage. How would the Opposition&#146;s proposal to cut 30 police from the Bedfordshire constabulary help with all that?</p>

 My hon. Friend has a very good record of challenging both the Government and the police force to use new technology in the most effective way possible. If police forces are to drive up confidence in the way in which we now expect, they will need to find new ways to communicate and engage with the public, as she identifies. I agree that not only confidence in the police force but the confidence of the police force would be reduced if cuts to police numbers such as those proposed by the Opposition were inflicted on police forces across the country.</p>

I am pleased that the Bill will reinforce their ability to develop talent from every background by strengthening the independence and status of the Senior Appointments Panel for chief officers. It is clear that accountability is crucial in building the public's trust and confidence. That is why we propose to place a new duty on police authorities to have regard to the public&#146;s views in the exercise of all their functions. We are also giving a strengthened inspectorate the power to assess how well the public's views are being reflected during the new inspections of police authorities.</p>

However, events late last year convinced me that there are still legitimate questions about how to achieve that without the risk of politicising the police. It is vital to protect the police&#146;s operational independence, as I have made abundantly clear to the House on many occasions. We remain convinced of the merits of direct election as part of a responsive and fully accountable police service, but in the light of last year's events, and having listened closely to all the views on the issue, I believe that it is right to do more work in this area before pressing ahead. In the meantime, with the proposed changes to the role of the inspectorate and the measures that we have taken since the policing Green Paper, I believe that we have a robust system in place that we can build on for the future.</p>

The seizure of criminal assets is one of our most powerful tools in fighting crime, and it delivers many other benefits as well. It deprives criminals of capital, reduces the incentives for criminal activity, and eases the harm caused by crime. Just as importantly, it promotes confidence in the criminal justice system and lets the public see that the criminals are not getting away with their crimes. To date, more than &#163;500 million worth of assets have been recovered since the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 came into force in 2003, including &#163;136 million in 2007-08 alone. That is a good achievement, but, as I said when we launched our anti-drugs strategy last year, we want to do more. That is why the Bill includes new powers to seize goods on arrest, which will be particularly useful in ensuring that criminals cannot get rid of their assets before the courts can get to them. At the same time, it will send a powerful message to criminals that they will not be able to get away with their crimes and flaunt their illegally gained wealth.</p>

This strengthened the UK&#146;s ability to catch the criminals who exploit victims of trafficking, and underlined the Government&#146;s long-term commitment to tackle this horrific crime. In too many cases, the trafficking is directly linked to the demand for prostitution in this country. It has been clear to me for some time that tackling the demand side of the equation is one of the best ways we have of fighting back against the misery of prostitution and human exploitation.</p>

 I welcome the fact that the Government signed and ratified the convention on trafficking, which provides support for women identified as trafficked.

 No, I do not believe that focusing and turning the legal spotlight on to men who choose to pay to have sex with women who have been exploited and have made no free choice will drive prostitution underground. In fact, I think that policy will protect women and put an onus on those whose demand actually creates the exploitation in the first place&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>However, I also recognise that such measures have to be part of a co-ordinated approach that not only tackles the demand, but provides a way out for those who want to escape the misery of prostitution.<i> </i>For that reason, the Bill also introduces a new rehabilitation order for prostitutes convicted of loitering or soliciting as an alternative to a fine.<i> </i>In conjunction with other agencies, that will help us shift away from a system that punishes women towards a more supportive framework that helps people who end up in prostitution.</p>

 I am opposed to exploitation, whether it stems from trafficking or elsewhere.

We are proposing the new measures in order to take action against that. I know that the hon. Gentleman has an important and good record on campaigning against trafficking. I think that the provisions will help us to identify and limit it, because without the demand for the prostitution, often fed by trafficking, we have more chance of tackling the actual trafficking itself, to which I know the hon.

 I thank my right hon. Friend for giving way. Does she agree that what she proposes is further to criminalise sex workers unless they participate in compulsory rehabilitation on pain of imprisonment. What evidence is there that such compulsory rehabilitation actually works? Should we not concentrate on providing excellent programmes that people who want to leave prostitution can engage in? Furthermore, how does criminalising men help keep sex workers safe? Why does the Home Secretary not listen to the evidence put forward by the Safety First coalition&#151;a wide umbrella of organisations campaigning to keep sex workers safe. It was set up after the terrible murders in Ipswich, so why does she not listen to its evidence on these issues?</p>

 On the first point, as my hon. Friend will see if she looks at how the provisions on rehabilitation orders are drafted, it is obvious that they are put forward as an alternative to a fine or other sentence when a woman has been brought before the courts. It is an alternative to criminalising, not further criminalising women in the way my hon. Friend suggests. On the second point, we listened to many different people who represented or purported to represent sex workers and others affected by prostitution during the tackling demand review. There is no consensus about the right way forward, but I am pretty clear that without a demand for prostitution, particularly the sort of prostitution that involves exploited or trafficked women, there would be less of it. That, I think, is what all of us across the House want to see.</p>

Whether it is kerb crawlers or lap-dancing clubs, we all need to listen and respond on behalf of the law-abiding majority. We need communities to be fully engaged and feel that their views are being heard, so that they can have real confidence in the criminal justice system. In the case of lap-dancing clubs, I think we need to do more to make sure that happens. The number of lap-dancing clubs in towns and cities across the UK has doubled since 2004 and in many areas the public are fed up with having no say in where these clubs open. That is why I propose to reclassify lap-dancing clubs as sex encounter venues to give local people a far louder voice in determining whether and where those clubs can be set up.</p>

The Bill reforms the provisions on foreign travel orders, increasing their duration and automatically removing passports from individuals subject to a blanket foreign travel order.

We need to do all we can to ensure that exploitation does not take place, and to give local communities the right to say when or where something should or should not happen.</p>

A million people were victims of alcohol-related violence last year, with accident and emergency admissions related to alcohol up by a quarter since 2004. No one can deny the evidence from the police, local authorities and hospitals that the Government&#146;s reckless policy of allowing 24-hour drinking has inflicted misery on innocent law-abiding citizens across Britain, not least the professionals who work in front-line services.</p>

 I share the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern, and I look forward to reading his report. He will not be surprised to learn that I have not yet had time to do so. My colleagues, including the shadow Chancellor, have argued for legislative measures to stop sales of under-priced alcohol. I have seen one or two examples which I found positively horrifying. In Liverpool, for example, I encountered a firm that would actually deliver alcohol to a park.

here is not necessarily the amounts of alcohol being drunk, worrying though those are, but the way in which those amounts are being drunk, in that there is a mentality among people in this country, and in particular among too many young people, that to enjoy themselves they have to binge-drink and get absolutely plastered in the process, in contrast to some continental countries where the population actually drink more per head, but people drink more responsibly? Does my hon. Friend also agree that no amount of legislation&#151;of excessive legislation&#151;will necessarily affect that British mentality, and that what we need is a change in people&#146;s thinking and in how young people, in particular, are educated to live and grow up with alcohol, rather than to abuse it?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point, and it is a sign of the failure of this Government&#146;s policies that so little progress has been made over so many years despite so much legislation being brought on to the statute book. It is a sign that the Government must focus not simply on passing Bills through this House, but on getting the job done out there, and must recognise that often when they micro-manage&#151;or interfere or misjudge their powers&#151;matters are made even worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="90119-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09011926000025">In addition, clause 30 seeks to give the police enhanced powers to give young people a direction to leave an area where there is a risk of an alcohol-related disturbance. It will now extend to children over 10, rather than those over 16. This raises serious issues to do with children being placed at risk by being made to leave an area with which they are familiar when one would have expected the police to take a younger child home or into protective custody if there was a serious enough problem to move them out of the area in the first place. We will wish to look at this in detail. Do we really want the police to be moving on 10-year-olds, rather than addressing the problem and getting them home to their families? We will want to hear more about the Government&#146;s thinking on this in debate in Committee, and we will need a bit of persuading that the approach in this part of the Bill is the right one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="90119-0011.htm_para13"><a name="09011926000026">Then we have the now annual exhortation by the Home Secretary to seize the assets of the Mr. Bigs of the criminal underworld. The intention is laudable, but it does not always work, as the Home Secretary knows. In its short life, the Assets Recovery Agency recovered a mere one third of its running costs in criminal assets, and the record of the Serious Organised Crime Agency has been little better; it has missed most of its targets. Yet again, this Government are proposing to introduce yet more law, which can never compensate for basic failures of law enforcement. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that some of this law has a draconian quality that must be questionable. The distinction between restraint of assets on arrest and seizure for confiscation after conviction is being blurred, and the level of judicial oversight reduced. It is unclear why this is being done, and it raises serious issues of fairness and interference with property rights without due process of law.</p>

that it would be a far better idea, and that this should have been in the Bill, that when traffickers&#146; ill-gotten gains are taken away from them, that money should go to the victims? At present, the National Criminal Justice Board gives money, but it is Treasury money, so victims are not getting it from the traffickers.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his congratulations. I understand exactly where he is coming from, but the trouble is that under this Government the Treasury has so little cash that I suspect that persuading it to deal with this matter very differently may be a struggle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="90119-0011.htm_para14"><a name="09011926000029">Nowhere in the Government&#146;s proposals is the evidence of failure more striking than in their approach to tackling human trafficking. That is a mere fig leaf for action. No one in this House should be under any illusion as to the scale of the barbaric trade pouring into Britain. Police upper estimates of the number of vulnerable women and girls trafficked into Britain for sexual exploitation have soared in recent years, from 4,000 to 18,000. The scale of the growth in this problem dwarfs the Government&#146;s efforts to contain it, yet instead of freeing up more police to tackle human trafficking, they are downsizing the specialist unit at the Met, and instead of their driving prosecutions of those profiting from this modern form of slavery, convictions have slumped by two thirds since 2006. That is the reality behind the Government&#146;s rhetoric.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="90119-0011.htm_para15"><a name="09011926000030">The Home Secretary&#146;s answer is a swathe of new criminal offences aimed at reducing the demand for prostitution. Should we take it from this change of focus, and from the failure to enforce existing laws against those who exploit vulnerable women, that the Home Secretary has now just given up trying to prosecute the criminal gangs involved? Does the Home Secretary agree with the Leader of the House that there is no evidence of any increase in people paying for sex?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="90119-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09011926000031">We will scrutinise the new strict liability offences closely and carefully to ensure that they do not create scope for abuse or injustice. The much greater risk, however, is that they will lie dormant on the statute book, along with so much of this Government&#146;s legislation produced over the last 11 years, because, as Commander Allan Gibson of the Metropolitan police&#146;s human trafficking unit has made very clear, these proposals will be &#147;very difficult to enforce&#148;.</p>

 I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend on taking up his new post. On clause 13, does he not agree that it is very silly indeed to have a measure whereby a man commits an offence if he uses the services of a prostitute whose activities are controlled in any way, notwithstanding the fact that first, the man did not know, secondly, he had no reason to know and thirdly, upon inquiry he was told that there was no such control? What is the man expected to do? There is no defence; is that not bad law?</p>

However, the most salient omission consists of the proposals for directly elected crime and policing representatives set out in the Green Paper published last July.

Both the shadow Home Secretary and the Home Secretary spoke passionately about their desire to ensure that the Government did more to control the amount of alcohol that is finding its way into our city centres and is directly related to crimes being committed in them; 45 per cent of crimes of violence in this country are alcohol-related. Alcohol is 69 per cent. more affordable than it was 15 years ago and it cost the criminal justice system &#163;1.5 billion last year, so it is important that we get to grips with this country&#146;s readily available supply of alcohol. We do not want to stop people drinking. I have to declare my interest: I do not drink alcohol. However, I know that other Members of this House occasionally do. I make no attempt to stop people drinking, and neither do members of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, who produced a unanimous report on this issue. We are talking about drinking in moderation and for social reasons, rather than drinking that results in what we sadly see in many of our towns and city centres: complete disorder, which occupies so much of the time of our excellent police force.</p>

her, as I have done in the past and shall continue to do, on the issue of the floor price of alcohol in supermarkets. The evidence given to the Committee&#146;s inquiry into policing clearly showed that the readily available alcohol in supermarkets is resulting in young people, in particular, having access to alcohol. This alcohol is so cheap; the latest figures&#151;this is not an advert for ASDA&#151;show that ASDA&#146;s Smartprice beer is being offered at 52p a litre, whereas one can buy Evian water there for 93.3p a litre. It is wrong that alcohol should be cheaper than water.</p>

Our Government, right at the last moment, withdrew their proposals for elected members of police committees, and I understood perfectly well why they did so. There was a risk of extremist minority groups taking over police committees on the basis of single-issue activities, and that would have destabilised the way in which the committees operate. The Government were right not to proceed with those proposals, but it is important that members of the public are made more aware of what police committees do. I can name a number of members of my local police committees, but sadly the only ones who I can recall are those who are elected representatives themselves&#151;councillors nominated from the various political groups. It is important that members of local police committees go out to the local communities, hold meetings and engage with the public, so that people understand exactly what they do. I say that because although those bodies control budgets of several million pounds, people still do not know precisely what they do.</p>

I understand why the Government have decided to take this course of action on sex offences. The Select Committee has just concluded its inquiry into the very serious problem of human trafficking. In this House today there is a world authority on the issues associated with human trafficking; we are very lucky to have the expertise of the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen), who has campaigned on these issues for many years. I am not convinced that the best course of action is to prosecute in the proposed way men who go into situations where they wish to buy sex from prostitutes; such men are going to be expected to ask whether the woman concerned has been trafficked, and even if they get an incorrect answer, as is highly likely, given the situation that these poor women are in, they will then be prosecuted.</p>

I know that she is keen, at all times, to consult them on issues that affect them, but they were not consulted on this issue and they feel that this proposal is not enforceable. The sentiment is right. The Home Secretary feels that she needs to do something and she is right to try to tackle the menace of human trafficking, but it is not possible to do so in the way she proposes, because too many technical difficulties are involved.</p>

The Government should be saying unequivocally that human trafficking is wrong and that the exploitation of women in particular is wrong. As the Home Secretary correctly said, we should be seeking a package of measures.

If it is the existing police authorities who will do so, then we are merely back to the position as it was before 2002. The duty that the Bill will introduce is negligible in its difference from the duty in the Police Act 1996. In short, we are now back to the police governance arrangements as they were when the Home Office decided that they did not work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="90119-0012.htm_para13"><a name="09011926000068">Let me remind the House that those arrangements did not work in terms of efficiency because there had been a long-term decline in detection rates for recorded crime, even though detection is the most crucial part of an effective deterrent against crime. That is important. One could introduce sharia law in this country and it would have no effect on crime whatsoever if the chances of getting caught remained extremely low. On a broad definition of crime, including business crime, only one in 100 crimes ends with a conviction in court&#151;99 do not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="90119-0012.htm_para14"><a name="09011926000069">National targets are a blunt instrument with many unexpected and counter-productive effects, but they have introduced some new focus on efficiency, effectiveness and outcomes. What will now take their place? The answer in the Green Paper was right: local accountability. Local accountability involves two crucial elements that are now lacking. The first would be a proper local debate about priorities, which would allow local police forces to use their police authority as a genuine sounding board on popular opinion. It would also allow the abandonment of targets that were inevitably nonsense in some parts of the country, such as targets for cuts in the types of crime that were already negligible in some force areas. The second crucial element would be a local drive to greater efficiency. The fact that police authorities should be accountable to voters would drive police forces to compare their own working methods with best practice and to improve. That matters because the variations in police performance are just as significant as the common factors. If the average detection rate were improved so that it came closer to that of the top 10 per cent. of forces in this country, nearly 400,000 more crimes would be detected each year. That would be a real deterrent, as we know from the Home Office&#146;s research against crime.</p>

accountability that we Liberal Democrats are talking about, it is extremely important that there should be an established, understood formula for funding that takes into account need across the country and that is not subject to the sort of vagaries that we have sadly seen as both the Treasury and the Home Office have chopped and changed on such issues as police community support officers and the 101 number.</p>

I welcome the Home Secretary&#146;s implication earlier that she has not entirely given up on that vision, but I hope that it is not just a smokescreen for retreat, as was the case with the provisions in the Counter-Terrorism Bill, when although she said that she was not changing her mind the reality was that the policy had changed fundamentally. I do not know what the Government&#146;s answer in this Bill actually is. It cannot be Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary, because however admirable its work is, it has not managed to reduce the disparities, despite many long years of trying; nor, for the same reasons, can it be the National Police Improvement Agency. We are left with a Polo policing reform&#151;a policy with a hole in the middle. We are left with a vacuum, a void and intellectual vacuity.</p>

 I note the argument the hon. Gentleman is making and I wonder whether he could elucidate how far his party would take the localism policy. For example, do he and his party want the 43 police forces in England and Wales to be funded wholly by a local income tax? I think that that used to be his party&#146;s policy. What proportion of funds should be raised locally? Can he say a little more about the funding of the police in his conception?</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman may know, local funding for the police has been steadily increasing as the amount of central Government grant is cut. There has to be an adequate amount of central Government grant to ensure that different needs are met across the country. That is a key matter and he is right to draw attention to it. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><i> </i>The answer to the question clearly is to make sure that there is a settled system, that each police authority is happy with the outcome and that there are no changes from year to year. Local funding would then pick up the remainder. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that our policy is to move towards local income tax, which would be preferable to the precept on council tax.</p>

Perhaps the Home Secretary realised that her plans for elected police authorities were fatally flawed. Such bodies would have been deeply unrepresentative and would have encouraged confrontational politics, because for the first time since 1997 the Government planned a new body elected under the first-past-the-post system. The Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, the Greater London assembly, the London Mayor and the European Parliament all use proportional or preference systems. In a force area, each borough that was a crime and disorder reduction partnership would elect one person as if it was a Westminster constituency.</p>

In force areas with substantial ethnic minorities, such as London, Greater Manchester, Liverpool, West Yorkshire and the West Midlands, either the Green Paper system or, even worse, the Tory system of single elected commissioners for each force area would provide substantial parts of the population with little or no representation. We know that first past the post is biased against women and ethnic minorities, because the parties want to put up white, middle-class men in suits who are held to alienate the fewest voters&#151;just look at us in the Chamber.

There are sensible provisions for collaboration between police forces and authorities, but we are not happy that the Home Secretary has the power to give directions from the centre in that matter. Nor are we happy that there is no duty to collaborate where it would be beneficial to the local communities involved.

A recent survey found that 40 per cent. of retail outlets were selling to under-age drinkers and that only 854 prosecutions were brought last year. Frankly, that is a drop in the ocean, by comparison with the many thousands of retail outlets across the country. At some stage, it will surely be revealed to the Home Office and its Ministers that enforcement matters more than new clauses from the parliamentary draftsman&#151;a point with which I hope the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) agrees, because he made it at the beginning of the debate. Paper powers matter less than police action.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman comes up against the very problem that he delineated before: the balance between localism and centralism. On the one hand, as he said in the early part of his speech, he wants more localism, more local control and so on; on the other hand, five minutes later, he decries the fact that no alcohol disorder zones have been put in place&#151;something that is decided by local people. He decries the lack of use of such powers, understandably, but that is what local forces have decided to do, or not to do. There is a contradiction in his position between localism and centralism, which we all have; it is very difficult.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has long experience of accusing me of contradiction in many different contexts, but I cannot conceivably concede the point to him, for the very simple reason that such powers are on the statute book and local authorities are not using them. Introducing similar powers is, frankly, as the Home Secretary conceded in an interesting little aside, intended to send a message. If she wants to send a message, she could either write it on a piece of paper and send it in the post&#151;there is still the Royal Mail, just about, while the Government allow&#151;or send out a press release.

That might have been a more intellectually coherent and honest approach. The Government are not brave enough to do that. Instead, the Home Secretary has apparently adopted the Finnish-style middle way of criminalising the client of a prostitute controlled for gain by others, whether those others be traffickers, pimps or perhaps even brothel owners. That is controversial because it is a strict liability offence, so it will not be a defence to argue that the client did their best to discover the true circumstances of the prostitute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="90119-0013.htm_para12"><a name="09011928000028">The legal consequences of that are important. First of all, no client in Finland has been convicted of sex with an exploited or trafficked woman since June 2006. That is certainly not because the trade has gone away; it is because none of the women say that they are trafficked or exploited at the time, and juries are understandably reluctant to convict if the client says that he was misled. Many experts in Finland do not support those laws, and the unintended consequence has been a booming internet prostitution industry.</p>

 I wish to speak mainly about the part of the Bill dealing with prostitution. The harm that prostitution does is mostly to the women who are for sale. Our duty as parliamentarians committed to human rights is to protect them, because the murders in Ipswich of Gemma Adams, Anneli Alderton, Paula Clennell, Annette Nicholls and Tania Nicol in 2006 were not as exceptional as we would wish. Prostituted women are, according to the <i> British Medical Journal</i>, 40 times more likely than other women to die a violent death. We need to reduce the exploitation and violence involved in prostitution. The Bill helps to do that by specifically interdicting actions such as pimping and trafficking, in which someone controls another human being for gain, and by ensuring that men who pay the prostitutes who are so controlled offend if, even inadvertently, they contribute to such exploitation.</p>

 Is the hon. Lady aware that Europol believes that trafficking children for begging is an even bigger problem than the trafficking of sex workers, and can she explain why the Government have done nothing&#151;not even organise a public information campaign&#151;to discourage people from giving money to child beggars? People who give them money create exactly the same incentive for trafficking as men who visit sex workers do.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is probably not aware that a child beggar in my constituency was at the centre of one of the very few successful prosecutions in this country of trafficking for begging. I am acutely aware of the issue, and I have had excellent support from the police and the Home Office in ensuring that prosecution and future further action. We are not talking about an either/or issue. We need to protect the human rights of exploited woman and exploited children, and I hope that we do.</p>

Tonight, we are looking at a much narrower proposal. The only form of payment for sex that is outlawed in the Bill is cases in which the woman is controlled by another for gain. I do not believe that there is a single Member in the House today who would endorse payment for sex with a woman who is offering that service only because she is under the control of another person&#151;her pimp, her trafficker, or the person maintaining her addiction.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a point that I was just coming to&#151;the point that it is unfair if a man does not know the woman&#146;s status.

toughen up that offence. The reason that that is a strict liability offence is that the harm caused by under-age drinking is sufficiently great for us to expect the shopkeeper to take responsibility even when a child lies. In my view, the same is true when human beings are put up for sale by people who control their lives to profit from the sale of their bodies. In those circumstances, this should be a strict liability offence, because the human rights at issue are not those of a man who seeks to gratify himself through the use of a woman&#146;s body, but the right of a woman to decide for herself to what use her body should be put.</p>

I feared that their alternative would fail, because it echoes too closely the approach of Finland which, until recently, had not mounted any prosecutions. Now, however, Finland is beginning to use its law. I have been to countries such as Sweden and the Netherlands to look at their approach. I have spoken to prostitute women and police in both countries, I have talked to politicians and support workers in New Zealand and Australia, and I have concluded that the legalisation of prostitution has, in every case, increased, rather than reduced, exploitation.</p>

Norway has recently followed Sweden&#146;s lead. Those measures to tackle demand are effective in reducing the number of trafficked women in Sweden, which is why Norway has followed its example.

She has, since 1824, been labelled a common prostitute, and risked regular fines or probation for soliciting. Generally, those fines are paid by her servicing more men. The Bill seeks to shift the burden: it drops the label, &#147;common prostitute&#148;, ends fines and substitutes meetings as the sentence for soliciting, which is required to be persistent. The purpose of those provisions is to address the causes of the street prostitution and to find ways of addressing them in the future. It is therefore  <br>

However, as in all sentences, the courts have a power to issue a warrant for those who do not comply with court orders, and if a woman fails to answer a warrant, the police can detain her to ensure that she attends court. That happens to prostituted women who fail to adhere to probation orders under the present offence, so the Bill provides no greater power of detention than exists at present. It is right to ensure that the burden of enforcement lands on those who have most control and choice in their actions. Different groups of people are involved, including those who pay for sex and those who control vulnerable women, often coercing or conning them into prostitution and making large sums from their work. Often, those people are not included within the ambit of the current law. The people who live in communities affected by prostitution have no choice about whether they take their children to school past condoms and drug litter. Until now, prostituted women have borne the brunt of law enforcement in a manner that is counter-productive, especially as powerful studies consistently show that most prostituted women start to work as prostitutes when they are children. They were groomed to work as prostitutes under the age of 16, they want to leave prostitution, they are likely to be addicted to class A drugs, and they overwhelmingly demonstrate symptoms comparable to those for post-traumatic stress disorder.

It is all too easy for such a person to fall under the influence of a dominant male, who exploits that vulnerability for financial gain. Exploitation of prostitution for financial gain is the broad mischief at which clause 13 is aimed, whether or not it involves the intimidation or trafficking of the prostitute or prostitutes concerned. I urge the Home Secretary to keep that offence sufficiently broad to protect all women, not just those who are trafficked from overseas but those who are terrorised by their pimps and controllers.</p>

I am struck that opposition to the measure is going along the lines of &#147;It&#146;s too hard to enforce&#148;, and is coming precisely from those quarters who, when I offered a simple-to-enforce solution in which all purchases of sexual services would be outlawed, made equally powerful arguments that that was not the way to go. Let us be clear: those who oppose the measure have exposed themselves as people who are more concerned about the right of men to purchase women&#146;s bodies than about protecting those women from the exploitation inherent in every single occasion of purchasing and of prostitution.</p>

 Yes, it is certainly an experience. No one can doubt her passion, her conviction and her sincerity. However, they may question the prudence of the approach that she has expressed so strongly and strenuously this evening.</p>

I shall describe it, because I want to explain why clause 13 is difficult and problematic to enforce. As one enters the parlour, one sees a cashier, to whom one pays cash for the use of the sauna premises. Beyond the cashier was a large room with deck chairs dotted around it. At one end, some women&#151;appropriately dressed&#151;were sitting in the chairs, and there were a number of punters. Most in the room were of Asian origin, and as far as I could find out from the conversations that I tried to have with them, few of the women or punters spoke English.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="90119-0014.htm_para12"><a name="09011928000064">If clause 13 was in place, how would the police have proceeded? As it was, the police questioned the women; two who were thought to have been trafficked were taken to the station. Would the women have been better protected, and if so how, if clause 13 had been in operation? The police would first have to have asked the men whether they were paying for sex. If the men had understood the question, they would probably have answered that they were paying for the sauna. The question for the women would have been, &#147;Are you controlled?&#148; I imagine a lengthy discussion facilitated by interpreters who would be funded by the taxpayer, and it would be difficult to discover whether any of the women had been trafficked. That shows how difficult or impossible it would be for the police to enforce the provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="90119-0014.htm_para13"><a name="09011928000065">The better approach is through specific police raids, such as Operations Pentameter 1 and 2. Pentameter 2 involved visits to 822 premises; 157 were massage parlours and saunas, and 558 were residential properties. What was found? Some 167 victims of human trafficking were identified. They had not been driven underground. They were not asked questions that would incriminate  <br>

anybody, but they were found to have been trafficked. Some 528 criminals were arrested and 6,400 police intelligence reports were gathered. More than &#163;500,000 in cash was recovered; it should have been given to the victims of trafficking, but it was not. Some 13 of the victims were children, and the youngest was just 14. If clause 13 replaces the Pentameter operations, the victims of trafficking will not be found, because most are found during police raids; otherwise, they are found because the punters report them to the police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="90119-0014.htm_para14"><a name="09011928000066">I shall give an example. Two weeks before Christmas in my constituency&#151;in Paignton, just a mile outside south Devon&#151;a girl was found to have been trafficked from the Czech Republic. She had thought that she was going to a gymnasium, but ended up in a brothel. She escaped into a neighbouring club, where somebody called the police. She was helped back to the Czech Republic, and prosecutions are pending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="90119-0014.htm_para15"><a name="09011928000069">The police tried to find the punters by advertising in the local newspapers. Six punters prepared to give evidence came forward. They would not have come forward if it had been a criminal offence for them to have had sex with that girl. That is an important point, on which I will not expand.</p>

In order to obtain a conviction evidence will have to be gathered and it seems fairly essential that the prostitute herself would be required to make a statement. This is likely to incriminate herself and also affect her livelihood. The vast majority of prostitutes, it could be argued, are involved in some sort of control; whether this is a pimp or a manager, a receptionist or owner of a brothel.&#148;</p>

If so, it is nonsense. Prostitution has been here as long as the world has, and unlike King Canute we cannot stop the sea, whether we pass that clause or not. The association goes on:</p>

The Government could have closed the existing loopholes in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 by making an offence of trafficking babies, infants and children, who cannot speak for themselves. The 2004 legislation needs strengthening. The Bill&#146;s provisions on the proceeds of crime and recovery of expenses should have enabled the proceeds from traffickers to fund support programmes for the trafficked victims; at the moment the taxpayer, through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, picks up the tab.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90119-0014.htm_para21"><a name="09011928000076">Unfortunately, clause 13 is a bold and radical provision that has not been thought through well enough. It is a start, but it will not work as we might wish. We all wish to see less human trafficking, which is now the third largest criminal industry after arms dealing and drug trafficking. But it will not be addressed until we recognise that it is born of poverty and economic desperation. Most victims are desperately seeking a new life and are tricked into being trafficked.</p>

I concur absolutely with the hon. Gentleman. Does he agree that the allegation from the hon.

We recognise that prostitution in western societies will not be obliterated and that the key thing is harm reduction. Driving prostitution further away from the police would mean that vulnerable people would be driven further away from the police and support services.

 I agree. I believe that the punter&#146;s role is crucial to finding trafficked victims. If we make the punter a criminal, we will not get the information and we will find that trafficked women will be harder and harder to find. If the police cannot get to trafficked women through raids because the brothels are not there, the whole thing will be impossible to manage. That is why, in the end, I oppose clause 13, although I understand the sentiments that have been expressed.</p>

However, we would still benefit from a trafficking rapporteur, a position that exists in Holland, from far better intelligence links with other European police forces and from better trained border and immigration officials. Human trafficking is the new slavery. The old slavery never disappeared; we should realise that the scale of new slavery continues to grow, with more people trafficked each year than ever were involved in the old slave trade 200 years ago. I give way to the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart).</p>

 At last! I am sorry, but I am slightly disconcerted. The hon. Gentleman takes a close interest in trafficking. Does he accept that when I was a Home Office Minister, I did not make a particular offence of having sex with a trafficked woman because I had been persuaded that punters provided evidence about the trafficking of women? Since then, however, I have asked police in almost every force how many trafficked women they have found because of reports from punters. I have not been able to find any compelling reports that trafficked women have been rescued as a result of a punter&#146;s report to the police.</p>

 I have given the example of what happened in Paignton just before Christmas when the punters came forward to give evidence. I am sure that we could build on that if the arrangements were different and punters were not seen as criminals.</p>

The human trafficking centre in Sheffield, which was set up by this Government&#151;I pay tribute to them for that&#151;spends nearly &#163;2 million a year, but we ain&#146;t got the numbers. We do not know how many people are involved. It is pure guesswork and sensationalism when people talk about 4,000 to 6,000&#151;the figure is probably in the hundreds, not the thousands. Whether it is hundreds or thousands, it is still too many, but the question is how to deal with those cases, which involve the poorest girls from the poorest countries of the world who have been duped and tricked.</p>

The best way is the approach taken by the police through Pentameter 1 and Pentameter 2, operations which have been extremely successful. Every police force in Britain has joined with other forces to outlaw human trafficking, but we cannot get the traffickers, and we should be concentrating on finding them. We have rightly tended to concentrate on the victims&#151;the girls&#151;and now on the punters, but we should be doing far more about the traffickers by making the situation much more penal and difficult for them to operate in. It is no good just doing it in Britain&#151;it must be a European initiative whereby all the countries join forces. Britain and Holland, among others, are way ahead on this. I pay great tribute to the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing, who is in his place, for taking that initiative forward, but I do not want him to go down the wrong track and end up making trafficking a far more difficult thing to unearth, with more women being pushed underground and not helped as we would like them to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para2"><a name="09011934000002">The key measure that I will talk about is clause 25. It is not without its problems, but I want to concentrate on what is good about it. As many Members will be aware, lap-dancing clubs are currently licensed solely under the Licensing Act 2003, and share the same licence as caf&#233;s and karaoke bars. Clause 25 will reform this by allowing local authorities to license lap-dancing clubs in the same way as sex shops and sex cinemas via the adoption of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982. Clause 25 creates a third category of establishment&#151;a sex encounter venue, defined as a venue where live visual performances for the purpose of sexual stimulation are provided for the direct or indirect financial gain of the operator.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para3"><a name="09011934000003">The critical aspect of the Bill, therefore, is that local authorities are now allowed to reclassify lap-dancing clubs as sex encounter venues. The Local Government Association is backing the measure, as it will allow councils to impose conditions on lap dancing venues when granting licences or to refuse licences altogether. As we know, the current categorisation has been wholly inadequate, and means that local councils could refuse a licence only by arguing that one or more of the licensing objectives under the 2003 Act would be breached. That is possible, but has proved very difficult in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para4"><a name="09011934000004">Many of us arguing for a change in legislation did so on the basis of getting the law changed so that local people would have a much greater say over whether to have a lap-dancing club in their area. The reforms contained in the Bill will allow authorities that choose to license lap-dancing clubs or similar as sex encounter venues to be able to consider important factors such as gender equality, the character of a locality and whether a lap-dancing club is appropriate for a local area. The reform will also give local authorities control over the total number of venues licensed in their area and empower local people by allowing a greater number to raise objections on wider grounds. In addition to the LGA supporting these reforms, we should note that the National Organisation of Residents Associations also supports them, as does a wide coalition of councillors and community and women&#146;s groups, including Rape Crisis England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para5"><a name="09011934000005">The Lap Dancing Association acknowledges that the current legislation does not allow community concerns to be taken into account when granting a licence but supports only voluntary measures to address the problems or argues that they can be addressed by reforming planning legislation. I would argue that that is not the answer either. As we know, the current legislation does not allow for sufficient consideration of wider community objectives such as tourism, regeneration policies or changes to the character of the area, or for the views of women who have to walk past such venues to be taken into account. The vital point is that those issues are unlikely to be addressed through the planning system, even if it were reformed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para6"><a name="09011934000006">The solution contained in the Bill&#151;to create a third type of sex establishment, a sex encounter venue, to exist alongside sex cinemas and sex shops&#151;is the only sensible way forward. As I said, the definition of a sex encounter venue is one where nude entertainment is provided before a live audience for the direct or indirect financial gain of the organiser or entertainer. The nude  <br>

<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 554</b><br>
entertainment must be of a nature that, ignoring financial gain, must reasonably be assumed to be provided solely or principally for the purpose of sexually stimulating any member of the audience. That is an important definition, because it should rule out nudity as part of a dramatic performance being covered by the reforms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para7"><a name="09011934000007">Some other issues and concerns have been raised by the Lap Dancing Association. I think that they can all be refuted quite easily, although I do not have time to go into them all now. Its first, and major, criticism of the Bill is that lap dancing is entertainment, not a sex encounter. I would argue instead, as have others, that the fundamental nature of the transaction is that a man pays a woman to take her clothes off and place her sexual organs near his face. The notion that this is not part of the commercial sex industry is not seriously sustainable. The LDA also argues that councils have sufficient powers to impose restrictions on premises&#146; licences. We know from the operation of the 2003 Act to date that those powers are impossible to operate in practice. The LDA&#146;s third major objection to changing the legislation is that the industry will go underground, but that could be an argument against regulating anything. If it does, it will be the duty of the enforcement authorities to prosecute. In any case, that is an argument for more, not less, regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para8"><a name="09011934000008">It would appear to most sensible people that bringing lap dancing into the same category as sex cinemas and sex shops and licensing them is a sensible response to the recent proliferation of such venues, enabling authorities to exercise greater control if they wish to. However, before everyone thinks that we are home and dry, I should like to outline two problems with the proposed reforms and ask the Public Bill Committee to consider them further. The first and most significant problem is that premises holding lap dancing events less often than once month will be exempt from the reforms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para9"><a name="09011934000009">As it stands, the Bill exempts from the reforms premises hosting lap dancing for less than once a month, but a large number of venues in the UK hold monthly lap-dancing nights and would fall under this category. Lap-dancing clubs and agencies cater specifically for that sub-market, which is likely to grow if the loophole remains, especially given the current economic climate of falling alcohol revenues in the licensed trade. Residents with objections to a venue hosting lap-dancing nights less than once a month in their area will still find themselves objecting under the limited grounds of the Licensing Act 2003. The second problem is that the reforms are not mandatory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para10"><a name="09011934000010">I want to thank the Minister for taking the issue seriously. He will know that my interest in this area arose because of a proposal to have a lap-dancing venue in a totally inappropriate location in Durham. Residents there are very much behind the legislation, but they stress that it is important for the loophole to be tightened so that it is not possible for those operating lap-dancing clubs to use temporary events notices as a way round the legislation. This is a serious issue and I hope that it will be addressed by amendments in Committee so that we get an important piece of legislation that gives local communities a greater voice. On the question of whether the provisions should be mandatory, we need to be careful that we do not have a postcode lottery, where some communities get more say over lap-dancing clubs in their area while others do not, because their local authority has not taken the legislation on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para12"><a name="09011934000013">On policing, we know that 14 per cent. of all officers&#146; time is spent on patrol, whereas 20 per cent. is spent on paperwork. According to the No. 10 strategy unit, it takes 11 and a half hours for a police officer to process an arrest, and the Flanagan report was rightly critical of the burden of bureaucracy facing our police forces throughout the country. One of my regrets is that the Bill singularly fails to get a grip on that problem. Why have the Government not gone further on the Flanagan report? Surely this is a wasted opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para13"><a name="09011934000014">I mentioned the senior appointments panel in an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling). Clause 2 places the panel on a statutory footing, and I ask the Minister why. Will that not create extra cost, and will it not be yet another bureaucratic body? Why, for example, will the panel members and the panel chairman be paid? Surely it will be far better to find volunteers to do such work, particularly when the budget is under so much pressure. I hope that that point will be looked at carefully in Committee. I have every confidence that my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) will get a grip on the matter, because it is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para14"><a name="09011934000015">A number of right hon. and hon. Members have spoken about the provisions in the Bill that deal with prostitution. As my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen) said a moment ago, Her Majesty&#146;s Government are right to try to protect vulnerable children from exploitation. They are right to try to tackle the exploitation and trafficking taking place. I believe that the level of trafficking is quite appalling, but I have concerns about the creation of a strict liability offence. I am concerned about the removal of intent&#151;or, as we lawyers call it, the mens rea. There is a chance of unintended consequences, and the provisions are riddled with anomalies. When there are prosecutions, they will be a lawyer&#146;s dream.</p>

Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz), and I thought the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne), who is not now in his place, made a number of excellent points on this subject. I endorse what the Bar Council recently said when it pointed out that the offence as currently drafted risks convictions that may be seen as unfair by reasonable people. Such convictions would bring the criminal law into disrepute, particularly given the stigma that would result. I urge the Minister to look at that matter again.</p>

soft on child trafficking. We do not in any way want to stand up for the people who feel they have to, in unfortunate circumstances, go and use prostitutes. We are concerned, however, about bringing in credible law that will stand the test of being put through the courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para17"><a name="09011934000018">I believe that the under-18s involved are the real victims. They need practical help and support, and should not be criminalised. I agree with the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris), who talked about harm reduction. The Bill does not abolish the power to prosecute a child over 10 for offences under section 57 of the Street Offences Act 1959, although it does amend that legislation. It is a big mistake that it does not abolish the power to prosecute those children. I have received briefings from a number of eminent organisations, including one from the YWCA, which makes it clear that</p>
<a name="90119-0015.htm_brev0"><a name="09011934000058"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The numbers of children aged under 18 who have been prosecuted under s. 57 are extremely low but the fact that the offence remains is potentially very damaging. In particular we are concerned that fear of prosecution deters young women from seeking help when they need it most.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para18"><a name="09011934000019">Similar comments were made by Barnardo&#146;s and the Standing Committee for Youth Justice. An overwhelming number of briefings and conclusions have been put to right hon. and hon. Members, saying that the Government have missed an opportunity. Furthermore, I think that the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing said in response to a debate on the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill last year that the Government would consider this matter further. I am disappointed that the Bill today does not address this point. I hope that the Minister will tell us why it does not, and give us some assurance that the Government will look at the matter again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para19"><a name="09011934000020">The provisions in the Bill dealing with extradition worry me, because again we have a wasted opportunity. The Extradition Act 2003 made various amendments to the law as it then stood and implemented in this country the European arrest warrant, which removed the requirement of dual criminality for certain offences. A UK court had always had to determine that a prima facie case had been made, but it is now enough if a European arrest warrant is issued by an EU country in respect of a listed offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para20"><a name="09011934000021">My concern is that such offences are so broad that many are meaningless. Some are described as &#147;computer-related crime&#148;, or &#147;swindling&#148;. We recently had a extradition case between Poland and Lithuania involving a young adult who was charged with piglet rustling. That type of case brings extradition into ill repute. The Government should take a long hard look at the European arrest warrant, and use the Bill as an opportunity to tighten it up and improve the situation. The Government seem to be peddling the presumption that all EU countries have the same fair and equal systems of justice. That is a dangerous assumption, because it manifestly is not the case. We are in danger of a serious backlash on the European arrest warrant unless the Bill is used to do something about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para21"><a name="09011934000022">In the case of non-EU countries, we all know that the Home Secretary, by way of Order in Council, can remove the need for specified countries to produce prima facie evidence to support a request for extradition.

similar Orders in Council have been used to bring in such procedures in the case of countries such as Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia and Turkey. That concerns me a great deal. The key point in the case of America&#151;I assume that it is the same for the other countries&#151;is that there is not genuine reciprocity. If we are to make changes to our law and put the liberties of UK citizens at risk, there has to be full reciprocity.</p>

 On reciprocity, may I draw my hon. Friend&#146;s attention again to the case of my constituent Gary McKinnon, who is subject to extradition on the basis that he hacked into American computers? In court tomorrow, he will challenge the Home Secretary&#146;s decision to extradite him. Does my hon. Friend not agree that Gary McKinnon is a prime example, and perhaps a better example than the NatWest three, of a victim of laws that do not demand proper reciprocity? He has admitted guilt and is asking to be prosecuted by the courts in this country.</p>

<p><a name="st_o340"><a name="09011934000024"><a name="90119-0015.htm_spnew5"><a name="09011934000071"><b>Mr. Bellingham:</b>
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, not least because he has given me some injury time for my speech. I could not agree more about Gary McKinnon. The offence that he committed is very serious in America, but not so serious here for a variety of reasons. If we were trying to secure an extradition from America of someone who had committed a similar offence, a prima facie case would have to be made in the American court by the extraditing country. In this case, no such requirement exists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para22"><a name="09011934000025">I am very concerned also about the Raoul Weil case. Very few people in this country will have heard about it. He is a 49-year-old Swiss national who lives and works in Switzerland, and he ran the global wealth management arm of UBS in Zurich and was also based in London for a time. He was involved in putting together a number of products for high net worth individuals, which were basically aimed at reducing their tax liability, and he fell foul of the US Internal Revenue Service. He was in charge of a private bank at the time of the alleged offences, so last November the Americans charged him with conspiracy to defraud the US through tax evasion. If convicted, he faces a long period in jail and a huge fine. He is considered a fugitive because he has not flown to the States to get himself arrested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="90119-0015.htm_para23"><a name="09011934000026">What is so worrying about that case is that although UBS has clearly upset the Americans, no one has charged Weil with doing anything to hurt his homeland or contravening any EU or Swiss law. The logic of the case is that any employee in any non-American tax jurisdiction is vulnerable unless they comply not just with their own laws but with American law. I hope that the relevant part of the Bill will be reconsidered carefully, and that protection will be given to people such as Raoul Weil, Gary McKinnon and the Enron three. Let us hope that this fag-end Bill will be examined in Committee and really improved.</p>

 I wish to focus on part 3 of the Bill, which is about alcohol. I very much welcome the proposals, but I would like the action to go further and include some of the measures  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="19 Jan 2009">

that were in my ten-minute Bill on alcohol pricing and promotions. In particular, my concerns are about the impact of alcohol on young people. I welcome the fact that the proposed measures are directed particularly at drinking among young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para0"><a name="09011934000028">We all know the general figures about alcohol consumption, but among the young the figures are getting very much worse. By the age of 13, more young people are drinking than not, and by the age of 15 one third are drinking once or more a week. Among those aged from 11 to 15 who drink regularly, the average weekly alcohol consumption has risen from 5.3 units in 1990 to 11.4 units in 2006. Those figures are provided by the Royal College of Nursing and shows a high level of alcohol consumption among very young children&#151;well over the Government limits for adults. The issue is not just the amount that young people are drinking; it is also where they are drinking it. Research shows that one third of 15-year-olds drink, and that one third of those do so in public places. All the provisions about drinking alcohol in public places are therefore particularly important when it comes to young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para1"><a name="09011934000029">I was grateful to the National Association of Head Teachers for supporting my ten-minute Bill. It was concerned about the impact of drinking with regard to young people missing school, turning up late or turning up with hangovers. The Police Federation was supportive because of the obvious links between drinking and crime, which are particularly bad in the case of young people. One third of all deaths caused by alcohol are from injuries suffered when people are drunk, and that is most common among 16 to 24-year-olds. Young people are more likely than others to be involved in alcohol-related crime, and are the most likely people to be injured or killed as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09011934000030">We know from the British Medical Association, which also supported my Bill, about the serious consequences of the increase in drinking for the physical and mental health of young people. Over Christmas in Northamptonshire, there was a very welcome reduction in the number of people arrested for drink-driving; the number of arrests fell from 112 to 98. However, among 17 to 24-year-olds the figures did not go down. In fact, the county police said that while young drivers formed 10 per cent. of all drivers, they formed 35 per cent. of those arrested for drink-driving. It seems that we need to consider specific measures to deal with the particular problems associated with young people and alcohol. On that basis, the relevant measures in the Bill are particularly important, even though they might seem draconian and even though people might ask why we should adopt them rather than others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para3"><a name="09011934000031">There are to be increased penalties for selling alcohol, which chimes with the public&#146;s concern not just about the symptoms of children&#146;s drinking but about trying to cut it off at source. People are concerned about the fact that however much one might try, there is still a pattern of young people drinking at home before they go out or drinking in parks, perhaps because they cannot get into on-licences. They are certainly drinking alcohol obtained from off-licences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para4"><a name="09011934000032">The &#147;three strikes and you&#146;re out&#148; rule, too, is important in the context of young people drinking in public places. Of course, there will need to be some care in its management   <br>


<meta name="Date" content="19 Jan 2009">

and interpretation, for example in deciding whether a park is a public place. The police will need to give some thought to how they manage it, but we must bear in mind the fact that in Northampton town centre, for example, there is a ban on drinking in public. The police use such measures on a voluntary basis, and there is a possibility of making them available nationally and in an organised way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09011934000033">One matter that I ask the Government to consider really carefully is the mandatory code. I very much welcome it, but it will need to be tough and it will need substantial measures to deal with the real problems that arise from alcohol sales. Why are there to be only nine conditions? Why cannot the appropriate number of conditions emerge from the consultation? Of course, the code will depend on secondary legislation, but will it cover labelling and the number of units in a drink, advertising, promotions, and the stocking and location of shelves in supermarkets, so that shelves stocking alcohol are clearly signed and located in particular places? Otherwise, as people walk around shops where the primary purpose is to sell food they become increasingly aware of alcohol on the shelves and piled up on the floor next to the till. That particularly applies before a bank holiday or when there is a big sports match on TV. Will there be provision in the mandatory code to deal with some of the price cuts and discounting that are so incredibly damaging?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para6"><a name="09011934000034">I believe strongly that there is a real need for much tougher action to deal with the problem of alcohol sales, particularly to younger people. The Sheffield research showed clearly the link between price and availability, and consumption. It made the case strongly for minimum pricing of alcohol. As I said in an intervention on the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne), the research shows that a 40p minimum price would cut binge drinking, would not affect responsible drinkers, and would reduce hospital admissions by 41,000 a year and crime by 16,000 a year. Minimum pricing is strongly supported by many groups that are concerned with the matter, and by the on-licence trade because it would provide more of a level playing field between the on-licence and off-licence trade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para7"><a name="09011934000035">Will the Minister talk to his colleagues and consider whether tax concessions on white cider could be changed in the next Budget cycle? The tax regime for cider and perry pricing was designed to encourage small producers and fruit growers, not to subsidise some of the most pernicious forms of alcohol that are sold in the shops. Anyone who has seen White Lightning piled up on the bottom shelves of supermarkets knows that its price way undercuts that of other drinks. The duty on a pint of cider, whatever its strength, is only 16p, but it is between 35p and 59p on beer, depending on its alcoholic strength. There is no logic or rationale for such a price differential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para8"><a name="09011934000036">My concerns about binge drinking are rooted in my constituents&#146; experiences. One constituent&#146;s son was killed after a happy hour promotion, and people who live near a park in Moulton Leys have had their lives made a misery by young people who gather there, and whose behaviour deteriorates when they are given drink. I welcome the proposals, but I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to give them greater consideration and to be tougher.</p>

 As always, I begin by declaring an interest as a Crown court recorder and a district judge sitting all over London and the south-east. I hope that my hon. Friends agree that one of this Labour Government&#146;s greatest failures over the past 12 years has been their crime and law and order policy I have witnessed anecdotally in court&#151;we all know it to be true&#151;a huge increase in murders, gun crime, knife crime, and crimes of violence generally. That increase has been horrific, and has brought great distress and upset to many right-thinking members of society. The real problem, which we never seem to get to grips with, is the Government&#146;s failure to ensure that our existing law is properly enforced by police on the streets and by the courts. Failure to enforce existing law is an accusation to which the Government must plead guilty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para9"><a name="09011934000038">Another problem is detection rates. It is usually said that a criminal&#146;s greatest fear is being caught, not whether the maximum sentence is three years or six years, or whether the <i> Daily Mail</i> had a decent headline last week about this or that. Being caught is the greatest fear, and detection rates under this Government have fallen dramatically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para10"><a name="09011934000039">I asked a parliamentary question about burglaries in Surrey in the past few years to find out about detection rates. Do you know what the answer was, Madam Deputy Speaker? One in 10 is successfully detected. To put that in another way, nine out of 10 burglars know that they will get away scot-free. No wonder crime is on the increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para11"><a name="09011934000040">Here is a little point. I wonder whether the Minister knows about a problem in the courts with the police whereby many assaults that amount to actual bodily harm&#151;they are serious crimes, which can go to the Crown court and carry several years&#146; imprisonment&#151;are charged by the Crown Prosecution Service as common assault under section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. Why? First, because it is simpler; secondly, because common assault cannot go to the Crown court; and thirdly, because it is more likely that there will be a guilty plea and the matter can be dealt with quickly. The result is that many crimes are not being charged as the serious crimes that they are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para12"><a name="09011934000041">What about tonight&#146;s speeches? The hon.

My goodness, I wish that more of them were brought before the courts so that they could receive the condign sentences. She talked about common prostitutes. In the courts in which I sit, I have seen those pathetic individuals, and my sympathies and those of many of my hon. Friends for them is no less than the hon. Lady&#146;s. I see ruined bodies and ruined young women, and class A drug addicts. Some may have pimps and some may not, but they are ruined. Do I believe that clause 13 of the Bill will sort out their lives?

a country where prostitution is entirely lawful and find himself or herself guilty of a crime in this country. That is wrong and the Bill will need amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para22"><a name="09011934000054">I will tell you one thing, Madam Deputy Speaker: for all the Minister&#146;s talk about consulting widely on the provision, I can tell him that those to whom I have spoken, in the police and throughout the judiciary, think that clause 13 as drafted will be bad law. They think that there will be a huge problem with evidential matters. Let us imagine someone pleading not guilty at Camberwell Green magistrates court to going to a prostitute in Taiwan who was controlled. I am trying not to be flippant, but let us imagine the problems in calling evidence, not only from abroad if the prostitute was abroad, but in the UK. There will be huge evidential problems. My forecast is that in the first year of the provisions being on the statute book, there will be few if any prosecutions, and all this at a time when the plight of prostitutes in this country is dire, because of other matters, such as pimping and drugs, to which we should give much more attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para23"><a name="09011934000055">Enough of that. What of other matters, Madam Deputy Speaker? What of clause 26? This touches on my earlier point about law that is not enforced&#151;law that is ridiculous. Let us look at clause 26 for a moment. It increases the penalty for consuming alcohol in a designated public place from level 2 to level 4&#151;that is, from something like &#163;500 to &#163;2,500. All that the Home Secretary could say to me earlier was that the proposal sends out a message. But what on earth is the use of that, when in the past few years nobody has been fined more than &#163;250? Does the Minister know that under the fines system, which, by the Government&#146;s own strictures, now means that fines have to be within certain confines relating to the defendant&#146;s means, it will be practically impossible to fine anybody more than &#163;100 for that offence, because they are all on benefits or low incomes? The proposal is absolute nonsense&#151;yet again, a flagship headline that will get the Government overnight popularity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para24"><a name="09011934000056">Clause 29 creates the offence of persistently possessing alcohol in a public place three times in 12 consecutive months. Why three times? It is ridiculous. Why not twice? Why not once? Why not four times? The Government get worse. Under the Licensing Act 2003, it is an offence to sell alcohol within three months to children on three occasions. Wow! Look what is happening now: &#147;We&#146;re going to change it to selling on two separate occasions. This is the flagship!&#148; Is the Minister serious? Does he think that there have been a lot of prosecutions for selling three times? Is it not an offence to sell alcohol to children once? What is the magic about two?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para25"><a name="09011934000057">What on earth is going on? The answer is not a lot. We are blessed with Home Office Ministers who, frankly, thrive on the oxygen of a good headline and who pass more and more laws, each of them meaningless and not enforced, and with a Government who gloss over the truth of what is happening on the streets. Until we get a Government who enforce the existing law, our crime and disorder problems will continue to escalate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para26"><a name="09011939000002">I have been working on the issue of licensing lap-dancing clubs over the past two and a half years or so. Constituents first contacted me when the Picture House nightclub in my constituency applied to be a lap-dancing club. It would have been the second lap-dancing club in the town, within a matter of yards of the first. Despite strong and convincing objections, the licence was granted. That brought home to me just how large the loophole in the legislation is and how little the quality of life and the views of my constituents counted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para27"><a name="09011939000003">The current four licensing objectives are insufficient and do not reflect the concerns that a community might have, including about the character and quality of life in an area and how residents, local businesses, workers and shoppers may be affected. Such things cannot be considered under the present system. It was unacceptable that someone could object to their neighbour building a porch or a conservatory, but not to a lap-dancing club next door or more than 100 yd from their home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para28"><a name="09011939000004">I became involved in the Object Fawcett campaign, which built up a coalition of MPs, peers, academics, councillors, residents and grass-roots support throughout the country. I was a co-sponsor of a ten-minute Bill dealing with the issue and tabled an early-day motion that received 119 signatories. I welcome the fact that the Tory party now officially supports the measures, albeit late to the fight and after a great deal of adverse publicity arising from the offer of a voucher to the Rocket lap-dancing club, during the party conference in Birmingham. I am told that the Tory shadow Chancellor&#151;he still is the shadow Chancellor, isn&#146;t he?&#151;is fond of saying that the Tories will make a difference. Well, they certainly did in Birmingham, because takings rocketed during their conference week in Brum.</p>

Interestingly, I have received correspondence on that point from women in the business who are concerned about the ease with which establishments could open. The opening of too many establishments could affect the little control that those women have over what they have to do for their money. Quite simply, if a woman in the club down the road was allowing punters to touch her, other women might have to do the same or possibly more to keep their punters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="90119-0016.htm_para31"><a name="09011939000007">It became clear to me through speaking to current and ex-lap dancers that, more often than not, it is they who are being exploited. The majority put up with working conditions that no union would allow and little or no employment rights. For a pitch&#151;that is, for the privilege of dancing for gentlemen&#151;they have to pay anything from &#163;50 up to &#163;250. Those women pay for drinks and costumes, and they are encouraged to pump their gentlemen for expensive cocktails and champagne. The women do not get to keep their earnings and many cannot join a union.</p>

Friend the Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods), I am concerned about the exemption in proposed new paragraph 2A(3)(b) of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982, in clause 25(3), for premises holding lap-dancing events less than once a month. Temporary event notices cannot be opposed by a local council and are automatically granted. Residents therefore find themselves without even the limited means of objecting under the Licensing Act 2003. I believe that that contradicts the main aim underpinning the proposed reforms, which is to empower local communities as fully as possible. I argue that exemptions should be amended, to avoid creating further loopholes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="90119-0017.htm_para2"><a name="09011939000012">I am the chair of the all-party group on alcohol misuse, and I am particularly concerned about the proposals on alcohol. The Bill contains an enabling power for a statutory code of practice on the supply of alcohol, allowing the Secretary of State to prescribe mandatory conditions for all licensed premises without conditions. I support the measure, because the aim of encouraging the more responsible sale of alcohol is important. My concern, which is shared by Alcohol Concern, is that there is no centrally held register of licensees. That means that individuals who have had their licence revoked may apply for a new one in another local authority area, which cannot easily access information about the applicant&#146;s former conduct. It seems sensible to introduce a centrally held register of licensees, and I urge the Minister to consider that proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="90119-0017.htm_para3"><a name="09011939000013">I broadly welcome the measures on the new offence of persistently possessing alcohol in a public place, about which my constituents and the local police are concerned. However, we need to be aware that simply putting more young people into the criminal justice system is not always the most productive way of addressing the problem of alcohol misuse. In addition to the new powers, we need to focus on more early intervention for people of all ages. Schemes such as the Home Office-approved one in Dudley borough, run by Aquarius, deserve more investment. The scheme aims to reduce alcohol-related reoffending by changing people&#146;s behaviour, and it is a proven success. A recent evaluation showed that, among the people who had attended, overall reoffending in Dudley was down by 49 per cent., and alcohol-related reoffending was down by 12 per cent. The scheme is also accessing people at an earlier stage in their drinking, including younger people, binge drinkers and perpetrators of domestic violence, none of whom would normally contact an alcohol service. Such schemes make a huge difference across the borough, and we should do more to support them across the country.</p>

More investment is required in outreach youth workers and in positive intervention by the services. I hope that my own Tory-controlled Dudley council will take note of that, as it is currently cutting youth services. Young people should first be offered a programme of support if they are found to be persistently drinking to excess in public and need to change their behaviour. A welfare and social response should surely precede any punitive one for the 10-to-15 age group.</p>

I worked alongside many officers across all departments of the force, and obtained a warts-and-all view of the work that those men and women do for us, day in and day out. I came away with a renewed respect for the job that they do in the most difficult circumstances, often with provocation from members of the public that even a mild-mannered lady such as myself found it hard to rise above. I know that the falling crime rate&#151;now at its lowest in the west midlands for 18 years&#151;is due to the dedication of those police officers and to the continued assistance of new powers to enable them to do their jobs effectively and professionally. I am sure that many of the measures in the Bill will add to their effectiveness.</p>

 I am sure that all hon. Members have the utmost respect for our police forces. They do a fantastic job, and it is certainly not a job that I would like to do. Policing is now probably at the top of the agenda in our constituency offices, alongside health, education, climate change and transport. It is one of the most important issues for our constituents. The police force offers a service to the community, and I believe that it should be funded according to need. I guess that we have all received a number of lobbies from police authorities, and they show that there is a breakdown somewhere between the Government and the police authorities. We have heard tonight that a lot of money has been put into the police forces, but that is not the way that the representatives of the police authorities who come to talk to me about funding see it.</p>

consider giving them a budget of their own to spend on the issues in the community that worry them. I guess that those issues are primarily the same for all of us. They include antisocial behaviour and traffic problems&#151;nothing that is particularly high on the agenda in terms of serious crime, but in our communities such issues are very important. To that end, there needs to be a review of the antisocial behaviour order system. It is certainly not working in our area. The persistent offenders&#151;the usual suspects&#151;are still there.</p>

Such crimes are often not recorded as crimes. People in my community have now started to ask for log numbers. If the police refuse to list an incident as a crime, at least people will have something to refer to if they have a log number. That, too, needs to be looked into.</p>

What are their reasons? Most of the reasons relate to inactivity and boredom: they have nothing to do. The problem is that our local authorities are now having to cut their budgets, which are being tightened all the time, and the provisions that are being taken away from our communities tend to be the ones that the young people want to keep, including the youth clubs and leisure facilities that provide them with something to do. Unless that is looked at, the problem of inactivity among our young people is going to get worse.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a number of excellent points, with which I thoroughly agree, although he may not necessarily welcome my saying so.

 I fully agree with the hon. Gentleman. The influence of parents and grandparents has significantly weakened over the past 25 or 30 years.

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="90119-0017.htm_para20"><a name="09011943000002">The reclassification of lap-dancing or pole-dancing clubs as sex encounter venues is a very welcome step. Since the Licensing Act 2003, the number of such clubs is estimated to have doubled approximately to about 300. It is fair to say that that was an unintended consequence of the legislation, which effectively disenfranchised local communities and made it extremely difficult for licences to be withheld from those establishments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="90119-0017.htm_para21"><a name="09011943000003">That was brought home to me very keenly towards the end of last year in respect of an application for such a club in the west Kensington area&#151;an area that I represented for about 20 years as a councillor and hope, following boundary changes at the next election, to represent again as an MP. It is an issue that has affected many areas in London and, indeed, outside it. In this case, a notorious establishment called the Fox tavern was bought by a company rather luridly called Passion Nights, which had no previous experience of running such places. It sought to open it as a lap-dancing club for up to 600 people with a large number of private booths and other insalubrious trappings that go along with such institutions. Needless to say, like many of these establishments, it was to be located in a densely populated residential area, with all that one expects to go with it in the way of schools, community facilities and so forth. It does not take much imagination to realise that that club would entirely change the character of that area. Despite that rather obvious fact, the experience of a number of my hon. Friends elsewhere has shown how difficult it is under existing legislation to challenge such licences. In those circumstances, one must try to prove a hypothesis: one must try to prove that something will happen for which there is clearly no current evidence, because the establishment is not currently there, and the criteria for refusal of licences are extremely narrow and not directed at the nuisances that residents usually expect such establishments to cause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="90119-0017.htm_para22"><a name="09011943000004">Fortunately, things have gone reasonably well thus far in this case, but that is entirely due to the fact that within 10 days of its becoming common knowledge that the application was being submitted, more than 25 per cent. of all residents in the catchment area had signed petitions and presented the local authority with over 1,000 objections to the club&#146;s opening. Owing to the quality of those submissions and the organisation involved&#151;I know that a great deal of organisation was involved, because I gave evidence at the licensing hearing&#151;the authority refused the application. It was one of very few applications that were refused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="90119-0017.htm_para23"><a name="09011943000005">However, the matter does not end there. Next month there will be an appeal in the magistrates court, and I strongly suspect that even if the residents win again, the matter will proceed to the High Court, because the people who have the estimated &#163;2 million needed to develop such a project have deep enough pockets to exceed, in the legal process, whatever the residents can come up with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="90119-0017.htm_para24"><a name="09011943000006">The clause is good news. I say that not only because of my own reading of it, but because organisations such as Object and the Fawcett Society&#151;which have campaigned nationally on the subject&#151;generally welcome it, and believe that it will do the trick when it comes to new licences. Some of my hon. Friends have already mentioned the caveats, so I will not go over the ground again. There is, however, an opportunity for temporary or occasional licences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="90119-0017.htm_para25"><a name="09011943000007">Two matters concern me particularly, given my own experience. First, I want to know how transitional provisions will be dealt with. We understand that they will be dealt with by means of a statutory instrument, but it would be helpful if&#151;perhaps not today, but certainly in Committee&#151;the Minister could give some indication of how the Government expect existing licences, and the process of renewal and challenge of those licences, to be dealt with. Given the mushrooming of facilities of this kind over the last five years, the problem clearly does not relate only to new licences dating from the time of enactment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="90119-0017.htm_para26"><a name="09011943000008">The second issue, which I think has already been covered by my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham, is the issue of choice. There is an adopted rather than a mandatory provision here. Indeed, it is a double adopted provision, because it constitutes an amendment to schedule 3 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982. There will be a &#147;postcode lottery&#148; effect. There will, I suspect, be displacement between authorities, some being less robust and some being more robust, and there is likely to be a substantial delay while authorities take advice and decide whether to adopt the new legislation. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to look at that issue again, and to consider particularly the matter of transitional provision. Notwithstanding that caveat, however, the legislation is very welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="90119-0017.htm_para27"><a name="09011943000009">I did not intend to say anything particularly partisan, but I am afraid that the door was opened by the newly appointed shadow Home Secretary, the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling). Perhaps it was his enthusiasm for his new job that gave him the temerity to claim credit for the Conservative party for coming up with these ideas. That, I think, is simply churlish. I think that credit should be given where it is due. The Conservative party&#146;s record on this issue is actually very bad, whether we view it at national or at local level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="90119-0017.htm_para28"><a name="09011943000010">Because she is a very modest person, my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge did not mention the fact that she and my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham had conducted a co-ordinated campaign, including an early-day motion which, when I last saw it, had attracted 119 signatures in the last Session. Four were from Conservative Members. That is how much the Conservative party cared at that stage. Conservative Members&#146; support in debates raising the issue, and their support for the 10-minute Bill, were singularly lacking. I am glad to note that residents&#146; pressure has belatedly brought them to the table to support this recommendation, but I think it would be rather better for them to give credit to the people who have pursued the agenda over the last two to three years than to try, in a rather tawdry way, to claim the credit now.</p>

 I wish to speak first on part 1 of the Bill, but only briefly because I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell) will do it justice when he is called to speak.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="90119-0018.htm_para0"><a name="09011943000015">The Government have missed a huge opportunity to be bold and to go the full way by having elected police commissioners. Instead, they have proposed the direct election of some members of police authorities, which is a cop-out. I am unsure precisely how that will work in practice, but people will elect members to various police authorities, and that will generate no interest or excitement. I cannot see in my mind people pouring out of their homes to go to the polling booths to vote for members of a locally elected police authority, because it will not be accountable. It is the police commissioner who would have been accountable. Such accountability would have been an exciting development. It would have been great if people could have gone to the polls to vote not only for their MPs and local councillors, but for the police commissioner as well. Let us imagine that after such a vote crime had gone up in their area, they were unhappy with what had been happening on their streets and there was no visible policing; if, when the next election came around, they could point the finger at somebody and say, &#147;That&#146;s your fault&#148;, they would go back into the polling booths to vote again in droves. Imagine the other advantages such as the prudence that would be applied to police budgets, and also in relation to how the budgets would be spent and the priorities adopted by the police commissioner&#151;which I am sure would have mirrored those requested by the local residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="90119-0018.htm_para1"><a name="09011943000016">That is what people want. Every area has different policing needs; every community knows what it wants in terms of policing. There was a chance to offer people the opportunity to vote for somebody who was visibly accountable and responsible for keeping their streets safe. It is a great shame that the Government have missed out on that huge opportunity&#151;they have ducked out of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="90119-0018.htm_para4"><a name="09011943000019">A named person is to carry that process out with the offender. I never thought I would stand up in this Chamber and find myself agreeing with the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)&#151;in fact, it is bizarre that I am doing so, and I will need to sit down for a minute or so after my speech to get over it. We have had prostitution since biblical times. One would think that after 2,000 years we would know how to accommodate such a profession within a civilised society. It is not possible to outlaw prostitution. It will not be possible by having three meetings with a prostitute to get them to change their mind about being involved in that career. It is not a matter of career choice; boys and girls do not say when asked in school what they want to do when they grow up, &#147;I would like to be a prostitute.&#148; It is probably the only job where death is an unintended consequence.</p>

<p><a name="st_o351"><a name="09011943000020"><a name="90119-0018.htm_spnew1"><a name="09011943000105"><b>David T.C. Davies:</b>
 I hesitate to say this, but I met a prostitute in the House of Commons this morning and she surprised me by saying that many women did enjoy this work, found it quite well paid and actively chose to do it. That was a surprise to me, but it came straight from the horse&#146;s mouth, as it were.</p>

<p><a name="st_o352"><a name="09011943000021"><a name="90119-0018.htm_spnew2"><a name="09011943000106"><b>Mrs. Dorries:</b>
 I stand corrected, and I am sure that what my hon. Friend says is the case at certain levels. The people with whom I am concerned in respect of this Bill are those who are controlled, those who are exposed and those who end up in prostitution via a route of need. Such people might need to feed a drug habit, the need might result from a dire financial circumstance, they may have been pimped or they may be under the control of another. My hon. Friend is talking about people who have made an active choice to go into prostitution; they actively manage their own affairs very well, given that they have considered their choice and are intelligent enough to have been able to make that choice. I do not detract from that, but the Bill was another great opportunity to have provided access to health care services, a route away from danger and harm for prostitutes and a way of controlling prostitution that would have benefited the prostitutes themselves and society as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90119-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09011943000022">Instead, these provisions will mean that if a prostitute does not attend the three meetings with the named person, they will be fined or put in prison. Thus, a group of people whose job puts them in danger and criminalises them will be further criminalised by the Bill. This is bad law and it is a wasted opportunity. Prostitutes need better sexual health advice: they need to know about needle exchange programmes; about where they can get a constant supply of safe condoms; about how to protect themselves; and about how to operate in a way that will protect them and their families&#151;including their children&#151;who also have health needs. The Bill has done nothing to address that; these two clauses will further criminalise prostitutes and further expose a group of people who are already in danger.</p>

<a name="90119-0018.htm_brev4"><a name="09011943000094"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The health issues experienced by sex workers have an impact over the long term for themselves and their children. The RCN has concerns that the measures promoted in Clause 16 and 17 of this Bill will not help men and women out of prostitution and fear that the measures in the Bill could actually lead to greater detention of some of the most vulnerable, stigmatised and marginalised people in society.&#148;</p>

The Government are quick to cite the RCN when it supports what they are trying to do, so I hope that they will take its criticisms on board too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="90119-0018.htm_para8"><a name="09011943000025">The Government could have formalised what happens in a voluntary way at the moment; they could have formalised outreach services to help prostitutes and worked with the voluntary sector, which tries to get out on to the streets to work with prostitutes. The Bill could have provided a framework to assist those voluntary organisations in providing the access to health care and the assistance that prostitutes need, but it failed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="90119-0018.htm_para9"><a name="09011943000026">Clause 20 deals with closure orders. Nobody likes brothels to operate in residential areas or areas that contain schools, playgroups or children, and I know that sensitivities are involved, but I also know that all that will happen when a brothel is closed is that the prostitutes will be driven out on to the streets, where they will present a greater danger to themselves. They will not stop being prostitutes&#151;they will not cease to work, to earn their income or to do what they are doing. They will just be driven out on to the streets. I fail to see the usefulness of closing down a brothel for three months and I fail to see what the provision aims to do. I hope that the Minister will be able to elaborate on what the Government hope to achieve. The Government might be trying to cease the business in a given area, but they will not succeed because brothels will just open up again a few months later. Again, all the Government are doing is exposing prostitutes to greater danger and greater health risks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="90119-0018.htm_para10"><a name="09011943000027">As was said before, no safety will be offered to such prostitutes&#151;prostitutes will not be in a group, but will be out on their own on the streets. We know what happened in Ipswich; we know what has happened over and over again to prostitutes who are on the streets on their own. I would have though that the Government would have tried to stop that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="90119-0018.htm_para11"><a name="09011943000028">I believe that society needs to be protected from those things that its members do not want to happen in their residential areas. I am not saying that brothels should be allowed to exist wherever or whenever, but that prostitution exists and will always exist in a civilised society. We are not going to do anything with the Bill that will stop that. I support moving the emphasis towards the demand side of prostitution and the fact that when someone is buying sex, they will be committing an offence, but why should that happen only when the person is buying sex with somebody who is trafficked? All the arguments have been made on that subject, so I shall not reiterate them, but the best argument came from my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen). He said the girls quite often do not speak English and the purchasers quite often do not speak English. How on earth will the clause work?</p>

 It is always a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries), who always speaks good practical sense. That sense contrasted somewhat with the speech made by the Home Secretary in opening today&#146;s debate, in which she oozed complacency. The fact that the Bill is the 66th piece of police and justice legislation that we have had under this Government just shows how they confuse quantity with quality. As so many hon. Members have already said, we need to make existing laws work properly as they were intended to, and to make them work better, before we introduce yet more laws and regulations that, as we have just heard, might prove completely unworkable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="90119-0018.htm_para12"><a name="09011943000030">I shall make a few brief and probably disjointed comments on various aspects of the Bill that are not to do with prostitution&#151;the subject that has exercised most hon. Members&#146; minds this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="90119-0018.htm_para13"><a name="09011943000031">The selling of alcohol to children is a big problem, as we would all agree. It is particularly a problem in deprived areas. Some of the statistics have already been mentioned. A survey that appeared in <i> The Lancet</i> showed that 29 per cent. of disadvantaged children say that they drink to get drunk, 52 per cent. say that they get alcohol from the local shops and 42 per cent. start drinking before they are 13. Another survey produced last year by Liverpool John Moores university said that poor children were 45 per cent. more likely to be violent after drinking than children in affluent areas. The problem is very serious. I welcome measures that will genuinely tackle that problem, but, as I mentioned earlier, legislation and regulations alone will not solve every perceived social problem, and a large part of this problem is social.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="90119-0018.htm_para14"><a name="09011943000032">The fact that the Government are making new penalties when the existing penalties have not even been used in the extreme, as we heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins), just shows that laws are not being allowed to work. I went out a little while ago on a test purchasing exercise with the local police. We went to pubs with two police cadets aged 15 and 16. One certainly did not look anything like 18, and the other was marginal. Four out of the five premises that we visited served those girls. In most cases they were served by the licensee himself or herself, not by some rookie 18-year-old barman. That is still happening, and it is happening because powers are not being used to ensure that those places are properly investigated and because the penalties are not sufficiently tough when people get caught. That is what we need to work on.</p>

We have to change that mentality. The Government have not helped by the fact that they have cut education programmes on drinking, on which they should have put more emphasis. We need to get people to respect alcohol, not to grow up abusing it.</p>

should explain that mosquitoes are high-pitched devices that can be heard only by children and young people, mostly under the age of 25. The devices are deeply insidious and discriminatory, and are produced by Compound Security Systems, a company whose managing director I met a little while ago. They have a range of 15 m and are attached to buildings, usually shops, to deter young people from congregating in an area. That is the wrong way to tackle the forms of antisocial behaviour that may or may not occur when young people congregate in groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="90119-0018.htm_para17"><a name="09011943000035">The device is highly discriminatory because it affects only young people. I tried it on a work experience student from one of the local schools who was working in my office. When the device was switched on, we could hear nothing, but that poor chap went berserk because it is very powerful. It is also dangerous; it has been shown that it can have adverse effects on people suffering from tinnitus or autism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="90119-0018.htm_para18"><a name="09011943000036">What if we had invented a device that could be detected only by elderly people, or that affected only people with hearing aids or who used Zimmer frames? That would be terribly discriminatory and we would not stand for it, yet completely unregulated and unlicensed devices are available that can be targeted at young people, who in many cases are simply trying to get together to socialise.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend welcome the approach copied from the continent that has been adopted in some London underground stations?

Furthermore, young people who happen to be sleeping in the proximity of one of those things can be kept awake. Will the Minister consider whether there should be some form of regulation for such devices? At present, they are available, through the company I mentioned and certain foreign companies, only to police authorities and local authorities. I am glad that my police authority in Sussex has stopped using them, as have many other authorities, but I gather that we are soon likely to be flooded with much cheaper devices from China, which will be available in DIY shops for any householder to put up in the vicinity of their house. That is deeply worrying.</p>

The Bill says little that is positive about young people. Clause 1 is about the duty of police authorities in relation to public accountability, and inserts in the Police Act 1996 the provision that police authorities when discharging their functions must have regard to the views of the public concerning policing. How will that affect children and young people?</p>

in my community.&#148; Under the Bill, the police must have particular regard to the policing priorities that come up in such consultation exercises, so can the Minister reassure me by telling me which provisions will take account of the feelings and wishes of children and young people? They are equally entitled to decent policing. They form 20 per cent. of the population and, as we have seen from the Government&#146;s youth crime action plan, suffer a high instance of being victims of crime. How will the proposals in the Bill reflect and protect the particular requirements of children and young people?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="90119-0018.htm_para22"><a name="09011943000042">There are provisions on the selling and procuring of alcohol for young people, but I want to make a couple of other quick points. The first is about gangs. We all know that we have a problem with gangs&#151;often in our inner cities&#151;who have access to knives, guns and drugs. I am glad that the Government have taken a number of measures, within those 66 pieces of legislation, to increase the penalties and clamp down on that, but what I hear in our inner cities is that those gangs are using younger children to act as the carriers of guns, knives and drugs. They are recruiting those younger children, who are known as soldiers. Courts are more lenient with younger children, so the gangs recruit them to do their dirty work. Many people might appreciate it if inciting a child to commit a crime resulted in a stiffer penalty than undertaking the crime itself. That is another thought that the Minister might consider. Again, too many people are cleverly getting round the law, and we need to close off all those possibilities for people to flout the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="90119-0018.htm_para23"><a name="09011943000043">The Minister would expect me to make one last point about cannabis caf&#233;s. One clause deals with closure orders for brothels, and we should have easier ways to put closure orders on cannabis caf&#233;s. I have waxed lyrical about the cannabis caf&#233; in my constituency, which is still functioning, but a trial is pending, so I will not go into my constituency case in detail. However, when a premises is masquerading as a caf&#233;, offering office space, when it has a reinforced roof, concrete-filled tyres in rows to reinforce its perimeter, razor wire around the premises, concrete bollards and height gantries to restrict vehicle entry, when it has no planning permission for a change of use, when it has had no health and safety inspections and no disability access requirements, and is not paying business rates, should that place be in business? Yet it is flouting the law, sticking two fingers up at the law and causing people in a residential area mayhem and misery. How on earth can a business that claims to be an innocent caf&#233; or renter of office space justify needing such fortifications to go about its business?</p>

 I am deeply disappointed that the Bill does not contain measures that would genuinely give local people a say over policing where they live. Clause 1 will impose a statutory requirement for police authorities to take into account the public&#146;s views on crime and policing. That is a far cry from having directly elected police authorities&#151;an idea that Ministers were toying with. Let us imagine that Parliament had a statutory requirement to take into account the views of the electorate instead of holding elections to decide who sits here.

Rather than empower local people, clause 2 does the precise opposite. Instead of the people deciding who runs the police, the decision will be left to yet another quango&#151;the police senior appointments panel, whose members will be appointed centrally by the Home Secretary.

The system of police accountability that we have today is a product of the tripartite system established under the Police Act 1964, and of its steady erosion under Governments of both parties in the years since. Police authorities, which are supposed to represent and supervise the police, have become weak, ineffectual and subject to the whim of Home Office target setters.</p>

Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz), seemed to imply that that was somehow a shortcoming of the people. In fact, it shows what is inevitable when police authorities are appointed rather than elected.</p>

Chief constables certainly do not seem to regard police authorities as bodies that exist to set their agendas or priorities.

I use the term &#147;their police&#148; deliberately, because as Robert Peel understood,</p>

Without local accountability, there is less local legitimacy, and there is alienation between the police and the public. Again, do not take my word for it; take the word of the Government&#146;s own Home Office adviser, Louise Casey. She recently spoke of the collapse of trust in the criminal justice system. The Government&#146;s former respect tsar is right to be concerned about surveys that show that only one third of people still have great confidence in the police.</p>

Bold reform and localism have been defeated by the Sir Humphrey Appleby types. On 18 December, in the pages of <i> The </i><i> Guardian</i> rather than in this House, the Home Secretary revealed that plans to make the police more accountable to local communities through direct elections had been abandoned owing to pressure from senior officers. Also cited were fears of local police falling under the control of political extremists or single-issue campaigners. Ten seconds of reflection show that it is nonsense to argue that we cannot have directly elected police chiefs for fear of the British National party. Surely that is an argument against electing people to run local councils&#151;or, indeed, against elections to Parliament. People could vote for extremists, but overwhelmingly they do not.</p>

predecessors as Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), said as much in an earlier question. We know that the Association of Police Authorities has used public money and part of its Home Office funding to engage a lobbyist to lobby the Home Office. Thus does the quango state use public money to lobby itself. So much for the LGA&#146;s belief in localism.</p>

We all like the idea of the expert&#151;the disinterested technocrat who can rise above the pressures of demagogic politics. The trouble is that no such person exists. If by the &#147;expert&#148; we mean someone who has spent their whole life and career in a particular profession, those are the last people we should put in charge of invigilating the measure.</p>

Leaving things to the experts was what we did with child protection in Haringey. In lobbying against localism, the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Local Government Association and police authorities argued that directly elected police chiefs would politicise the police, yet it would be perfectly possible to have directly elected justice commissioners, for example, overseeing local police without compromising in any way local forces&#146; operational independence. Saying that policing would be politicised by the direct election of police authorities ignores the fact that in a democratic free society, the way in which we are policed is a matter that should be subject to democratic control. If it is not, why on earth do we talk about policing in our election manifestos?</p>

There has been no shortage in the Chamber of Home Secretaries or Ministers talking about the need to make our criminal justice system work, or of Westminster insiders talking about the need to be tough on crime. The trouble is, talk is all that it is. Without the direct election of police authorities, those whom we elect remain powerless to fight crime. We can fight elections with lots of talk about fighting crime, but unless we have directly elected justice commissioners, policing will remain almost entirely beyond democratic control.</p>

 Before turning to clause 13, may I reiterate the comments of many hon. Members who agree&#151;in fact, everyone does so&#151;that trafficking in human beings for any purpose is evil, and who recognise that those evil people must be stamped out and put behind bars? I commend the Government, because over the past few years, there has been greater awareness of that evil trade, of which many of us were ignorant five, six or 10 years ago. It is now very much in everyone&#146;s mind, and the Government have tried to ensure that when traffickers are caught, tough sentences are handed out. There are two problems. First, very few of them are caught and, secondly, despite the long sentences that are handed out, most of those people walk out free halfway through as a result of automatic early release, about which I should like to speak at length another time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="90119-0019.htm_para11"><a name="09011943000062">The problem with clause 13 is that it appears to have been drafted in the heat of the moment, rather than after a cold, hard look at the facts. The Minister talks about trying to reduce trafficking by stemming the demand, and about the financial incentive for traffickers to bring women into this country to offer sexual services. If that is the case, and if the Government believe that by going after prostitutes&#146; clients they will stem that demand, they must answer the question that I have posed about child beggars. When I went to Europe and discussed trafficking with senior Europol officers a few months ago on behalf of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, they told me that, to a trafficker, a child beggar is worth more money than a female prostitute. They gave me rough figures&#151;no one can be exact&#151;and said that a child beggar was worth &#8364;100,000 a year to a trafficker, and a female prostitute was worth about &#8364;75,000 a year. They went on to say that, as a result, some towns in some parts of eastern Europe have practically been turned into baby factories where women produce children specifically so that they can be kidnapped, taken away to countries such as the United Kingdom and exploited as beggars and petty thieves. I am sure that the Minister will agree that that trade is equally disgusting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="90119-0019.htm_para12"><a name="09011943000063">Let us look at the measure logically. If we are to stem the demand for prostitution by going after prostitutes&#146; clients, we should also take action to stem the even greater problem of child beggars. I have asked the question before: if we are to criminalise those who go to prostitutes, should we not also criminalise those who give money to child beggars? Those people are contributing to and causing a problem exactly as the clients of prostitutes are. I put the question directly to the Leader of the House when she gave evidence to the Home Affairs Committee. She wrote back a rather strange letter saying that one group of people were being philanthropic and the other was committing rape.</p>

rape. If anyone has sex with a woman who has not given her consent&#151;the definition under the law is perfectly clear&#151;they can be charged as the law stands. This law is being brought in only because the men are not committing rape. The women are giving their consent; if they were not, the act of rape would be committed. I am sure that the hon.

 Surely the consent must be freely given. I cite child prostitution, an example that the hon. Gentleman used.

Somebody else gave the example of people running red lights, but we all know that when we drive past traffic lights, it is our responsibility to be sure that they are green; if we do not and we run a red light, we are to blame and can be prosecuted. There is no way in which a punter going to a prostitute can find out for certain whether she has been trafficked.

As I said to her earlier, this morning I met a very articulate lady; in fact, I assumed that she was a solicitor and did not at first realise that she worked in the sex industry as well as lobbying Members of Parliament. Her take was that many women work in the industry quite freely because the money and the job are good. She tells me that most of those whom she meets are perfectly nice and decent and that most who run brothels are also that. She even described one brothel as a happy family business. I have no way of knowing how representative she is, but her union is linked to the GMB, which has more links to the hon. Lady&#146;s party than to mine.</p>

If we start making it easy for the police to get prosecutions by going after clients, then they will go after clients and spend a lot of time trying to collate evidence about them.

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="90119-0019.htm_para18"><a name="09011943000073">I would like the Government to answer these simple questions. Why have they done nothing about running a public information campaign to discourage people from giving money to child beggars and try to stop those activities? Why are they doing so little to prevent forced marriage, which is another form of trafficking whereby women are taken from one country to another to act as domestic and sexual slaves for people whom they have never even met before? While we are on the periphery of this subject, perhaps they could also explain why they have done nothing to enforce the law on female genital mutilation that they introduced in 2003, when lots of Members of Parliament made speeches saying that that disgusting practice must be stamped out. They encouraged the Metropolitan police to set up a unit to hunt down and seek out people who had perpetrated this disgusting crime, yet since then not one single person has been convicted and only one person has been investigated. I know that that is the case only because I had to make a case to the Information Commissioner to get the information out of the Metropolitan police, who did their damnedest to try to stop me from having any of it.</p>

We should not criminalise men who seek prostitutes in the belief that they are perfectly willing to have sex, or criminalise prostitutes, some of whom, contrary to what the hon. Member for Slough may think, are perfectly happy with the jobs that they are doing, but go after the traffickers. We should discourage people from giving money to a woman who has obviously been coerced into sex or giving money to a child who has been taken from their home in eastern Europe, or somewhere else, and put out on to the streets of London. We should discourage people who are party to the fact that domestic slaves are brought into this country from some parts of the middle east and forced to work for little or nothing in the houses of very wealthy people from that part of the world. Those are the people whom the Minister should be tackling; if he did that, he would have support in all parts of the House.</p>

I was set to take part in a Delegated Legislation Committee to consider a hangover from previous legislation. We have already heard about the number of criminal justice Bills&#151;66 and counting&#151;that we have considered in recent years. One of those measures was the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, and the Committee was to consider a draft order extending penalty notices for disorder to a number of offences&#151;the subject of my earlier intervention on the Home Secretary. The last-minute cancellation of that Committee because of the lack of consultation highlighted a running theme of the speeches that we have heard in this debate: the Government are legislating, and over-legislating, without proper consideration of the effects. There is a preponderance of increasing legislation and a reduction in public confidence in our police and justice system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="90119-0019.htm_para21"><a name="09011943000077">That is a matter that we could have highlighted in the Committee. Justice is being done on the cheap away from the courts and without recognition for victims. There is a problem in our communities arising from the lack of ownership, understanding and information as regards what happens in our justice system and about priorities for policing. The Government have tried to tackle that in part 1, but wholly inadequately. An opportunity has already been missed, and we need to address that in Committee. The provisions have fallen short of what is needed: directly elected police commissioners who can bring accountability to the communities that the police serve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="90119-0019.htm_para22"><a name="09011943000078">In the short time that I have, I would like to draw attention to part 3, which deals with alcohol misuse. Points have been raised about its provisions throughout the debate. The Government are, in many ways, legislating to deal with their own mistakes, not least the 24-hour licensing regime. During the first year of the regime, offences increased by 22 per cent. between 3 am and 6 am, and those involving serious violent crime increased by 25 per cent. A and E admissions for alcohol-related injuries increased by 26 per cent., and there were 1 million alcohol-related attacks last year. Not only in part 3, but throughout the Bill, there are provisions to correct mistakes in previous Government legislation. A running theme throughout many speeches, however, has been the lack of enforcement of existing legislation. Since 2004, only 32 people under 18 have been prosecuted for buying or attempting to buy alcohol, and in 2006 that figure was only eight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="90119-0019.htm_para23"><a name="09011943000079">I wish to spend my remaining minutes dealing with part 2, which deals with prostitution, and whose provisions have caused other Members concern. We should be in no doubt that for the most part prostitution involves exploitation and preying on the most vulnerable. While my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth has met someone who is not in that category, the reality is that prostitution involves exploitation. The European average age for entry into prostitution is 14, and in this country, 75 per cent. of prostitutes enter prostitution before the age of 18. The facts about vulnerability speak for themselves. The Home Office&#146;s own figures refer to homelessness, living in care, debt and substance abuse. All are common experiences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para0"><a name="09011943000082">Those are the experiences of those entering prostitution, and research shows that many involved have suffered abuse or violence in the home. Some 85 per cent. report physical abuse and 45 per cent. report familial sexual abuse. I will refer to my own experience of prostitutes when in Haringey; I did not meet them on the streets, but in the magistrates courts. I recall going down to the cells in Highgate in the morning as a duty solicitor, and in a similar experience to that described by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins), seeing those prostitutes, who were, in the true sense of the word, pathetic. When I opened the hatch of the cell, I would see a prostitute who was damaged, vulnerable and plainly exploited. When they went before the magistrates, the magistrates were often embarrassed about what to do with them, saying &#147;What do we do with them? We saw them last week and we saw them the week before. Well, we&#146;ll give them a token financial penalty.&#148; And off they go, but they come back week in, week out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para1"><a name="09011943000083">Some might say that prostitutes have a choice and that they have a right to earn a living. Some do, but the majority have a desperate existence. In the remaining time that I have, I would like to talk about what needs to be done to address these issues and make the changes that we all want. First, we cannot overstate the significant influence of drugs. The pimps, no doubt, want to make many women drug dependent in order to use them in prostitution. The prostitutes will then use drugs as a means of escape, and stay in prostitution in order to feed their habit. With 95 per cent. of street-based prostitutes on class A heroin, the statistics speak for themselves. Drugs have to be tackled, including by means beyond legislation, as other hon. Members have said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para2"><a name="09011943000084">Secondly, there is the question of danger. Many have said during this debate, with a smile on their face, that prostitution is the oldest profession, implying that it is going to be with us year in, year out, and that we just have to deal with it. I am not saying that it is within the power of the state simply to brush it away, but neither am I saying that the position is static and has not changed. We must recognise that demand has increased with regard to those in most danger&#151;those who are being trafficked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para3"><a name="09011943000085">It is estimated that some 4,000 women in this country have been trafficked, and that 81 per cent. of prostitutes now come from overseas. That inevitably opens up the issue of trafficking. On 1 August, it will be the 175th anniversary of the release of all slaves in British colonies, thanks to the work of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton and others. Now, in 2009, British men gather slaves to themselves each day&#151;now sexual slaves&#151;to do their bidding. We must ask ourselves whether there has been progress, and what needs to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para4"><a name="09011943000086">We certainly need to enforce current legislation better, because the number of convictions for trafficking is woefully low. Up to May 2008 it was at 84. Perhaps we must do better in introducing new legislation, and we must certainly examine clause 13 closely to decide whether it creates an ambiguity. Do we want to criminalise prostitution on the one hand while on the other hand saying that we wish to focus on those who are controlling it, gaining from it and trafficking? The concern is that we will not be able to deal with them properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para5"><a name="09011943000087">We also need to examine clauses 16 and 17 carefully. They resurrect issues that the Minister for Security,  <br>

Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing and I debated during the passage of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, in relation to the practicality of rehabilitation orders. Will they really lead to people giving up prostitution, given the concerns about family breakdown, child abuse, domestic violence and debt? Will the three meetings, to take place within six months, really produce the desired result? Will there be compliance, rather than women being criminalised further with the prospect of imprisonment for breaches of an order? Will there be the resources that we all believe are needed to help people exit prostitution and to provide rehabilitation for them? Countries such as Norway and Sweden have those resources, but they do not exist in this country.</p>

 The Bill is a smorgasbord of measures that are sometimes worthy but not always well thought through. It is not the radical reform of our law and order system that the police, and the public whom they serve, need. The first 16 minutes of the Home Secretary&#146;s speech&#151;I counted the minutes&#151;were about measures, many real, many imagined, that are not even in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para7"><a name="09011951000002">The police do a difficult and often dangerous job on our behalf, and the Bill does not give them the additional tools that they need to do their job. The right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz), the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, agreed with me about that, saying that he hoped for a second Bill later this year to deliver some serious police reform. Members of the Home Secretary&#146;s own party say that, and they are right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para8"><a name="09011951000003">The Home Secretary gives us lectures about her criminal record&#151;sorry, her crime record&#151;that are, frankly, complacent. Violent crime is up by almost 80 per cent. under Labour, with 1.099 million violent crimes recorded in 2007-08 compared with just over 615,000 offences in 1998-99. Those are Home Office figures, shown in table 2.4 of its report &#147;Crime in England and Wales 2007/08&#148; of 17 July 2008, so we do not want any argument about the fact that the crime figures are up. Robbery is up by 27 per cent. under Labour and criminal damage by 18 per cent., and just over one in four crimes were detected by the police in 2007-08.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para9"><a name="09011951000004">Why is all that coming about? It is partly to do with the fact that despite five red tape reviews under this Government we still have the unacceptable position that patrol officers spend less than 20 per cent. of their time on the beat. That is not good enough. That was one among many points that my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para10"><a name="09011951000005">Much reference has been made in the debate to the reform of the police senior appointments panel in part 1.

Members have pointed out, nothing in the relevant clauses will ensure that there is a better, higher-quality calibre of police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para11"><a name="09011951000006">Clauses 7 and 8 will make it easier for officers to tackle crimes that occur in areas where a collaboration agreement is in force. However, why does the Bill not tackle the real problem and reform the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 to do away with the ridiculous requirement for an officer to fill in a form if he wants to surveille the house of a known, persistent burglar? The measure should do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para12"><a name="09011951000007">It is clear from part 1 that Ministers have it in mind to ensure more collaboration to deliver, for example, better level 2 protective services. We agree about that. However, will the Home Secretary and her Ministers mandate collaboration? If they have a plan for that, they should tell the House today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para13"><a name="09011951000008">As we have heard, the Home Secretary bottled it when it came to introducing some form of elected representation to hold the police to account. She kicked the idea into the long grass, giving it to the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett). Heaven knows when we will hear the results. The Cabinet Office&#146;s Casey review found in an independent survey that 68 per cent. of people agree or strongly agree that a person or persons should be elected by local people to hold the police to account on behalf of the community. As recently as November, the Home Secretary said that she was committed to</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para14"><a name="09011951000009">Perhaps the Minister can tell us in his winding-up speech why the Government suddenly changed their mind and dropped their plans for improving police accountability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para15"><a name="09011951000010">A solitary clause is intended to improve accountability. It will add a statutory requirement to the Police Act 1996 for police authorities to take account of</p>
<a name="90119-0020.htm_brev1"><a name="09011951000023"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the views of people in the authority&#146;s area&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para16"><a name="09011951000011">Perhaps the Minister will explain how that significantly changes police authorities&#146; current responsibilities. As my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell) said in a powerful and typically trenchant speech, the Conservatives&#146; solution, which the Minister would do well to adopt, is to replace the police authority with a police commissioner, who is directly elected by voters in a police force area every four years. A safeguard would be provided in a power of recall&#151;a trigger whereby an elected commissioner who went off the rails before the four-year term ended could be recalled and the election rerun. We have also devised other safeguards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para17"><a name="09011951000012">In another typically trenchant contribution, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries) made it clear that the public want something simple from the Bill: a commissioner to whom they can complain if policing is going wrong and a mechanism to kick that commissioner out of office in the case of underperformance. What could be simpler? It is a tragedy that part 1 contains nothing comparable to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para18"><a name="09011951000013">Part 2 drew many contributions about the sex industry and sex offences. To avoid doubt, let me say that we welcome making lap-dancing clubs subject to local licensing along the lines that the provisions set out.</p>

 My hon. Friend may not know that a lap-dancing club opened in Braintree, which&#151;as he knows&#151;is a genteel market town. Does he honestly believe that clause 25 will grant sufficient powers to stop lap-dancing clubs from opening in towns such as Braintree?</p>

On the other hand, contributions from Conservative Members, such as that from my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins), raised technical questions about the way in which enforcement would work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para20"><a name="09011951000017">What we do know, however, is that organisations tasked with helping vulnerable and trafficked women believe that there is a risk that some of the clauses, if they are not drafted properly and do not work satisfactorily, will drive sex workers further underground. We have to test those propositions in Committee. We also know what the head of the Metropolitan police&#146;s human trafficking unit said of the new offence:</p>

Outside bodies, including the UK Network of Sex Work Projects, also believe that the measures relating to the closure of brothels might restrict the ability of outreach organisations that work with sex workers to deliver them help and support. Issues of such huge importance will be tested in Committee, but the debate that we have had on the Floor of the House today has been extremely worth while in teasing some of them out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="90119-0020.htm_para22"><a name="09011951000019">However, there is a case for tougher border protection and control&#151;there can be no substitute for that&#151;to stop trafficking from happening in the first place. The Government have been insufficiently proactive in tackling human trafficking. After a delay of nine months in signing the European convention on action against trafficking, Home Office figures show that in 2007 there were only 17 convictions for trafficking for sexual exploitation. Would it not have been better to have clauses in the Bill to do what the Conservative Opposition have argued for long and hard for the past six to 12 months, which is to introduce a national border police to stop illegal weapons from coming to this country and to stop the illegal, disgusting and pernicious trafficking of human beings? That is what the Bill should contain. Sadly, it does not contain any such measures.</p>

The Bill also links the international to the neighbourhood in the fight against crime, in particular by improving our tools to recover criminal assets.

He also said that in this country we do not go around saying that we cannot directly elect a mayor just because the British National party might get into power, and that we can re-run elections with the power of recall anyway. In other words, there would be an election for a police commissioner, and, if the Conservatives did not get the result that they wanted, they would re-run it. What sort of lunacy and idiocy is that? What sort of democracy is it, in which an election is held for a police commissioner and, if people do not like the result, they hold another one?</p>

 It is called a safeguard&#151;well, we will see what it is called, but I do not believe that that is the kind of democracy that the hon. Member for Harwich was talking about. So let us have a debate about accountability, and let us have a debate about how we can more properly ensure that the police are representative of their communities and take into account what they say. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has introduced sensible, proportionate proposals that will place on police authorities a duty to take the views of local people into account, and that will place on Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary a responsibility to inspect those police authorities to see whether they have done so.</p>

Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) made an excellent point about police authorities having to ensure not only that they consult the people whom we might expect them to consult but that young people also have a voice in this regard. He was also right to say that, when HMIC inspects the police authorities, it should consider whether that consultation has been achieved. The hon. Gentleman has made an important point, and we should consider the matter.</p>

Alongside the Bill, there is a range of measures on crime mapping, on the single confidence target, and on reducing bureaucracy. All of this is happening alongside the policing pledge, and it is happening irrespective of what is in the Bill, because we do not need a Bill to achieve those things. Alongside the Bill, real reform and real changes are taking place.</p>

Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz), the Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, made some important points about alcohol. There is no doubt that many of us enjoy alcohol and find that it adds to our evening out. There is also no doubt, however, that alcohol causes considerable problems and a considerable amount of violence in our society. That is why the Government are looking to see what more they can do, particularly with respect to young people. That is also why we are introducing new offences to tackle some of the problems that young people have with alcohol&#151;a new offence of persistent possession of alcohol in a public place; a new offence that will enable the police, if necessary, to direct young people between the ages of 10 to 15 to leave an establishment; and new measures to allow us to take tougher action against retailers who persistently sell alcohol to young people.</p>

 I am sorry to return to the theme that I explored with the Home Secretary earlier. What the Government are doing to deal with retailers is absolutely right, but the fact remains that supermarkets provide alcohol very cheaply. As a result of their promotions, young people are going in and buying alcohol. It may well be that the supermarkets are complying with the code, but the availability of cheap alcohol is the real problem. What are we going to do about that?</p>

<p><a name="st_o374"><a name="0901201000035"><a name="90119-0021.htm_spnew1"><a name="0901201000201"><b>Mr. Coaker:</b>
 I was about to mention to my right hon. Friend that the Bill also contains an enabling power that allows us to establish a mandatory code for the sale of alcohol, which will tackle the problem of irresponsible promotions. It will deal not only with the on-trade, but with the off-trade, and it might well enable us to tackle some of my right hon. Friend&#146;s concerns about promotions in supermarkets, which are often linked to price. As I say, the Bill will help us to tackle some of the alcohol abuse that we see around us.</p>

<p><a name="st_o375"><a name="0901201000036"><a name="90119-0021.htm_spnew2"><a name="0901201000202"><b>Ms Keeble:</b>
 Will the Minister conduct an extensive consultation so that the public and the different organisations that feel very strongly about this matter can comment on and contribute to the code?</p>

 I can tell my hon. Friend, who made an earlier contribution to the debate, that we intend to conduct extensive consultation on what should be included in the conditions&#151;not only those in a mandatory national set of conditions, but those that local authorities will be able to choose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="90119-0021.htm_para0"><a name="0901201000038">Alongside the debate on accountability, policing and alcohol, we had an impassioned debate about sexual offending and the new strict liability offence in respect of prostitution. Let me first commend my hon. Friend the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart): whether or not Members agree with her&#151;some will not&#151;many will have recognised the power of her speech. I thought that she made an excellent speech, which made an enormous contribution to our debate, as I hope those who disagreed with it would also accept.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="90119-0021.htm_para1"><a name="0901201000039">Just over a year ago, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary asked me to conduct a six-month review into the whole demand side of prostitution. In connection with that, I visited Sweden, where I saw legislation at work that makes paying for sex a criminal offence, full stop. I heard the evidence from that country relating to the concern&#151;it was raised in another context by the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)&#151;that the legislation had driven prostitution underground. That was a real worry, as was the applicability of the same law to this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="90119-0021.htm_para2"><a name="0901201000040">We also went to Amsterdam. I say to hon. Members in all sincerity that if they think that the legalisation of prostitution is the answer to tackling the exploitation that we see, they should go there and see the trafficking that takes place alongside legalised brothels; they should see the serious and organised crime that takes place alongside legal brothels; and they should also see the exploitation. The idea that legalisation or decriminalisation somehow provides a magic wand that ends exploitation and abuse or stops trafficking is simply not the case. I brought that evidence back from Amsterdam.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="90119-0021.htm_para3"><a name="0901201000041">We were left, therefore, with a public policy conundrum. To be fair to the hon.

said that they wish to examine the arguments for it. I am pleased about that, because this is a serious public policy debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="90119-0021.htm_para4"><a name="0901201000042">For too long, the onus of dealing with prostitution has been placed entirely on the woman. Prostitution has been regarded as a female problem that women ought to sort out for themselves, and the responsibility of men has been neglected or, indeed, ignored. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary asked me to look into what responsibility men have in this regard. What we are trying to do, through the strict liability offence, is make clear that those who purchase sex have a responsibility to consider&#151;not always, but generally&#151;the position of the women from whom they are purchasing it. That means that men will no longer be able to act with impunity, with total disregard for the position of the women from whom they are buying sex.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="90119-0021.htm_para5"><a name="0901201000043">Let me issue a challenge. There are those who say that this is a step too far, or that this is an offence for which people cannot be prosecuted. What measures would they introduce to impose on men a responsibility that they have ignored for centuries? Very little is said about that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o377"><a name="0901201000044"><a name="90119-0021.htm_spnew4"><a name="0901201000204"><b>Paul Holmes (Chesterfield) (LD):</b>
 Can the Minister explain why, having examined the policies of a number of countries, the Government alighted on that of Finland, where no successful prosecution has been made in the two to two and a half years since the policy was introduced?</p>

 We think that that policy offers us the best way of encouraging men to accept the responsibility that they should exercise when deciding whether to purchase sex.</p>

Friends the Members for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods) and for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho), and other Members on both sides of the House, on their work in tackling the issue of lap dancing. There is no doubt that amending the Acts under which lap-dancing clubs are licensed will give local communities more of a say in where such clubs can and should be positioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="90119-0021.htm_para7"><a name="0901201000047">I will consider the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter) about temporary licensing and some of the other &#147;postcode&#148; issues, and will try to establish whether we need to take any action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="90119-0021.htm_para8"><a name="0901201000048">The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds raised the issue of collaboration. As he will know, the Bill contains a power&#151;it is not secret&#151;to make collaboration mandatory if it is considered necessary and in the best interests of policing. The mergers debate has gone away, but the debate on the reason for it&#151;the need for greater collaboration between police forces to enable them to tackle serious and organised crime&#151;has not gone away. The hon. Gentleman accused us of running out of ideas, but the Bill seeks to address some of the collaboration issues that must be addressed if we are to tackle some of the serious and organised crimes that are being committed in our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="90119-0021.htm_para9"><a name="0901201000049">The Bill contains other important and valuable measures relating to airport policing, sex offenders and the proceeds of crime, and I commend it to the House.</p>

 I am pleased to have the opportunity to hold today&#146;s Adjournment debate. I seek to persuade the Government to take urgent action to prevent closures, redundancies and loss of investment in companies in the port of Liverpool, which could threaten the city&#146;s regeneration. I know that a similar situation exists in other statutory ports in England and Wales.</p>

 Yes, it also affects ports such as Hull and Grimsby. The problems arise because of mistakes made by the Government&#146;s Valuation Office Agency, part of HM Revenue and Customs. The mistakes are particularly significant because of the current unprecedented economic crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="90119-0022.htm_para6"><a name="0901201000094">I thank Mersey Maritime and the Mersey Dock Rating Group for drawing my attention to this important issue. The problems relate to failings by the VOA in carrying out the change from prescriptive to conventional rating for businesses in the 55 statutory ports, and in their ports review; there was no effective communication with businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="90119-0022.htm_para7"><a name="0901201000095">The changes, to be implemented from 1 April 2005, required the VOA to conduct detailed assessments of hereditaments in every port, and they involved significant redistribution of rates from port operators to companies. That resulted in some companies being rated for the first time. It was not until September 2008&#151;three and a half years later&#151;that the VOA started to instruct local authorities to issue vastly increased backdated rates bills. The bills were backdated over three and a half years, and the demands could not have been anticipated or budgeted for by the companies concerned. Where rates had previously been paid to port operators with the rent, it meant double billing. No impact assessment of the change was made.</p>

 The hon. Lady has been a vigorous campaigner in this area. Will she confirm that the really shameful aspect is that the companies had not been warned while they were negotiating their rents that the change in rates was to take place?</p>

The success of the port of Liverpool is a key part of Liverpool&#146;s regeneration. The port is the No. 1 gateway for UK-USA business and it handles 32.5 per cent. of container trade to the USA. The Merseyside maritime sector has 1,000 companies, employing 26,000 people and generating &#163;2.6 billion in economic output. Local authorities are being asked to levy large  <br>

The annual rateable value of the relevant part of the port of Liverpool was about &#163;16 million before the new system; that will now rise to &#163;16.75 million. There were 43 hereditaments&#151;units of rateable occupation in the port&#151;before the revaluation, but afterwards the figure rose to 127. The real problem has arisen because &#163;10 million of that &#163;16.7 million of rateable value has been redistributed to a group of 70 companies who had no knowledge of what was happening and therefore could not plan for it, and the bill has been backdated over three and half years.</p>

 Faced with the situation that I have described, two stevedoring companies in Liverpool have already closed, with the loss of 27 jobs. A major company faces a 400 per cent. rates increase, with a demand for &#163;2.6 million-worth of backdated liability. One company has received a final demand for &#163;500,000 for 2008-09 and, six weeks after lodging an unanswered appeal, is considering its future. That is the tip of the iceberg. Liverpool&#146;s regeneration is threatened. Members of Parliament from Liverpool and other ports have lobbied Ministers, including my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and the Prime Minister. I am pleased to see in the Chamber this evening many of the MPs who have made representations to Ministers. The Treasury Committee has also considered the issue. Recently, port businesses from all over the country lobbied MPs at a well-attended House of Commons reception.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="90119-0022.htm_para10"><a name="0901201000106">The Government have responded, but their proposal to spread the backdated element over eight years under still unspecified conditions does not resolve the problem. Companies must show how they can meet their liabilities, and anticipating eight years ahead is made particularly problematic by the economic downturn. Companies could not have known about the nature and size of their bills, so could not have incorporated them into their business plans. They cannot do so retrospectively, and it is therefore wrong for the Government to seek retrospective payment from companies that have no way of recouping the cost.</p>

 Although I will not comment on the absence of anybody from the Opposition Front Bench, I remind my hon. Friend that she is surrounded by the intellectual flower and beauty of Humberside en masse. The principle is the same. It is iniquitous, wrong, unfair and unreasonable to demand three and a half years&#146; back payments from companies that were not billed for those rates until 2008. They are being asked to pay them right back to 2005. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will devote some attention to that. Is it moral, fair or reasonable to charge those back payments?</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that another issue needs to be taken into account? Not only are the bills retrospective, but most of the companies think that they have already paid, because they were paying a fee to the port operator&#151;Associated British Ports, or ABP, in Goole&#146;s case and across the Humber ports. Much of the Government&#146;s case on the subject of giving time and revaluing was based on the fact that those companies should seek recompense from ABP and the other port operators. That is simply not going to happen, so the Government&#146;s case is flawed and needs to be reviewed as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="90119-0022.htm_para11"><a name="0901201000111">I support the call for the Government to prescribe the rateable value of premises in the ports concerned at the values set out in the rating list published on 1 April 2005, and to maintain those values until 1 April 2010&#151;the next rating review period. That would address the problem of the backdated bills and the huge unanticipated increases, and would also give an opportunity for proper consultation. It would be ironic if the Government, who are doing so much to support businesses in these unprecedented international circumstances, played a part in risking jobs and investment in the ports through the failings of their agency.</p>

I advocate that further action is a matter of business survival, and a question of justice.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) on securing the debate and on expressing concerns on behalf of businesses in her constituency in the port of Liverpool. As is shown by the interest of my hon. Friends behind her on the Labour Benches, concerns are clearly felt in some other ports among businesses that operate successfully and, particularly over the past decade, have been part of a strong renaissance in our shipping trade and ports industries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="90119-0022.htm_para13"><a name="0901201000114">My hon. Friend raised a number of important points and, in a fair and balanced way, reflected the concerns of port businesses, from which I, too, have heard directly. She and colleagues have raised the matter directly with me and with Treasury Ministers. As she said, they have also raised it with my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="90119-0022.htm_para14"><a name="0901201000115">The impact of the review of rating in ports has not necessarily been uniform and has certainly not caused universal problems, even if it has been generally unwelcome&#151;as any fresh tax liability always is. Some companies certainly believe that the impact could be severe; equally, however, other companies are settling not just their new bills but their backdated bills, in full. I have had reports from some local authorities that companies are beginning to discuss a negotiated schedule of payments, taking advantage of the announcement that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor made in the pre-Budget report in November.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="90119-0022.htm_para15"><a name="0901201000116">Since that announcement almost two months ago, a relatively small number of companies has taken advantage of the special fast-track system that the Valuation Office Agency put in place to deal with inquiries or appeals. Across England and Wales, the VOA has had only 150 inquiries from port businesses since the PBR and only 65 appeals have been lodged. When the number of port businesses affected in the way my hon. Friend explained is 564 in England alone, I have to say that although there are grounds for serious concerns&#151;I shall come to the way in which the Government are trying to help deal with them&#151;the system is not necessarily causing universal problems for all businesses in all ports that have been put on the ratings list for the first time.</p>

Friend&#146;s point about fast-track appeals to the VOA, at least one company in my constituency&#151;RMS, a big company in Goole which operates out of other Humber ports, too&#151;tried to take that route but found the VOA completely unhelpful, so much so that I intervened on the company&#146;s behalf and received a letter from the VOA that could have been written in Swahili from all I could understand. I now have to chair a meeting between the VOA and the companies to try to get things back on course. Surely, the Minister cannot have confidence that the fast-track system is resolving the problem in any way, shape or form.</p>

 I am not saying that it has resolved the problem, but it is an important part of trying to deal with the problems that may be experienced by particular companies. My hon. Friend has been one of the strongest advocates of port companies, not just in his own constituency. If he has particular problems with the VOA not carrying out the undertaking on the fast-track system that it gave me and I gave the House, I should like the details and I will certainly take the matter up for him and any companies experiencing such problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="90119-0022.htm_para17"><a name="0901201000122">We are dealing with two separate problems, and in trying to explain them to my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside, I hope to be able to explain why the sort of solution that she seeks will be difficult, if not impossible, to put in place. The first issue is the move away from the prescribed rating system for statutory port operators. My hon. Friend said that the VOA had made mistakes in undertaking that move. I do not entirely accept that, although it is fair to say that the VOA took too long to prepare the assessment for the new valuation list.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="90119-0022.htm_para18"><a name="0901201000123">The prescribed rating system for large statutory docks and harbours until 31 March 2005 was a method whereby the valuation was determined by reference to a formula set by the Secretary of State, drawing on the income and expenditure of the port operators. In other words, it was not based on the way in which rateable value was established for all other businesses with the valuation list, which is based on the rents that could be charged for those properties. The Government&#146;s decision to end that prescription formed part of a long-term policy to apply conventional valuation across all businesses and industry sectors and to do so fairly and consistently. We first consulted on that in December 2000. We consulted again on a White Paper in December 2001, and we introduced legislation in the Local Government Act 2003. In other words, the move away from the proscribed formula system was a long time in coming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="90119-0022.htm_para19"><a name="0901201000124">There are 55 ports and container terminals in England and Wales, each of which is run by a designated port operator who has responsibility for business rates, except where any part falls to be separately rated. The need for separate rating will depend on the facts of the case, but the key issue is whether the occupier of that separate part or premises within the port precincts is in paramount control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="90119-0022.htm_para20"><a name="0901201000125">I have been told that, as my hon. Friend has argued this evening in the Chamber, a simple solution to the problems caused by the review of rating in the ports would be to return to prescription. I am afraid that that is not the case. The reason is that, even if we were to return to prescription, the properties that are now separately identified as liable for business rates would none the less continue to be separately rated, because that is what the business rates legislation requires. The formula could and only ever did apply to the valuation of the port&#146;s operator, not to the businesses that she rightly and understandably is concerned about tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="90119-0022.htm_para21"><a name="0901201000126">The second issue&#151;this is where the difficulties have been created&#151;was the VOA&#146;s review of ports. That began when it became clear that some properties in Southampton port should have been separately rated but were included instead in the port operator&#146;s assessment under the formula for the 2005 rating list. In other words, the review was separate from the move away from prescription and pursued by the VOA, as part of its statutory duty to maintain an accurate and up-to-date valuation list. It was challenged at the time in court. So it was only in May 2006&#151;once the Southampton case was settled the month before, thus confirming the status of some of those port tenants and the VOA&#146;s approach to valuing them&#151;that the VOA started its review of the 55 major ports in England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="90119-0023.htm_para0"><a name="0901201000127">To be clear, when the VOA becomes aware that change is needed, such as in the ports, it is its legal duty to make the alteration to the ratings list and to specify  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="19 Jan 2009">

<notus-date day="19" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>19 Jan 2009 : Column 600</b><br>
when that listing should take place. If the property existed before the beginning of the valuation list&#151;in other words, from 1 April 2005&#151;and arguably should have been separately rated before then, the VOA has no legal alternative other than to make the effective date 1 April 2005, from the beginning of that list. To do otherwise would require primary legislation. We simply do not have the power to change that by regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="90119-0023.htm_para1"><a name="0901201000128">Effectively, the review has increased the number of properties separately assessed for business rates in ports from 1,616 to 2,180&#151;an extra 564 properties in England. In the meantime, the rateable value of some port operators has been reduced significantly, particularly in some places. In Liverpool, the rateable value for the port operator has been reduced to less than half of the previous rateable value; in Grimsby it has been reduced to almost a third, in Hull to around a third, and in Goole to less than a quarter of the previous rateable value. Across England and Wales, the port operators&#146; rateable value has been reduced by a total of &#163;44 million. At the same time, the changes to the separately assessed properties have raised the total rateable value by &#163;53 million, so the net increase in the rateable value across the ports is just over 4 per cent., taking it from around &#163;200 million to about &#163;209 million. However, as I accepted before the Treasury Committee, and before my hon. Friends, that disguises some big shifts in a small number of ports, about which my hon. Friends are concerned.</p>

<p><a name="st_o402"><a name="0901201000129"><a name="90119-0023.htm_spnew0"><a name="0901201000229"><b>Mrs. Ellman:</b>
 May I remind my right hon. Friend that in the port of Liverpool, the change has been concentrated on 70 companies, which now face major financial problems? We are seeking an equitable solution to that problem.</p>

<p><a name="st_o403"><a name="0901201000130"><a name="90119-0023.htm_spnew1"><a name="0901201000230"><b>John Healey:</b>
 Precisely so. The information that I was able to give the Treasury Committee is that the number of properties separately assessed within the port of Liverpool is now 91. I know from direct discussions with some of those port businesses, their lobby groups and my hon. Friends that there are two perceived unfairnesses. First, as my hon. Friends the Members for Liverpool, Riverside and for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) said, there are large backdated liabilities, and companies argue that they could not have made business provision to cover the costs of those liabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="90119-0023.htm_para2"><a name="0901201000131">Secondly, companies believe that they have already been making payments on business rates as part of their contractual fee to the port operator. I have to say to my hon. Friends that I have seen only one contract with any reference to business rates, and that is ambiguous. In other words, the contract does not explicitly say that where the property is not separately listed, the port operator will pay the relevant rates and recover them from the occupier. That being said, in my view, port companies that legitimately believe that they have contributed towards rates by means of payments made through the cumulo or through fees to the port operator should take the matter up with the operator. That is a private contractual matter, and I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside would accept that it is not possible&#151;</p>

 Finally, I accept that now that the full facts are available as a result of the review, the tax liability has been established in the cases in question. We cannot undo what has been established.
