recognise that the network is not being used as it once was by people
in both urban and rural areas. Customers have voted with their feet.
The loss to the network started long before 1993, the changes regarding
the Post Office card account and the direct payment of benefits. If the
Government are to act responsibly, they must ensure that they get the
maximum benefit to people through services. However, they must examine
new ways of delivering those services, such as through the internet, as
the customer demands that we should. We need to meet customers&#146;

European partners to establish an EU framework to reduce the emissions

that there is no current prospect of replacing aviation kerosene with a
low or zero-carbon fuel. There is therefore a danger that, under an
emissions trading scheme, the aviation industry will simply purchase
credits from other sectors that have succeeded in making cuts, without
doing so itself. Does he agree that much greater pressure must be
brought to bear to boost scientific research into aviation fuels and
engines, so that the industry itself can contribute to significant cuts
in the future?</p><p><a name="060518114000050"><b><a name="060518114000514">Ian

The UK is one of the few countries that is on target to meet its Kyoto
commitments. I am proud of that fact. The climate change programme that
we published in March sets out a range of actions. We have set a
direction of travel for the UK that is leading the world. We need now
to continue to push internationally to get other countries to follow
the same policies as those of the United Kingdom. That action is needed

scale of the challenge that is posed by aviation emissions? Everyone
knows that the problem at present is quite small, but statistics show
that emissions are growing by about 12 per cent. a year. Assuming that
we meet the 60 per cent. total emission reduction target by 2050, and
using figures based on public transport forecasts and those of the
Treasury, aviation emissions are on track to represent about 60 per
cent. of the UK total by 2050. That calculation is supported by the
Environment Audit Committee and by the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution.</p><p><a name="060518114000056">So far, the
Government&#146;s position, first, has been to leave aviation
emissions out of the calculations, which is clearly untenable.
Secondly, they hope&#151;we have heard about this again this
morning&#151;that aviation can be included in the troubled EU
emissions trading scheme. If that proves impossible, is there a plan
B?</p><p><a name="060518114000057"><b><a name="060518114000518">Ian

will want to say something about that
shortly.</p><p><a name="060518114000058">The hon.
Gentleman is right that we want to see aviation fuel as part of an
emissions trading scheme. We need to take action on aviation fuel. That
is why, through the United Nations framework convention on climate
change and the International Civil Aviation Organisation, we are
pushing as the United Kingdom to ensure that international action is
taken. International industries need international solutions. That is
why it is so important that we take this action. It is right that
aviation fuel represents about only 5 per cent. of UK emissions, but
the use of it is planned to increase. That is why we need to take
urgent action. We need to commit ourselves
internationally.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1120</b><br><h3 align="center"><a name="060518114000019">Single Farm

resolve. In April, officials wrote to the European Commission asking
for an extension but, at the same time, the previous Secretary of State

There was no technical reason why partial payments could not have been

the scheme was on track. When it became clear that it was off track we
had to take emergency measures. I hope that farmers in his constituency
have received partial payments, as 31,000 have been made. By the middle
of April, it was appropriate to approach the European
Commission&#151;officials have done so, and we await a reply. Our
priority is obviously to make sure that the payments are made. There
are about 3,700 large claims that are still waiting to be
made&#151;the figure is down from the 5,000 a week ago&#151;and a
remaining 20 per cent. payment must be made to the 31,000 farmers who
have received partial payments. Finally, there is the question of small
claims of less than &#8364;1,000. More than half of the claimants in
that category&#151;about 40,000 or so&#151;have received payment,

The debacle over the single farm payment has caused hardship for many

chief executive has been moved, my neighbour and friend, Lord Bach, has
been sacked and, bizarrely, the previous Secretary of State was

our Department that we are proud of the work of British farmers, that
the British food that they produce is top quality, and that we are

served with him in government understood his ability in that context
and as a parliamentarian. I welcome the Secretary of State to his new
responsibility. He takes over at a time when the distrust of Government
by farmers is probably at its lowest ebb since
1947&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> I am delighted that hon. Members
take such pleasure in the distrust of Government by farmers. The
partial payments are welcome, though long overdue, and the Minister has
just said that the 5,000-odd complex cases have been reduced to 3,700,
which I am glad to hear, but those&#151;they are all large
farmers&#151;have received nothing. Also, as the Secretary of State
will know, by last Monday farmers were required to claim this
year&#146;s for payment on their entitlements, even though the vast
majority have not had their entitlements validated, so their difficulty
in filling in an accurate form is obvious. As he has asked for the
extension to the payment window, why does he not also ask for an
extension to this year&#146;s claim date, as Poland has already done,
so that those claims can be based on validated entitlements, otherwise
he will face thousands of individual disputes next year about why
claims have been incorrectly submitted, based on false evidence and
false information from the Rural Payments
Agency?</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1123</b><br><p><a name="060518114000077"><b><a name="060518114000535">David

debating whether climate change is happening. As a result, due in
significant part to the leadership of the Government in the G8 and the
EU presidency, we are moving from a debate about whether climate change

is an important contributor to renewable energy, with potential

and evaluating different policy proposals. Biomass can play an
important part in reaching our renewables targets. The biomass
taskforce estimates it has the potential to supply 6 per cent. of our
electricity needs by 2020. Only last week, I went round
Talbott&#146;s in Stafford, which is a world leader in producing
biomass power plant. A lot can be done with these resources, and it is

DEFRA to address the widespread ignorance, both inside and outside the

present policy remains unchanged, we shall become heavily dependent on
imported gas, moving from being 80 to 90 per cent. self-reliant to
being 80 to 90 per cent. dependent. He said that that meant that the
replacement of nuclear power stations, along with a big push towards
renewables and a step change in energy efficiency, engaging businesses
and consumers, were all back on the agenda. The energy review is
looking at all 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1126</b><br>those issues, and it will come up with a balanced result. Biomass can be
part of the overall picture. Sir Ben Gill&#146;s report says that it
has the potential to provide 6 per cent. of our energy needs by 2020,
and that is very much to be welcomed. The figure is only 1 per cent. at
the moment, so we have a long way to go if we are to achieve that, but
important developments are taking place with biomass and biofuels that

the Minister makes all the right noises about biomass, but the complete
opposite is happening on the ground. Hon. Members might have seen the
hysterical scare stories I yesterday&#146;s newspapers about the
amount of carbon dioxide being released from Drax power station. Up to
April, however, the power station was co-firing coal with biomass up to
a rate of 25 per cent. However, the regulations that were imposed from
1 April this year have reduced the biomass element of the co-firing to
15 per cent. Will my hon. Friend look again at those regulations, to
see whether we can increase the levels permitted in co-firing, or move
to complete biomass
firing?</p><p><a name="060518114000104"><b><a name="060518114000558">Ian

high-energy-consuming industries to give themselves a longer-term
future by considering biomass as an alternative energy source? That is
the case in my constituency of Glenrothes, where Tullis Russell is
trying to process such ideas. One of the main difficulties is gaining
access to the national grid, which takes an extraordinary amount of
time compared with the time it takes to get the initiative developed.
Therefore, a gap exists, which is unhealthy and discouraging to the
initiative taking place. Will he consider those points in due
course?</p><p><a name="060518114000109"><b><a name="060518114000562">Ian

and access charges that are important and which we are looking at as
part of our future policy on biomass, but my hon. Friend is right to
point out that there is a growing industry here and growing interest in
biomass. There is also an interest from growers in growing energy
crops, whether it be Miscanthus or short rotation coppice willow. We
need to ensure that we can help to drive the market in those renewable
energy projects. The introduction of new building regulations from
April this year, as well as new procedures and tougher standards as
part of that, can be helpful in getting more companies and public

would have seen the explanation: there were 5,000 particularly complex
cases in which partial payment was not possible, but we had given

20 per cent. by 2012. An industry-led champions group, including other

it.</p><p><a name="060518114000140"><b><a name="060518114000587">David
Tredinnick:</b> That was a disappointing reply. Is it not a
fact that the number of UK food miles has increased owing to the
inexcusable chaos of single farm payments in the Department?
Leicestershire farmers are struggling, at the mercy of their bank
managers and unable even to pay for fertilisers to make their crops
grow. Has that not increased the UK food miles problem? What is the
Minister doing to help farmers to distribute UK food through
farmers&#146; markets such as the one in Hinckley and the new one

that the single farm payment is responsible for the increase in food
miles. We are trying to work closely with the industry to improve
resource efficiency, which will enable us to address the food miles
problem. Clearly, one issue is people driving to supermarkets and shops
to buy their goods, but we must also consider the carbon dioxide
emissions produced by HGVs. The

produce&#146;s country of origin is Kenya, and that produce is beans,
one can draw one&#146;s own conclusions. I am very attracted to the
idea that we should buy more local produce, and farmers&#146;
markets, to which reference has been made, are an extremely worthwhile
initiative in that regard. The more that we can buy local and source

May:</b> I thank the Leader of the House for giving us the
business for the coming week and I echo the sentiments he expressed
about my late right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst
(Mr. Forth). It was with deep shock and sadness that I and my right
hon. and hon. Friends learned this morning of Eric&#146;s untimely
death. Eric was a former shadow Leader of the House and his skirmishes
each week with the late Robin Cook became legendary. Eric was above all
a great parliamentarian, who loved this place and all it stood for.
Never a man to pull his punches and not always beloved of the Whips or,
dare I say it, Front Benchers, he was a great asset to this House. More
than that, many in this House across all parties have lost not only a
great colleague, but a friend. The life of this House will be the
lesser for his passing. It was a mark of the man and his personality,
to which the Leader of the House alluded, that the staff of the Tea
Room expressed their tremendous sadness this morning, too. He had been
a friend to them, not just to Members of Parliament. We have lost a
great parliamentarian and 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1136</b><br>we all mourn his loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife,
Carroll, and his family, friends and constituents.</p><p><a name="060518114000167">I am sure that the Leader of
the House is aware of the importance of a good conclusion to the Doha
round of world trade talks, not only for this country, but for the
whole developing world. May we have a debate on world trade so that we
can explore the Government&#146;s position and ensure that they are
putting sufficient pressure for the right conclusion of this round of
trade talks on the European Trade
Commissioner?</p><p><a name="060518114000168">This
week, it has been announced that 573 jobs will be lost at NHS Direct,
in addition to the thousands of jobs being lost in hospitals across the
country. May we have a statement from the Secretary of State for Heath
on the future of NHS Direct?</p><p><a name="060518114000169">However, that is not the only
part of the NHS that is suffering financial problems. For example, the
Thames Valley strategic health authority already gets 21 per cent. less
funding than the average, and it has admitted that that has resulted in
fewer operations and less patient care. In a presentation to the board
last week, the SHA&#146;s chief executive revealed that introducing a
national standard tariff across the NHS would mean that it would cost
Thames Valley PCTs &#163;70 million extra a year to provide the same
services&#151;there would be no gain in activity or in the services
provided. That is just one example, so it is little wonder that people
ask where all the money has gone. Therefore, may we also have a debate
on the future funding of NHS trusts and the impact of the standard
tariff?</p><p><a name="060518114000170">That is the
NHS that the Health Secretary said had had its best year
ever&#151;where on earth has she been? But that is not the only area
where the Government are in denial. The head of the civil service has
said of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate&#146;s work on
asylum that it has &#147;been performing particularly well&#148;,
and the Prime Minster wrote to the incoming Home Secretary advising him
to &#147;continue and accelerate&#148; the success of the
Government&#146;s immigration and asylum
policies.</p><p><a name="060518114000171">That is the
same Home Office where only 16 per cent. of officials have confidence
in senior management. The director of enforcement and renewals at the
Immigration and Nationality Directorate was asked by the Home Affairs
Committee how many people were in Britain illegally. He
said:</p><a name="060518114000460"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I
haven&#146;t the faintest
idea&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="060518114000172">When asked how
many people had been removed when all their appeal processes had been
exhausted, he
said:</p><a name="060518114000461"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
don&#146;t track individual
cases&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="060518114000173">Therefore, can
we have a debate on the chaos in the Government&#146;s prisons and
immigration
polices?</p><p><a name="060518114000174">Perhaps that
is why, in a recent speech, the Prime Minister revealed that he was
asking the Chancellor to examine how the Treasury could be involved in
ensuring the protection and security of the public. When asked if that
meant that the Home Secretary would have to refer to the Chancellor
before making any decisions, the Downing street spokesman
said:</p><a name="060518114000462"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;No. The
Home Secretary and the Chancellor will have a normal
relationship&#148;.</p></ul><br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1137</b><br><p><a name="060518114000175">Presumably that will be in contrast to
the relationship between the Chancellor and the Prime Minister. Up
until now, the Chancellor has been the roadblock to reform, so can we
have a debate in his future role in public sector
reform?</p><p><a name="060518114000176">Finally, in
an article in the <i> Eastern Daily Press</i>, the sacked former Home
Secretary said of the recent
reshuffle:</p><a name="060518114000463"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I
thought the point was to give a clear sense of redirection for the
Government but, in the end, it hasn&#146;t worked out like
that.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="060518114000177">So the former
Home Secretary says that the Government lack direction, the Health
Secretary is in denial, and the Home Office is in meltdown&#151;no
wonder that this is a Government in
paralysis.</p><p><a name="060518114000178"><b><a name="060518114000605">Mr.
Straw:</b> I shall deal in turn with the points raised by the
right hon. Lady. We are doing a great deal to apply pressure where that
is required, as I can confirm from my five years as Foreign Secretary.
We took the lead in the EU in pushing for an end to unacceptably high
and restrictive subsidies to farmers across Europe. My right hon.
Friend the Foreign Secretary used to be Secretary of State for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and was in the lead negotiating the
deal on the future of the common agricultural
policy.</p><p><a name="060518114000179">In addition,
we are also pushing the US and other key partners in the Doha round,
and especially the much larger states from the non-aligned movement,
such as India and Brazil. Those states must also make some movement,
and especially in respect of non-agricultural market access. I assure
the shadow Leader of the House that there will be an opportunity to
debate these matters in the regular six-monthly debate due to take
place just before the European Council in mid-June. That will be a full
day&#146;s debate, and I hope that she and the rest of the House will
take that opportunity to discuss the matters that she has raised and
other key foreign policy issues coming up before the Council, such as
Iraq, Iran and the funding of
Hamas.</p><p><a name="060518114000180">The right hon.
Lady asks about the health service. She is not correct in claiming that
thousands of people will lose their jobs under changes in NHS funding.
She asks where the money has gone. It has gone, first, on dramatic
increases in the number of clinical staff in the health service.
Overall, there has been an increase of 85,000 in the total number of
nurses in the health service, including an increase of nearly 3,000 in
the health area covering her constituency.</p><p><a name="060518114000181">Secondly, the money has gone
on ensuring that nurses and other clinical staff are better paid. The
number of nurses has increased by well over a quarter since 1997 and,
alongside that, the pay of nurses, in real terms after inflation, has
also increased by over a
quarter.</p><p><a name="060518114000182">Thirdly, the
money has gone on new hospital buildings, to an astonishing degree,
including in my constituency and in most constituencies in the country.
Fourthly, it has gone on equipment. That is why there are difficulties
with the health service&#151;there always will be&#151;but overall,
on the question of whether the health service is doing the job for
which the taxpayer is paying: yes it is, which is why levels of patient

<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1138</b><br>satisfaction are higher and why overall, on any measure, patients are
receiving better care faster, and mortality and morbidity rates all
show improvement.</p><p><a name="060518114000183">The
right hon. Lady asks about asylum and immigration. Asylum numbers are
significantly lower than when we came into office in 1997. I have every
reason to remember the catastrophic record of the right hon. and
learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), who had ordered a
computer system, failed to finance it properly and, at a time when
numbers of asylum seekers were rising, slashed by 1,200 the number of
staff in the immigration and nationality department dealing with asylum
seekers. On top of that, he had declared an amnesty in which 30,000 of
those people were allowed to stay in the country without further proper
inquiry.</p><p><a name="060518114000184">Numbers are
now down, and we have passed the tipping point where the numbers
leaving the country are higher than the numbers applying to stay. We
have reduced the time taken to process applications from20
months to about two
months.</p><p><a name="060518114000185">On the number
of illegal asylum seekers, the Prime Minister reminded the House
yesterday of the
following:</p><a name="060518114000464"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;&#145;There
are no official estimates of the number of illegal immigrants into the
United Kingdom. By its very nature, illegal immigration is difficult to
measure and any estimates would be highly
speculative.&#146;&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 17 May
2006; Vol. 446,c.
991.]</p></ul><p><a name="060518114000186">That is what the right
hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe said in 1995. There
are slightly better estimates these days, following work by Professor
Salt for the research and information directorate of the Home Office,
who estimated that the total number of people who are wholly illegal
was between 310,000 and 500,000. Those are not asylum seekers; we know
how many asylum seekers there are.</p><p><a name="060518114000187">I am glad to see the shadow
Home Secretary sitting next to the right hon. Lady. Whatever other
promises he makes at the next election about how life will be so much
better when he becomes Home Secretary&#151;that every prisoner will
become compliant, every criminal will stop committing crime and,
probably much easier to achieve, that there will be no illegal
immigrants because they will be scared off by the disaster of the
Conservative Government&#151;I strongly advise him not to claim that
he will be able to produce an accurate estimate of the total number of
illegal immigrants. That would be very unwise, as he knows. Why?
Because people who are wholly illegally in this country, as in every
other country, have escaped immigration control and thus, by
definition, do not appear on any database. No country in the world has
accurate figures for wholly illegal immigration: not the United States
and not the country held up as having the greatest and most efficient
system of law and order in Europe&#151;if not the highest respect for
human rights&#151;namely, France. The French have hundreds of
thousands of people who are &#147;sans papiers.&#148; They do not
know the numbers and they do not take much interest in
them.</p><p><a name="060518114000188"><b><a name="060518114000606">Anne

anything, and behind the undoubted style, there was real substance. He
was an ornament to the House, and he will be sorely
missed.</p><p><a name="060518114000191">May we have
an urgent debate on nuclear power in this country? It is clearly no
good waiting for the results of the energy review, because the Prime
Minister has transparently decided to pre-empt the results of that
review. Therefore, given the reservations that have been expressed,
quite openly, by a former Minister in the Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs and the fact that the Treasury has said that the
costs are likely to be eye-wateringly large, is it not time that the
whole House had an opportunity to debate the
matter?</p><p><a name="060518114000192">If and when
orders are introduced for the regionalisation of police
forces&#151;given the difficulties that have been experienced over

was two weeks ago, I think, that the Government was reshuffled, but
still no list of ministerial responsibilities is available. Can the
Leader of the House sort that out? We apparently now know what the
Deputy Prime Minister is doing, but it would be nice to see which
Ministers feel that they have which responsibilities, so that we can
perhaps hold them to account rather better than we would
otherwise.</p><p><a name="060518114000194">Lastly,
may we have a debate on the Human Rights Act 1998? Two weeks ago, the
problem was the then Home Secretary; now it seems that everything is
down to the exercise of the Human Rights Act. Frankly, the Prime
Minister has been saying some very silly things about that Act over
recent weeks. Given that some of us believe that the finest achievement
of the Leader of the House, when he was Home Secretary, was to
introduce the Human Rights Act, may we have a debate to defend the

be a debate on the issue, but the energy review will be published and
then, in due course, there will be a debate on this country&#146;s
future energy needs, including the role that nuclear power should play.
Let me point out to the hon. Gentleman that people forget that nuclear
energy currently plays an extraordinarily important part in energy
generation. It accounts for
75<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption</i><i> ]</i>&#151;terra-watt hours.
I am learning.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1140</b><br><p><a name="060518114000196"><b><a name="060518114000610">Mr.

20 per cent. of total electricity generation. The hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) will know that, because of the decline
in North sea production of gas in particular and oil, unless we take
other steps to rebalance the generation of energy, including nuclear
power, we will become quite unnecessarily reliant on overseas sources
of energy. He will also know that the idea that renewables could
possibly replace the loss of generating capacity from nuclear power is
simply not the case. Even in a country such as Germany that has huge
numbers of wind farms&#151;far more than I think would ever be found
acceptable here; its generation of electricity by wind is only a third
of that generated by nuclear power in this
country.</p><p><a name="060518114000198">On the
regionalisation of police forces, the orders will go through the House
in the normal way. I cannot recall the procedure exactly, but I think
that many of them will be taken upstairs. On the reorganisation of
police forces, I know, as a former Home Secretary&#151;everybody in
the House knows it&#151;there is simply no necessary connection
between the efficiency of a police service, the degree to which the
service is delivered at a local level and the overall size of the
constabulary. Moreover, the current boundaries were in effect settled
following the royal commission report on the police in the early 1960s.
Forty years on is not too short a time to reconfigure police force
boundaries to take account of the dramatic changes in our social
structure in the meantime.</p><p><a name="060518114000199">On a list of ministerial
responsibilities, there are in the Library of the House and available
on the website letters that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has
sent to each departmental Minister setting out responsibilities. The
detailed list of ministerial responsibilities will be published in the

became Leader of the House, I cannot say that the absence of the list
has caused any difficulty whatsoever to either Ministers or
Members.</p><p><a name="060518114000200">On the
Human Rights Act, the hon. Gentleman says that it was the finest thing
that I ever did as Home Secretary. If he does not mind, I would like to

the bathwater, but look sensibly&#151;which is what the Prime

stout defender of the role of the House of Commons and a great House of
Commons man. Not everyone in the House may realise, as I did as his
neighbour, that, in many ways, he was an old softie at heart. The
comments made by the shadow Leader of the House about the reaction in
the Tea Room re-enforced that. He was a very good neighbour to me and
when I faced some difficulty in the last general election, he was the
first to come and help out. He was there early in the morning; no
nonsense, getting on with it and saying, &#147;I will deliver

outstanding independence of spirit. He will be greatly

easy subject or comfortable for other G8 partners, but precisely
because the subject was difficult and he believed that all G8 partners
needed to do more on climate change&#151;he actually forced them to
do so. I could give my hon. Friend all the numbers. He said that we
have cut emissions. Our scheme reduced emissions by 1.5 million tonnes
between 2002 and 2004. However, this is an international problem. Even
if we were to abolish our emissions altogether, without international
action by other parties, including, especially, the United States,

on the subject was illustrated by the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s
answer, in which he managed to ignore microgeneration and energy
efficiency measures, both of which would be interfered with by a
decision to go nuclear. Will he comment on the view that seems to be
coming from Downing street that that vastly important and potentially
dangerous change in energy policy might be achieved without primary
legislation? Will he ensure, not only that there is a full debate in
the House on the change, but that the House has an opportunity to vote
on it?</p><p><a name="060518114000234"><b><a name="060518114000638">Mr.
Straw:</b> The legislative base for any increase in nuclear
generating capacity will of course be clear, but there is little point
in the House wasting its time legislating in respect of powers that
already exist. It is a classic Liberal Democratic approach: never mind
the demands for new laws that are needed; let us debate laws that are
not needed. There will of course be debates on the energy review and
the White Paper when it is
published.</p><p><a name="060518114000235">The hon.
Gentleman represents Cambridge, which is one of the key bases of this
country&#146;s scientific establishment, where much of the work on
nuclear energy was
developed&#151;</p><p><a name="060518114000236"><b><a name="060518114000639">David

renewables.</p><p><a name="060518114000237"><b><a name="060518114000640">Mr.
Straw:</b> And renewables. I have to say that I would find the
Liberal Democrats&#146; claims that they oppose all nuclear and want
only renewables more convincing if, at local level, they were more
consistent in respect of planning permission for wind farms. I
recollect that they oppose almost all planning applications for wind
farms and for developments of other renewable sources of
energy.</p><p><a name="060518114000238"><b><a name="060518114000641">Jim

Forth. If there is life after death, I can look forward to enjoying
exchanges with him and the late Robin Cook.</p><p><a name="060518114000239">A former Member of this House
who is still a Member of the other place was given a lengthy prison
sentence for acting irresponsibly and endangering people&#146;s
lives, but when company directors act irresponsibly and not only
endanger people&#146;s lives, but cause their employees and other
people to lose their lives, they are given a paltry fine, which is
probably tax deductible. What are the Government doing to end that
unfair and inconsistent practice and to right that
wrong?</p><p><a name="060518114000240"><b><a name="060518114000642">Mr.
Straw:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his question. In fact, a
quite high level of responsibility is imposed on company directors, and
that has increased. Whether we should amend the law in respect of
corporate manslaughter is a separate issue, and my hon. Friend may be
aware that our right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home
Department has plans to do that. He is considering legislation, but is
anxious to ensure that it is fair both to victims and potential victims
and to company directors.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1147</b><br><p><a name="060518114000241"><b><a name="060518114000643">Mr.
Nicholas Soames (Mid-Sussex) (Con):</b> May I thank the right
hon. Gentleman for his handsome and generous tribute to my right hon.
Friend, the late Eric Forth? As others have said, the important thing
about Eric Forth is that he was deadly serious about defending the
rights and freedoms that over the generations this House has hard won
from over-mighty Executives, and he believed, rightly, that we should
do that better. We shall genuinely miss him.</p><p><a name="060518114000242">The Leader of the House will,
I am sure, have heard that I am to chair a big public meeting in East
Grinstead tomorrow night, as part of the formal consultation on the
Government&#146;s wicked plan to impose excess further housing in the
south-east of England. Does he agree that, by any stretch of the
imagination, the scale of the developments is clearly in breach of the
Government&#146;s own benchmark for sustainability? Given the points
made by my hon. Friend the Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth)
yesterday in his urgent question on the water supply, and given the
inadequacy of the roads and railways and the fact that public services
in the area are extremely overstretched, will the right hon. Gentleman
ensure that we in this House have a chance to debate the
infrastructure&#146;s inability to keep up with the
Government&#146;s plans for increased house building in the south of
England, particularly in
Mid-Sussex?</p><p><a name="060518114000243"><b><a name="060518114000644">Mr.
Straw:</b> First, I thank the hon. Gentleman for his tribute
in respect of Eric Forth. The reason why the tributes have been so full
is that Eric Forth cared about this place. In my judgment, caring about
Parliament is not a matter of sentiment; it is absolutely fundamental
to the working of our democracy and to good government.</p><p><a name="060518114000244">Of course I had heard that the
hon. Gentleman is to speak at the meeting tomorrow night. I am pleased
to say that the news had even reached Blackburn, and I believe that
train reservations are in hand.</p><p><a name="060518114000245">I noticed a flicker of a smile
cross the hon. Gentleman&#146;s lips as he described the plans as
&#147;wicked&#148;. Let me say to him and to other
Members&#151;particularly Opposition Members&#151;who represent
rural and suburban constituencies in the south-east that nothing would
please Environment Ministers more than if no plans were necessary to
increase the number of available houses in the south-east. The truth
is, however, that demand for housing in the south-east greatly exceeds
supply. I wish that many of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents
would recognise the attractions of the north-west, including my
Blackburn constituency, and move there, but they are not going to. The
choice for the Government, for him, for his local authority and for
every other Member of the House is between allowing a dramatic and
continuing increase in house prices to squeeze out the very people who
need to live in those areas, and ensuring a sensible increase in
housing so that prices decrease and those who live in those areas are
able to stay there. That is the choice, and the debate is not helped by
the use of extravagant adjectives. Every house in the country was new
at one time.</p><p><a name="060518114000246"><b><a name="060518114000645">Sir

well merited. May I ask the Leader of the House, who gave a most
generous personal tribute, to arrange a debate on how the authority of
this House and the authority of the Government and the Executive might
be rebalanced? There could be no better tribute to the late Eric Forth

talking about over-mighty Governments, particularly during the period
of the Major Government. <i> [</i><i> Laughter.</i><i> ]</i></p><p><a name="060518114000248">The hon. Gentleman, as a
former Chairman of the Procedure Committee and a member of the
Modernisation Committee, will know that there are many opportunities to
debate that subject. He will also know that, in a public session of the
Modernisation Committee yesterday, we received evidence from three
academics, one of whom made the point that the accountability of
Ministers to Parliament had been strengthened significantly in the past
50 years, not least through the introduction 25 years ago of the Select
Committee process. I am strongly in favour of improving the
accountability, and the perception of accountability, of Ministers, but
we must not believe that the position has worsened in the past 50 years
when, in fact, it has got significantly
better.</p><p><a name="060518114000249"><b><a name="060518114000647">Mr.
Philip Hollobone (Kettering) (Con):</b> On BBC2&#146;s
&#147;Newsnight&#148; last night, the Minister for Immigration,
Citizenship and Nationality said that it would take at least 10 years
to clear the backlog of illegal immigrants in this country. Residents
of my Kettering constituency and elsewhere think that it is scandalous
that those in government who are supposed to defend our country and
protect our borders seem to be completely unable to do so. I join my
right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) in calling for
an urgent debate on immigration and asylum in this
country.</p><p><a name="060518114000250"><b><a name="060518114000648">Mr.

but if the Opposition feel really exercised about it, they have a
number of Opposition days coming up, which I am sure that they will put
to good use. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>I see the Opposition
Chief Whip confirm that. I am always happy to suggest subjects to the
Opposition for their debating time.</p><p><a name="060518114000251">I point out to the hon.
Gentleman that my hon. Friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship
and Nationality gave that time scale because of the time that it will
take to introduce the e-borders arrangements, so that we have accurate
data on the numbers going in and coming out of the country.</p><p><a name="060518114000252">I hope that the hon. Gentleman
tells his constituents that in 1996, the then Home Secretary, the right
hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe(Mr. Howard),
decided to abandon disembarkation controls in Dover and other ports,
which covered about 40 per cent. of those leaving the country. He also
got rid of all the staff and the budget for them. When I became Home
Secretary, it was clear that there was no point in maintaining
embarkation controls in respect of 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1149</b><br>the other 60 per cent. because people who wanted to leave illegally
would go through the other ports. The system that the Conservatives had
maintained meant that even when disembarkation cards were taken off
people, they were put in a room and nothing was done with
them.</p><p><a name="060518114000253">We must change
the system, and that is what the Government are seeking to do. I wish
that there had been slightly more help from the Opposition in respect
of part of these arrangements, especially on identity
cards.</p><p><a name="060518114000254"><b><a name="060518114000649">Pete
Wishart (Perth and North Perthshire) (SNP):</b> I associate
myself and my hon. Friends with the glowing tributes to Eric Forth.
When showing new Members round the House, I would always point out Eric
Forth, and the description &#147;colourful character&#148; would
always feature.</p><p><a name="060518114000255">I do
not know whether the Leader of the House saw the programme on the BBC
over the weekend that showed that 52 per cent. of the British public
believe that a Scottish Members should no longer be able to become
Prime Minister. I am certainly sure that it was not missed by No. 11.
Does not this show that the public are way ahead of the House and the
Government in their thinking about the role of Scottish Members? Should
we not have a proper, grown-up debate about the role of us Scots MPs so
that we get up to speed with the public on this
issue?</p><p><a name="060518114000256"><b><a name="060518114000650">Mr.
Straw:</b> The hon. Gentleman has a particular view; he would
like to see Scotland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom.
That is not the view taken by the vast majority of people in Scotland,
nor is it the view taken by the vast majority of people in the United
Kingdom. We should celebrate our Britishness. A Prime Minister is the
Prime Minister for the entire United Kingdom&#151;that is Great
Britain, including Scotland and Northern Ireland. It seems to me that
where he or she happens to come from is entirely
irrelevant.</p><p><a name="060518114000257"><b><a name="060518114000651">Mr.

He was a politician who always made himself available to new Members to
give them, as he would put it, good advice.</p><p><a name="060518114000258">You have probably read, as I
have, Mr. Speaker, the interview of the Leader of the House in <i> The
Times</i> of two days ago. I welcome the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s
aspirations about petitions receiving a certain amount of action rather
than just a response. Will he extend that principle to popular
early-day motions, which currently receive no Government response or
debate in the
House?</p><p><a name="060518114000259"><b><a name="060518114000652">Mr.

<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1150</b><br>understand that the Scottish Parliament has a good system in place for
dealing with petitions that are signed by a significant number of
Members. It was my instinct to raise the matter before the
Modernisation Committee, and, subject to what colleagues on that
Committee and other Members believe to be right, to ensure that we take
more seriously petitions that are often painstakingly drawn up, with
the support of many constituents and other people throughout the
country. I think that that is
straightforward.</p><p><a name="060518114000260">An
inquiry is taking place into the future of early-day motions. That is a
matter for the House and certainly not one for the Government. It is a
tricky issue because they are used for serious national issues, serious
constituency issues and trivial issues such as the success or failure
of Burnley football

Government have reinstated structures in the national health service
that they got rid of eight years ago, can we have a debate to reflect
the real concerns of health practitioners in our constituencies who are
concerned about the culture of continual change in the NHS. They just
want a period of calm. They would like us to have the opportunity to
reflect that in Parliament in the presence of Ministers. May we have
such a
debate?</p><p><a name="060518114000263"><b><a name="060518114000654">Mr.

service&#151;on what we have done nationally and on what happens
locally. I hope very much that in such debates, Opposition Members,
including those who are new, will be honest enough to talk about the
state that the NHS would have been in had Conservative spending plans
continued, and had the Government accepted their advice when each
year&#151;almost without exception&#151;they voted against the
spending plans proposed by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the
Exchequer. If Conservative spending plans had continued, there would
not have been the dramatic increase in the numbers of nurses, doctors
and other clinicians&#151;there has been an 85,000 increase in the
number of nurses. There would also not have been a dramatic
increase&#151;it was increased by more than a quarter&#151;in the
real pay of nurses. Instead, there would have been the same stagnation
in the health service, and, as a result, there would have been lower
delivery of care for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents and for

Minister on 30 March that the pay increases for Members of Parliament
for 2006-07 should be staged, with the full increase being deferred
until 1 November rather than being payable from 1 April last. The
proposal is made in the context of the Government&#146;s response to
the 28th report of the Senior Salaries Review Body, which provides that
the award to the senior civil service, to which Members&#146; pay is

that the increase in these salaries too should be
staged.</p><p><a name="060518114000275">Under these
proposals, the salary of a Member of Parliament will be &#163;59,686
from 1 April and &#163;60,277 from 1 November. The principle of
linkage to the senior civil service pay bands, agreed by the House in
1996, followed earlier systems of linkage. It was intended to avoid the
need for a major debate on Members&#146; pay on every occasion when
pay needed to be adjusted. However, the system agreed does not cover
the present situation, because the pay bands to which our pay is linked
would have risen by the full 2 per cent. from 1 April. If nothing
further were done, our pay would rise by 2 per cent. from that date,
even though this would not be the case in practice for most of the
senior civil
service.</p><p><a name="060518114000276">When he

than that if other factors&#151;employers&#146; national insurance

comparators in both the public and the private sector. Does the Leader
of the House accept that Members&#146; pay is 20 per cent. behind the
comparators to which it has been linked by the SSRB? Is that fair in
the short, medium or long term for hon. Members? Will it encourage

out of kilter with the comparators, so I accept the strength of that
argument.</p><p><a name="060518114000281">In its

aspire to hold office&#151;that should include Ministers. At the same
time, however, I am struck by the high calibre of members of all
parties who entered the House in 2001 and 2005, notwithstanding the
pay, and the cynical press that Members of Parliament generally
receive. However, if pay does not keep pace with the comparators,

chairman shortly&#151;I will make that known to the House. However, I
have every reason to believe that there will be a full review next
year&#151;and that view is being confirmed by the nods of officials

Parliament are in a unique position? Members entering the House for the
first time&#151;there were many such Members at the last
election&#151;receive the same pay as a Member of Parliament who has
served in the House for 25, 30, 35 or even 40 years. It is important
that Members&#146; pay keep pace with the comparators, otherwise
there is a grave unfairness for Members who serve with loyalty and
distinction in the House. I include the Leader of the House in that
category.</p><p><a name="060518114000289"><b><a name="060518114000672">Mr.
Straw:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I have
received a note saying that the review was to be commissioned this
year, and will report next year. I have rather fewer complaints about
my pay because, as I am a member of the Cabinet, it is little more than
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s. I hope that the review will look at the
issue of whether there should be an age and experience-related band, as
it is perfectly possible to construct a series of
steps&#151;</p><p><a name="060518114000290"><b><a name="060518114000673">Mr.

no.</p><p><a name="060518114000291"><b><a name="060518114000674">Mr.
Straw:</b> Hang on a sec. It is perfectly possible to
construct a pay system in which Members are paid according to age and
time spent in the House. Whether that is acceptable to the public
purse, and above all to hon. Members, is another matter. There has been
an improvement, however, as Chairmen of Select Committees and
equivalent bodies, including members of the Speaker&#146;s Panel,
receive additional remuneration. The only people who do not receive
such remuneration are members of the shadow Cabinet, who have to work
extremely hard and are not paid properly for that work. However, that
is an incentive to leave the shadows and enter Government. I hope that
everyone accepts the case for staging, which is the subject of the
motion.</p><p><a name="060518114000292">May I deal
with the two motions on payment for Chairmen of the Select Committee on
the Crossrail Bill, both of which make the same proposition? The House
decided to introduce payments for the Chairmen of the main Select
Committees in 2003, following a debate in 2002 on the principle of
payment arising from a report of the Modernisation Committee and from a
subsequent report by the SSRB on the amount payable. In July 2005 we
decided that that should be extended to nearly all the remaining
permanent Committees. We decided, too, that a system of payment should
be introduced for members of the Chairmen&#146;s Panel who chair
Standing
Committees.</p><p><a name="060518114000293">The main
purpose of the decision to pay Chairmen of Select Committees was to
promote recognition of another career choice in the House as an
alternative to service as a Minister. It reflected a recognition of the

<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1155</b><br>importance of Select Committees in underpinning a modern democracy, and
a general agreement that the chairmanship of many Committees involves a
heavy work load and substantial responsibility. The House would wish me
to take the opportunity to say how much we value the work of Select
Committees and to thank the various Chairmen for their commitment. The
decision to pay Chairmen was by no means unanimous, but the House as a
whole has shown that it supports the principle by subsequently
extending the list of Chairmen who receive the additional
salary.</p><p><a name="060518114000294">Chairmen of
non-permanent Committees have not been paid, partly because they do not
fit the criteria as clearly as other Chairmen. By definition, such
Committees are relatively short-lived, although the Select Committee on
the Armed Forces Bill, which was ably chaired by my right hon. Friend
the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth), has just
reported after four months and more than 20 sittings. It would be
difficult to identify in advance which Committees should be covered and
which should not. However, where there is an exceptional case, I hope
that colleagues agree that we should reflect that in arrangements for
the payment of salaries.</p><p><a name="060518114000295">The Select Committee on the
Crossrail Bill appears to be such a case. It first sat on 13 December,
and it sits up to four times a week when the House is sitting. Until
last week it had sat on 36 days, so as it typically sits twice a day,
it has many more sittings than other Committees. It may continue to
sit&#151;but perhaps not at the same rate&#151;until the autumn.
The House will agree that its work load is higher than that of many
other Committees whose members are paid an additional salary. It is
higher, too, than the work load of other ad hoc
committees.</p><p><a name="060518114000296"><b><a name="060518114000675">Mr.
David Heath (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b> Undoubtedly members
of Committees considering private legislation&#151;the Crossrail Bill
Committee is such a Committee&#151;undertake an awful lot of hard
work, but I find it difficult to distinguish the additional work by
Chairmen from that of the membership, as they both seem to do exactly
the same job in the same
circumstances.</p><p><a name="060518114000297"><b><a name="060518114000676">Mr.
Straw:</b> It could be said that assiduous members of Select
Committees do the same job as, say, the Chairman of a Select Committee
who happens to be coasting. There is no precise science. All Members
who are doing their duties in the House work very hard&#151;far
harder, I may say, than they get credit for, regardless of party, from
many sections of the press. But there is a difference between chairing
a Committee and being a member of it. There is plainly a difference in
responsibility. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman does not
seek to make the best the enemy of the good, and will accepts that
there is an exception to the general rule to be made
here.</p><p><a name="060518114000298">I express my
gratitude to my hon. Friend the Member for Mansfield (Mr. Meale) for
the work that he has done as Chairman of the Select Committee on the
Crossrail Bill. Had he simply been coasting, had he not been taking his
responsibilities seriously, I would not have tabled the motion and
Members on both sides would not have accepted it. I accept that to add
this Committee to the list of Committees whose Chairmen 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1156</b><br>receive an additional salary will set something of a precedent. We will
have to look at other cases as they arise, and it is not inconceivable
that another Select Committee on a Bill may at some future point
justify similar treatment. However, I do not envisage that we will have
for some time another ad hoc Committee involving the work commitment
for its Chairman that that one involves. It is a matter for the House
to decide, but I think it is right to put the motion forward to provide
an opportunity for the Chamber as a whole to make that
decision.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060518114000483">12.41

motions before the House relating to Members&#146; salaries and the
pay of Chairmen of Select
Committees.</p><p><a name="060518114000300">I am
grateful to the Leader of the House for having recognised that the
staging of Members&#146; pay does not in itself constitute a very
large saving for the Government. However, as others, with whom we have
been compared and linked in respect of the decision on our pay, are
being asked to take their pay in stages, it is appropriate that we
undertake the same level of restraint as we expect of
them.</p><p><a name="060518114000301">The Leader of
the House referred to the wider issue, partly in response to a question
from my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas
Winterton). The pay of Members of Parliament is a difficult matter,
with which Governments and Members have grappled over the years. We
have not necessarily found the best way to deal with Members&#146;
pay. It is Members who vote on our pay, and voters raise questions
about it. They are often encouraged in that by members of the press,
whose salaries are not revealed to the electorate or to their
readership.</p><p><a name="060518114000302">There is
an issue that we need to address, and the SSRB triennial review will
consider the wider aspects when it reports. I am grateful to the Leader
of the House for clarifying that that will be commissioned later this
year and will report next year. The question asked by my hon. Friend
the Member for West Worcestershire (Sir Michael Spicer) is important,
concerning the mandatory nature of that report. The report is not
produced at the whim of the Prime Minister; a resolution was passed
that a triennial review should take
place.</p><p><a name="060518114000303"><b><a name="060518114000678">Sir
Michael Spicer:</b> The resolution is cited on the Order
Paper; it was motion 14 at the

May:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that
clarification. I am sure the Leader of the House has noted the point
and the motion number, to ensure that the process goes ahead and there
is no way that the triennial review can be stymied by a prime
ministerial
decision.</p><p><a name="060518114000305">The wider
issue is important. The right hon. Gentleman referred to the need to
encourage high-calibre people to want to become Members of Parliament,
and to the fact that these days this is a full-time job. That is not
necessarily a view that will be shared by all my colleagues, or in
other parts of the House, but my personal view is that it is a
full-time job and we should treat it as such, as I have always done. 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1157</b><br>That presents a challenge to those who are employed in areas where
salaries are above those of Members of Parliament, which in the past
may not have been the case. It is no longer the case that higher
salaries are paid only to those in a significant role in business or
banking, or who are barristers or in similar professions. A head
teacher of a secondary school, for example, almost certainly earns more
than a Member of
Parliament.</p><p><a name="060518114000306"><b><a name="060518114000680">Sir
Nicholas Winterton:</b> Similarly, a superintendent of
police.</p><p><a name="060518114000307"><b><a name="060518114000681">Mrs.
May:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. There are a number
of areas of employment where salaries are higher than those of Members
of Parliament, which would not have been so in the past. People of very
high calibre still wish to be Members of Parliament, but sometimes that
involves them and their families making significant sacrifices to
enable them to give their service to the country. We need to consider
the issue.</p><p><a name="060518114000308">I crave
the indulgence of the House to raise one further point that cannot be
accommodated by the SSRB triennial review, but which is a matter for
all parties&#151;the cost of standing as a candidate for election to
Parliament. That can be a significant cost, particularly to someone
nursing a seat for three or four years, if they are selected well in
advance of an election. That presents a challenge to parties too, to
ensure that we encourage high-calibre people to enter the House, as we
are all keen to
do.</p><p><a name="060518114000309">On the pay of
Chairmen of Select Committees, the right decision was taken by the
House. It was an important step offering Members a different career
structure, so that they do not have to become Ministers to feel that
they are progressing and earning extra salary. The Leader of the House
mentioned members of the shadow Cabinet. Having been a member of the
shadow Cabinet since 1999, I, perhaps more than others, am conscious of
the point. Members of the shadow Cabinet assume that burden with no
extra pay over and above that of Members of Parliament.</p><p><a name="060518114000310">The key issue is that the role
of Select Committee Chairman offers an alternative career. In earlier
exchanges during business questions, the Leader of the House referred
to the introduction of the Select Committee system in the House. That
has been one of the great strengths of the House over the past 25
years, and it is important that we recognise the value of that through
the pay of Chairmen of Select
Committees.</p><p><a name="060518114000311">On the
Crossrail Bill, I entirely understand the intervention by the hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) about the fact that all the
members of the Committee take on a substantial burden because of the
number of meetings of the Committee. I say openly and honestly that I
would not like to be a member of that Committee. I intend to give
evidence to it because Crossrail affects my constituency, but it is a
detailed issue and a significant burden to meet and take so much
evidence from those who have submitted petitions against the Crossrail
Bill.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1158</b><br><p><a name="060518114000312">It can be argued that for
members of any Select Committee there is a burden if they do their job
assiduously, which I know members of Select Committees do, but the
Chairman of such a Committee has an extra burden to bear, and it is
appropriate that the Select Committee on the Crossrail Bill be added to
the list of those whose Chairmen who are paid. The Leader of the House
made a valid point when he said that we cannot guarantee that in future
other Committees will not need to be added. Now that he has finally
been allowed to become Chairman of the Modernisation Committee, after a
little local difficulty, he will know that, as became clear from the
evidence taken yesterday, one of the current issues concerns the role
of Select Committees, Standing Committees and Special Select Committees
in the future. If the Modernisation Committee proposes changes to the
way in which the House handles legislation and the legislative process,
so that the balance between Select Committees and Standing Committees
and their various responsibilities evolves, we may need to look again
at the whole question of whom it is appropriate to pay.</p><p><a name="060518114000313">I welcome the fact that Select
Committee Chairmen are now paid&#151;that has been an important move
for the House&#151;and I endorse the adding of the Chairman of the
Crossrail Bill Committee to the list of those whose salary is increased

doing.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060518114000484">12.50

something of a reputation for taking a puritanical view of them.
Indeed, I am very clear that in fact and in perception we must be
extraordinarily careful that we do not seem to be giving ourselves
preferential treatment above those who serve in the public service or
the private sector beyond this place. For instance, when we discussed

however, be fair to Members of Parliament. We have to reflect the
comparators that are set down and ensure that Members&#146; salaries
are commensurate with the responsibilities that they take on. It
worries me when Members&#146; pay falls way behind those comparators.
I agree with the right hon. Member 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1159</b><br>for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) that the job of a Member of Parliament should
be to represent people in this place, not to go off and do some other
job down the road. It always surprises, and sometimes shocks, me when
somebody leaves high office, or even shadow responsibilities, and the
first thing that the newspapers say is, &#147;What job is he going to
do now?&#148; The answer is the job of a Member of Parliament, which
is still their prime responsibility. It worries me that so many Members
feel the need to top up their salaries in all sorts of ways. I cannot
believe that that is to the advantage of their constituents. Of course,
every individual has to take a view for
themselves.</p><p><a name="060518114000318">The
Leader of the House cited the quality of the recent intake of Members.
I agree. I think that we had an extraordinarily talented intake on both
sides of the House this

joining us. However, although that may be a seductive argument for
saying that we can therefore allow market forces to do their work and
allow salaries to dwindle, it is wrong. It would be a complacent view,
and an unfair one. Greater self-sacrifice is required, not only by
Members but by their families, which is sometimes inappropriate. Having
for several years led a county council with an annual turnover of about
&#163;500,000 on the basis that total expenses were about
&#163;4,000 per annum, I know how difficult it is to make such
sacrifices in order to achieve one&#146;s political
objectives.</p><p><a name="060518114000321"><b><a name="060518114000687">Sir

should be. I would hope that it takes an objective and independent
view, not one clouded by the misconceptions of bundling up all our
office expenses&#151;for example, staff and computers&#151;into our
salary and saying that they are perks for the individual concerned. All
those factors are removed from the equation and we have an objective
view.</p><p><a name="060518114000323">I entirely
support the contention of the Leader of the House in the first motion.
Given that the Government have determined that civil service pay should
be staged, it would be wrong of us to seek an advantageous position,
and we should accept that recommendation.</p><p><a name="060518114000324">That brings me on to the
payment of the Chairman of the Select Committee on the Crossrail Bill.
I have genuine problems with that. I hasten to add thatthat
has nothing to do with either the person orthe qualities of
the hon. Member for Mansfield(Mr. Meale), and everything to
do with the apparent lack of discipline and control over the
process&#151;a process that I generally welcome. Those who chair 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1160</b><br>Select Committees of the House undertake a very substantial job and
generally do so with a great deal of assiduity and sheer hard work. I
can readily accept that there should be a career structure within the
House and that it should be rewarded, but I have always been reluctant
for it to be greatly expanded. I agree with the right hon. Member for
Maidenhead that we are rapidly approaching the situation whereby the
only people who will not be paid extra are those who do a great deal of
the work of the House by speaking from the Conservative and Liberal
Democrat Front Benches on each and every Bill and attending Standing
Committees to speak as required, and do so without any extra emolument
at all. I hasten to add that I am not seeking that extra emolument, but
merely pointing out that it is a rather perverse
situation.</p><p><a name="060518114000325">We now
have payments for the Chairmen on the Chairmen&#146;s Panel who chair
our Standing Committees. Again, I do not argue with that. It is a
gradated structure. However, naming a specific temporary Committee sets
an unhelpful precedent. The motion makes no provision&#151;although
it is clearly implied&#151;that the payment should cease at the point
at which the Select Committee reports. However, I have a more
substantial objection. I do not know whether the hon. Member for
Mansfield is a member of the Chairmen&#146;s Panel&#151;if so, he
is receiving a payment as such&#151;but I suspect that he is not.
That is surprising. Hon. Members who are put on a Select Committee on
private legislation undertake a truly horrendous task. It is very
time-consuming and difficult work that is usually, frankly, given as a
punishment by the Whips Office for some misdemeanour, and I have the
greatest sympathy for those who undertake it. But the fact remains that
that hard work is shared by all the members of the Committee. It is not
like being the Chairman of a departmental Select Committee. Those
Chairmen do a tremendous amount of work outside the Committee, meeting
individuals, preparing for meetings and guiding the reports that the
Committee produces. They do a whole array of further work, but I do not
believe that that is the role of the Chairman of a private Bill
Committee. The work of those Committees is shared by all their
members.</p><p><a name="060518114000326">I do not
intend to show any disrespect to the hon. Member for Mansfield, who I
know is doing very good job of work, but he is not there all the time,
and I believe that up to four other Members have also chaired that Bill
Committee. So it seems odd to reward only one member of the Committee,
quite substantially under the terms of this provision, for doing that
temporary job. Furthermore, it is not clear to me from my reading of
the resolution whether this is an annualised payment in line with those
of other Select Committee Chairmen, or whether there is a pro rata
element related to the timing of the Bill. It would be helpful to know
that.</p><p><a name="060518114000327"><b><a name="060518114000689">John
Bercow (Buckingham) (Con):</b> I do not know whether the hon.

question. No doubt the Leader of the House will be able to answer it
when he responds to the debate. If there was a genuine election within
the membership of the Committee, that would be one thing. However, if
there was an instruction to the effect that someone had been favoured
with the chairmanship of the Committee and was to receive a substantial
emolument as a result, that would change the view of the House on what
exactly is going on. For all those reasons, I really need to be
convinced that this is a sensible way
forward.</p><p><a name="060518114000331"><b><a name="060518114000693">Mr.

Chairman of that Bill Committee were a member of the Chairmen&#146;s

would be paid. So why should he not receive payment for chairing this
particular
Committee?</p><p><a name="060518114000332"><b><a name="060518114000694">Mr.
Heath:</b> The hon. Member for Mansfield would be paid rather
less if he were a member of the Chairmen&#146;s Panel. He would be
paid as a prospective Standing Committee Chairman, which, by a
resolution of the House, would depend on his experience in the role,
but he would still receive considerably less than the rate of pay that
is felt to be appropriate for a Select Committee Chairman.</p><p><a name="060518114000333">The anomaly is that this Bill
Committee is described as a Select Committee but it is not a
departmental Select Committee&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.]</i> The
Leader of the House objects to my use of the word
&#147;anomaly&#148;, so I shall retract it. However, such
Committees are a kind of hybrid between a Standing Committee and a
Select Committee. Many other temporary Committees are set up for
similar purposes, and the only logical conclusion is that anyone who
chairs any Committee of the House in any circumstances ought to have a
temporary pay
increase&#151;</p><p><a name="060518114000334"><b><a name="060518114000695">Mr.

the Chairman of the Crossrail Bill.</p><p><a name="060518114000337">The right hon. Member for
Maidenhead (Mrs. May) raised a fundamental point about how we settle
our pay, in saying that we have always had difficulties because we have
to vote on our own pay. This is almost unique, except for those who run
a company that they wholly own. I remember the debates that took place
on this matter in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the system was
much worse than it is today. In those days, there was no linkage, which
was just awful. The system of linkage is much better, because it
provides a clear benchmark. I am not sure whether we could devise a
better system, although&#151;to pick up the points made by the hon.
Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) and others&#151;we
must not forget the important associated issue of what the benchmark
should be. We need to ensure that the salaries of Members of Parliament
keep up with certain comparators, without any shifts being offensive to
our constituents.</p><p><a name="060518114000338">The right hon. Member for

interesting that people of talent still enter the House. That happens

the same arrangement as for a Select Committee. It does not involve a

by some osmotic process, a name comes forward. That Member becomes a
member of the Committee and&#151;hey presto!&#151;all other members
of the Committee, by an entirely democratic free vote, approve that

does everything by gentle persuasion. However, it certainly was true,
as I remember&#151; <i> [Interruption.]</i> The right hon. Member for

Cabinet member for 10 years, it always rankled that I was expected to
work my socks off and speak on behalf of the party while not being paid
a penny whereas our Chief Whip, who was expected simply to dragoon
people into the Lobby and not speak at all, was paid a large sum. There
we are; it just gets one used to life in

1990.</p><p><a name="060518114000355">Allan had been
offending the Whips in a variety of ways and was told that he had to

hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) will speak in greater
detail on this issue, because he has been chairing a working group on
support for former Members. Those of us who have been lucky enough to
survive in the House over many elections, as I have, will have friends
who are no longer Members. Some retired at an appropriate
moment&#151;we wish them all well in their retirement&#151;but many
either got squeezed out because of gratuitous boundary redistributions
or lost their seats. That happened to a large number of my colleagues
in the 1980s, and it also happened to Conservative colleagues in the
1990s and at the 2001
election.</p><p><a name="060518114000364">Many of
those who lost their seats were assiduous Members of Parliament. They
had given up careers and quite high incomes, and often put great
strains on their families, but they suddenly found themselves outside
the House and at a loss as to their future. That is a risk that we all
accept when we are elected to the House, but I have often been struck
by the lack not of support in terms of pensions, which are reasonable
these days, although not for people who retired some time ago, but of
psychological support and recognition of the contribution that those
people made to the running of the
House.</p><p><a name="060518114000365">Shortly before
the 2001 election, our former colleague, Joe Ashton, who was just about
to retire, led an informal cross-party group looking at what could be
done to assist the position of former Members of Parliament. My right
hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, who was then Leader of the House,
facilitated a short debate in May 2001, just before the general
election, which led, in effect, to the establishment of a working party
to report to the Speaker. The motion identified the desire of former
Members to stay in contact with each other and the possible benefits of
availability of sources of personal advice and assistance for those who
might have got into
difficulties.</p><p><a name="060518114000366">As I
say, my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle will go into more detail,
but I understand that the association has more than 330 members,
including a former Prime Minister and a former Speaker. Any such
association needs some material support, but I understand that our
association funds most of its activities from subscription. However,
some modest financial support and assistance in kind have been made
available by the House of Commons Commission. That will
continue.</p><p><a name="060518114000367">The
Commission considered
that</p><a name="060518114000478"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in due course the
view of the House should be sought on this assistance, so that it can
be put on a steadier footing&#148;.</p></ul><br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1166</b><br><p><a name="060518114000368">The main purpose of tabling the motion is
to allow the House to give its view. We are being asked to give broad
endorsement of the Commission&#146;s approach, but not to take
responsibility for specific decisions, which remain a matter for the
Commission. I am extremely happy to give that endorsement. I hope that
the House as a whole does so
to.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060518114000487">1.16
pm</h5><p><a name="060518114000369"><b><a name="060518114000709">Mrs.
Theresa May (Maidenhead) (Con):</b> I am also happy to give
that endorsement. Any large organisation has clubs, societies and
groupings for former members of staff, which are for people who retire
in the natural way of things. Of course, many Members of the House lose
their jobs, and that can come as a great shock to them. Politics is a
brutal business in that sense. Therefore, the proposal seems entirely
sensible. Indeed, it seems a little odd that it took so long for a
grouping or association of former Members to be
formed.</p><p><a name="060518114000370">I pay tribute
to the work of all those former Members and Members of the House who
have been involved in getting the association up and running and in
ensuring that it is provided with the support it needs. I am entirely
happy to endorse that important, albeit limited, support that the
Commission has agreed the House may
give.</p><p><a name="060518114000371">I would like to
make a further point. There are many ways in which Members of the House
can continue to learn from former Members. On a specific issue, I am
very grateful for the support that Dame Marion Roe is giving to those
of us who are trying to encourage more women into the House,
particularly on the Conservative Benches. She is giving practical
support and advice to women. It is good of former Members to be willing
to do that. We should never forget the experience that they have, which
can be of benefit to current Members and to the House
generally.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060518114000488">1.17
pm</h5><p><a name="060518114000372"><b><a name="060518114000710">Mr.
Eric Martlew (Carlisle) (Lab):</b> I am delighted to speak to
the motion. On 2 May 2001 we had the original motion before the House.
Of course, if it had not been for the outbreak of foot and mouth
disease, the debate would never have taken place. After it, the Speaker
asked me to form a working group to see whether we could get an
association up and
running.</p><p><a name="060518114000373">I was
flattered by that and I wondered whether the Speaker realised that I
had a background in human resources&#151;I used to be personnel
manager for a large multinational company. So, I delved into this a
little further, but the reality was that I was one of only three
Members who were sitting on the Benches when the debate took place. I
was the obvious
candidate.</p><p><a name="060518114000374">The work
has gone well, but when I was appointed to the post, I wondered why we
had never had a formal association. The right hon. Member for
Maidenhead (Mrs. May) has asked that question today from the
Conservative Front Bench. Throughout the world, Parliaments similar to
ours all have their associations. I then realised that the reason for
us not having an association for former Members is down at the other
end of the building. In fact, we have an association, and it is called
the House of Lords. It has been there for many centuries, but only
elite former Members 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1167</b><br>went to it. If what I hear is to be believed, it will be even more
difficult for Members of this House to get to the other House, so I am
sure that the need for the association will
increase.</p><p><a name="060518114000375">The working
group reported to the Speaker and the then Leader of the House, and it
was successful. The association of former Members now has, I
think,340 members, including two former Prime Ministers and
32 former Cabinet Ministers. They need no advice from us about how to
run their business, as many of them have run the country, some of them
well and some not so well.</p><p><a name="060518114000376">As the Leader of the House
pointed out, there was a need for this association, and the main need
was for fellowship. This place is a closed community, and suddenly
finding oneself on the outside is difficult when most Members live in
their constituencies and are unlikely to meet one of their work
colleagues walking down the street. Some successful social gatherings
have taken place, and I want to put on record our thanks for the
support of Speaker Martin in that regard. The Administration Committee,
which was at first reluctant to accept the demands of the association,
has also been helpful.</p><p><a name="060518114000377">Progress has been made. When
the association was started, a former Member had to have
completed15 years&#146; service before being given
permission to come into the House without having to go through security
and wear a label with a date on it. That has now improved greatly.
Former Members found it shaming to have to go through that procedure
and felt that their contribution merited better. An office has been
provided, which is welcomed by the association. The small amount of
financial support provided helps to pay the association&#146;s
postage costs. It has been fortunate to employ a part-time secretary,
Sally Grocott&#151;&#147;employ&#148; is perhaps not the right
word, as I am not sure that she gets paid or gets paid regularly. As
she knows the House&#151;her husband is Chief Whip in the other
place&#151;she has been a tower of strength to the
association.</p><p><a name="060518114000378">The
driving force behind the association, however, has been Joe Ashton. I
have worked closely with him and he tires me out. Given the amount of
energy that he puts into his role, he probably retired too early. The
association has been fortunate to have him. Nothing is ever good enough
for Joe, so we must go further and faster. He now has an all-party,
mixed-gender executive that represents various regions of the United
Kingdom. The House would be proud to form an executive on such a basis
were it ever able to do so. Members are aware of its success, because
it produces a newspaper, &#147;Order Order&#148;, three times a
year, which is now circulated with <i> The House Magazine</i>.</p><p><a name="060518114000379">The association has asked me
to raise one or two issues. First, it has asked me to raise the issue
of the pension fund trustees. I served for many years as a pension fund
trustee and, believe me, it is not a glamorous committee. It is perhaps
a bit like that on the Crossrail Bill, but the chairman does not get
paid. The law says that there should be pensioner trustees. At present,
we have a pensioner trustee, who was not nominated by the association
but is a member of it. The association has asked whether it can be
consulted in future about the retired trustee on the pension fund,
which is a reasonable request, and whether there could 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1168</b><br>be more than one retired trustee on the pension fund. I hope that that
suggestion will be communicated through the usual channels back to the
fund trustees.</p><p><a name="060518114000380">Secondly, the association
asked me to raise the issue of the Members&#146; Fund, of which, for
my pains, I am also a member. I am conscious that the vast majority of
Members of Parliament know nothing about the Members&#146;
Fund&#151;they just know from their payslip that they make a
&#163;2 contribution to it every month. In reality, it is a fund for
assisting former Members of Parliament or their spouses and
family&#151;the assistance is normally to spouses and family who
might have fallen into some kind of financial difficulty. The laws on
the fund were passed by the House in about 1935 and need revising.
Members of the association understand that. If the laws are revised,
however, they would like a retired association member to be a member of
the Members&#146; Fund.</p><p><a name="060518114000381">I also want to raise the
issue, on which the Leader of the House touched, of how we treat
Members who lose their seats. Some work has been done on that, and I
thought that I had secured an agreement with the usual channels that
when a Member loses a seat, he or she can use part of the winding-up
allowance to get expert help on returning to the labour market. A
Member of Parliament who has been out of his or her profession for 10
years will find it difficult to get back into the labour market. The
multinational company for which I worked would bring in consultants to
assist those who had been made redundant with their CVs and advise them
on their career prospects and future direction. That does not happen
here. My understanding&#151;which was wrong, as it did not
happen&#151;was that Members, if they so wished, could use part of
the winding-up allowance for those purposes. I hope that that will have
been provided for by the time of the next general
election.</p><p><a name="060518114000382"><b><a name="060518114000711">Mr.
David Winnick (Walsall, North) (Lab):</b> Does my hon. Friend
agree&#151;this did not apply to me, although I lost my seat, and I
was fortunate enough to be in employment within a week&#151;that the
process can be pretty undignified when a Member loses a seat? Several
former Members, no doubt on both sides of the House, have needed to get
permission from the authorities to come here and collect their papers
and so on, perhaps a few days after a general election. A more
dignified approach is required to deal with those who have lost their
seats, not only to help them in the way that my hon. Friend has
suggested but to make it easier for them to collect papers and do other
things that one would do normally when leaving one&#146;s
employment.</p><p><a name="060518114000383"><b><a name="060518114000712">Mr.
Martlew:</b> I totally accept that, and I understand that the
matter is being considered. I have heard the process described as being
similar to what happens when an employee has been instantly
dismissed&#151;someone will come to the person&#146;s office, help
him or her to gather their papers and see them off the premises. That
cannot be right. Of course, there is pressure of time&#151;the work
of the House starts again soon after the general election, and desks
and so on must be available. However, the issue must be treated more
sensitively. The issue in relation to passes is similar. Often, Members
have felt ashamed to come back into the House through the security
system. Since 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1169</b><br>we have made changes, the House is a much more welcoming place to former
Members.</p><p><a name="060518114000384">My final
point is that the amount of money made available to the association is
probably less than &#163;2,000. I realise that that is public money,
and we must be careful with it. However, outside this place, a civil
service retirement association or a large company would be more
generous. When the House of Commons Commission considers the matter, I
hope that it will see its way to being a little more
generous.</p><p><a name="060518114000385">I am
grateful that this motion is on the Order Paper today. I am sure that
all Members of the House realise that, sooner or later, they will be a
former Member. I am not planning to lose my seat at the next general
election, but one can never tell. We should take credit for what we
have done. Some members of the association complain about the pensions
and salaries that we receive and compare them with the amounts that
they received, and they are right to do so; but we did set up the
association. They had the opportunity to set it up, and did not do
so.</p><p><a name="060518114000386">When we are
former Members, the association will make leaving this place better for
us. We have already made it a great deal better for our colleagues and
friends who left at the last
election.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060518114000489">1.30

David Heath (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b> I want to express
not just congratulations but thanks to the hon. Member for Carlisle
(Mr. Martlew), and to all who have been instrumental in setting up the
association and making it work as it has. It represents an important
advance in what we do for former Members. I also agree with what the
hon. Gentleman said about further steps that could be taken. It is
extraordinary that although we spend all our time here referring to
each other, quite properly, as &#147;the hon. Gentleman&#148; and
&#147;the hon. Lady&#148; in accordance with the formalities of the
House, the moment a seat is lost the Member is apparently no longer an
hon. Gentleman or an hon. Lady, and cannot be trusted to clear his or
her desk in good order. That is an indignity that we do not need to
visit on those who are inevitably distraught at their
position.</p><p><a name="060518114000388">In too many
instances, the structures of the House are based on the assumption that
someone who leaves is a member of the landed or money gentry to whom
attending the House has been merely a pastime for a certain number of
years, who can simply return to his estates or his job in the City, and
to whom nothing really matters. That is not how things are in the real
world. Most Members of Parliament nowadays burn their bridges when they
come here, setting aside their former professions, trades or jobs, and
when they end their time in the House they often face an uncertain
future. It is important to provide such people with a proper
transition.</p><p><a name="060518114000389">The hon.
Member for Carlisle suggested that some of the winding-up funds should
be used to pay for professional advice on employment opportunities. I
think that a good employer would supply such funds not from a
winding-up allowance, but as a matter of course. I think that the House
should provide the 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1170</b><br>largest amount that it can sensibly provide, not because I want Members
of Parliament to have a particular advantage but because I want us to
be in a similar position to someone leaving a major company. We have
all seen major redundancies in our constituencies, and we have all
urged employers&#151;some of them good employers, some not so
good&#151;to provide relocation packages so that people can find new
ways into work.</p><p><a name="060518114000390">I
entirely endorse what was said by the hon. Member for Carlisle, and
entirely concur with what was said by the Leader of the House and the
right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs.
May).</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060518114000490">1.33

editor deserves
praise.</p><p><a name="060518114000392">I do not
agree with some of what has been said, but the debate is relatively
limited. I think that we should all be prepared to clear our offices
when an election comes, and I do not think that we need too much time
in which to do it. I do not like the idea that Members of Parliament
are doing a job better than any other that they could do. I am glad
that we are past the times when only the poor and the rich could become
Members of Parliament, and that now middle-income groups can do
so.</p><p><a name="060518114000393">I agree with the
general points made about the importance of the solidarity and support
that people receive, but I think we should bear in mind the position of
spouses or partners of former Members of Parliament, especially former
Members who have died. I remember a case about 20 years ago, when
someone who had been the daughter-in-law and wife of distinguished
Members was not be recognised when she came back here several weeks
after her husband&#146;s funeral and memorial service. Although they
are not members of the association, I hope that some attention will be
paid to those who have been married to politics for many
years.</p><p><a name="060518114000394"><b><a name="060518114000715">Mr.

believe that the motion should be passed, and that we should have
further discussions on what else can be done to ensure that people can
be together and feel that they are contributing&#151;if only to the
fun of being in an association of former Members, but I think that they
can contribute
more.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060518114000491">1.35

Dennis Skinner (Bolsover) (Lab):</b> I am sorry that I was
missing for a few minutes. I was in touch with&#151;not Joe Ashton,
although he has been in touch with me a great deal lately, which is why
I have risen to speak, but the cardiologist. Just at the moment, that
is a bit more
important.</p><p><a name="060518114000398">Joe Ashton
was a Whip between 1976 and 1979, when we had no majority. Well, we did
have a majority, 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1171</b><br>but then Stonehouse went missing. He was on a Florida beach, then he
turned up in Australia. Then he crossed the Floor, and Joe Ashton was
given the job of being one of the Whips keeping our majority intact.
They were heady days and all the rest of it, but we formed a
relationship. Joe&#146;s job was to try to get me into the Lobbies.
It did not always work, but I told him all those years ago that I would
do him a favour some time. I got on the phone to him when he retired.
It has not been mentioned yet, but Joe had a very serious illness. We
had many long discussions about how he was getting on. At the time I
could see that despite the grim fight that he was undertaking, there
was no doubt that the proposal that he had helped to put to the House
way back in 2001&#151;I think that my hon. Friend the Member for
Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) said that it was on 2 May&#151;was still very
much in his mind. I promised him on numerous occasions that I would
raise it if necessary, in accordance with what he wanted. What I did
not know was that Joe had also been briefing my hon. Friend the Member
for Carlisle, who has presented most of his propositions
today.</p><p><a name="060518114000399">Reference has
been made to the composition of this place in the old days. Many
Members then had formerly worked in factories or the pits. I can speak
with some knowledge about pension entitlements in those days. The
pension from the pits was only voluntary even in my day, and there was
no pension at all when I started working as a miner. Many people who
became Members of Parliament received no pension. It is true that they
could have money shifted from one place to another, but people who had
given20 years&#146; service were receiving about
&#163;100 a month&#151;people who had worked in factories, pits and
all the rest. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome(Mr.
Heath) was right to say that many Members did not leave with a great
deal of money. It is true that the composition of this place has
changed dramatically. There are no longer 700,000 miners; you would
have a job to find more than 5,000. That is why it is important to
remember what the position used to
be.</p><p><a name="060518114000400">My hon. Friend
the Member for Carlisle mentioned nominees for the parliamentary
contributory pension fund and the Members&#146; fund. That is what
Members are striving for, as of right. If the Commission would 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1172</b><br>consider it, I am sure that my old pal Joe Ashton, Bill Michie and all
the rest who helped to form the association will be very pleased. Help
with the cost of the magazine would also be appreciated, and Joe also
told me that he would like to have the names and addresses of all the
Members who had left, so that they could keep in
contact.</p><p><a name="060518114000401">So those are
the proposals. My hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle dealt with them
previously and explained precisely what was needed, and I hope that the
Commission can deal with the matter. I have done my job. I made a
promise to Joe donkeys&#146; years ago that there would come an
occasion when he would be glad of my presence. I may not be in the
Lobby, but I am speaking up for his
association.</p>

Jamie Reed (Copeland) (Lab):</b> I am delighted to have
secured this debate today on a subject of pivotal importance to my
constituency. In fact, although it is of real importance to a number of
constituencies throughout the country, nowhere will the effect of the
sale of British Nuclear Group be more acutely felt than in Copeland and
in West Cumbria generally.</p><p><a name="060518114000409">I want to begin my
establishing the unique importance of British Nuclear Group to the
Sellafield site, Copeland and West Cumbria. I know that the Minister is
well aware of these issues, but they bear repeating. British Nuclear
Group is by far the largest company operating on the Sellafield site.
It employs more than 7,000 people directly, and the site itself employs
over 11,500 people. Employment at Sellafield sustains another 5,000
jobs in the wider local community, so in real terms, the site is
responsible for approximately 17,000 jobs. Such employment accounts for
the majority of the West Cumbria economy and well over 60 per cent. of
the economy of
Copeland.</p><p><a name="060518114000410">Take-home
wages from the Sellafield site are in excess of &#163;210 million per
year. The site provides, as the Minister knows, high-quality, highly
skilled, highly valued jobs. Expenditure from the Sellafield
sitegoing into the regional supply chain is in excess
of&#163;600 million a year. It provides the lifeblood of
the local service industry companies, the hospitality and retail
industries, and the bespoke, high-value engineering industries to be
found not only in Copeland, but in Allerdale, in the constituency of my
hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Tony Cunningham). Local supply
chain procurement by BNG is essential in West Cumbria, an issue to
which I shall return.</p><p><a name="060518114000411">In addition to that
contribution to the local economy, in the past 15 years BNG has
committed&#163;20 million to the West Cumbria Development
Fund&#151;a local economic regeneration body&#151;which, in turn,
has helped to lever in a further &#163;10 million worth of European
Union funding. BNG has also demonstrated a concerted willingness to
work in partnership with the local communities within which it
operates, and, crucially, with the trade unions. In my view, it is the
trade union members on any nuclear site who are the ultimate arbiters
of safety. That is certainly the case at Sellafield, and I am grateful
and pleased that the relationship between them and BNG is as strong as
it clearly is. It is against that background that my interest in BNG
must be understood. I must also state for the record that I am a former
employee of the company at the Sellafield site&#151;a fact of which I
am extremely
proud.</p><p><a name="060518114000412">On 30 March,
the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced the
Government&#146;s endorsement of the proposal of the board of British
Nuclear Fuels Ltd. to sell BNG. This was expected, and given the remit
of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority under the terms of the Energy
Act 2004, completely understandable. The NDA and the UK as a whole
require the development of competition within 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1174</b><br>the nuclear decommissioning industry in the UK, in order to achieve the
best value for money for the taxpayer. Although I completely accept the
logic of that and the need for competition, I hope that the Minister
can explain what, if any, consideration was given to the formation of a
public-private partnership for UK decommissioning before the
owner-contractor model was
chosen.</p><p><a name="060518114000413">Accompanying
the Secretary of State&#146;s announcement, the NDA made the wise
announcement that it would grant BNG a new five-year contract to
operate the Sellafield site. That contract will keep the company, or
its new owner, at the site until at least 2012. The Secretary of State
said that he expects the sale of BNG to be completed by the autumn of
2007. For my constituents, that means that from next autumn, there will
be a new, dominant company operating the Sellafield site. It is
essential that that new company understand my community and become an
active partner within it.</p><p><a name="060518114000414">I have to say at this juncture
that neither the Leader of the Opposition nor the shadow Secretary of
State for Trade and Industry have shown the faintest glimmer of an
understanding of what any of this means. Following the Secretary of
State&#146;s announcement in March, the shadow Secretary of State
issued a press release claiming that that announcement meant that the
nation&#146;s nuclear liabilities were being put into the private
sector. I can only assume that he has not read, let alone understood,
the 2004 Act. Those liabilities have remained, and will remain, within
the public sector under the ownership of the NDA. That embarrassing
lack of understanding does not bode well for the shadow Secretary of
State&#146;s time on the Conservative Front Bench, or, indeed, for
the Conservatives&#146; approach to the nuclear industry in
general.</p><p><a name="060518114000415">The Leader
of the Opposition recently hand-picked one of the country&#146;s most
vocal and misleading opponents of the nuclear industry to be his energy
and environment adviser. That adviser has repeatedly misled the nation
about the health and well-being of my constituents, among whom he has
spread fear, anxiety and anger. His claims have no scientific or
factual basis and constitute little more than malicious scaremongering.
So today, I call upon the Leader of the Opposition&#151;sadly, he is
not here&#151;to ensure that his high-profile advisers publicly
withdraw their comments, or to otherwise sack
them.</p><p><a name="060518114000416"><b><a name="060518114000720">Mr.
Charles Walker (Broxbourne) (Con):</b> Does the hon. Gentleman
agree with me that, where nuclear power stations do exist, local
communities have come to accept them and value the contribution that
they make to such communities, and to the wider generation of
electricity throughout the
country?</p><p><a name="060518114000417"><b><a name="060518114000721">Mr.
Reed:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that contribution. He
is absolutely correct; indeed, I could not have put it better myself.
Speaking as a member of a local community surrounding a nuclear
facility, I can say that that is precisely what such communities
believe.</p><p><a name="060518114000418">I return to
the litany of errors committed by Opposition Front Benchers. Only this
week, the new 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1175</b><br>Leader of the Opposition notably failed to back calls for a new
programme of nuclear power generation in Britain. I deeply regret his
turning his back on the industry, at its time not only of greatest
need, but of greatest opportunity. More importantly, at a time when
climate change has emerged as perhaps the definitive political
challenge of our time, it is a tragedy that Conservative Front Benchers
should fail to back the single largest carbon dioxide-free producer of
energy&#151;energy that is available not only to Britain, but the
world. I implore the Leader of the Opposition to reconsider, and I will
happily sit down with him and his shadow Secretary of State&#151;and,
indeed, the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker)&#151;and convince
them of the nuclear case. This issue is above and beyond party
politics. I hope that all parties in the House will be able and mature
enough to devise a national consensus on energy policy, and I urge the
Conservatives to join me in calling for new nuclear power generation in
the
UK.</p><p><a name="060518114000419">Last
week, during a trip to the USA, I visited the Hanford nuclear facility
in Washington state before meeting representatives of the Hanford area
on Capitol Hill. I learned a lot from that visit, and it is appropriate
to compare and contrast the British and American approaches to the
nuclear industry. It is important to do so because there are
significant differences between the two. Let me make it clear at the
outset that I am a passionate pro-American, but that cannot and will
not influence my views on what I believe to be right for the Sellafield
site and my
community.</p><p><a name="060518114000420">It is
important to understand and be aware of the US nuclear regulatory
framework and working practices, because a US-based company is almost
certainly going to buy BNG. There may or may not be some involvement
from French interests, and a number of consortiums might attempt a
purchase. Should a consortium bid for, and succeed in buying, BNG, I
could not support the break-up or carve-up of the Sellafield site. That
has been done before&#151;notably by BNFL during the 1990s&#151;and
it resulted in a deterioration in working practices and managerial
accountability structures. Such an approach also compromised safety, so
I would need to be convinced that it is now workable. At this stage, I
have seen nothing to convince me that it is, and I firmly believe that
the Sellafield site is best served by one
operator.</p><p><a name="060518114000421">In the
event of the successful purchase of BNG by a US-based company, I would
expect that company immediately and wholeheartedly to embrace the
British nuclear industry&#146;s working and regulatory practices, and
to adopt the British corporate social responsibility culture. That
means the adoption of a local supply chain purchasing policy, a close
and productive relationship with the trade unions, the establishment
and implementation of significant socio-economic development plans for
the areas in which it operates, and an effective and satisfactory
approach to working terms and conditions&#151;including already
amassed pension entitlements&#151;that is acceptable to the existing
work force. Fundamentally, it means doing things our way. Above all, it
means working safely. The safety of the Sellafield work force and the
safety of my community is non-negotiable, whatever other inducements
might be proposed.</p><p><a name="060518114000422">The British nuclear work force
is the best nuclear work force in the world. I can say that with
confidence 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1176</b><br>as I have up close and personal experience of it. Standards of safety in
the UK industry are better than elsewhere in the world, technological
development and applied scientific and research application is amongst
the best in the world, and productivity standards are now approaching
the best there are as well. It is those attributes that make our
nuclear workers, our nuclear scientists, our nuclear engineers and our
nuclear working practices among the most sought after in the
world.</p><p><a name="060518114000423">Speak to
any US multinational with a developing interest in buying
BNG&#151;and I have spoken to some&#151;and they will explain that
an association with the British nuclear industry is the key to opening
up the vast nuclear clean-up and decommissioning markets in Russia,
former Soviet Union states and eastern Europe. BNG&#146;s recent
record illustrates that, as the company has successfully decommissioned
and cleaned up more than 50 redundant nuclear facilities world wide.
The company is also on a sound financial footing, with signs of real
further improvements in financial performance this year and in years to
come.</p><p><a name="060518114000424">The
company&#146;s profitability has not been achieved at the expense of
either productivity or safety, a feat attributable not only to
management, but the knowledge and experience of the shop floor. Last
year, Sellafield&#146;s vitrification plant delivered a
record-breaking 503 canisters against a predicted target of 450. By
contrast, the US vitrification programme is billions of dollars over
budget and in complete disarray. The Sellafield MOX plant recently
delivered a second batch of four MOX fuel assemblies to
NOK&#151;Nordostschweizerische Kraftwerke AG&#151;in time for its
summer reactor reload, and last week signed a new &#163;200
million-plus contract with another continental utility. Those are
causes for
celebration.</p><p><a name="060518114000425">In
January 2006, the company completed the clean-up of historic liquid
waste from one of the oldest plants at Sellafield, preventing more than
44 yearsof liquid emissions and saving the taxpayer up
to&#163;300 million in potential new building costs. Only
last week I was discussing problematic clean-up issues with the US
Department of Energy. It highlighted a particular problem in the US
with technetium. That is an issue solved by BNG some time ago&#151;I
am delighted to say that I was involved in the project&#151;which
piqued a great deal of interest among the US Department of Energy
officials. If anyone from BNG is listening to this debate or reads the
report, I advise them to get down to the patent office as soon as
possible, because a significant sum could be made from their unique
technological skills and expertise. The market applications are
huge.</p><p><a name="060518114000426">With regard to
safety&#151;we should bear in mind the fact that Sellafield is the
largest construction site in Britain and one of the largest in
Europe&#151;the current days-away case record rate is 0.23 against a
target of 0.28, which is lower than any similar rate among any US
contractors currently operating in that country. BNG Project Services
has a days-away case record rate of zero and has worked almost 3
million man hours without a single lost-time accident. I could go on,
but the point is made. The British nuclear industry places safety above
everything else and it is a matter of fact that foreign contractors
will have to emulate that safety 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1177</b><br>culture if they want to operate in Britain. We lead the world in that
regard and others have a great deal to learn from us.</p><p><a name="060518114000427">I cannot guess at the value of
BNG in financial terms. However, when assessing the revenue of any
potential sale, I ask that the Government consider more than the
financial value of the sale. Value is measured in more than money and
the highest bidder for BNG may not necessarily be the best bidder for
my community. It is imperative that the highest financial bid should
not bring with it the highest actual cost to my constituents or any
part of the UK in the areas of safety, environmental performance and
socio-economic investment and development. Public acceptability of a
particular contractor must be considered in the process of any sale,
and weight must be given to that in devising the criteria against which
potential BNG purchasers are
judged.</p><p><a name="060518114000428">It must be
said, one year after the establishment of the Nuclear Decommissioning
Authority, that its presence in my constituency and West Cumbria
generally has been enthusiastically received. It has proven already to
be a genuinely involved, listening community partner, which has already
demonstrated that it has the interests of the West Cumbria community
uppermost in its thoughts and actions.</p><p><a name="060518114000429">I thank my hon. Friend the
Minister for the budgeting process of the NDA. I was concerned to
discover in the US that the budget for nuclear clean-up is done on a
year-by-year basis, so the budgets are set annually. They are therefore
subject to the vagaries of the political process&#151;cut in some
years and expanded in others. In the UK, my hon. Friend and the
Department have provided a comprehensive, stable framework for nuclear
decommissioning and clean-up to take place, and I am grateful for
that.</p><p><a name="060518114000430">I understand
that the NDA will devise the BNG sale criteria, no doubt in conjunction
with BNG, BNFL and the DTI. What I now require is significant
involvement from the West Cumbrian community in determining what those
criteria should be. The socio-economic obligations for both the NDA and
its contractors are laid out in the Energy Act 2004, and I now hope to
explore with the aforementioned groups the United States National
Defence Authorisation Act 1993, especially section 3161, which helps to
define the socio-economic obligations of US contractors operating in
nuclear decommissioning environments. My hon. Friend will know of the
importance of the West Cumbria Strategic Forum and I believe that it
would be appropriate if that body were involved in establishing the
sale
criteria.</p><p><a name="060518114000431">Finally,
the future of British Nuclear Group is of fundamental importance to
West Cumbria. It is vital that its sale be conducted properly,
transparently and with the interests of those communities where BNG
currently operates upheld at the centre of this process. The successful
bidder must be the one who understands the ambitions and aspirations of
its host communities and the working practices of the UK nuclear
industry. I thank my hon. Friend for his patience and time, and look
forward to his response.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1178</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="060518114000494">1.56
pm</h5><p><a name="060518114000432"><b><a name="060518114000722">Mr.
David Drew (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I am grateful for the
opportunity to speak in this debate, despite being late, and I
apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Copeland (Mr. Reed) for
missing the first few minutes of his speech. I was taken by surprise,
but I should have learned that about this
place.</p><p><a name="060518114000433">I wish to make
three quick points. I represent a constituency at the other scale of
things from my hon. Friend, in as much as the Berkeley site has been
undergoing a fairly organised run-down for some months. The decision to
dispense with the nuclear laboratories came as a bit of a shock, but it
is pleasing to see that the work will go on. I welcomed the comments by
my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister yesterday. In defending the
nuclear industry, I have always sought to make the point that it is
nothing if it is not its work force. That is the basic integrity of the
industry. One can have sites and systems, but without the people, one
has no industry. It is vital that we keep those people in
place.</p><p><a name="060518114000434">So my first
point is that it is vital that we keep the presence of the industry in
many different parts of the country. That is why I have always fought
for Berkeley to be considered, if not as the site of a new nuclear
power station&#151;because of problems with the River
Severn&#151;but to retain the research and development facilities. I
hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will say something about
that.</p><p><a name="060518114000435">Secondly,
we have the issue of the ownership of the sites by the Nuclear
Decommissioning Authority. Much as I can see the benefits of separating
the providers of services from the ownership of the sites, there are
some concerns about possible conflicts of interest. Given that Berkeley
is the first decommissioned nuclear power station in this country, a
proposal is imminent for the further decommissioning of the old power
site, which would be a first in the world. I hope that my hon. Friend
the Minister will accept an invitation when the proposal is introduced
to come and see how it would take the nuclear industry forward, in
terms of solving the waste problem and the issue of the new
generation.</p><p><a name="060518114000436">My third
point is about the relationship of the BNG, whatever form it takes, and
other parts of the nuclear industry. It is vital that we do not see
contractualisation as the answer to everything. I am concerned that we
have no overall picture of what the nuclear industry could look like in
five years&#146; time. British Energy, BNFL, AMEC and the various
other parts of the industry may have had their weaknesses, and the
introduction of foreign investors may or may not be a good thing, but
there need to be clarity about the industry&#146;s structure. Without
that, we will not be able to build the new generation of nuclear power
stations, even if that is what we decide to do.</p><p><a name="060518114000437">Finally, I totally concur with
my hon. Friend the Member for Copeland that BNG is an important company
that has been much abused in the past. I hope that my hon. Friend the
Minister will give us some food for thought. and hope for the
future.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060518114000495">2
pm</h5><p><a name="060518114000438"><b><a name="060518114000723">The
Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):</b> After the previous
debate on MPs&#146; pay, it is good to turn to the calmer and less
controversial waters of nuclear energy.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1179</b><br><p><a name="060518114000439">I welcome the opportunity to
comment on the future of the British Nuclear Group. My hon. Friend the
Member for Copeland (Mr. Reed) is a great commentator on nuclear
policy, and his expertise and experience are always worth listening to.
In addition, he has a great reputation in his community, as I witnessed
when I visited Sellafield some months
ago.</p><p><a name="060518114000440">The former
Secretary of State, who is now Secretary of State for Education and
Skills, announced our intentions in a written statement to the House
on30 March. That statement made it clear that we had approved
the BNFL board&#146;s recommendation that it should sell BNG through
a competitive sale process commencing in April 2007 or earlier.
However, there has been much media speculation about how the
competitive sale will be conducted. Some of that speculation has been
accurate and some of it less so, and my aim today is to provide some
clarity on the
matter.</p><p><a name="060518114000441">I recognise
that this debate takes place against a backdrop of some interest in the
future of nuclear energy. I shall not say too much about that wider
issue, save that I am conducting an energy review on behalf of my
Secretary of State and the Prime Minister, and that it will report on
these critical questions by the
summer.</p><p><a name="060518114000442">My hon.
Friend the Member for Copeland rightly made some very positive comments
about BNG and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority&#146;s
achievements since it commenced operations just over a year ago. I
should like to echo those sentiments. BNFL did an admirable job in
restructuring itself and preparing the ground for the NDA. The
management and staff at BNG have coped very well with the transition. I
am tremendously encouraged that the NDA&#146;s stewardship of the
UK&#146;s nuclear clean-up has already yielded significant efficiency
savings at BNG&#146;s sites. It is a very good start, but of course
we are looking for very much
more.</p><p><a name="060518114000443">That is why we
believe that a competitive sale is the right route. After careful
deliberation, the BNFL board determined a sale to be in the
company&#146;s best commercial interest and to represent BNG&#146;s
best chance of operating successfully in the commercial market created
by the Energy Act 2004, thereby providing long-term stability for
staff. Most important of all, though, the company also convinced us
that it would be good for the taxpayer because it is good for the
nuclear decommissioning and clean-up programme.
</p><p><a name="060518114000444">I shall be happy to
discuss with my hon. Friend the Member for Copeland the reason why the
option of a public-private partnership was not pursued, but essentially
it was because BNG would not have the required critical
mass.</p><p><a name="060518114000445">The decision
for Government was not straightforward, and was taken only after
extensive consultation with key stakeholders. We were especially keen
that the sale should not impact negatively on the NDA&#146;s mission,
and we have moved forward carefully to ensure that we have fully
considered the issues. However, I am absolutely confident that we now
have the right result, and one that will contribute to improved
clean-up performance for the NDA by introducing external expertise more
quickly.</p><p><a name="060518114000446">The
NDA&#146;s competition timetable reflects its broader strategy to
prioritise the tackling of the highest 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1180</b><br>hazards. Rather than run its own separate competition for Sellafield,
the NDA was able to accommodate the sale by letting a new five-year
contract for that site. That will commence next year, at the point when
the new owner acquires BNG. The NDA and BNFL will thus work closely
throughout the competitive sale process. The aim will be to ensure that
the successful bidder is the best available to improve performance
substantially, particularly at Sellafield. Therefore, the selection
criteria will be focused mainly on issues such as safety, reducing high
hazards, driving down costs through better planning and more
innovation, accelerating clean-up and improved managed
capability.</p><p><a name="060518114000447">This
debate is not the occasion to discuss the problems involved in nuclear
decommissioning, but it is worth noting that they represent some of the
really big challenges facing this country in the coming half century.
Over the summer, the expert group CORUM will present a report with
proposals on what might be called the final resting place for nuclear
waste. Those are critical issues.</p><p><a name="060518114000448"><b><a name="060518114000724">Mr.
Drew:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that decommissioning
represents a global rather than a purely national challenge?
Increasingly, global relationships will have an impact on the nuclear
industry. We have expertise in some areas, but will also have to borrow
expertise from other parts of the world. Likewise, other countries will
want our expertise in
decommissioning.</p><p><a name="060518114000449"><b><a name="060518114000725">Malcolm
Wicks:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend. The BNG sale enables
us to assess the best bidders and to draw on their expertise, but he is
right that Britain has great skills when it comes to nuclear energy.
Indeed, we are very good at energy as a whole and we need to seize the
chance to become one of the leading countries in nuclear
power.</p><p><a name="060518114000450">In assessing
bids for BNG, the main emphasis will be on achieving value by making
sustainable clean-up improvements in the longer term. We will keep in
mind the fact that a sustained 10 per cent. efficiency improvement
equates to a &#163;200 million saving on the NDA&#146;s annual
budget, which can be ploughed straight back into more work. Clearly,
however, there is still some way to go and it is much too early to
speculate about the commercial basis on which BNFL, working with the
NDA, will organise the sale process.</p><p><a name="060518114000451">It is expected that the
competitive sale process will start in April 2007 with completion up to
six months later. Details will be updated on the NDA and BNFL websites,
but it is currently expected that pre-qualification will occur at the
end of the summer. Before the new year, the new draft contract will be
shared with pre-qualified bidders, the regulators and other
stakeholders on a fully open and transparent
basis.</p><p><a name="060518114000452">The sale will
comprise BNG and all its subsidiaries on an integrated basis: project
services, Magnox and spent fuel services will all be included.
Following a successful exit from its legacy contracts, BNG America, the
US clean-up subsidiary, has already been sold with no continuing
liabilities. Magnox has been included on the understanding that its
inclusion does 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1181</b><br>not disrupt the Magnox competitions due to start in 2008, or possibly
2009. Given the short time gap between completion of the sale and the
start of the competitions, the new owner of BNG will not be expected to
make significant changes to the running of the Magnox stations during
that period.</p><p><a name="060518114000453">BNFL and
the NDA have been maintaining a close dialogue with the unions and
staff over proposals for BNG and that will continue, with the
involvement of the Department as appropriate. I recognise that such
fundamental change creates tremendous uncertainty for the work force,
so I use this opportunity to reaffirm unequivocally that any BNFL
employee whose employment is transferred to a private sector employer
will receive the relevant pensions protections set out in the Energy
Act 2004; or, where they do not apply, in the Cabinet Office statement
of practice for staff transfers in the public
sector.</p><p><a name="060518114000454">The sale of
BNG is entirely consistent with the BNFL strategy review held in 2003,
which concluded that UK clean-up should be BNFL&#146;s priority. It
envisaged that BNG would need to find partners to operate successfully
in the new market being created by the NDA. The review also concluded
that other parts of BNFL should be run for value and to minimise risk
to the UK taxpayer. The sale of Westinghouse has already been
announced. In addition, we are considering the future of BNFL&#146;s
research and development arm, Nexia Solutions, and BNFL is exploring
ways of realising value from its shareholding in
Urenco.</p><p><a name="060518114000455"><b><a name="060518114000726">Mr.
Jamie Reed:</b> An important issue came up in my broad-ranging
discussions in the US last week with Ron Ault from the
AFL-CIO&#151;the US equivalent to the TUC&#151;when we were talking
about companies that might have an interest in BNG and which could have
a direct impact on the lives of people in my community 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1182</b><br>and those of my hon. Friends the Members for Stroud (Mr. Drew) and for
Workington (Tony Cunningham). Mr. Ault said of one company that it
would rather climb a tree than do a deal with labour&#151;meaning the
unions&#151;and that, at any cost, it would pick a fight with the
trade union movement at whichever site it was asked to operate. I shall
not name the company, save to say that it has run into terrible
difficulties at the Hanford vitrification plant. What is my hon. Friend
the Minister&#146;s view on the relationship that American companies
must have with UK working practices and UK working bodies and
representatives on UK nuclear
sites?</p><p><a name="060518114000456"><b><a name="060518114000727">Malcolm
Wicks:</b> I have already paid tribute to the skills of our
work force in the nuclear industry. Those skills need to be safeguarded
and we need to think about the future when, as with other parts of the
energy sector&#151;oil and gas&#151;demographic trends mean that
the average age of workers is increasing. We need to attract new people
to those industries. It is critically important that whoever takes over
BNG has a proper understanding of what these days we call the human
relations side of business. I should rather climb a tree myself than
jeopardise those important relationships. In any case, such companies
would have to contend with my hon. Friend, which would be a formidable
challenge.</p><p><a name="060518114000457">I hope I
have provided clarity on the issues surrounding the BNG sale and the
rationale for approving the board&#146;s decision. In summary, the
Government have been persuaded that it is good for the company, its
people, the NDA, decommissioning and, ultimately, the taxpayer. I thank
my hon. Friend and other colleagues for their contributions to this
short, early, but useful,
debate.</p>
