 Wales Office Ministers have regular discussions with ministerial colleagues on a range of issues including health matters. The border between England and Wales does not represent a barrier to the provision of health care; rather it illustrates that, although there are distinct elements of the health service in both countries, we are still one nation in our commitment to universal access to health care for all our people.</p>

 I thank the Minister for his response, but I am afraid I shall have to disagree with it. In Wales, 20 per cent. of patients&#151;one fifth&#151;must wait more than 14 weeks to be admitted to hospital, whereas in England the proportion is only 5 per cent. Why are Welsh patients treated as second-class citizens in the context of the national health service?</p>

 With all due respect, that is not the case. Waiting times on both sides of the border have fallen dramatically. Nine out of 10 patients in Wales are seen within four hours in accident and emergency departments, while 90 per cent. fewer in-patients and 99 per cent. fewer out-patients wait more than 22 weeks for appointments than was the case a year ago. In short, the position has improved dramatically, and there is great comparability between Wales and England.</p>

 That is completely untrue. Let me emphasise that we do, very much, have a national health service for all our people. Of course I know full well that the hon.

That does not mean, however, that we question the integrity of the national health service over the country as a whole. I believe that the two can operate together, as has been the case.</p>

 Again, I thank the hon. Gentleman for his kind welcome, and I am sure that he is right to say that I will be extremely busy in my post. The issue he touches upon will undoubtedly require my attention. However, I should stress that the health service budget in Wales has increased dramatically over the past few years. That is true, too, for the current budget: the draft budget from the Welsh Assembly Government again proposes an increase that is far in excess of the rate of inflation. I therefore think that there is plenty of scope within that broad expansion of finance to address the issues the hon. Gentleman is concerned about.</p>

my ministerial colleagues, I will look at the question of advice, but I repeat what I said to the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd): the advice generally from the Treasury and the Assembly is that the investment should be spread, and that security should be balanced with investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="81022-0002.htm_para0"><a name="08102242000075">Given the well-reported increasing risk attached to Icelandic financial institutions, why was no revised advice issued to Welsh public institutions earlier?

 I was told by the Treasury that so far as its advice was concerned, it did not provide a list of individual banks or institutions in recent years and months, and it was up to individual authorities to judge what a prudent investment might or might not be, and of course, there would be professional advisers, as well. However, I repeat what I have said twice already: that that guidance had to be balanced between a breadth of investment and security, and every council has a responsibility so to do.</p>

 I thank the Secretary of State for that answer. In the joint statement from his Department with the Assembly Minister, the Minister said that there would be no immediate impact on services or council tax levels following this debacle, but as local authorities are now switching investment strategies toward low-risk, low-yield funds, their budgets are based on figures that cannot be achieved, and something has to give. When can we expect to see the council tax rise, assets sold or spending cut in Wales?</p>

 I obviously hope that none of that occurs, but the issue first, as I said, is to get the money back from Iceland. When that is done, it is for each individual authority in Wales that feels it has a difficulty to approach the Welsh Assembly Government, and then proper advice will be given to it. Of course, as the hon. Lady knows, nine authorities are involved to varying degrees. All of us have been told by the Local Government Association that there is no immediate threat to services or, indeed, to the level of council tax.</p>

<a name="ordayhd_0"><a name="81022-0004.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="08102242001094"><h5 align="left">12.31 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o96"><a name="08102242000160"><a name="81022-0004.htm_spmin0"><a name="08102242001234"><b>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b>
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I shall now make a statement on the latest Government measures to help small businesses. The Government understand that many small firms are having real difficulties as a result of the credit crunch and worldwide economic slowdown. Those companies are critical to our long-term economic success. More than 99 per cent. of UK businesses are small and medium-sized enterprises. They contribute as much as large businesses to UK output, and nearly 60 per cent. of private sector jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08102242000161">We have always made getting the business environment right for SMEs a priority, and since 1997, 1 million more small businesses have been created. UK SMEs employ 1.5 million more people; they are more productive and more innovative, and they survive longer. Most recently, our enterprise strategy set out our renewed vision to make the UK the world&#146;s most enterprising economy and the best place to grow and start a business. We increased the small firms loan guarantee lending allocations by 20 per cent. for 2008, boosted enterprise programmes and committed to a new approach that avoids placing unnecessary regulatory burdens on smaller firms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08102242000162">These tough times have only made us only more determined to help SMEs. We need to be practical and innovative; above all, we need to ensure that what we do makes a real difference. We are meeting business organisations and businesses across the country to discuss the problems that they are facing, such as cash flow, access to finance and higher bank charges and costs, and to ensure that their views are reflected in Government action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08102242000163">Our first priority has been restoring financial stability. Without a strong financial system, small businesses cannot access the credit that they need, homeowners struggle with their mortgages, and trade in the high street slows down. But as the impact of the global financial squeeze hits small businesses further, the Government believe that it is not enough for us to focus on financial stability alone. So, building on the measures that we have already brought forward, the Government announced yesterday further action, with immediate effect, to help SMEs through these tougher times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08102242000164">For SMEs, cash dominates: cash in&#151;prompt payment&#151;and cash out, to their work force, for inputs and to the Revenue. Over the past year, the time that organisations take to pay their bills to suppliers has increased, intensifying the cash-flow pressures of many businesses. The Government are determined to do everything they can to help. The Government will aim to pay their suppliers as soon as possible, and within 10 days at the latest. That will bring forward billions of pounds-worth of payments, on top of the majority of payments already made within 10 days. The regional development agencies, which spend around &#163;750 million annually with suppliers, have also committed to that. Yesterday, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government wrote to the Local Government Association, and the chief executive of the national health service wrote to NHS trusts, asking those public bodies to review their payment performance and to follow the Government&#146;s lead.</p>

HMRC already has a policy of flexibility in dealing with struggling businesses, and I know that the Treasury will continue to impress upon it the importance of implementing and publicising that policy in the current climate.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08102242000168">Small businesses must know that the banks are open for business. RBS, HBOS and Lloyds TSB make up 50 per cent. of small business lending, but given that they operate in a competitive environment, we can expect other banks to follow suit. The Government will monitor how recapitalised banks are delivering their commitment on SME lending. We will ask the banks how they will achieve that, including the availability of capital and liquidity allocated for small businesses, marketing plans, and their principles for SME lending, from head office to branch level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08102242000169">We want to see banks taking appropriate risk assessments on SME lending&#151;being responsible but not unduly risk-averse, and not passing on unreasonable costs. The Chancellor and my right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08102242000170">The Government have also been brokering contact between UK banks and the European Investment Bank. The four largest UK banks have now signalled their initial interest in negotiating loans totalling about &#163;1 billion from the EIB to lend to UK SMEs. I hope that we will be able to make rapid progress on that for small businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08102242000171">It is critical at this difficult time that businesses have access to support and advice that helps them to survive now and succeed in the future.

Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills yesterday announced that small businesses are the focus of &#163;350 million of Government funds to help them get through the tougher economic climate by building the skills and expertise of their workers. The Government are making improvements to Train to Gain that will deliver advice and funding for training, with the minimum bureaucracy and delay.

That is why we have brought forward these measures, and we will continue to do all we can through the work of the National Economic Council to look for and implement solutions that help SMEs. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

 The Minister&#146;s statement is an unprecedented occasion, representing an unacceptable mixture of farce and contempt. The Department has no one of Cabinet rank in this House, so instead, a Minister has just read out a statement that the real Secretary of State will deliver in another place in three hours&#146; time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08102242000175">Last week the Leader of the House said that there would be no statement delivered today, but then today&#146;s announcements were made first in a Select Committee, then in a press release sent out by the Department yesterday lunchtime, and then in a press conference attended by the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister. If the real Secretary of State says something in the House of Lords that the Minister has not said here, will we be entitled to a further statement tomorrow?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para13"><a name="08102242000176">The Government have been slow to cotton on to the fact that the turmoil witnessed over the past few months in financial markets is now causing the deepest imaginable pain for businesses both big and small throughout the country. Is there not a danger that even the most imaginative measures to assist business cash flow will simply be too small and puny to cope with the scale of the fallout caused by a decade of Government mismanagement and financial hubris?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08102242000177">We have been ahead of the Government in sounding the alarm about the debt that has been built up, the taxes that have been raised and the irresponsible financial practices at the heart of Government. We want to see some immediate practical assistance for small businesses, which are having to deal with serious cash-flow problems: prompt payment from central and local government, deferral of VAT, a cut in national insurance, a reduction in corporation tax for small business, and more promotion of the small business rate relief, to which many are entitled but for which not all apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para15"><a name="08102242000178">Will the Minister therefore confirm that the &#163;350 million that was announced yesterday, and repeated today, to help SMEs train staff is, in fact, just a reheat of old money and a recycling of old schemes? How, indeed, can the Government possibly monitor prompt payment by Government and Government agencies, when they have admitted in a parliamentary answer that they never even record that information?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para16"><a name="08102242000179">On what basis can the Minister defend the assertion made by the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills on the &#147;Today&#148; programme, and repeated today, that bank lending will continue at 2007 levels? How will the Minister measure that? Is it not the case that all over the country, contrary to the Government&#146;s assertions, overdraft facilities are being viciously called  <br>

in by the banks, to the severe detriment of thousands of businesses? Is it not blatantly evident that banks are not continuing to lend as the Government say they are and must, but are in fact pulling the rug from under many perfectly good firms?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para17"><a name="08102242000180">To whom can business turn for a reprieve, when a bank declares that it will withdraw an overdraft facility or suddenly call in guarantees? What is the Minister&#146;s estimate of the number of businesses that will go to the wall in the coming year? Does he agree with some independent economic experts that unemployment will shoot through the 3 million mark by the end of next year? Is it not the case that although the base rate is falling, actual borrowing costs are rising through 15 per cent.?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para18"><a name="08102242000181">The Minister mentioned the small firms loan guarantee scheme, but what plans do the Government have to extend this very narrow scheme to help businesses more widely? How, indeed, can they claim that regional development agencies will make a difference when the Government have just raided their budget to prop up the housing market?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para19"><a name="08102242000182">Does the Minister share my analysis that there is growing anger that a Prime Minister who has spent the last years declaring that he has abolished boom and bust, while in fact storing up all the trouble that is now hitting us hard, is massively to blame for mortgaging this country just as bankers have mortgaged their banks? While demanding praise for building what he has not yet even paid for, he has delivered only the illusion of prosperity, behind which will now follow massive bills for future generations to pay. Having built the country on a mountain of debt, the Labour Government are now as bankrupt as the economy that they have created. Does that not prove the abiding truth of post-war British politics&#151;that Labour Governments always run out of money?</p>

 I start by thanking the hon. Gentleman for his courteous welcome to me at the Dispatch Box.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para20"><a name="08102242000184">What we are doing as a Government is concentrating on the real work of helping small businesses through difficult economic times. I would have liked to think that he would welcome the package of measures that we are announcing today. He mentioned small business rate relief, so may I remind him that the Opposition voted against the Bill introducing it?</p>

Gentleman posed, first about the &#163;350 million announced by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. That focuses on SMEs as a top priority and relaxes the rules on spending on training to gain. I should have thought that that would be widely welcomed at a time when companies are thinking about shedding staff and about whether to move to short-time working. I should have thought that the ability to say, &#147;You can work four days a week and you can train for one, so you will have additional skills,&#148; would be warmly welcomed during these difficult economic times. I am surprised that the Opposition do not seem to accept that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para22"><a name="08102242000186">On the subject of prompt payment, the hon.

of payments are already made within 10 days. If we can get this right, it could be a big boost to help small companies, but we are paying with taxpayers&#146; money and we need to make sure, when we are safeguarding the public purse, that the goods and services have been delivered and the invoice is right. We will then do everything we can to ensure that it is paid within 10 days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para23"><a name="08102242000187">Let me repeat the point about bank lending. We are not saying that there should be lending at 2007 levels; we are saying that the availability of that funding should be at 2007 levels, and that we expect banks to market actively and to offer competitively priced products to the SME sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para24"><a name="08102242000188">There is clearly an issue in relation to rates. There is a great deal of anecdotal evidence out there suggesting that some banks are starting to look again at their lending practices and are insisting on higher margins. Although we cannot interfere in individual lending decisions and it would be wrong to do so, it is right that we should expect banks to be clear about their lending principles. That will be one of the subjects for discussion when my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the Chancellor meet the banks tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para25"><a name="08102242000189">There was an accusation from the Opposition that we have been too slow in taking action. In March we announced that we would increase the small firms loan guarantee scheme by 20 per cent., because we understood that companies were going through difficult times and would need extra support. We are making such decisions. I heard the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) argue last night in the debate that there should be lower spending. I do not see how, in our current difficult economic times, low spending will help the SMEs that he professes to want to support. That is bad economics, and he should be ashamed of himself.</p>

 The Chancellor of the Exchequer is considering bringing forward capital works in order to stimulate the economy in the face of the economic downturn. Is the Minister aware that improvements to the major road network and local rail services in the north-east, which are currently outside the scope of regional funding allocations, would be of major benefit to small businesses in the north-east, which have been calling for such improvements for some time? Will my hon. Friend draw to the attention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer the opportunity that the proposal presents for helping small businesses in the north-east of England?</p>

 My hon.

much new in it. The hon. Gentleman is right to draw attention to the importance of small businesses, which are the bedrock of commerce in many parts of the country and vital for our long-term economic growth. The key issue facing small businesses is cash flow and, more particularly, the availability of bank finance. Will he explain how the Government will ensure that the banks negotiating for refinancing will actually deliver on the sentiment? The sentiment in favour of maintaining availability is fine and laudable, but how will the Government ensure that that is what happens? May I suggest that a memorandum of understanding be agreed between the Government and the banks, which specifically deals with the question of rates, fees and availability? That should be agreed in principle in advance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para26"><a name="08102242000193">On payments to small companies, I welcome the move to oblige public sector bodies to pay up quickly, and within 10 days, if possible. Again, however, how will the Minister ensure that that actually happens, given that most of those bodies have computerised payment systems that operate on a monthly basis?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para27"><a name="08102242000194">How will the Minister ensure that HMRC will be more flexible, particularly when the work force change programme is taking 10,000 skilled people out of HMRC and replacing them with a call centre operation? And what can he do to ensure that private companies, too, pay more quickly? Will he talk to the CBI about how it could talk to its members about that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="81022-0004.htm_para28"><a name="08102242000195">The Minister mentioned the small firms loan guarantee scheme. Is he aware that its annual report, published in August this year, noted a further decline in the number of loans given&#151;notwithstanding the new money. Total loans now stand at &#163;270 million, but default rates are about 13 per cent., and the biggest complaint from small businesses is about the administrative burden of getting into the scheme. The best way to make that scheme work is to improve the administration, so what action is the Minister taking to get the administration right?</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments, particularly his welcome for the Government&#146;s attempt to ensure prompt payments. Yes, there are administrative difficulties in carrying out some of these measures, but there is a clear commitment from the top to do that. We need to ensure that the system continues to deliver. As I said, a significant majority of payments are already being made within 10 days, but we need to consider how to raise that performance; it is a question of managing for better performance. Yes, we also want to encourage large private companies to pay their suppliers more promptly, and I have no doubt that we will want to discuss the matter with them.</p>

 My hon. Friend raises a number of points, most of which are the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Administration and its Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. I cannot reply to those questions, but in response to his question about his desire for HMRC to show more flexibility, I can be pretty clear. We do not want HMRC to be first in the queue to put companies into bankruptcy in order to get their money.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. May I raise a matter of the greatest importance affecting your role as the defender of the interests of Members of Parliament? A decision has been taken and, sadly, Members have been denied an opportunity to comment on it. It was a decision to give an indemnity to an American company against future accidents that could cost the taxpayers multi-billion pound amounts. Information was given only to the Chairs of two Select Committees, while the minute informing Members arrived at the House only last week, 75 days after the date that was laid down for us to comment on it. That means there is no opportunity for us to comment on what appears to be a reversal of Government policy in subsidising the nuclear industry. It is a matter of great importance, which could lead in future to a very big bill for taxpayers.</p>

 What the hon. Gentleman raises is not a matter for me, but I understand his concern. It sounds to me like a good subject for an Adjournment debate, and I am quite sure he would be more than capable of informing the House of his concerns if such a debate were granted by Mr. Speaker.</p>

<a name="ordayhd_2"><a name="81022-0006.htm_ordayhd1"><a name="08102242001096"><h5 align="left">1.18 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o144"><a name="08102242000246"><a name="81022-0006.htm_spnew2"><a name="08102242001282"><b>Mr. George Howarth (Knowsley, North and Sefton, East) (Lab):</b>
 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="81022-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="08102242001040"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make requirements about the integration of health and safety issues in education and vocational training; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para0"><a name="08102242000247">Accidents at work destroy lives and cost money. Many, although not all, can be prevented. No amount of regulation or training can wholly eliminate human risk or error, but it is right that dangerous practices should be regulated. The principal focus of this Bill is to change mindsets, so that by the time young people reach employment they already have an understanding of the principles and practice of good health and safety. Correspondingly, the purpose of the Bill is to reduce the human, economic and social toll that results from poor management of health and safety risks, through effective education and training. It would achieve that by embedding health and safety into national vocational and professional curricula and helping to provide the skills needed to keep people well and to create and sustain a modern and competitive work force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para1"><a name="08102242000248">Before I talk about the measures in the Bill, it is important to put it in context. Some 247 people were killed at work last year and 274,000 seriously injured. Some 2.2 million suffered an illness that they attributed to work. In addition, it is estimated that up to 1,000 people a year are killed in work-related road accidents and that thousands more die from occupational cancers. That is a particular concern in Knowsley, which is represented by myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, South (Mr. O'Hara), who is in his place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para2"><a name="08102242000249">In the past decade in Britain, 64 under-19s were killed at work, nearly 15,000 suffered major injuries and more than 50,000 other teenagers were hurt by their work. It has been estimated that the cost to society of workplace accidents and work-related ill health is up to &#163;31.8 billion a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para3"><a name="08102242000250">Reducing the number of needlessly lost and devastated lives must be a priority. We are fortunate that there is also a strong economic rationale for doing that. The Health and Safety Executive estimates that the cost to society of workplace accidents and work-related ill health ranges between &#163;20 billion and &#163;31.8 billion per annum. The total cost to individuals is estimated at between &#163;10.1 billion and &#163;14.7 billion a year, and the cost to employers at between &#163;3.9 billion and &#163;7.8 billion a year. A reduction in accidents will lead to reduced costs to employers, through less staff absence, and fewer disruptions in work flow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para4"><a name="08102242000251">The Bill provides the scope to build on the foundations already laid in schools, so that workplaces provide adequate training for all levels of the work force. Those in crucial vocational and professional roles such as architects, planners, designers, engineers, managers, doctors and teachers need to understand the essentials of health and safety so that core principles can be designed into buildings and new ventures rather than imposed after the fact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para5"><a name="08102242000252">There is a straightforward way to ensure that standards are raised consistently across the board. We need to embed relevant health and safety understanding as an integral element of all curricula. Clearly, that needs to be tailored to different ages and levels of expertise, but it makes sense to begin at an early age by tackling health and safety in schools before students start their work experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para6"><a name="08102242000253">The Department of Health&#146;s national director for health and work, Dame Carol Black, has rightly pointed out that future generations will have higher expectations, stating:</p>
<a name="81022-0006.htm_brev1"><a name="08102242001041"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Healthy workplaces need to become the expected norm...schools, further education and higher education have a role in embedding these expectations into the next generation.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para7"><a name="08102242000254">The good news is that much work has already been done. The Institution of Occupational Safety and Health, which I should thank for providing a good deal of briefing material for the Bill, has worked with the HSE, teachers and young people themselves to produce the workplace hazard awareness course, or WHAC. It is a free resource for teachers that emphasises the need to take a balanced approach. Additionally, it is important that managers understand their responsibilities, including how to supervise young people properly, and that people vetting work placements are suitably trained in health and safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para8"><a name="08102242000255">A number of things could be done to ensure a safe start in work. First, teacher training should equip new teachers to deliver a short course on health and safety so that students are properly prepared for their first work experience. There is also a need for professional development to help existing teachers achieve similar objectives. Secondly, we need to teach health and safety in the classroom before young people start work experience. WHAC, produced by the IOSH and the HSE, should be delivered as part of work experience preparation and could lead to a level 3 entry qualification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para9"><a name="08102242000256">Thirdly, work placements should be organised in suitable environments. That means that people with the right health and safety knowledge must check that employers and workplaces are suitable. Training that meets national standards would help to achieve consistency and should be applied by schools, colleges and local authorities. That could be achieved more easily if bodies that award Government funding to work placement organisers required suitably trained placement officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para10"><a name="08102242000257">Fourthly, employer vetting and workplace supervision need to improve. The HSE and the Learning and Skills Council have improved the guidance to those involved in educating, training and employing young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para11"><a name="08102242000258">Fifthly, accidents need to be properly reported so that lessons are learned. There is a general problem of accidents being under-reported both at work and in education. Schools and colleges running vocational training on their premises are currently required to report only incidents in which students are killed or taken to hospital, as they are classed as members of the public. I ask the Government to consider tightening up the reporting requirements for students in colleges and schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para12"><a name="08102242000259">Sixthly, health and safety needs to be a priority. The Government should signal the importance of health and safety when setting their strategic priorities for education, training and skills. There is an opportunity for the Government to show leadership on the matter.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 Oct 2008">

<notus-date day="22" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>22 Oct 2008 : Column 321</b><br>
For example, in England the health and safety of young people on Government-funded programmes could be noted as a key priority in the next LSC grant letter, which is due in November.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para13"><a name="08102242000260">I welcome the Government&#146;s new Education and Skills Bill. Its drive to improve the skills of the UK&#146;s work force is a welcome opportunity to integrate core health and safety principles into the training and education system. Health and safety should be seen as a key component of modern apprenticeships and new diplomas. It should also routinely be part of the disciplines of business and management qualifications, just as they currently cover marketing, finance and human resources. Such work is already being carried out by the inter-institutional group on health, safety and risk, to ensure that adequate health and safety knowledge is provided to engineering undergraduates. One such programme is being trialled at the university of Liverpool. All of that amounts to a welcome step forward, but more needs to be done so that business schools and universities systematically include health and safety in vocational disciplines, especially MBA programmes. Health and safety at work should also be fully incorporated into the new qualifications and credit framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para14"><a name="08102242000261">Finally, it is worth remembering that evidence shows that people new to workplaces are at a greater relative risk of work-related injury. Rhys Davies and Paul Jones of the Warwick Institute for Employment Research estimate:</p>
<a name="81022-0006.htm_brev2"><a name="08102242001042"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Those with current employment tenure of less than one month are almost 400 per cent. more likely to have a workplace injury than those with 20 years or more experience in their current job.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para15"><a name="08102242000262">Their research showed clearly that the risks are greatest in the first four months of a new job, which also has implications for those working on short-term or agency contracts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para16"><a name="08102242000263">The Bill would create an opportunity to prepare young people so that when they begin their working lives, they are better able to handle the risks that face them. In time, that change in mindset will reduce unnecessary risk.</p>

appropriate time to put it to you. As you know, Sir, I wrote to you last week regarding the selection of amendments. I accept totally that it is absolutely within your discretion to decide what amendments you select for debate, and that you are not required by precedent or procedure to state the reasons why you have selected them. Nevertheless, I am asking, and I will accept it entirely if you say that my point of order is invalid or that I am not raising it at the right time, whether it is open to you to explain to the House&#151;if it is not, I accept that&#151;how it comes about that you have selected a large succession of new clauses on abortion when there is no reference in the Bill to abortion.</p>

 First, the right hon. Gentleman did write to me, but I did not reply to him or to any other letters because I did not want to be drawn into this argument. It was only this morning that I was drawn into the argument, but I think that I can put on the record that I did not reply to the right hon. Gentleman for the reason that I have given. The amendments were selected because they were within the scope of the Bill; it is a simple as that. All the amendments on the Order Paper are there because they are within the scope of the Bill, and that is the explanation.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I should be grateful for your advice and I am sorry that I have not had a chance to give you advance notice of this point of order.

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker.

Do I take it that you accept that the Speaker has no discretion whatever if the Government of the day choose to order for debate amendments, as well as new clauses, in whichever order they deem fit? Obviously, the consequence is that they are able to choose that the House debate only those matters that are not, for some reason, inconvenient for them to have debated, and everything else falls to a guillotine under our new timetabled arrangements.</p>

I am not suggesting that it should do that, but the House can vote the programme motion down, and if it does, we revert to the situation where the clauses are in the order of consideration.

They have a potentially profound impact. One in seven couples needs help with fertility treatment; 350,000 people in this country live with Alzheimer&#146;s; every week, five children are born with, and three young people die from, cystic fibrosis. All those issues, and the potential for treatments, this Bill addresses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para23"><a name="08102242000281">Today is the last opportunity for the House to debate the Bill before it returns to the other place for consideration of the amendments that we have made. We have amendments for debate today that cover embryo research, the definition of embryos, the parenthood of people who receive assisted reproduction treatment, and saviour siblings. These matters go to the very heart of the Bill and they need consideration before it finally leaves this Chamber. The programme motion provides for that.</p>

 I shall confine my remarks at this stage specifically to the programme motion. As the Minister correctly said, this is the last chance for the House to discuss many detailed and complex issues before the Bill moves to the other place. We Conservatives have a completely free vote on the Bill&#151;from the programme motion to all amendments, and through to Third Reading&#151;and in my view the Government should have had far more free votes on it, as was the case with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. The Government had free votes on only the three key areas, in addition to abortion: admixed embryos, saviour siblings and the need for a father.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="81022-0006.htm_para24"><a name="08102242000283">The Conservatives have a totally free vote, so my remarks from this Dispatch Box will be personal ones. Clearly, having one day to debate the volume of amendments that have been tabled, both about the main part of the Bill and about abortion, demonstrates what a insignificant amount of time the Government have allocated. It is possible that significant aspects of the Bill will not have been debated on the Floor of the House and will not be reached.

There is real concern and anger in all parts of the House about the Government&#146;s tactics to limit debate, both on abortion and on other key aspects of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="81022-0007.htm_para1"><a name="08102242000285">I know that the Minister wants to ensure that the Bill, when it is enacted, has the same longevity as the 1990 Act, and like most Members of this House, I share that aim. A key part of the 1990 Act&#146;s success was the depth and thoroughness of the debate and discussion that took place on it, and my fear is that the curtailment of debate today as a result of the programme motion will mean that the same might not be said for this Bill. That is why I shall vote against the programme motion, given the chance.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds) that the Bill deals with large and fundamental moral issues. I am not discussing the Bill&#146;s merits at the moment, but I point out that it deals with fundamental moral issues about the human race. I therefore agree that free votes are appropriate on this Bill, just as they were on the Bill that became the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, when my party, like the hon. Gentleman&#146;s, had free votes throughout.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="81022-0007.htm_para2"><a name="08102242000287">After a great deal of discussion within the Labour party, our Whips have agreed to free votes along the way on this Bill. They have agreed to more free votes than they originally intended&#151;their original intention was that we should have none. Despite the fact that Labour Members are whipped on Second Reading and on Third Reading, paragraph 3 of the parliamentary Labour party&#146;s code of conduct allows members of the PLP not to vote on an issue of this kind. Having written to the Chief Whip, I shall avail myself of paragraph 3 and not vote on Third Reading of the Bill, because I refuse to give it my support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="81022-0007.htm_para3"><a name="08102242000288">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness rightly says that the issues raised in the Bill on which amendments have been tabled and to which the Government are giving priority go to the very heart of the nature of the human race. That is why it is very important that the programme motion allows the opportunity to discuss matters that trouble me and trouble large numbers of my constituents. Such matters relate to hybrid embryos and saviour siblings, among other things. It is essential that this House is given a proper opportunity&#151;and uses it&#151;to debate those issues and to come to decisions on them, whatever those decisions may be. I know on which side I shall be voting, as I did in Committee in May. I go that far with what the hon. Gentleman said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="81022-0007.htm_para4"><a name="08102242000289">This Bill is clearly not about abortion, which is why I raised my point of order with Mr. Speaker before we began discussing the programme motion, why I went to see him and why I wrote to him. The Bill does not contain a single word about abortion; it did not when it was originally published or when it was completed, and  <br>

it does not now. I acknowledge&#151;who would not acknowledge it?&#151;that the issue of abortion is of profound importance, whatever view one takes on it. Many different views on abortion can be taken, so talking about pro-abortion and anti-abortion oversimplifies an approach to a topic on which people have very strong feelings. I respect those feelings, whatever side of the argument they represent. I do not regard it as appropriate for the issue of abortion, given all its profundities and the strong feelings it generates, to be pinned on to this Bill. The Bill was never tabled to deal with abortion and does not deal with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="81022-0007.htm_para5"><a name="08102242000290">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness is right to say that the issues relating to abortion, of which there are many&#151;the time limit is but one such issue, despite its importance; other such issues include medical approval and the question of procedure&#151; are very important. However, it is clearly not appropriate to debate them in relation to a Bill that has nothing to do with abortion. It should be appropriate, at some stage, to debate the issues associated with abortion. Since David Steel introduced his private Member&#146;s Bill, the issue of abortion has never been introduced into, debated by or legislated on by this House of Commons as a Government issue and in Government time. As with a number of other very important moral issues, such as the legalisation of homosexual acts between consenting adults, these matters have been brought before this House of Commons by private Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="81022-0007.htm_para6"><a name="08102242000291">I support the Government&#146;s motion because the abortion issue should not be pinned on to a Bill that is not about abortion. If a Member of Parliament were to be successful in the ballot in the next Session and able to introduce a Bill on the issue, it might be appropriate at that stage for the House to debate it.</p>

 Order. Perhaps it would be convenient for the House if I were to re-emphasise the ruling that Mr. Speaker gave a short while ago that the subject of abortion is within the scope of the Bill. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman wishes to maintain a clear distinction between arguing about Mr. Speaker&#146;s selection and about the order contained in the programme motion.</p>

<p><a name="st_o159"><a name="08102242000293"><a name="81022-0007.htm_spnew2"><a name="08102242001297"><b>Sir Gerald Kaufman:</b>
 I made it perfectly clear in my point of order to Mr. Speaker that I totally respect the Speaker&#146;s right to decide which amendments to select. Once I had put my point of order to Mr. Speaker, I in no way questioned his decision; the House must accept his decision and respect it. If anything that I was just saying appeared to infringe on the Speaker&#146;s absolute right to make a selection within the bounds of order, I am very sorry, because that was never my intention. What the Government have done in this programme motion is to introduce an order in which the groups of amendments should be taken. That order, which the Government are proposing to the House and which I support and shall vote for in the event of a Division, says that amendments on abortion should be dealt with right at the end, after every amendment or group of amendments has been considered. That is appropriate because abortion is a subject all on its own. While it may well come within the ambit of the Bill as drawn, it was not intended by those who drafted the Bill to be debated as part of this Bill. That being so, I support this motion and I shall vote for it.</p>

That was the case in 1967 and 1990. In any event, that is no good reason to prevent debate in this House.</p>

In 1990, the Conservative Government allowed time for discussion of abortion issues. This time, the Labour Government have refused to do so. Will the Minister give a commitment now to allow time at some future point? There has been a suggestion that the Government would commit to allowing time on a private Member&#146;s Bill. Will she now ensure that that is the case, because it is important that this significant issue, with strong feelings on both sides, should be properly aired and debated in this Chamber?</p>

argument that we should have another piece of legislation that would enable a full debate on most of the matters in relation to abortion that have been raised as amendments and new clauses to the Bill, but there is a special case for debating and voting on the particular new clause that I tabled to extend the 1967 Act to Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="81022-0007.htm_para11"><a name="08102242000302">In Northern Ireland, abortion is a criminal justice matter. In due course, criminal justice matters will revert to the Assembly. At present, no major party in the Assembly supports a woman&#146;s right to choose. If we do not debate my new clause today, women in Northern Ireland will lose for a generation the opportunity to gain the rights that women in the rest of the United Kingdom have enjoyed for more than 40 years. The other matters in relation to abortion can come back to the House in due course, but my new clause is widely regarded by the hundreds of women who have written to me as their last chance to get justice on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="81022-0007.htm_para12"><a name="08102242000303">I have been roundly abused by male politicians from Northern Ireland for tabling the new clause, so I wanted to touch not on the substance of the new clause but on why I have tabled it. I have not tabled it out of any desire to run contrary to people&#146;s deeply held religious opinions, nor out of a desire to persuade people in Northern Ireland that abortion is a good thing&#151;which I do not think myself. Nor did I table the new clause to override the authority of the Northern Ireland Assembly. I certainly did not table it to force a single woman in Northern Ireland to have an abortion. I tabled the new clause because, as it stands, the law on abortion in Northern Ireland is the same law that was passed in 1861. So long as this remains the Parliament of the United Kingdom and so long as women in Northern Ireland are citizens of the United Kingdom, we have a responsibility to move those women&#146;s rights into the 21st century.</p>

If we do not have sufficient time to debate my new clause this afternoon, we may miss the opportunity to change that for a generation. Women from Northern Ireland cannot have an abortion in Northern Ireland. The lucky ones are the thousands who have the resources and the support to travel to Britain to get an abortion. How can that be right? If I go to Belfast and break a leg, I can have an operation on the national health service, but because of the manoeuvrings of politicians down the years, poor women have to find the money&#151;at a time of enormous stress and difficulty&#151;to come here and pay for an abortion. I do not wish to speak to the merits of my new clause, but I do wish to emphasise the urgency of this matter. The question is whether this United Kingdom Parliament is content to keep a group of women as second class citizens on this important issue of liberty and rights.</p>

In other words, all the issues that were raised in this House were not raised in another place and have not been debated there. That would not matter if the Bill were starting here, but it started in another place. Surely the Government are right to say that given that we have limited time&#151;which is a shame, because time should not be so limited&#151;the issues that we must discuss are those in the original Bill, which have already been debated and which are still in the Bill, rather than those that were raised only at a late stage in this House, which have never been considered by the other place.</p>

I pay credit to Geoffrey Howe, now Lord Howe, who was then the Leader of the House of Commons. He made it quite plain that he wanted me, as Secretary of State, to ensure that the Bill was drafted in such a way that Mr. Speaker would allow abortion amendments, because there was such a demand from the House that they should be considered. A great deal of time was allowed for the discussion and the law was settled for the next 18 years. It needs to be revisited and debated again.</p>

 I rise to support the Government and the programme motion. I assure the House that my party was not party to any deal whatsoever on this issue.</p>

Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) referred to her new clause 30, which is before the House today and which would have the effect of extending the Abortion Act 1967 to Northern Ireland. One reason for our support of the programme motion is that we believe that it is not appropriate for the House to debate that new clause today, as there is strong opposition in Northern Ireland to the proposition on which it is based.</p>

Friend the Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson), who is my party leader, the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Adams), the leader of Sinn Fein, the hon.

the electorate in Northern Ireland, and have more than 100 seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly. That makes it clear that this sensitive matter should be dealt with by the Assembly and not by this Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="81022-0008.htm_para2"><a name="08102242000323">Northern Ireland has had separate legislation on this and many other issues, going back centuries. Indeed, there are different bodies of law that apply in Scotland and Wales, and there is nothing unique about the issue of abortion. In Northern Ireland, we have laws in respect of other matters of legality that are different from the laws that apply in other parts of the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="81022-0008.htm_para3"><a name="08102242000324">It is clear that we should consider only the human fertilisation and embryology element of the Bill and not try to tack on something that will cause considerable problems for the political process in Northern Ireland. The implementation of the 1967 Act, if it were to be extended to Northern Ireland, would fall largely to the Northern Ireland Assembly. It would therefore be entirely wrong for this House to legislate against the wishes of the parties in the Assembly, as those parties would be required to implement a law with which they did not agree.</p>

 Unless my memory serves me false&#151;which it may be doing&#151;my recollection is that the right hon. Gentleman did try to amend the Bill at an earlier stage in order to add abortion issues to it. If so, does he agree that his argument simply will not wash?</p>

<p><a name="st_o170"><a name="08102242000326"><a name="81022-0008.htm_spnew2"><a name="08102242001308"><b>Mr. Donaldson:</b>
 I did not table any amendments to this Bill at any stage, so the hon. Gentleman is entirely incorrect in that respect. As far as the principle is concerned, any Member of this House is of course free to vote on any amendment, but new clause 30 has been tabled by hon. Members who represent constituencies where abortion is already available. We are dealing with these matters in the context of the 1967 Act, and no hon. Member with a constituency in Northern Ireland supports new clause 30. Indeed, the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington has not set foot in Northern Ireland to talk to people about this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="81022-0008.htm_para4"><a name="08102242000327">The hon. Lady has not consulted about her new clause, even though section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998&#151;which was passed by this House and which enacted the Belfast agreement&#151;requires that any major legislation brought forward by Parliament or the Assembly should be subject to proper consultation and equality impact assessments. There is no opportunity for the public to be consulted about new clause 30, so she and the other hon. Members who have proposed the new clause are simply seeking to impose their will in a way that goes against the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland and of their elected representatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="81022-0008.htm_para5"><a name="08102242000328">The leaders of the four main parties in Northern Ireland have written to all hon. Members to say that the matter should be addressed by the Northern Ireland Assembly, and not by this House. That is why I urge the House to support the programme motion, and to leave this matter to the people of Northern Ireland and their elected representatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="81022-0008.htm_para6"><a name="08102242000330">The Bill is about human fertilisation and embryology issues, but that is not the perception in the public arena. The media coverage that the Bill has received means that the public perception is that it is purely about abortion, and that is why I support the programme motion. Abortion is a very serious issue, and I accept that it comes within the scope of the Bill, but it is not the dominant aspect of the Bill and there are many other important matters that need proper debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="81022-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08102242000331">I believe that there should be a proper review of the Abortion Act 1967. That is the way ahead, because it would allow people on both sides of the argument to have a reasonably intense and detailed debate. If we were being honest with ourselves, we would not play this sort of game. We would treat all of these subjects with great seriousness.</p>

 I do not often feel sorry for the Government, but in a sense they are the victims of their own actions. We are debating these matters because they have recognised the pent-up demand in the House to examine the abortion issue, and the logical result of that is that any hon. Member can table an amendment on the subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="81022-0008.htm_para8"><a name="08102242000333">We all recognise that the Bill is fundamentally about human fertilisation and embryology, and that is a very big and important subject. I must gently disagree with the hon. Member for Heywood and Middleton (Jim Dobbin) and what he said about the amount of publicity given to the human fertilisation and embryology element of the Bill, but there is huge demand for clarification and modernisation of the law on abortion. That is what all the amendments are about, and I very much agree with those who have pointed out that there is plenty of time in our parliamentary timetable for the necessary debates to take place. That is why I shall go into the No Lobby against the Government, even though in general I approve of what they are trying to do with the Bill.</p>

 I am very disappointed to have to state that I will have great difficulty in supporting the programme motion this afternoon. I chair the House&#146;s all-party fertility group, and am well aware that the community of people outside the House who have serious problems conceiving are looking to the Bill for support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="81022-0008.htm_para9"><a name="08102242000335">However, the Bill makes no mention of access to NHS facilities&#151;something that was discussed in full in the other place. There, the subject was given a very fair run, but we in this House are not allowed to discuss it. The Bill focuses on the regulation of IVF treatment and research, and makes no mention of the many other treatments that infertile people can access.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It is with great regret that I shall not be supporting the timetable motion. I have supported the Government through thick and thin, I think, in their attempt to get on the statute book a moderate and tolerant piece of legislation that is absolutely necessary. I have accepted that it is perfectly in order to debate the question of abortion, so I regret very much that we shall probably not have time this afternoon to discuss even those important issues&#151;such as parenthood, surrogacy or saviour siblings&#151;that relate to the original Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="81022-0008.htm_para13"><a name="08102242000342">That is a very great regret, because I think that the Government are well intentioned with this Bill. I therefore ask that they&#151;and Parliament&#151;consider changing the habits of a lifetime: they should accept that the very important issue of abortion should not be shuffled off to a private Member&#146;s Bill but instead tackled in Government time with a Government Bill. We are mature enough in this country now to take those issues as public business; they are public business. I therefore hope that they will be so treated in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="81022-0008.htm_para14"><a name="08102242000343">Meanwhile, I shall vote against the programme motion, because it ignores the wishes not only of almost everyone in the Chamber today, but of our constituents, who are bemused, indeed amazed, that although we have plenty of time, the Government are rushing the Bill through&#151;even though they are largely right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="81022-0008.htm_para15"><a name="08102242000345">These are very important matters, and it is important to focus on the Bill. It is about IVF treatment. Actually, it is about access to the treatment, the improvement of that treatment and broadening the range of people who are entitled to it. It is about research on debilitating and killing diseases and about giving hope. The Bill has had 81 hours of debate thus far. Unusually, it has had two days on the Floor of the House&#151;unique for this type of Bill&#151;including time for the debate on abortion, without restriction on the subjects on which amendments could be tabled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="81022-0008.htm_para16"><a name="08102242000346">I shall answer two specific questions that have been put to me. First, there are no plans to introduce a Bill on abortion. Secondly, in answer to my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) who asked about a special Committee of both Houses, that is not a matter for Ministers; it is a matter for the House authorities, and he can pursue that if he wishes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="81022-0009.htm_para6"><a name="08102242000846">New clause 24&#151;<i> Prohibition on placing human gametes into an animal&#151;</i></p>

<p><a name="81022-0009.htm_amdt13">&#145;(1) The Secretary of State shall by regulations make it an offence to place any human gamete into an animal.</p>

<p><a name="81022-0009.htm_amdt14">(2) Sections 3 and 4 of this Act shall not come into force until regulations under subsection (1) have been made.&#146;.</p>

<p><a name="st_o182"><a name="08102242000847"><a name="81022-0009.htm_spnew2"><a name="08102242001803"><b>Dr. Pugh:</b>
 As sufficient brickbats have been handed out so far, may I put on record that this emotive Bill was dealt with courteously and considerately in Committee?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="81022-0009.htm_para7"><a name="08102242000848">The big debate is about whether it is right to extend the range of experiments involving the human embryo that may be carried out. The alleged goal is the extension of scientific and medical knowledge that could alleviate human suffering, especially, but not exclusively, that of a generic origin. For some hon. Members, no possible reduction in suffering, improvement in maternity or growth of knowledge can justify what they regard as the violation of human life and the interference with normal human development. Their position is unqualified. For many hon. Members in the Chamber, however, this is a case of balancing hope and fear. On the one hand, there is the hope that some day, terrible inheritable and cellular diseases will be conquered, and on the other hand, there is the fear that an increasingly casual approach to human life will denature our society and create possibilities that we would not wish. That balance is being played out in nearly every Member&#146;s head.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="81022-0009.htm_para8"><a name="08102242000849">I suspect that we cannot know with any confidence whether those hopes or fears&#151;or both&#151;will be realised many years hence, so we all act on a kind of faith. Our position depends on whether we believe that the grounds for hope outweigh the grounds for fear, or vice versa. On Second Reading, that point was made most eloquently by the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman), who is not in the Chamber; he said that he was more fearful than hopeful. That is the heart of the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="81022-0009.htm_para9"><a name="08102242000850">Whatever one&#146;s judgment on the main issue, my amendments Nos. 49 and 50 and new clause 24 do not affect it, because regardless of one&#146;s take on the Bill&#151;for or against&#151;we know that it was never intended that the Bill would authorise human genetic engineering or reproductive cloning, even through it repeals the Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001. Nor was it intended that the Bill would allow scope for genetic engineering or reproductive cloning. The humane intention behind the Bill is to allow women whose eggs are encased in cytoplasm with disease-carrying mitochondria to transfer those eggs into healthy cytoplasm and avoid inheritable disease. I am sure that we all wish to avoid the transmission of inheritable disease.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="81022-0009.htm_para10"><a name="08102242000851">The key point is that the Bill says that an egg or embryo for which mitochondrial disease is addressed is a &#147;permitted&#148; egg or embryo. It is an unquestionable, but ignored, fact that some mitochondrial diseases result from deficiencies in the nucleus, rather than arising from the cytoplasm or the mitochondria. The manipulation of the nucleus is thus&#151;subject to regulation, of course&#151;unintentionally permitted. Several amendments in the group, including Nos. 49 and 41, would address that by simply closing the door, or drawing the line, and restricting the law to what was originally intended.</p>

<p><a name="st_o183"><a name="08102242000852"><a name="81022-0009.htm_spnew3"><a name="08102242001804"><b>Dr. Ian Gibson (Norwich, North) (Lab):</b>

which apply across the human race? They would not contribute to a person&#146;s individuality, so he is exaggerating the problem of mitochondrial disease.</p>

<p><a name="st_o184"><a name="08102242000853"><a name="81022-0009.htm_spnew4"><a name="08102242001805"><b>Dr. Pugh:</b>
 To exaggerate a problem is still to identify that a problem exists, and I do not think that it was intended that the Bill would generate such a problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="81022-0009.htm_para11"><a name="08102242000854">Hon. Members may think that amendment No. 41 is more comprehensive than amendment No. 49, which I tabled, but my amendment would put the Bill back on track. The amendment would mean that the Bill would do what hon. Members, whether they support or oppose it, thought that it actually did.</p>

<p><a name="st_o185"><a name="08102242000855"><a name="81022-0009.htm_spnew5"><a name="08102242001806"><b>Dr. Evan Harris (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD):</b>
 May I offer my support for my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment No. 49, which is at the head of the group that we are discussing? I have no doubt that the regulations in the clause would stop nuclear modification to prevent cytoplasmic disease, and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority would not, in any event, license such a procedure, but my hon. Friend is right: it is sensible for legislation to say what it means. There is no doubt that the Government mean the provision to deal only with cytoplasmic causes of mitochondrial disease in DNA. It is unfortunate that the Bill reaches us in this imperfect form, but my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment would improve it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o186"><a name="08102242000856"><a name="81022-0009.htm_spnew6"><a name="08102242001807"><b>Dr. Pugh:</b>
 I thank my hon. Friend for that support. I see that we are in a holy, or perhaps unholy, alliance. We all have our views on the &#147;slippery slope&#148; argument, but slopes are certainly a lot more slippery if we do not examine carefully where we are treading and what exactly we are doing. Arguably, that is all my amendment seeks to do. We are talking about not an unintended consequence, but an unintended meaning to the Bill, which it behoves us to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="81022-0009.htm_para12"><a name="08102242000857">Turning to new clause 24 and amendment No. 50, the legislation prohibits the placing of animal gametes or embryos in a human. My amendment mirrors that by banning the placing of human gametes in an animal for experimental purposes. Such an experimental procedure was carried out as recently as in 1984 in Australia. It, too, involved embryos. At the moment, such an act is covered, rather weakly, only by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="81022-0009.htm_para13"><a name="08102242000858">Arguments against that simple, seemingly innocuous but important amendment are extraordinarily weak. They include the argument that so far, such experiments have been futile and uninformative&#151;that is probably true&#151;and the argument that scientists would not want to do such procedures anyway. The Department of Health argued that</p>
<a name="81022-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="08102242001050"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the development of a foetus or progeny is impossible&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="81022-0009.htm_para14"><a name="08102242000859">but that is disputed by Professor Millar of the Medical Research Council.</p>

<p><a name="st_o187"><a name="08102242000860"><a name="81022-0009.htm_spnew7"><a name="08102242001808"><b>Mr. Kevin Barron (Rother Valley) (Lab):</b>
 The Medical Research Council, the Association of Medical Research Charities, the Wellcome Trust and the Academy of Medical Sciences say that new clause 24 and amendment No. 49 would weaken invaluable research. What does the hon. Gentleman say to that?</p>

 I would really like instruction on what that &#147;invaluable&#148; research, conducted in such a bizarre way, would deliver.</p>

<p><a name="st_o189"><a name="08102242000862"><a name="81022-0009.htm_spnew9"><a name="08102242001810"><b>Dr. Harris:</b>
 As I understand it, some of the research that would be banned by my hon. Friend&#146;s new clause involves looking at the development of human gametes in the context of animals. It is not about creating embryos; it is about studying the development of human gametes in vitro. That is what his new clause would cut across. I do not think that it is the sort of frightening research that some would say it is, and I do not think that he is justified to seek to ban it when it is already regulated in other ways.</p>

<p><a name="st_o190"><a name="08102242000863"><a name="81022-0009.htm_spnew10"><a name="08102242001811"><b>Dr. Pugh:</b>
 There is absolutely no reason that I can think of why such research should not be banned if people cannot state clearly the identifiable benefits that could be derived from it. That is quite apart from the question of whether humankind can be crossed with other primates&#151;that, of course, is the scenario that most frightens people&#151;and whether Stalin&#146;s scientists&#146; dreams of creating a &#147;humanzee&#148; can be realised. That could all be science fiction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="81022-0009.htm_para15"><a name="08102242000864">I want to make two simple points. First, why should we legislators leave it to scientists to set limits on what is morally permissible? Scientists, bankers and MPs are all, in general, decent honourable folk. However, where there is an interest, I have limited faith in self-regulation for any of them. After all, in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, we outlawed placing a human embryo in an animal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="81022-0009.htm_para16"><a name="08102242000865">Secondly, would it not be a sight as monstrous as any hybrid creation to see hon. Members shuffle through the Lobby to preserve the right of scientists to put human gametes in animals&#146; wombs? How would such an action be represented to their constituents? If hon. Members suggested and supported something that absurd and abhorrent, would not constituents think that hon. Members themselves had been transmuted into a flock of unreasoning sheep?</p>

 In many respects, I am pleased to follow the hon. Gentleman, because amendments Nos. 41 and 73, in my name and the names of a number of other hon. Members, are in the same vein. We wish to make it absolutely explicit, in the two amendments, that we are ruling out human genetic modification. I have always been pleased to try to do that in other areas, too. I have always been an opponent of the genetic modification of food, so it is unsurprising that I am an opponent of any attempt to allow it to happen to human beings.</p>

Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo), in particular. On a number of occasions she has made it absolutely explicit that the Government have no intention of allowing genetic modification of human beings. I think that the argument is about how the Government say that. However, the legislation could imply&#151;I put it no more strongly than that&#151;something slightly different. Amendment No. 41 basically tries to clarify that the Government cannot allow themselves, or a subsequent Administration, to use secondary legislation to do what should really come within the purview of  <br>

this House&#151;to clarify by clearly stating in legislation what should and should not be allowed. Amendment No. 73 basically says that if we do not have agreement and do not want to specify outcomes, it is meaningless to permit scientists to experiment in this field.</p>

 My hon. Friend may be confusing the issue. For example, if somebody has cystic fibrosis, it is possible now to attempt to introduce genes, by various mechanisms, into the lung cells to prevent what we call somatic disease. However, a disease could also pass into the gametes, and be passed on from the person who is being treated to their children, should they be fortunate enough to have children. It is then in the genetic line. Part of my brain can see why we ban such research at the moment, but another part says, &#147;Perhaps one day we&#146;ll get lucky.&#148; In other words, perhaps we will be able to knock out genetic disabilities. Many genetic diseases&#151;250 or 300 of them&#151;could then be completely knocked out. We should not throw the baby out with the bath water.</p>

 I hear what my hon. Friend says, but we have to deal with what we are faced with today. The amendments are carefully phrased. We are looking at mitochondrial opportunities to deal with diseases that someone might carry, but the amendments would make it absolutely clear that that should not be done through human genetic modification. There is a dividing line, but I hope that the Government are clearly on my side, and that of other hon. Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="81022-0009.htm_para18"><a name="08102242000870">I have written to my right hon. Friend the Minister on the subject; unfortunately, I have not had a reply. I refer to the letter sent by my right hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher), my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) and me. We wrote to the Government in the hope that the point would be clarified before Report, given that in Committee I tried to draw attention to what some of us saw as a particular problem. To refresh everyone&#146;s memory, we are talking about proposed new section 3ZA to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, which, to many of us, is the key part of the Bill before us. It goes to the essence of what human fertilisation and embryology is all about. Those of us who wish to shut down genetic modification will draw attention to any loophole that will result from the Bill becoming law.</p>

Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson), I have no problem with the Government&#146;s aim of helping people with mitochondrial conditions. The problem is that proposed new section 3ZA(5) is so broadly worded that it would allow a future Government to permit absolutely any technique&#151;including genetic modification or even reproductive cloning&#151;to prevent transmission of mitochondrial conditions. We want the Government to respond to that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="81022-0009.htm_para20"><a name="08102242000872">We feel that the Government have to clarify their position, because although there is an opportunity for Parliament to scrutinise in respect of permitting any technique that requires the passing of regulations, that is not the same as primary legislation. Views will change, and as has just been said, matters may pass on. As the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) said, unless the legislation is clear from the outset, there will be the slippery slope about which some of us are very concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="81022-0009.htm_para21"><a name="08102242000873">The Minister cannot have it both ways. If the Government are coming down against the genetic modification of children, that needs to be stated in the Bill and we should not need to go to secondary legislation. If that does not happen, the Government will effectively be supporting a loophole that would permit such modification to happen in due course. There is an argument that my amendment might interfere with the techniques for mitochondrial donation. However, according to people far more scientifically knowledgeable about these issues than I, there are other ways in which such donations can be made. From my philosophical point of view, those are very preferable to genetic modification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="81022-0009.htm_para22"><a name="08102242000874">I agree with the hon. Member for Southport. We have had a listening Government and open-minded discussions. What happened before is different, but to me that is a slightly different issue. I hope that the Government will respond. The problem is that if we do not get things right with amendment No. 41 at this stage, that will be the law, even if there is a subsequent attempt to provide more control through the regulatory process. Some of us are nervous about that, because attitudes change and 90 minutes&#151;at best&#151;is not a good length of time in which to discuss such huge philosophical issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="81022-0009.htm_para23"><a name="08102242000875">Amendment No. 73 clearly links to amendment No. 41, and through it we are asking why the Government, if they wanted to will the end&#151;not allowing genetic modification in respect of the creation of children&#151;were not prepared to rule out the means. As it is currently constituted, the Bill will allow scientists to continue to experiment in this area. That is problematic for two reasons. First, this country is an outrider on this issue in the world, and certainly Europe. Many European countries have ruled out the process. I am quizzical about why, in saying that they want a degree of restrictiveness in this area, the Government have not signed the relevant convention. That has been discussed in Committee and on Second Reading. Even if we want to be at the front end of scientific progress, why are we out on our own? Some of us do not want to go to certain places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="81022-0009.htm_para24"><a name="08102242000876">If our view is that we wish to make genetic modification in respect of the creation of children illegal, shutting down scientific research on the issue would seem perfectly reasonable. If it is not shut down, scientists in this country or elsewhere will work on the issue. If we believe that science will eventually find answers, such scientists&#151;whether mavericks or the most genuine members of the scientific community&#151;will push through that door. We will then be faced with the dilemma of what to do with that research&#151;sorry about the pun, but the genie will really be out of the bottle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="81022-0009.htm_para25"><a name="08102242000877">I have explained why amendment No. 73 is vital. It would not interfere with the basic research, because other forms of research dealing with all manner of genetic imperfections would be allowed to carry on. The problem is that unless we are clear that we are not encouraging research through genetic modification, somebody somewhere, if the legislation retains its current wording, will go on with it.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Members for Southport (Dr. Pugh) and for Stroud (Mr. Drew), and I support their amendments. Many of us opposed in principle the prospect of human admixed embryos, but we had a vote on that principle and the House decided to go ahead with it. Many also opposed the practical results proposed by the Government; indeed, during discussion of the programme motion today, the Minister again alluded to the prospect of treatment for Alzheimer&#146;s disease and other debilitating conditions. Many of us applaud that fine motivation, but are concerned that the Government are marching us up to a false summit. Many of us sought to oppose the move because we felt that there were ready alternatives that are producing therapeutic treatments and offer great prospects of further cures to such debilitating illnesses.</p>

It is not a wrecking amendment; it does not seek to oppose the principle of human admixed embryos, as we have to accept the previous will of the House. Nevertheless, there will obviously be a fundamental vote on Third Reading. Our amendment seeks to do something important: plug a gap that has exercised the minds of many. The Minister has mentioned that there have been 80 hours of deliberation and many of those have been taken up in discussion of whether the definitions of human admixed embryos in the Bill are adequate. Amendment No. 47 is significant, and I will want to press it to a Division.</p>

The House of Lords Science and Technology Committee also undertook an inquiry specifically into the issue of definitions, which is a matter that has led us down many different paths. Indeed, I pay tribute to the noble Lord Mackay, who gave particular consideration to the issue, both in the Joint Committee and in the other place, with Ministers and others, to try to help us come to a definition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="81022-0010.htm_para29"><a name="08102242000910">The subject of amendment No. 47 is the case of embryos created by a process called tetraploid complementation. If the results were to be the same in experimentation with human-animal embryos as they are with mice, the potential exists for the embryos to end up being completely or almost completely human. In tetraploid complementation, pluripotent stem cells are combined with an embryo that has been altered in such a way that the cells in the embryo have double the number of chromosomes. The cells are then tetraploid and develop into an extra-embryonic tissue such as placenta, while the pluripotent stem cells develop into the foetus. However, this specific class of embryos would not fall within the ambit of the Bill. That is the issue that my amendment seeks to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="81022-0010.htm_para31"><a name="08102242000914">That goes against the principles behind clause 4 as described by the noble Lord Darzi in the other place. Those principles are also reflected in the new sub-paragraph (e) which is intended, as the Minister said, to capture all hybrid embryos in which human DNA is predominant. The embryos that I am describing would be similar to the type of chimeric embryos described in section 4A(6)(d) of the 1990 Act. They would be, as defined in the Bill, a mixture of human and animal cells, rather than transgenic embryos or cloned embryos. However, they would remain outside regulation, and I shall spend a few minutes explaining why they would fall outside the ambit of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="81022-0010.htm_para32"><a name="08102242000915">First, the chimeric embryos referred to in section 4A(6)(d) are human embryos to which animal cells are added. However, the chimeric embryos in the example that I am putting forward would be animal embryos to which human cells were added. As confirmed by Lord Hunt of Kings Heath in a written answer on 25 June 2007, they would not be captured by sub-paragraph (d). Lord Hunt stated:</p>

Any embryos not considered to be a protected animal do not come within the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.&#148;&#151; [<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 25 June 2007; Vol. 693, c.

They may develop to have predominantly human DNA only after the first 14 days of development. In the examples that the eminent experts discussed in the Joint Committee, the human or animal definitions could not easily be applied.</p>

Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris), with whom I have debated the matter on many occasions, may suggest that. However, since those embryos would fall under animal legislation, the 14-day rule and the no-implantation rule, which I concede are in the Bill, would not apply, so the embryos would not be permitted to be implanted into an animal womb.  <br>

Thus, their development would continue to the stage where human DNA would potentially overwhelmingly predominate in the developing foetus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="81022-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08102242000918">The third reason is that although clause 3 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 bans the implantation of an entirely human embryo in an animal&#151;we would all unite and agree on that&#151;and, as we know, the ban is retained in the Bill, if an embryo created by the mechanism of tetraploid complementation were to be implanted, it would not be entirely human at that stage. That is the crucial issue. At the pre-implantation stage it would be defined as not human, and it would not fall within the remit of the Bill. It would then supposedly come under the auspices of animal legislation. My point is that it would not; it would tend to be unregulated. Even if the particular embryo were subsequently to develop into an entirely human embryo, it would escape the ban. That is why the issue is crucial.</p>

 I am grateful for that intervention. If the hon. Gentleman bears with me, I shall come shortly to the issue of the licence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="81022-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08102242000922">The fourth reason for the amendment is that proposed new section 4A(4) to the 1990 Act bans the implantation of human admixed embryos in an animal. Since the embryos in question are not defined as human admixed under current definitions in the Bill, implantation into an animal could not be banned under clause 4. The embryos would thus fall under animal legislation, potentially allowing a human foetus with an animal placenta to develop in an animal womb up to mid-gestation, without the requirement&#151;this relates to what the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said&#151;to obtain a research licence from the Home Office. The research project would require a licence only if the research was intended to take the foetus beyond mid-gestation. If that was the intention, a licence would be required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="81022-0011.htm_para3"><a name="08102242000923">The difference, as I understand it, between requiring a licence for a research project and requiring one for implantation is an unrelated animal welfare issue&#151;not something that falls within the intention of animal legislation. As the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon knows, animal legislation is designed to ensure that animals are not butchered by incompetent or uncaring technicians or researchers who do not know what they are doing or do not care if animals suffer unnecessarily. In relevant cases, the researchers would need an implantation licence because the animal to be implanted would be classified as a protected animal. That is the crucial issue. In my example, the foetus developing inside would be an unprotected animal until mid-gestation. That is the gap that I am seeking to plug. Hence a licence would not be required for the research project unless the intention was to develop the foetus beyond mid-gestation. That might sound like a far-fetched scenario; some may even say that it is a science-fiction scenario.</p>

 Let me give an example. The procedure has been used in mice since the early 1990s, and it is routinely used to make entire mice from embryonic stem cells, which are being aggregated with tetraploid embryos. When used in this way, the procedure is considered a gold standard for testing, where researchers have isolated genuine, fully functional embryonic stem cells to make every cell type in the body rather than just many cell types. Since the tetraploid cells would make tissue outside the embryo, such as placenta, the inserted embryonic stem cells would have to make every cell type in the animal. If anyone is interested, I have research papers here on that very procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="81022-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08102242000926">Currently, researchers use a far less rigorous type of test for human embryonic stem cells. It is called the teratoma test, as was mentioned earlier. Teratomas are a specific type of tumour generated by embryonic stem cells, which consist of various stem cell types. However, it is a much less comprehensive test than tetraploid complementation, since relatively few cell types are generated in this way.</p>

 I am listening very carefully to what the hon. Gentleman is saying. His basic argument relates to something falling outside the current prohibitions in the Bill. However, does he not agree that the definition of human admixed embryos, already discussed in the House, covers tetraploid complementation so that the Bill&#146;s prohibitions would apply? The embryos could not therefore be placed into an animal, which is the fear that the he is expressing. The Bill therefore deals with the problem.</p>

 It will probably not surprise the Minister to hear that during the 20 or so minutes of my speech, I have been seeking to make the very point that the definitions are not covered, which is why we need amendment No. 47 to plug the gap. That follows on from the relationship with animal legislation&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>The Minister may well like to talk rather than listen to my response, but this issue should not be taken for granted. This research and testing is taking place, and the issue of the mid-gestation period, which presently falls within the ambit of the Home Office and animal legislation, needs to be dealt with properly at this stage, through the opportunity presented by the Bill.

by the definitions in the Bill, but according to a written answer given by Lord Hunt, that type of chimeric embryo is not covered. He said at one point that the position following mid-gestation is covered by animal legislation, but before he had said that it was not, so there is a discrepancy. I hope to be assured that all these matters will be fully covered by regulation under the Bill, but if they will not be, as I believe, all Members should unite in supporting amendment No. 47.</p>

However, the scientists may have been referring to a very similar procedure whereby embryonic stem cells are inserted into normal diploid embryos rather than tetraploid embryos. In such cases, the resultant human-animal chimeric foetuses, or creatures, would contain various proportions of cells from both species. Many of us agree that that carries great concerns of its own&#151;for example, the potential development of human gametes or of a large proportion of human brain cells in an animal. However, as the Bill is currently drafted, both those types of chimera would fall within the more permissive animal legislation.

They have said that there is not a defined point, and they have talked in vice-versa terms on the issue of going from human to animal. When one follows through this process within the ambit of animal legislation, it is apparent that at the time before mid-gestation there is potential for the process to be unregulated, unless a licence has been applied for where there is an intention to go beyond mid-gestation point. There is a gap that I feel needs to be properly plugged, at the very least for the reassurance that we have it covered.

The amendment would close up a legal loophole between the Bill and the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. It would ensure that chimeric embryos created by tetraploid complementation that had the potential to result in a completely or almost completely human foetus with an animal placenta would not come under animal legislation, and would therefore not be allowed to develop inside an animal womb.</p>

Members of the general public listening to this debate might find it difficult to understand what we are discussing, and I should like to begin by making it clear which issue the new clause and amendment are trying to resolve. If the Bill as it stands is passed, it will allow the insemination of human gametes into an animal&#151;that is, the insemination of human sperm into an animal.

What have the Government been playing at, given that this loophole was pointed out to them a long time ago? What would it take for them to make this amendment?

Yet despite all the Government&#146;s fervent assurances about safeguards and regulations, this procedure remains entirely untouched by the Bill&#146;s prohibitions. The Department of Health has argued that the insemination of animals with human sperm could never lead to a viable foetus. How can it know? Surely the nature of science and scientists is that they are incredibly experimental and inquisitive and constantly attempting to push back the barriers. How do we know what this would lead to in one, five or 10 years&#146; time?</p>

However, as I said, the Department of Health is arguing that the insemination of animals with human sperm could never lead to a viable foetus, and that therefore there is no need to legislate. It is just not an issue, the Department says. I think that it is a huge issue, as do many people.</p>

If a constituent asked me, &#147;Why did you do that?&#148;, I would find it very difficult to explain my motives.

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="81022-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08102242000981">Ivanov&#146;s experiments were legal. I suppose that should hardly surprise us&#151;he was working under one of the most brutal totalitarian regimes the world has ever known, at the personal behest of one of history&#146;s bloodiest dictators. He was allowed to experiment with humans and chimpanzees. Soviet scientists had precious few personal freedoms in the 1920s&#151;they could not buy their own homes or shop for the food that they wanted&#151;but they enjoyed the legal freedom to carry out experiments involving placing human gametes in animals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="81022-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08102242000982">Such was life in Stalinist Russia, but of course no enlightened 21st century western democracy would ever countenance allowing such things in law. Of course it would not, because its Government would ensure that they learned a key lesson from history and what happened in the 1920s, and would legislate to ensure that it could not and would not happen again. I am using the example of those 1920s experiments to say that that is what we should do today. We should legislate today to ensure that such experiments will never be legal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="81022-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08102242000983">The Department of Health insists that inseminating chimpanzees with human sperm could never produce hybrid offspring, and therefore no scientist would ever try. But the Ivanov episode shows that there is just enough hypothetical possibility in such a proposal to entice a certain kind of scientist. The chromosomal differences between some animals that can mate&#151;such as goats and sheep&#151;is greater than between humans and chimpanzees. There has been reference to a press article in which scientists speculated whether inseminating chimps with human sperm could produce offspring, and predicted that were it legal, some of their less squeamish colleagues were bound to try it. So we actually have members of the scientific community saying that if this is allowed to go through today, some of their colleagues will try it. The scientists are saying that themselves&#151;</p>

A professor in a UK university used that terminology! The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine) can shake his head as much as he wants. I despair to think that a scientist would believe there were no ethical objections to such behaviour. Like many people, I applaud scientists for their inquisitive nature. Thank goodness they exist and experiment constantly. However, the role of the House, the Government and Parliament is to legislate to curb that enthusiasm and that inquisitive nature.

If the placement of non-human embryos or gametes into a woman is to be prohibited by the Bill, why are we allowing this loophole to go through? Whether there are any budding Ivanovs working in Britain&#146;s research facilities becomes irrelevant if new clause 24 and amendment No. 50 are passed. For that reason, I hope that the House will have the opportunity to divide on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="81022-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08102242000988">In conclusion, I cannot help reflecting on the farcical nature of the topic under discussion. We are in the midst of the remaining stages of what is supposed to be benchmark legislation of impeccable ethical and technological integrity, but Members such as I have to support a new clause as basic and ethically uncomplicated as the one before us. Plenty of intricate and huge ethical issues are as yet not satisfactorily resolved in the Bill&#151;the subject of saviour siblings will not even reach the light of day. How ludicrous it is, in those circumstances, that we are debating the placing of human sperm into an animal. How absurd it is that the Government, by failing to close the loophole, have allowed themselves to stand shamed by direct comparison with the most distasteful ethical excesses of Stalin&#146;s Russia.</p>

 I rise, briefly, to speak against new clause 24 and amendments Nos. 50 and 47. I was involved with the 1990 Act when it came through the House, and I sat through the first two and a half hours of the debate thinking that things had moved on in some areas. The presentation that we have just had from the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries) has knocked me back 17 years in terms of how we compare modern-day science and get it into context. As legislators, we have a responsibility to do that.</p>

Saying that the scientific community is on one side or another is not a helpful case. If there are two scientists in a room, they are likely to hold three different opinions. In a sense, it is the same with politicians. Over the years, I have listened to many scientists give evidence to the Health Committee, and other Select Committees also sometimes call in eminent scientists to put their arguments. However, we must accept that there will never be a consensus among scientists.</p>

who is not in his place at the moment. In the past 48 hours, all hon. Members will have received a short briefing from the Medical Research Council. The text was agreed by the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Association of Medical Research Charities, the Wellcome Trust and the MRC itself. There is a consensus on different issues among those organisations that we, as legislators, have accepted for many years. I know that various hon. Members have sat on some of those bodies, as lay or other members, and that they have brought their experience back to the House. We have a duty to recognise what the collective voice of the scientific community says about different pieces of legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="81022-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08102242000994">The scientific community has said that it believes that the two amendments and the new clause to which I have referred should be rejected. I do not know what my right hon. Friend the Minister of State thinks about that recommendation&#151;we will have to wait and see&#151;but I am happier to accept the advice in that brief than the advice in some of the other briefs that have been read out in this debate. I would not always accept the argument put forward by these organisations, but I shall briefly explain why I do accept it today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="81022-0012.htm_para19"><a name="08102242000995">The brief states:</p>
<a name="81022-0012.htm_brev6"><a name="08102242001084"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We oppose the amendments which would have the effect of limiting valuable research which can be undertaken using human gametes in animals...While we recognise that gametes are special, in that they are cells involved in reproduction, the reasons for studying human gametes in the context of an animal is to learn more about how gametes develop and function.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="81022-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08102242000996">Many reasons are given in debates such as this for looking at different areas of research, but the briefing note says that this particular research</p>

I have been very lucky in my life to be able to have children and grandchildren without ever having to worry about whether I could be a father, but many of our constituents go through the torture of infertility. Some of them, unfortunately, find it hard to afford treatment in the private sector, and Ministers will know that over the years I have spoken about the deficiencies of NHS infertility provision. However, the most important thing is that scientists should continue their research into these matters, as that is how they can help citizens who have not been as lucky as I have been when it comes to having a family.</p>

 I agree with what the right hon. Gentleman is saying. Another example of the sort of research to which he has referred is the process by which ovarian tissue, for example, is engrafted onto an animal and then tested for the effects of chemotherapy. That is impossible&#151;or at least very difficult&#151;to do in vitro, without that sort of animal model. For good reasons, the Bill defines gametes as cells in the ovary or the testes at any stage in their development, including their very early stages. That is why banning the placement of human gametes in animals would prevent research, currently being done in this country, that involves research into the effect of chemotherapy on those cells&#146; development. Clearly, that research would play into the issue of infertility.</p>

He then went on at great length just to give us an example of how complex it is, and I am grateful that he did.

I am confident in saying, both in the House and in my constituency, that we as legislators have a duty to bring about this way of improving medical science and research into such scientifically complex areas.

However, it would be useful for the Minister to restate that. Section 3ZA(5) grants the same regulation-making power to future Secretaries of State. The Government simply cannot speak for future Secretaries of State; that is why we have primary legislation. If ever the Government want to change their policy in this area, we want them to come back to the House&#151;to the elected representatives&#151;and we want a chance to say, &#147;No, we don&#146;t want to leave this extraordinarily vital ethical issue in the hands of a future Secretary of State.&#148;</p>

Perhaps a copy of the regulations could be placed in the Library so that we could read it and have our fears put to rest. I suspect that no copy is available, and that it will not be placed in the Library. I suspect that we will pass the Bill without ever having had a chance to read the regulations. Far better to make sure that any alteration to the human reproductive cloning ban can be made only after the closest scrutiny by the public, and by parliamentarians acting on their behalf, in primary legislation.</p>

That would at least be a signal that they could give the many of us who are worried about the Bill. They could make the situation absolutely clear in the Bill, as it was in the 2001 Act, and ensure that the ban could not possibly be tampered with by secondary legislation. Why can we not have that? Perhaps the Government will take this opportunity to state publicly why such an amendment would be detrimental to the spirit and intentions of the Bill. I do not think that it would be. Amendment No. 41 is not a wrecking amendment. It is completely in line with everything that the Government have said. I would have thought that the Minister could support everything that I have said so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="81022-0013.htm_para23"><a name="08102242001030">If the amendment is not to be regarded as detrimental, surely the Government are prepared to commend it for identifying and rectifying a serious drafting error that threatens to make a mockery of their oft-repeated assurances that the foundational intention of the Bill is the creation of a rigorous regulatory regime encompassing all existent and hypothetical reproductive technologies. We all know that creating such a regime will be very difficult, but there is one issue on which both sides of the argument want absolute assurance from the Minister: there should be no loophole in the Bill through which some form of reproductive cloning could in future emerge. We are entitled to have that assurance from the Government because this ethical area is so vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="81022-0013.htm_para24"><a name="08102242001031">Amendment No. 41 removes only that which the Government have insisted repeatedly they do not want: a means of permitting a form of human cloning for reproduction. The amendment retains that which the clause is specifically intended to permit&#151;mitochondrial donation techniques. Amendment No. 41 also rectifies a further blunder caused by the dangerously loose wording of proposed new section 3ZA(5), which I have read out to the House. In replying, the Minister may wish to explain this problem. By providing for regulations allowing any&#151;I stress, any&#151;method of preventing the transmission of a mitochondrial disease, 3ZA(5) also opens up the possibility of legally altering human nuclear DNA as a means of preventing future transmission of mitochondrial disease. That, of course, would be germ-line genetic engineering&#151;that is, human genetic modification. People should be concerned about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="81022-0013.htm_para25"><a name="08102242001032">Clearly, the only appropriate vehicle for dealing with an issue of such magnitude would be primary legislation; I hope that we can all agree on that. The idea that such a serious issue could be dealt with sufficiently by affirmative resolution is ridiculous. Even the Bill&#146;s supporters have acknowledged that a significant problem exists because of the wording of proposed new section 3ZA(5), and that, in overturning the ban on mitochondrial DNA alteration, subject to regulations, the proposed new section&#151;unintentionally, I accept&#151;overturns a ban on nuclear DNA alteration. They say that the issue should be dealt with at a later stage. Here we are, at a later stage; in fact, it is the last stage. So far, however, the Government have refused to address the obvious discrepancies in the wording of the proposed new section. The House must rectify the Government&#146;s failures by amending that glaring fault in the Bill; that is what amendment No. 41 would do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="81022-0013.htm_para26"><a name="08102242001033">I am going to finish my speech in a moment, but before I do I should apologise for having been somewhat technical. I have had to read out closely what is in the various clauses of the Bill. However, I want to end with my personal view, and why I feel passionately about this issue. At the heart of all the debates on the Bill and of the technical arguments about these amendments appears to lie a point of view that in this country we are treating human embryos as things. I believe that human embryos are emphatically not just blobs of cells; they have the entire genetic make-up of a human being. I believe not that they are potential human beings, but that they are human beings with potential. Of course, they are microscopic&#151;a grain of sand&#151;and that is perhaps why we can view them as a spare part. However, when I thought of them as a microscopic grain of sand, as it were&#151;as something that was not in any way recognisably human&#151;I was reminded of this passage from Dostoevsky, the greatest poet of human nature. In addressing the brothers Karamazov, the prior of the monastery says:</p>
<a name="81022-0013.htm_brev7"><a name="08102242001093"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Love all God&#146;s creation, the whole and every grain of sand in it. Love every leaf, every ray of God&#146;s light. Love the animals, love the plants, love everything. If you love everything, you will perceive the divine mystery in things. Once you perceive it, you will begin to comprehend it better every day. And you will come at last to love the whole world with an all-embracing love.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="81022-0013.htm_para27"><a name="08102242001034">There is something very dangerous in what we will undoubtedly do today. We are making ourselves less than human, in a sense, by viewing one part of human creation as a thing, a spare part, which I believe is extraordinarily dangerous.</p>

<p><a name="st_o248"><a name="08102255000046"><a name="81022-0013.htm_spnew8"><a name="08102255003928"><b>Dr. Evan Harris:</b>
 I was not going to speak in this debate, but the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) and those of the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) require a brief response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="81022-0013.htm_para28"><a name="08102255000047">First, we have amendment No. 49, which is in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Southport. It would add the words &#147;via cytoplasm&#148; to the provisions of clause 3, and it touches on the issue raised by the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh). The hon. Gentleman is correct: there is no longer an absolute ban in primary legislation on some of the things that the Government clearly intend to ban, because it requires the secondary legislation to be written, as I am sure that it would be, in such a way as to allow only those forms of treatment of mitochondrial disease that are caused by cytoplasmic factors, and only in such a way that there is no breach of the provisions and policies enunciated by the Government, namely that there will be no human reproductive cloning, or germ-line nuclear genetic amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="81022-0013.htm_para29"><a name="08102255000048">I have already said in an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Southport that it would be better for the primary legislation to state what it intends in purest terms. It is unfortunate that the Government have not found a way to do that. I believe that the Government said in Committee that they had tried to draft the legislation so that such practice would be restricted in such a way. I do not see why a phrase such as &#147;via cytoplasm&#148; or something similar would not be acceptable, at least to narrow the issue. I do not accept for a moment that the current wording opens the door to those things feared by my hon. Friend, but given the battle we have had to get to this stage, in which we have had to overcome people whipping up fear about what might happen&#151;we have heard some rather dismal examples today&#151;it would be better if the legislation were clear. It is unfortunate that it is not, and for that reason, I would support amendment No. 49.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="81022-0013.htm_para30"><a name="08102255000049">The second issue relates to new clause 24, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Southport and others, which would ban the placing of human gametes into an animal. This was dealt with in Committee, thanks to my hon. Friend, and the Minister wrote a letter to him explaining why it is not considered necessary or appropriate to include such a provision. I agree with what the Minister said in that letter&#151;I will not go into it because she may be planning to do that. In 1990, it was not considered necessary to include measures in legislation to ban the practice of inserting sperm into animals. That procedure is not part of science, and it is not appropriate for it to be dealt with in the Bill.</p>

We cannot do that in humans for all sorts of ethical reasons, but we permit the practice, under tight regulation, in animals. We do so to explore what causes infertility and, for example, what the impact of certain types of chemotherapy might be on infertility. The Bill&#146;s drafting means, for good reasons, that &#147;gametes&#148; includes germ line cells at any stage of their development, including immature germ-line cells found in the ovary and the testes, which  <br>

are subject to such experiments. One could list&#151;but I will not do so&#151;papers that have been published in peer review journals using such work, and I have no doubt that such work is being done in this country. My hon. Friend&#146;s new clause would prevent that work, and he accepted in Committee, on the record, that that would be an unintended consequences of what I describe as an unnecessary step. I hope that the House is reassured that the amendment is unnecessary, but if that does not make the argument, the speech that we heard from the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries) put the fact that it would be inappropriate beyond any doubt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="81022-0014.htm_para1"><a name="08102255000051">The third point is about the interesting issue that the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate raises in amendment No. 47. We must accept&#151;I hope that the Government will accept this&#151;that it has not been possible to produce an exhaustive list of admixed embryo types. I do not believe that it is possible to do so; indeed, the Academy of Medical Sciences accepts in its paper that it is probably not possible. The Government have made the best attempt that they can and it is only right that we should accept that the list is not guaranteed to be exhaustive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="81022-0014.htm_para2"><a name="08102255000052">The hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment is a good example of some of the debates that we could have, but that is why we have the HFEA. It is there to ensure that scientists understand that there is a need to fall within the regulations where at all possible. I cannot imagine any scientist in this country seeking to identify types that would not come before the HFEA, so that they could argue in a court of law, &#147;Well, it&#146;s not human enough at the point at which we were seeking to implant it to be covered by the HFEA.&#148; That is not how science works.</p>

 To pursue that line of argument, does the hon. Gentleman not agree that exactly the same kind of argument that he is presenting was presented to me when I suggested that we would move into research into animal-human hybrids? That was 25 years ago, and now we are where we are. Does he recognise that because people have an enormous amount of knowledge, it does not follow that they will not later do things that are unacceptable to society as a whole?</p>

 It is certainly possible, but it is also possible that new primary legislation could be brought before the House if that was felt necessary, as happened over human reproductive cloning. In that case it was felt necessary to reassure the public through primary legislation that something that was not envisaged and not possible would also be illegal. So, we are not in an &#147;It&#146;s now or nothing&#148; situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="81022-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08102255000055">Let me also deal with the issue of definitions. A huge amount of effort has been put in, especially by Members of the House of Lords and the Government Bill team, to try to find an appropriate definition. A tribute must be paid to Lord Mackay in particular, who has struggled, even though he was not necessarily a huge fan of the legislation to start with, to find a way to deal with the issue. The Government have engaged on the subject and done the best that they feel they can.</p>

can get while preserving the ability of scientists to do the research in a way that will be regulated. There is no scientist in the country who does not understand that such research will have to apply to the HFEA under one of the categories set out in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="81022-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08102255000057">There are two potential gaps, one of which the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate mentioned. Proposed new section 4A(6)(e) talks about an embryo that does not fall within paragraphs (a) to (d) which</p>
<a name="81022-0014.htm_brev0"><a name="08102255003866"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;contains both nuclear or mitochondrial DNA of a human and nuclear or mitochondrial DNA of an animal...but in which the animal DNA is not predominant.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="81022-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08102255000058">The key question, however, is at what point we are talking about the animal DNA not being pre-dominant, because that could vary. The hon. Gentleman rightly said that the scientists pointed that out in evidence to the Committee. That is not a secret, which is why it would be appropriate for the Government not to recognise that the list is not perfect. Indeed, it cannot be perfect, but I argue that it is good enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="81022-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08102255000059">That is one problem. The second problem is that even if the hon. Gentleman is right that the tetraploidal complementation process that he mentioned falls outwith the provisions, his amendment does not solve the problem. It is quite possible to have complementation that does not involve tetraploid cells. One could inject into a more developed, normal diploid embryo a less developed human embryo, which would then predominate, causing the original embryo to become the extra-embryonic endoderm and the trophectoderm&#151;the stuff that forms the placenta&#151;as has been done in mice. His amendment does not refer to such an entity, however. So the hon. Gentleman is merely demonstrating that the clause is never going to be perfect, but it is clear that anyone attempting to implant an entity which arguably does not fall within the definition in clause 4 will have to apply for a licence to the animal procedures committee to implant it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="81022-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08102255000060">When I spoke to the hon. Gentleman outside the Chamber, he conceded, I hope it is fair to say, in answer to my question if one created an entity with human cells in an animal envelope&#151;I do not believe that that is likely outside HFEA regulation in any event, for reasons that the Minister will explain&#151;a licence would still be needed to implant it into an animal. One cannot just grab a pig from a farm, drag it into a lab and implant something into it without a licence.</p>

<p><a name="st_o251"><a name="08102255000061"><a name="81022-0014.htm_spnew2"><a name="08102255003931"><b>Mr. Gummer:</b>
 As somebody who was responsible for that animal legislation, may I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that animal legislation is designed to protect animals and their welfare. One of our concerns must be, therefore, that it is not reasonable to use that legislation to deal with the problems under discussion. He may be right that that is not necessary, but it does not seem sensible to say that animal legislation of the kind that we have properly covers these circumstances. Surely if we find some gaps in the law, we might deal with those and make the law that much better. There may be still be other gaps, but why is he not willing to accept that the gaps that have been identified should be covered now, rather than left to the organisation outside or to secondary legislation?</p>

 I am in almost 100 per cent. agreement with the right hon. Gentleman. It is possible that there are gaps in the definition. I hope the Minister will accept that that is the case and that it is necessary for ongoing work to be done. The academy has indicated a willingness to continue to do that work so that if, down the line, something that is not covered by these definitions is felt to be useful and therefore needs to be covered by the HFEA legislation in order not to fall completely outside or under animal procedures, amendments can be made to the legislation. That is a mature, sensible approach.</p>

I have already demonstrated that it does not even close its own potential gap because it does not cover diploid complementation, as just one example. The Minister said in an intervention that the specific example that the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate cited was covered by the Bill, presumably because at the relevant point the entity would not be predominantly animal&#151;the embryo would be human and the animal cells would form the non-embryonic part of the entity. It would therefore fall under subsection (6)(e).</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing an intervention. An application to the HFEA for a licence would have to be made at the outset if it was believed that the human DNA would become predominant, so it would be covered. Whether that was predominant at the start or whether its development would lead to its becoming predominant, a licence from the HFEA would be needed before the process started.</p>

 I leave that to stand. I would also say that if a scientist wanted to avoid a criminal charge, it would be wise to apply for a licence. Even if the scientist felt that the circumstance would not be covered by the definition, if it turned out to be covered, he would be liable under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, as amended, which contains stiff penalties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="81022-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08102255000074">On the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes), I completely agree with him that we do not know exactly where science will go, and that it is right to ensure that we do not have to keep coming back with primary legislation. He is right that we need to pass a Bill that is sufficient to deal with foreseeable developments in science.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="81022-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08102255000075">Looking through the Bill as it stands, and having listened to the assurance of my right hon. Friend the Minister, I believe that we need broad principles of legislation to underpin how different bits of research should be regarded. We also need a regulatory body able to interpret the legislation and take decisions about applications that come before it. I am sure that my right hon. Friend will want to comment further on this later, but I believe that the Bill provides a framework that allows for the sort of experiments described by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate to be managed and properly regulated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="81022-0014.htm_para18"><a name="08102255000076">I share the concern of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) that a list of possible future developments might not be exhaustive.

The HFEA has steered us through some very difficult times, sometimes with inadequate legislative tools. I hope that the Bill will deal effectively with a lot of the chinks. My constituents certainly want proper provision made for the regulation of these activities on the basis of sound ethical principles, and I think that the Bill provides that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="81022-0014.htm_para20"><a name="08102255000078">On the amendments to prohibit the mixing of gametes, I believe that they would be extremely damaging to the treatment of some forms of infertility. The Bill provides for the ability to mix gametes under licence. I would argue that the key issue is the mixing of gametes, not how the gametes come to be mixed. It is not about artificial insemination of an animal with human sperm; it is about the mixing of the gametes. That is the real issue and that covers mixing them by whatever form. If these amendments were accepted, it would make it harder to understand some of the processes involved in infertility and difficult to deal with certain forms of male infertility in particular.</p>

 That is true, but I think that there are quite a few reasons why people are fearful about the process. One reason is that the idea of some creature that is part-human, part-animal&#151;the example that is always given&#151;is simply horrific. However, that is not on the cards, as the legislation clearly prevents it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="81022-0014.htm_para21"><a name="08102255000081">There is also the fact that because, as my hon. Friend says, this whole area of medicine has developed in the private sector, people tend to focus on the more exotic aspects. In reality, straightforward IVF is now a fairly standard treatment, although a difficult one because of the ethics involved. That is where the bulk of the interest and the bulk of the provision lie, which is why IVF treatment on the NHS is so important.</p>

That issue was raised by the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) when he quoted from &#147;The Brothers Karamazov&#148;. In the section to which he referred, one of the characters undergoes a religious conversion and then talks about salvation through universal love. It is fine to have a religious view of embryos, and I am sure that many people have such a view, but what we are considering is a legal way of regulating experiments with embryos, and the legal status of embryos. That is different from having a religious view of them.</p>

In the context of embryo research, we are dealing with the same debate, but in relation to the very early stages of development. Passions run as high in relation to those early stages as they do in relation to the later stages, for very obvious reasons.</p>

think, very easy to say &#147;This is a human being, but just in one or two cells&#148;&#151;and, of course, that is exactly what people will see if the pregnancy is wanted and planned, and would lead to a much-loved child. However, those who have been through the process of IVF, as I have, will know perfectly well, because they have had to learn the hard way, that it is not really the case at all.</p>

On a screen in a private room they see a little blob, and someone says &#147;That is a baby&#148;&#151; or they see that it is a baby. Then the one blob becomes two blobs, and sometimes it becomes four, and then it disappears, because it was never going to come to anything anyway. It might have had some potential for life, but that was never going to develop. It was only going to be one or two or four cells; they were not differentiating, and nothing was ever going to happen. We must take that into account in considering such groups of cells and in deciding what should happen to them and the status they should be accorded in law&#151;and therefore the way in which we should then be able to manipulate them for the good of improving the prospects of in vitro fertilisation, as well as for understanding a bit more about the science of life and what make us human, and for understanding a little more about some of the appalling diseases and conditions that affect human beings and thus finding cures for them.</p>

Securing improvements in both outcomes for people who suffer from infertility and need IVF treatment and the conditions of people with appalling diseases will come, in part, from making sure that we have good regulation that enables our scientists to manipulate, and experiment with, these cells at this very early stage.

 I actually think that talking about GM in people is quite wicked, because it makes people think scientists are doing something that they are not doing. They are dealing with groups of cells at a very early stage. I have seen such groups of my own cells up on a screen, and I know that they will never come to anything and they are not at a stage where they are human&#151;however much my hon. Friend might wish they were, they are not. What is important is that, with the right ethical principles, legal provisions and regulatory framework, it is possible for scientists to manage, experiment with and manipulate such cells within clear guidelines, so that they can improve the prospects for both the children who might be born through this process and the parents who will care for those children&#151;there is very good provision on parenthood, which we probably will not have time to deal with&#151;and also enhance the well-being of many people who suffer from appalling diseases.

Once an embryo exists, the problem is what to do with it or what to allow others to do with it. There would be no danger of someone implanting a genetically modified embryo into a woman if they did not have the embryo in the first place. Do we want this technology? Perhaps that is an issue for another day. The point is that we should not ask about the disposal of something only after we have decided to make it.

I do not believe that that is their intention, but the loophole exists because of the idea that some people have of a possible future fertility treatment for women with mitochondrial disease. The Government have allowed the loophole in response to that possibility. Amendment No. 41 would close it without precluding possible future approaches to mitochondrial disease. It would allow what the Government want to allow but close a dangerous loophole, and everyone in the House should be able to support it, even though it originated on the Back Benches rather than with the Government.</p>

It involves the transfer of a nucleus from a donor adult cell to an egg that has had its nucleus removed. The egg is then treated with either chemicals or electric current, and if it begins to divide normally, it is transferred into the uterus of the surrogate mother, where it will develop.

Regulations could allow a nucleus to be removed from an adult cell from a woman with mitochondrial disease and to be placed in a donor egg with healthy mitochondria, and from there a clone could be produced. In such a case, it would not have the healthy mitochondrial DNA from the second woman. That procedure, which would not involve fertilisation and would remove the need for a man, was suggested some time ago in a report in the <i> British Medical Journal</i> as a potential way to treat mitochondrial disease. Under the Bill, the protection previously provided against this procedure by the 2001 Act would no longer be in place, as that Act is abolished by clause 3(6) and schedule 8.</p>

What happens is either that a donor egg with healthy mitochondria with its nucleus removed is used to house the healthy nucleus from the egg with faulty mitochondria and this reconstructed egg is then fertilised by sperm through IVF; or that fertilisation occurs first, and is followed by nuclear transfer into an embryo with healthy mitochondria that has had its nucleus removed.</p>

 I support amendments Nos. 49 and 50, tabled by the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh), and Nos. 41 and 73, tabled by the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew). All the amendments in this group, including amendment No. 47, tabled by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes), and new clause 24, propose adding some words to the Bill to try to ensure that the law is clear and to reduce loopholes. None of them does any injury to what the Government and the supporters of the Bill say that they want the Bill to do. The amendments would not remove any of the provisions in the Bill. Those of us who had other views on those provisions lost that debate earlier this year. The amendments would address issues that are of concern not only for those who have reservations about this Bill, but, we were told, for those who support it.</p>

They have been real enough for the Government to try to assure people, here and in the other place, that they will not materialise. Why should not legislation protect against any such possibility in the interpretation of regulations, either on the part of those who produce the regulations or those working under them?

So it is our shared humanity that distinguishes us from animals; that determines how we should behave to one another; and determines especially that we should not deliberately distort the lives, or expedite the deaths, of fellow humans, whether those fellow human beings are born or unborn. There has been too little debate in this House about that definition of human life in relation to the Bill, too little clarity about the nature of human life, as my hon.

For Singer, the ethics of humanity is objectionable because it amounts to what he calls &#147;speciesism&#148;. We have heard a great deal about the blend of animal materials and human cellular materials. Of course, if one does not believe the orthodox view of how to define humanity, and if one defines it around the idea of personhood, when personhood itself is defined by the ability to exercise autonomy and choice, it becomes entirely permissible to manipulate human cellular material in the way the Bill will allow.</p>

All that the amendments would do is introduce greater clarity. Of course science matters, and of course scientific research is important, but, frankly, morals matter more. We should not define human cellular material in such speciesist terms. We should certainly not abandon our orthodox assumptions about those things that bind us together, born or unborn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="81022-0016.htm_para27"><a name="08102255000169">The Minister needs to explain in detail how the Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001, which bans reproductive cloning, is replicated in the Bill. Why does clause 3(6) use the word &#147;superseded&#148;? If it is correct that there are loopholes in the Bill, as we have been told, the Bill does not supersede the 2001 Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="81022-0016.htm_para28"><a name="08102255000170">It is thought that amendment No. 41, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), should prohibit future Governments from permitting reproductive cloning. We have heard the Government&#146;s reassurances that they would never pass regulations to permit that&#151;a Conservative Government would not do so&#151;but if a form of wording could be included in the Bill to ensure that that could never happen, the Government should work to find it. It is not acceptable to leave that to regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="81022-0016.htm_para29"><a name="08102255000171">Clearly, one of the challenges in the Bill concerns the balance between primary legislation and regulation. One of the reasons why the Bill is before us today is that medical technology has advanced. The Bill is partly about updating the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. The onus is on the Minister and the Government to show that amendment No. 41 is harmful. It has been cleverly drafted so as not to interfere with mitochondrial donation techniques. It would prevent the legalisation of only those techniques that there is a strong public and international consensus against.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="81022-0016.htm_para30"><a name="08102255000172">My hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) made a passionate, interesting, detailed speech that demonstrated key, fundamental understanding of the issues. He highlighted a potential&#151;I use the word advisedly&#151;loophole relating to the technological advances in question. Of course, there cannot be an exhaustive list. There was a great debate in the other place about that. However, the Minister needs to understand, and to clarify today, the interaction between the Bill, the 1990 Act that the Bill amends, and the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. She needs to say which piece of legislation will be responsible for   <br>

which licence, and whether one is more permissive than another. If it is, she must say whether the Government will consider tightening the relevant licensing procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="81022-0016.htm_para31"><a name="08102255000173">Again, amendment No. 50 and new clause 24 were tabled by the hon. Member for Southport. The right hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) was absolutely right to say that the Bill prohibits admixed embryos being placed in an animal. If there were a total ban, however, it would clearly affect mitochondrial technological advancements, and I am in favour of those advancements. Members need to understand that mixing human and animal gametes has taken place for some considerable time. The right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) and the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) made the point clearly that there have been significant advances in infertility research because of what has been called the hamster test. Hon. Members need to be very careful about trying to ban and prohibit any mixture of animal and human gametes.</p>

 I will not, if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, because I want to give the Minister time to respond. Common themes have emerged today. First, it is clearly the view of many Members, on all sides of the debate, that there are potential loopholes that may need to be closed. Secondly, it is vital to get the balance between primary legislation and regulation correct. I suspect that the Minister will have to address that clearly. The key element that we must not lose sight of as we discuss this part of the Bill is the fact that the special status of the embryo must be put above everything else. That must not be lost in our debate.</p>

<p><a name="st_o287"><a name="08102255000176"><a name="81022-0016.htm_spnew8"><a name="08102255003967"><b>Dawn Primarolo:</b>
 I start by saying clearly&#151;I will return to this point, as the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds) asked me to&#151;that the Bill sets out a clear prohibition on human reproductive cloning and the genetic modification of gametes or embryos that are to be used for treatment purposes. It does that through the provisions set out in clause 3. At the end of my comments on the amendments, I will return to the subject to lay that out clearly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="81022-0016.htm_para32"><a name="08102255000177">Amendments Nos. 41, 49 and 73 seek to restrict the provisions in the Bill that aim to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases. Research is currently being carried out, under a Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority licence, on ways to avoid those devastating diseases. To remind ourselves, we are talking about dementia, respiratory problems, gastro-intestinal disorders, stroke and brain atrophy. In recognition of the severity of those conditions and the potential for such research to provide effective treatment, the Bill provides, through a regulation-making power, for eggs or embryos that have had applied to them a specific process enabling them to avoid serious mitochondrial diseases to be considered &#147;permitted&#148;. They can therefore be used in treatment. The particular process and the circumstances in which that would be appropriate would be detailed in regulation. I take the caution given by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) about acknowledging the sensitivities and difficulties in that area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="81022-0017.htm_para0"><a name="08102255000178">The safety of using the techniques has not yet been established. They would need to be assessed carefully before being deployed as options for patients in treatment. The regulating power would allow for that consideration through a full consultation, to gather the views of the public, ethicists and relevant stakeholders on the appropriate use of using donor eggs for that purpose. For example, as some hon. Members have pointed out today, and as has been raised in the House before, there would need to be consideration about the status of the egg donor if donations from which only the mitochondria is used were made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="81022-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08102255000179">In addition to the public consultation, we believe that Parliament should not be asked to decide on this issue now, for precisely the reasons that have been mentioned: the facts should be before Parliament before it makes a decision. It should be asked to take the decision only when all the facts are clearly available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="81022-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08102255000180">Amendment No. 41 seeks to limit the regulating powers so that embryos or eggs that have undergone cell nuclear replacement could not be permitted for use in treatment. Following debate in another place and in this House, the Government carefully considered the drafting of proposed new section 3ZA of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, and whether it needed to be amended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="81022-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08102255000181">After careful consideration, the Government&#146;s view is that the drafting is clear and does not require amendment. The precise process by which mitochondrial diseases may be treated is not yet clear, and amendment to the regulating powers would inadvertently risk and reduce the scope and the process for treatments to be allowed. Secondly, the regulation-making power is limited to the treatment of mitochondrial diseases only. Thirdly, the regulations would be subject to considerable public consultation and then to debate in Parliament. That would enable all the concerns to be raised. In taking that forward, the Government are balancing the need to have the facts before taking decisions with the recognition that the power is about helping couples conceive a child that is genetically theirs, but without the fatally flawed mitochondria that affect the maternal line. That is the balance that we are trying to strike; we have left things open for further consideration. That is why we are proceeding as we are.</p>

<p><a name="st_o288"><a name="08102255000182"><a name="81022-0017.htm_spnew0"><a name="08102255003968"><b>Mr. Drew:</b>
 I hear what my right hon. Friend says, but does she understand the concerns that some of us have? We are being asked to trust the Government, and, more particularly, to think that any future regulation, over which we would have no control through primary legislation, will be fit for purpose. In the context of these issues, that is quite a leap of faith.</p>

<p><a name="st_o289"><a name="08102255000183"><a name="81022-0017.htm_spnew1"><a name="08102255003969"><b>Dawn Primarolo:</b>
 I am asking my hon. Friend to think about being involved in the consultation, participating in the public debate and improving the draft regulations if and when they come forward. He should then fully participate in an affirmative resolution debate in the House before the regulations are passed. I am asking hon. Members to think&#151;and that is a reasonable thing to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="81022-0017.htm_para4"><a name="08102255000184">Amendment No. 49 seeks to limit the regulating power so that only embryos or eggs that have been subjected to processes to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases through cytoplasm could be  <br>

permitted for use in the treatment. I absolutely understand and appreciate the intention behind it. I have to say, however, that the amendment is ambiguous&#151;a point that has been touched on in the debate. Everything in a cell could be considered to be cytoplasm, including the mitochondria and the nucleus, and restricting regulating powers to prevent the transmission of serious mitochondrial diseases via the cytoplasm would not necessarily achieve the aim of excluding transmission via the cell&#146;s nucleus. For that reason, there was no need to put the amendment before the House.</p>
<a name="ordayhd_31"><a name="81022-0017.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="08102255003907"><h5 align="left">5.45 pm</h5>
<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="81022-0017.htm_para5"><a name="08102255000185">There are other more appropriate ways in which mitochondrial disease transmitted via a cell&#146;s nucleus could be treated. We are looking specifically, through pre-implantation, at genetic diagnosis of the embryo. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) will accept that we are attempting to strike the right balance, while leaving open the final decisions until the information is available and this House has taken a final view, following consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="81022-0017.htm_para6"><a name="08102255000186">Amendment No. 73 would prevent any research from being undertaken in the UK the purpose of which is to develop techniques of germ-line genetic modification. It would have the effect of prohibiting research projects from being licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority where the purpose of the research was to develop techniques for the genetic modification of human embryos. In addition, the amendment would restrict the regulation-making power to prevent the research. We are not aware of any researcher who would want to undertake such research, particularly in the light of the international agreements in place to prevent such activities from being applied for reproductive purposes. The Bill clearly sets out a prohibition on the reproductive application of such practices, and any research licensed by the HFEA would also need to satisfy the criteria that the use of embryos was necessary for the research, and that the research was necessary or desirable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="81022-0017.htm_para7"><a name="08102255000187">Amendment No. 50 and new clause 24 would introduce a regulating power that requires the Secretary of State to make it an offence to place human gametes in an animal. The Bill does not change the legal position achieved by the 1990 Act, which made no prohibition on the artificial insemination of an animal with human sperm. Such a prohibition was believed unnecessary at the time because of the inability for humans and animals to produce offspring successfully. Equally, the 1990 Act legislated on the creation of human embryos in vitro and on reproductive services. The subject matter was very different from that of the artificial insemination of animals. Since 1990, our knowledge of the ability of humans and animals to procreate has not changed, and there is still no published evidence to suggest that any insemination of an animal with human sperm, whether as part of a scientific study or not, has resulted in pregnancy. Members touched on the regulations that exist and support the legislation in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The Government believe that the combination of the existing legislation in this area is sufficient, and we are not aware of any developments that require revision of that position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="81022-0017.htm_para8"><a name="08102255000188">Amendments Nos. 51 and 52 relate to the regulation-making powers in the Bill to extend and alter its definition of embryo, eggs, sperm, gametes and human admixed  <br>

embryos. They provide that those powers can be used by the Secretary of State only on condition that they are necessary and desirable. It is important that hon. Members understand exactly how that would interact with the rest of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="81022-0017.htm_para9"><a name="08102255000189">Amendment No. 47 has been substantially debated this afternoon with regard to a definition of human admixed embryos that include a catch-all category. That category refers to an embryo containing both human and animal DNA in which the DNA of the animal does not predominate. In other words, those embryos are more human than animal. I touched on the conditions under which a licence would have to be sought in an earlier intervention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="81022-0017.htm_para10"><a name="08102255000190">Amendment No. 47 refers to embryos containing human and animal cells created by a process of tetraploid complementation. In the type of embryo created by the process to which the amendment refers, the cells of an early animal embryo are altered, so that they contain twice the usual complement of DNA. Such cells are destined to give rise to only extra-embryonic tissue. When placed with those altered animal cells, human cells would give rise to the embryo proper, because the animal cells are capable of forming only extra-embryonic cells. The implantation of the embryo created in that way is therefore prohibited by the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="81022-0017.htm_para11"><a name="08102255000191">Amendment No. 47 seeks to add a further category to the existing categories. Hon. Members have talked about their fear of a loophole that needs to be closed. In looking at the range of issues that have been raised, the Government believe that the embryo created by the process that I have described should be considered as a human admixed embryo, which is regulated under the definition in proposed new section 4A(6)(e) of the 1990 Act, so there is no loophole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="81022-0017.htm_para12"><a name="08102255000192">In conclusion, let me return to the point about cloning. The Government are absolutely clear that we are committed to banning human reproductive cloning, and the Bill continues to provide for that.</p>

 Hon. Members know that the Bill is about helping the one in seven couples who need assistance with their fertility. It is about research to deal with the dreadful diseases and the debilitating attacks on their health from which many in our society suffer. The Bill is about combining science with an ethical framework that works on behalf of humankind, and I think that the House knows that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="81022-0017.htm_para13"><a name="08102255000195">The provisions of the Bill continue to prohibit reproductive cloning and retain the existing penalty of up to 10 years in prison for anyone attempting reproductive cloning. I say this to all hon. Members, whatever their fears: please be reassured that the penalty is there. The prohibition continues. The Bill contains specific powers to allow the House to return, when the information is there and the consultation has been completed, in order to be clear about whether we would permit any further expansion in that area of research.</p>

It is a complete disgrace that we have been treated in this way by the Government.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I wonder whether I could appeal to you as the guardian of the reputation of this House of Commons. I completely understand that you can make no comment about the contents or quality of a Bill, but this Bill is of enormous, far-reaching importance. Parenting is in its title but there has been no opportunity to debate that. We are not going to have a Third Reading to discuss any of it as it leaves this House. People up and down this land will just not understand that. Would you be prepared, Sir, to discuss this with the Procedure Committee, so that never again does a Bill of this major importance go through without a proper Third Reading?</p>

 When science throws our views and ethics into flux, legislation brings regulation and stability. The House has struck a new consensus of allowing science to stretch its wings and develop, but constraining it within what the House considers to be ethically acceptable. The US physician, Richard Cabot, said that science and ethics need to shake hands. The Bill brokers that handshake. It represents a good deal for science and society, and I commend it to the House.</p>

 The Bill is of great significance. It has tried to strike a balance&#151;to allow scientific advancement while being based on an ethical platform. It is a shame in some ways that it has had this unfortunate end. Clearly, there are many dissatisfied Members in the House, and that is primarily due to the programme motion, which has not allowed important amendments and issues to be debated. Conservative Members had a free vote on the Bill, and in my view there should have been far more free votes for Government Members, too. We are talking about significant ethical and moral issues, and Members should be allowed to vote with their conscience.</p>

House and in the other place. It was originally the Minister&#146;s hope, and it is my hope, that this Bill will be similarly enduring. However, after today&#146;s performance, I have to question whether it will be. I hope that the shape of the ethical and regulatory framework for reproductive science and medicine will hold for many years to come. The Bill is built on a moral and ethical regulatory framework that will allow Britain to remain at the forefront of scientific and medical innovation while, importantly, still protecting the special status of the embryo.</p>

 It is unfortunate that the Bill has ended its time in the House in this way. The way in which the Government manipulated the programme motion is outrageous; it denied people on both sides of the debate the opportunity to raise issues of real and profound concern. At the beginning of Report, the Minister argued that it was important not to deal with abortion because we needed time for all the other issues in the Bill. Of course, we have not had time to deal with all the other issues because debate has been so greatly constrained by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="81022-0020.htm_para12"><a name="08102255002314">Despite all that, this is a very important Bill. We Liberal Democrats have had free votes throughout its stages, and will have a free vote on Third Reading, but speaking personally, I welcome the Bill as it stands. I support the way in which it has moved through the House, and its shape now as it moves to the other place. This country has led the way in shaping the ethical framework within which science operates. The Conservative party started the process in 1990, when it was in government. The Bill brings the legislation up to date on the advances of scientific endeavour, and that is the right way to proceed.</p>

 I want to know what, in years to come, Members of the House are supposed to say to children who look at us and say, &#147;Why have you denied me the opportunity to have a relationship with my natural father or mother?&#148; That should be the birthright of every child in this country. It is a deeply sad moment when the House denies that possibility to children who may wish to have that opportunity in years to come. I am deeply saddened that we have not had a proper debate, and that there has not been a chance for every Member to go through one or other Division Lobby, on the issue.</p>

 I should briefly like to support the Bill on Third Reading. It is another breakthrough piece of legislation, following on from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. All of us should think that one day, future generations will thank us legislators for having made good legislation, backed with regulations that will ensure that many diseases from which people suffer will, in years to come, be a thing of the past.</p>

 Professor Jones of St. Mary&#146;s university college sums it up by saying that there is no doubt that if one overarching principle of contemporary medical ethics still trumps all others, it is personal autonomy. We have been denied the opportunity to debate the question of consent in the context of licensing, and it is deeply regrettable&#151;</p>

 Not many people have witnessed a British nuclear explosion, but those who have will be following this debate closely, for I intend to ask the Minister whether the Government will repay a debt of honour to surviving veterans of our nuclear weapons tests in the 1950s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="81022-0021.htm_para10"><a name="08102255002829">The issue is not new. Successive Governments have been aware of the facts for quite a while, but I am raising the matter again because a number of new factors have come into play. The first is that there has been new scientific evidence from Dr. Al Rowland in New Zealand to suggest that veterans have suffered as a result of their exposure to radiation. Secondly, the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) and I held a cross-party inquiry last year which raised new facts and disclosures. Meanwhile, other countries are moving well ahead of us in recognising their veterans. Here in Britain we lag shamefully behind. The Government even appear to be backtracking on a promise to replicate the New Zealand study on our veterans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="81022-0021.htm_para11"><a name="08102255002830">The history to the debate needs to be understood. Between 15,000 and 20,000 servicemen took part in Britain&#146;s nuclear tests, which included Operation Grapple on Malden Island and Christmas Island in 1957-58. Other tests took place at Monte Bello islands, Maralinga, and Emu field. It is thought that only about 3,000 veterans are alive today. Many of those involved believe they were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation that resulted in their own ill health and that of their descendents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="81022-0021.htm_para12"><a name="08102255002831">Veterans and their families seeking redress in the form of a war pension encounter a frustrating tribunal system that is both inconsistent and subject to delays. For many years, the British Nuclear Test Veterans Association or BNTVA has campaigned for recognition for its 800 or so surviving veteran members, and many more widows and offspring, but successive Governments have used a controversial series of reports by the National Radiological Protection Board or NRPB to insist that no harm was done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="81022-0021.htm_para13"><a name="08102255002832">It was against that backdrop that research from New Zealand last year threw light on a possible link between participation in the tests and possible genetic changes in veterans. The hon. Member for Norwich, North and I therefore believed that the time was right to hold a cross-party inquiry to look at this question again. We took evidence over two days from scientists and veterans, but the Ministry of Defence declined to contribute. Our inquiry heard clear personal testimony that makes us question whether adequate radiological safety standards were followed for the tests. For one thing, there is a concern that some veterans were simply too close to the epicentre of the blast. Witnesses described their experiences of a heat wave of extraordinary intensity, leading in some cases to temporary blindness or a sensation of blood boiling within their bodies. Others developed skin rashes and flu-like symptoms immediately after the detonations. My constituent Mr. Eric Everard says:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="81022-0021.htm_para14"><a name="08102255002833">There were many similar stories of men being mustered on to beaches or on the decks of ships to witness the explosions and many suffering afterwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="81022-0021.htm_para15"><a name="08102255002834">In our inquiry, we also saw little evidence that fallout and the dangers from ingested radioactive particles were taken seriously after the tests. Servicemen were free to move around the island, drinking local water, eating local fruits, bathing in the lagoons and breathing in dust, all of which could have been contaminated. That is worrying, because ingested radioactive particles from fallout can remain in the body and continue to harm for many years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="81022-0021.htm_para16"><a name="08102255002835">As I have suggested, successive Governments&#151;I hope that the Minister realises that this is not a party political issue&#151;have used the NRPB series of reports to argue that test veterans have not experienced poor health, but endless concerns have been raised about those reports, which have never commanded the respect of veteran groups. I do not intend to go into the issues now, as time is not on our side, but I suggest to the Minister that the key point is that NRPB reports go only so far. They are studies of cancer mortality&#151;in other words, counting cancer deaths&#151;that tell us nothing about the underlying genetic changes in veterans or other ill health among them or their descendants. That is why our inquiry took such a close interest in the Al Rowland study from New Zealand and the Chris Busby survey undertaken through the BNTVA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="81022-0021.htm_para17"><a name="08102255002836">The study of the genetic status of New Zealand veterans, which was carried out by Dr. Al Rowland and his team at Massey university, showed a very high frequency of translocations in the chromosomes of veterans as compared with a carefully matched control group. Dr. Rowland certainly believes that the probable cause is exposure to radiation, which can be attributed to participation in Operation Grapple. The report concluded:</p>

It was our clear and distinct impression from that meeting that the Rowland study would be replicated here by the British Government if it was peer-reviewed. Yet despite its being peer-reviewed in a respectable scientific journal, the Government seem now to be prevaricating. A letter from the Minister&#146;s predecessor dated 23 August stated that the Government would be</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="81022-0021.htm_para21"><a name="08102255002841">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the scientists who came to our inquiry had some ideas about conducting it along the right lines in order to get an answer one way or the other. It certainly was my understanding when we talked to the previous Minister that that was going to happen. I would like publicly to congratulate Al Rowland, whom I met at Massey. He gave me the data relating to his work; it has opened up a hornet&#146;s nest that cannot be denied in terms of further research.</p>

<p><a name="st_o324"><a name="08102255002842"><a name="81022-0021.htm_spnew6"><a name="08102255006517"><b>Mr. Baron:</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for what he has said. I have already put on record my thanks to him for being a co-party in our inquiry, and in the efforts that we have made so far. I am pleased to hear his confirmation that it was our understanding that an Al Rowland-type study would be undertaken if it was peer-reviewed, which it has now been. I hope that the new Minister will tell us whether the Government intend to keep the promise made at our meeting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="81022-0021.htm_para22"><a name="08102255002843">The Busby report is important for a similar reason. It examines the legacy of nuclear testing for subsequent and future generations. The results of a questionnaire study of BNTVA members and their offspring conducted last year suggest much higher levels of miscarriage, still birth, infant mortality and congenital illness in veterans&#146; children, both in a national context and in the context of control children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="81022-0021.htm_para23"><a name="08102255002844">Some of the experiences revealed by the study are quite distressing. Among veterans the number of miscarriages was 105, compared with 18 in the control group. The rate of still births was 26 per 1,000 births, compared with 10 in the control group. The rate of congenital defects among veterans&#146; children was almost 10 times that among other children. The defects included cataracts at birth, deformed spines, muscle wasting, deafness, excess and missing teeth, and holes in the stomach and heart. My constituent Mr. Eric Everard certainly believes that the effects of the radiation to which he was exposed were passed on to his son Darran, who died of a genetic connective tissue disease when he was only 22 years old. Such reports are not unusual among veterans. Dr. Busby concluded:</p>
<a name="81022-0021.htm_brev22"><a name="08102255003899"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is clear that the veterans received significant genetic damage as a result of their period near the test sites.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="81022-0021.htm_para24"><a name="08102255002845">The findings of that research echoed the earlier findings of Dr. Sue Rabbitt Roth of Dundee university, which I understand was peer-reviewed in 1999&#151;a fact overlooked by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="81022-0021.htm_para25"><a name="08102255002846">That snapshot is deeply worrying, and suggests a sinister genetic legacy for future generations. I would go as far as to suggest that there is a ticking time bomb of ill health that the Government need to recognise. The Minister must not underestimate the real anger that exists outside this place about Government inaction. To help future generations, we need to understand the scope of the problem. That is why I believe that Dr. Busby&#146;s study should be replicated rigorously, and the Government should provide the funds.</p>

almost identical experiences and conditions receive different outcomes. Our inquiry therefore called for a complete overhaul of the system, perhaps even removing nuclear test veterans from the war pensions process altogether because they are such a unique group. I suggest that the Minister and representatives of the Ministry of Defence should sit down with the veterans and sort the problem out&#151;a process that will require political courage and leadership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="81022-0022.htm_para1"><a name="08102255002848">Let me deliver a final thought to the Minister. We are not dealing with this issue in isolation, and we are already being left hopelessly far behind other nations in terms of honouring our debt of gratitude to veterans. The Isle of Man Government will pay compensation in the region of &#163;8,000 to each of the estimated eight Manx veterans involved in the tests, the New Zealand Government have already provided money for the Al Rowlands experiments and scientific tests, and the Canadian Government have offered to settle with their test veterans. In the United States, &#147;atomic veterans&#148; are eligible for presumptive compensation based on 21 identified cancers. A person who has one of those cancers and was involved in the tests will receive compensation automatically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="81022-0022.htm_para2"><a name="08102255002849">The contrast between the different approaches is well illustrated by the case of Mr. Roy Prescott, whose son wrote to me during our inquiry. He was one of 500 British servicemen who, having served on Christmas Island, were loaned to the United States for further tests on the island in the early 1960s. Mr. Prescott later became ill and applied for a British war pension, but that was turned down. He then applied to the United States compensation programme, was accepted and received a substantial one-off payment. We therefore see the absurdity of other countries compensating our own veterans because we have failed to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="81022-0022.htm_para3"><a name="08102255002850">The Ministry of Defence has been cagey and resistant for too long. We owe a duty of care to our test veterans. The Minister is new in his position and I ask him to commit to a fresh appraisal regarding our debt of gratitude. This is not a party political issue. My early-day motion 156 attracted signatures from Members in all parts of the House. I therefore ask the Minister some very simple questions. Will he now replicate the Rowland study on British veterans? What further study is he prepared to carry out on the descendents of veterans&#151;a matter that could be with us for many years to come? Will he sit down with veterans and address the question of tribunals and compensation, and do it now?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="81022-0022.htm_para4"><a name="08102255002851">These veterans just want justice for themselves and their descendents. They served their country. What they now expect is their country to be honest with them. While any solution is likely to be characterised as much by political compromise as by scientific rigour, this is, without doubt, a political problem. Time is now short, and I suggest to the new Minister that the best should not be the enemy of the good.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s comments, and I wish to begin by putting it on the record that the Ministry of Defence recognises the debt of gratitude we have to the servicemen who took part in these nuclear tests. They were important tests that helped to keep this nation secure at a difficult time in terms of nuclear technology. The hon. Gentleman rightly noted that if harm has been caused to these individuals and the Ministry of Defence and this nation are responsible, they should be offered redress. However, I think he would agree with me that any claim for compensation should be evidence-based. Evidence should be brought forward and determined on an individual basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="81022-0022.htm_para6"><a name="08102255002854">I also think we can agree that there is no doubt about the sincerity of the veterans; I would not question for one minute their testimony or that of their families. It is important that we do not question or criticise them in any way. The vital issue, however, is whether we can link the conditions that some individuals and families have with those individuals having been present at the nuclear tests. As the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, previous Governments as well as this Government have looked at the evidence and have come to the conclusion that no evidence has been demonstrated to link those conditions with presence at the tests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="81022-0022.htm_para7"><a name="08102255002855">The hon. Gentleman&#146;s report conceded that current scientific evidence does not generally support the view that there has been an increased risk of ill health or death among the test participants. Even though Dr. Rowland&#146;s recent study indicates that genetic damage was present among the small cohort of individuals that he examined, it did not go on to draw any link between the genetic abnormalities found in the chromosomes and any conditions such as cancers. That report has been held up as an important piece of research, but it does not help to move forward the argument for drawing that link between damage to chromosomes and conditions such as cancers that developed later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="81022-0022.htm_para8"><a name="08102255002856">The hon. Gentleman asked whether I would give a commitment to replicate the Rowland study. He mentioned a meeting. I was not present, so I have asked my officials what was said. They have told me that it is quite clear that no clear commitment was given. I have examined the study in detail since I found that the debate was coming up, and I have come to the conclusion that it would be very difficult to replicate in the case of the individuals whom we are discussing. I am not sure what such a study would add to the debate if it led to the same conclusions that Rowland came to.</p>

 Nevertheless, it is an important piece of the jigsaw. The clear recollection from our meeting with the Minister&#146;s predecessor is that a promise was given on condition that the study was peer-reviewed. It now has been, and we hope that the Government will reconsider their position. I am not expecting an answer now, but all I ask is for the Minister to think about it.</p>

 I shall certainly address that point and return to the matter of the peer review at a later date. When my predecessor met the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North, he stated clearly that the Department would examine the Rowland research and take expert advice on it, and that has been done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="81022-0022.htm_para9"><a name="08102255002859">The hon. Gentleman mentioned other countries&#146; payments to their nuclear test veterans. What is unique in this country is that consecutive Governments have accepted that people who can prove that exposure to radiation caused them harm can apply for the war pensions scheme. That is not the case in other countries, so to say that we have done nothing is a little harsh on the current and previous Governments. I add that the burden of proof in the war pensions scheme is generous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="81022-0022.htm_para10"><a name="08102255002860">The hon. Gentleman complained about inconsistency in the cases involving the war pensions scheme. I accept that people have felt that, but they do have the right to go to a pensions appeal tribunal and ultimately, on a point of law, to the social security commissioners. I used to deal with tribunals and I accept that inconsistencies can appear to happen, but individual cases have to be considered on an individual basis. The Department has examined some of the cases involved and has not found inconsistencies, but if the hon. Gentleman or the nuclear test veterans want specific cases to be examined, I am quite prepared to ask the Ministry of Justice to do so. It is important to get credibility. A separate system would be difficult, and it would not lead to the payments that many of the individuals who come forward currently get.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="81022-0022.htm_para11"><a name="08102255002861">The other route of access to justice is common law, and the hon. Gentleman will know that 1,000 nuclear test veterans have taken group litigation. The Ministry of Defence served a summary defence on 21 January, and a preliminary trial on the issue of limitation is due to commence on 19 January next year. It has been reported in the media that the matter of limitation is simply a technicality, but that is not the case. It is important that the matter is examined from a legal point of view, especially given that many of the key witnesses are no longer alive and that the evidence of others needs testing because of age or infirmity. I do not want to say a great deal more about that, because it is right that we let the legal process take its due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="81022-0022.htm_para12"><a name="08102255002862">The hon. Gentleman made some emotive points about the offspring of test veterans. I accept that it is not easy for the families that have disabled children and that they find some of the responses that politicians give difficult to take. We need to examine the matter, but to say that there has been no research is wrong. I am told that good-quality research has been done on Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors, examining ill health among children born to survivors. That needs to be taken into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="81022-0022.htm_para13"><a name="08102255002863">I genuinely do understand the British nuclear test veterans&#146; concern about this issue, on which they have placed a great deal of importance. At a recent meeting with my predecessor, they expressed the view that they wanted this issue to be looked at, putting more weight on doing that than on carrying out a &#147;Rowland mark 2&#148; type study. I have listened carefully and looked at the files in the short time that I have been in the Ministry, and I think it is important to get experts to look in detail at what has already been done and what can be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="81022-0022.htm_para14"><a name="08102255002864">This is not a simple task, and this afternoon I perhaps upset some of my officials by being a bit impatient in trying to get instant answers. The logistics will prove difficult because of the passage of time, loss of data and other such issues. However, my predecessor said he would meet representatives of the group in the autumn, and I am determined to move this agenda forwards. I  <br>

make an offer tonight to meet the hon. Gentleman, my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North and representatives of British nuclear test veterans next week, so that we can discuss the possibility of taking forward a study on health experiences and issues associated with veterans&#146; offspring. Once that meeting has taken place, I propose to ask officials to discuss with the experts the best way to design and develop a possible research programme. It is important that this study and the terms of reference for it are correct, and that we are not asking people to do the impossible. That is a commitment that I give today.</p>

 I welcome my hon. Friend&#146;s very positive attitude towards helping in his early days in office. One of the logistical problems that we came up against was finding out where vets were, which is why it is very important that he has invited them along, because they may be able to help in finding out where all those folks live now, so that we can get decent numbers. It will be difficult, but I really do welcome my hon. Friend&#146;s positive approach. Perhaps we will get to the bottom of this once and for all.</p>

 I sense that the Minister is about to conclude, so may I, too, put on the record my thanks for his positive response? He has decided to try to move this issue forward, certainly with regard to descendants, which I very much welcome. I look forward to that meeting next week, and I know that the BNTVA will also be looking forward to it. We should not forget that it has a database of at least 800 surviving veterans, which can help with that process. I want also to thank the Minister for his promise to sit down with the veterans and look at inconsistencies in the tribunal process, and to explore whether any progress can be made where inconsistencies have occurred. Those are two positive steps that we did not necessarily have months ago.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that. I hope to make an announcement before Christmas on the way forward. It will not answer all the issues raised in his inquiry, but I am determined to see whether we can at least get some movement and give some comfort, although I accept that the report might not come to any great conclusion. At least we are going to move the process on, which will give the sense to nuclear test veterans that they are being listened to.</p>
