</p>


<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50704-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Defence  (John Reid): </b> 
 It is extremely important that all of us in this country recall the sacrifices of our past and pass on the culture of remembrance from generation to generation. That is why the Government are organising a series of events this week to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war. They will be centred on national commemoration day, on 10 July. It will bring to an end the first ever veterans awareness week, which will concentrate this year on second world war veterans.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 2</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50704-01_spnew0"><b> Meg Hillier: </b> 
 Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is extremely important to recognise not only the veterans who are still alive but the memory of those who gave their lives in conflict for our future? Will he join me in applauding the work of the late Sir Donald Thompson, a former Member of this House, in establishing the War Memorials Trust, of which I am a trustee? Will my right hon. Friend also promise that he will work with colleagues at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to ensure that all war memorials&#151;not just listed ones&#151;are preserved, as the conflicts that we are discussing move from living memory to history?
</p>





<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50704-01_spnew1"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 I should like to associate myself with my hon. Friend&#039;s tribute to Sir Donald, a former Member of this House, whose tireless efforts on behalf of the War   Memorials Trust&#151;a charity dedicated to the conservation and preservation of 65,000 memorials throughout the country&#151;has ensured that those who gave their lives for our freedom are not forgotten. In a real sense, this week&#039;s veterans awareness week is intended to be a living memorial not only to those who gave their lives, but to those&#151;military and civilian&#151;who suffered great hardship and made great sacrifices for this country. It is a fitting tribute to them.
</p>





<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50704-01_spnew2"><b> Daniel Kawczynski  (Shrewsbury and Atcham)</b> 
 (Con): I hope that when we do commemorate the many veterans who sacrificed so much, the Secretary of State will remember the many Poles who came to this country. According to some estimates, one in five of the pilots who fought in the battle of Britain were Polish. My own grandfather was among the Poles who came over during the war, and I hope that we can remember them as well.
</p>





<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50704-01_spnew3"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 Absolutely. The hon. Gentleman may be pleased to know that I was the first Defence Minister ever to attend the Polish memorial ceremony at Northolt, on Remembrance day 1997. So I do remember the Poles, along with the Czechs and the many other 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 3</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>nationalities who came here. But as the hon. Gentleman says, none were more prominent than the Poles, particularly those who served in the Royal Air Force.
</p>





<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50704-01_spnew4"><b> Sarah McCarthy-Fry  (Portsmouth, North)</b> 
 (Lab): We in Portsmouth have just commemorated the 200th anniversary of the battle of Trafalgar. One of the most moving aspects of last Wednesday&#039;s drumhead service was the work that veterans had done with local schoolchildren. Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is very important that we keep alive the memory of those who gave their lives in the service of their country, and that our schoolchildren learn what such conflicts were like?
</p>





<p><a name="st_6"><a name="50704-01_spnew5"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 Absolutely. I had the great pleasure of attending, with Her Majesty the Queen, the review of the fleet, which took place off Portsmouth, and the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig), attended the drumhead ceremony. It is of course vitally important that we recall the lessons to be learned, as well as the memory of those who served in combat for us. First, we should recall the terrible, tragic and huge cost of war. Secondly, we should recall the price of appeasement, which resulted in many more lives being lost than would have otherwise been lost. Thirdly, we should recognise that these memories have to be retained for generation upon generation, because it is on them that we build partnership and peace with former enemies. Thankfully, such efforts have preserved peace in Europe for 60 years.

<p><a name="qn_1">2. <a name="50704-01_wqn1"><b> Mr. Crispin Blunt  (Reigate)</b> 
 (Con): If he will make a statement on the ownership of the intellectual property in the joint strike fighter.  [8652]
</p>


<p><a name="st_7"><a name="50704-01_spmin1"><b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence  (Mr. Adam Ingram): </b> 
 Intellectual property rights in the joint strike fighter system are owned by the contractor generating them, whether UK or US companies. Ownership of subcontractor-generated information is a commercial matter between the contractor and subcontractor. The Ministry of Defence can use the IPR generated under the JSF contracts and subcontracts for purposes associated with JSF, whether nationally or collaboratively with other partner nations.
</p>





<p><a name="st_8"><a name="50704-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Blunt: </b> 
 Will the Minister confirm that due to lack of access to the intellectual property invested in the joint strike fighter&#151;the UK has now invested some &#163;2 billion in this programme&#151;and due to the lack of a guarantee of future access to such property and to other elements of the JSF programme, if we ordered this aircraft today, we would not have sovereign control over it? In other words, we would not be able to upgrade and update it in the light of British requirements, once it was in service with us. It is unacceptable for the UK to have such a substantial part of her future defence requirements operating without sovereign control and the fact that this matter has not already been sorted out is a pretty poor return for British assistance to the US. Will the Minister make it clear that it is unacceptable for purchases to go ahead on this basis and will he inform the US Administration that the House believes it to be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 4</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>indifferent at best that her No. 1 partner in this programme and No. 1 partner in operations around the world is being treated in such a fashion without this issue being resolved?
</p>





<p><a name="st_9"><a name="50704-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I well understand the heat generated by the way in which the hon. Gentleman has raised the matter. We constantly make representations to the US Administration through our defence and other contacts. Discussions are under way to ensure that the information transfer, which is crucial to our maintenance of the fleet, is completed to our satisfaction. We are at an early stage as yet, but the determination that the hon. Gentleman requests certainly exists within the Ministry of Defence and elsewhere in the Government.
</p>





<p><a name="st_10"><a name="50704-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Lindsay Hoyle  (Chorley)</b> 
 (Lab): I am sure that my right hon. Friend would agree that not to have the intellectual property rights and the know-how and ability to be able to service the aircraft as well as build them to supply other nations amounts to a serious setback&#151;not only to the loyal workers at Warton, but to the rest of Europe. The failure to reach agreement on the intellectual rights will put those workers&#039; jobs at risk and the Royal Air Force as a whole at risk. Furthermore, we will not have the operational capability to work off the new aircraft carriers. If we fail to get agreement from the Americans, will my right hon. Friend look further into the intellectual property rights and design that was put forward for Typhoon to operate off the carriers and view that as a fall-back position?
</p>





<p><a name="st_11"><a name="50704-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 We are not yet at the stage of having to consider fall-back options or failure, but I take my hon. Friend&#039;s point that this is a very serious issue. I reiterate my earlier answer that we are determined to succeed&#151;for all the reasons that my hon. Friend set out. Negotiations are at an early stage and we have very good relations with the US Administration. There are blockages elsewhere in the political processes of the United States and we all have to work earnestly to ensure that those blockages are removed. This will be an important part of our and, indeed, NATO&#039;s defence capability.
</p>





<p><a name="st_12"><a name="50704-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Michael Jack  (Fylde)</b> 
 (Con): Subject to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) being resolved, does the Minister agree that his own Department&#039;s RAND Europe study made a compelling case for Britain to have a final assembly and check-out unit for the joint strike fighter, together with a maintenance and repair unit located here? Will he confirm that, in any further investigations that his Department is making, BAE Systems Warton would be one of the key locations examined in a feasibility study?
</p>





<p><a name="st_13"><a name="50704-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 One thing that can be said with a finger of certainty is that, whenever this matter is raised, the right hon. Gentleman pops up to speak about it. He is right that we commissioned the RAND study, which has pointed out what needs to be done to move the agenda forward in respect of establishing maintenance, repair and upgrade facilities in the UK. The review on how best to develop that is under way and we hope to conclude by September 2005. It would be wrong to be too predictive 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 5</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>about what will come out of it. No doubt when the subject comes up again, the right hon. Gentleman will be there pushing the case for BAE Systems.
</p>





<p><a name="st_14"><a name="50704-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. James Arbuthnot  (North-East Hampshire)</b> 
 (Con): Would the Minister describe the technology transfer relating to the joint strike fighter as disappointing?
</p>





<p><a name="st_15"><a name="50704-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 There are Government discussions about it, and I have already answered the question twice earlier. We are at an early stage in the discussions and I have expressed my views about some of the blockages, particularly the protectionist tendencies of some politicians in the US, but it sometimes applies to the UK as well. We all have to work earnestly to ensure that those who are putting pressure on the Administration understand the importance of ensuring that this platform is delivered on time so that we can maintain the facility and use it for our own needs, which will also help to support NATO objectives. These are big issues and it is not right to put on the record the type of comment that the right hon. Gentleman elicits.

</p>


<p><a name="st_16"><a name="50704-02_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Defence  (John Reid): </b> 
 Decisions on any replacement of the United Kingdom&#039;s nuclear deterrent are likely to be necessary in the lifetime of the current Parliament, which will of course last some years. I have no doubt the issue will be raised whenever we discuss defence in this House.
</p>





<p><a name="st_17"><a name="50704-02_spnew0"><b> Michael Gove: </b> 
 Can the Secretary of State assure me that he will no longer appease the hard-left sentiments of the unilateralist disarmers who are sadly so numerous on Labour&#039;s Back Benches? Will he end prevarication on this question and give us a firm commitment that the nuclear deterrent will be modernised urgently in the interests of the defence of this country?
</p>





<p><a name="st_18"><a name="50704-02_spnew1"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 I can certainly say to the hon. Gentleman, who is relatively new to the House, that I have never appeased nor will I appease those who call, in today&#039;s circumstances, for unilateral nuclear disarmament, such as the former Conservative Secretary of State for Defence, Mr. Michael Portillo, who did so several weeks ago. Nor will the hon. Gentleman find me, unlike colleagues of his on the Front Bench, co-authoring articles in <i>The Guardian</i> with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.
</p>





<p><a name="st_19"><a name="50704-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mullin: </b> 
 All I am looking for is a little transparency. With respect to my right hon. Friend and, indeed, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, with whom I raised this subject the other day, official pronouncements on the subject so far have been 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 6</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>remarkably vague. May we know when the decision has to be taken and, in due course, what the cost is likely to be and, perhaps, what the purpose of a new generation of nuclear weapons will be? Is my right hon. Friend in a position to assist with inquiries? If he is not, who is?
</p>





<p><a name="st_20"><a name="50704-02_spnew3"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 As they would say in Glasgow, &quot;Ah&#039;m yer man&quot; when it comes to assisting my hon. Friend. I have been pretty transparent. First, we pledged no longer than two months ago in our manifesto&#151;to which my hon. Friend was as committed as I was, as far as I am aware&#151;that we would retain the minimum nuclear deterrent, so that is our position. Secondly, the minimum nuclear deterrent that we have at the moment will last us between 10 and 20 years. Thirdly, as far as the situation beyond that is concerned, I have said to my hon. Friend that we have not started even considering, far less taking decisions on, the details of that. That is why I cannot give him costs for the various alternatives. That is as straight as I can make it. It also has the benefit of being honest, even though it may not satisfy my hon. Friend.
</p>





<p><a name="st_21"><a name="50704-02_spnew4"><b> Adam Price  (Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr)</b> 
 (PC): More than 50 years ago, a Tory Government made a unilateral announcement that the UK would no longer develop offensive biological and chemical weapons. Would not a similar announcement that there would be no successor to Trident make a positive contribution to the global process of eliminating those weapons of mass destruction?
</p>





<p><a name="st_22"><a name="50704-02_spnew5"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 Well, we are talking about events 10 to 20 years away. Although the hon. Gentleman may think that making such decisions arbitrarily is a good method&#151;
</p>

</p>





<p><a name="st_24"><a name="50704-02_spnew7"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 I see the hon. Gentleman nods, but at this very moment his party is discussing whether to join NATO, which would of course mean joining the nuclear club. What is sauce for the goose has to be sauce for the gander. The House should consider the matter carefully, rather than taking any arbitrary decisions. If the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price) can tell us off the top of his head what the situation will be in 10 to 20 years&#039; time, we would all greatly benefit from that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_25"><a name="50704-02_spnew8"><b> Mr. Robin Cook  (Livingston)</b> 
 (Lab): Can my right hon. Friend say whether, in the event that he intends not only to retain the deterrent but to replace it, he would expect the defence budget to be increased? If he does not expect that budget increase, would it not be entirely rational to decide that it might be wiser to husband his budget for the peacekeeping and stability missions that the British forces do so well and which, as I can testify, greatly enhance Britain&#039;s standing in the world?
</p>





<p><a name="st_26"><a name="50704-02_spnew9"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 If my right hon. Friend will allow me, I would rather study the options and their implications before drawing conclusions from any of those options, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 7</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>whether on the basis of cost or anything else. When we consider the dynamics of change over the last six years, we find, in terms of our nuclear deterrent, that on the one hand we have reduced to a single form of nuclear deterrence&#151;the only nation to do so; we have abolished the WE177 freefall bomb, detargeted our missiles and reduced the number of warheads and the number of boats we have at sea. On the other hand, since then, we have discovered that North Korea, Pakistan, India and, formerly, Libya were in the process of developing programmes, and there may have been aims in Iraq, too. The situation is constantly fluid and it behoves all of us to give the matter serious and prolonged consideration rather than pre-empting or prejudging it, or making arbitrary decisions on something so important.
</p>

 (Con): As the co-author of the article to which the Secretary of State referred, may I advise him and the House that it is a sorry state of affairs when a former head of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and a former leading opponent of CND have to get together to write such an article to try to persuade the Government to let the debate begin? Our key question to the Secretary of State is not will he keep Trident until the end of its useful life, but will he continue to possess nuclear weapons as long as other countries have them? When the people of Britain are asked, two thirds say yes, we should, and one quarter say no, we should not. Hardly anyone is undecided. Why is the Secretary of State undecided?
</p>





<p><a name="st_28"><a name="50704-02_spnew11"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 I am decided and I have told the hon. Gentleman what I have decided. Unfortunately, I am in government and he is not&#151;that is really the source of frustration. However, I am glad that he raised the matter, because when we consider what could possibly bring CND and Conservative Front Benchers together on defence&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Debate.&quot;] It is not a matter of debate. We have debated it at every Question Time; every time we have a debate on defence we debate the issue, so it cannot be lack of debate that brought them together. The fact is that it has nothing to do with a serious decision about our strategic needs, whether nuclear or otherwise, but that CND and Conservative Front Benchers want to discomfit the Government. Well, they can continue debating, but I am afraid that they do not discomfit me in the least.

</p>





<p><a name="st_30"><a name="50704-02_spnew13"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 The answer to the first question is that I discern those views by listening, although listening does not necessarily mean that I accept them; it depends on the rationale and logic of what is put to me. As regards debate, I find myself in the peculiar position where I am attacked from both sides of the House for not debating the issue and by my hon. Friend for endless debate on it.

 The UK continues to play a significant role in seeking to improve conditions in Darfur, through complementary NATO and EU aid to the African Union&#039;s observer mission.

 I thank the Secretary of State for that reply, although he did not actually answer my question. After the Live 8 events, on which I am sure that the whole House will congratulate Bob Geldof and his team, the world&#039;s attention is focused on Africa, nowhere more so than in Sudan where ethnic cleansing and genocide have led to thousands upon thousands of deaths. So, are the Government satisfied that sending a total of 17 soldiers and officers, 15 under a NATO flag and two under a rival EU flag, is really doing enough in what the UN described as the worst humanitarian crisis in the world at present?
</p>





<p><a name="st_33"><a name="50704-02_spnew15"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right; the matter is important. These are tragic circumstances, in which, perhaps, the response of the world community as a whole has been belated&#151;as it was in certain other cases. Having said that, if we are to contribute&#151;however much and through whichever mechanism&#151;I think that the hon. Gentleman will accept, as do both the EU and NATO, that there must be a lead from the African Union, so we are responding to the request of the African Union. I leave aside the fact that currently our service personnel are in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Afghanistan and other places. We are actually responding to what the African Union wanted, which is logistical support.

 (Lab/Co-op): Would my right hon. Friend care to give an opinion? He may not have seen last night&#039;s &quot;Panorama&quot; programme, which gave a further response to the tragedy in Darfur. It is clear that the AU is doing invaluable work&#151;it is a real test for the AU&#151;but what the AU needs more than anything on the ground is logistical support, which can come only from developed countries, such as the UK. So I hear what he has to say, but will he go back and talk to his NATO colleagues and, indeed, those in the EU to find out what additional support can be brought to bear to ensure that the AU is as effective as possible on the ground?
</p>





<p><a name="st_35"><a name="50704-02_spnew17"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 Absolutely. I do not think that there is any difference of intent between my hon. Friend and me. Indeed, it was precisely at the request of the chair of the African Union to both the EU and NATO that I contributed to the discussions in the EU on 23 May and NATO, I think, on 9 June. Both institutions have concentrated on heavy-lift capacity, which is supported by ourselves and many others in NATO and Europe, to take in the extra 7,000 soldiers whom we hope will be supplied by the African Union. That is precisely what we

We certainly believe that there should be more urgency in the international community&#039;s efforts to find a peaceful solution, but we welcome the Government&#039;s contributions so far. Will the Secretary of State confirm how much of assistance pledged to the African Union by the Secretary of State for International Development in his written statement on 13 June has now been provided? Given the widespread fears about the scale of the crimes against humanity in Darfur, does he believe that the 7,700 troops committed by the African Union are sufficient for the task in hand? If the force is to be extended, will the United Kingdom and its NATO and EU partners be able to supplement the logistical and technical support offered so far?

The answer to the third question is that we will give whatever help we can. Although that has been diminished to 17 personnel&#151;to paraphrase the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)&#151;the UK has, in fact, already provided significant logistical assistance, including approximately 600 vehicles, rapid deployment equipment, air-lift for Nigerian soldiers and technical military advice. On 13 June, we announced an increase in our contribution of &#163;19 million, bringing our contribution to &#163;32 million, on top of everything that the Department for International Development has given on this matter. So we have already made a significant contribution, and we will continue to do so, because the situation is tragic.

Although there have been no formal contacts, there have been informal ones and, indeed, informal meetings, and both the Secretary-General of NATO and the High Representative of the EU have worked very closely. That is to the benefit of the African Union and the people in the area itself, which is as it should be. We have never believed that the European Union security and defence policy and NATO should be contradictory and competitive. One of the principles that I made absolutely plain to both those institutions is that they should work in partnership, in complementing and dovetailing with each other, and they have done so on this occasion to a far greater extent than ever before.

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 16</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>170,000 Iraqi security forces&#151;about 5,000 to 10,000 more than was the case at the previous Defence questions&#151;are now sufficiently trained gradually to take the lead in counter-terrorism. That will not be done overnight, but it is important that the House distinguishes between two propositions. First, as was made plain by Secretary Rumsfeld recently&#151;I have discussed this matter with him&#151;it may be a considerable time before terrorism is defeated in Iraq. Secondly, it may be a much shorter time before the Iraqis themselves can take the lead in combating that terrorism. The time scale that Mr. Rumsfeld envisaged is not necessarily the time scale during which our troops would have to be in Iraq, and I look forward in the next year to the Iraqis beginning to take over the lead role in counter-terrorism in some of the 18 provinces of Iraq.

 In those terms, we often speak&#151;rightly&#151;about staying there until the job is done. Could the Secretary of State define more precisely on what basis the judgment will be made as to when the job is done? Is he talking about the job in the whole of Iraq or just in our area of MND (South-East)? If it is the latter, does that mean that once the job in our area is done, whatever is happening elsewhere in Iraq, our troops can come home?
</p>





<p><a name="st_75"><a name="50704-04_spnew11"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 The right hon. and learned Gentleman asks an important question. May I explain the context? There are 18 provinces in Iraq. Despite the fact that we hear constantly about widespread terrorism, more than half of those terrorist attacks are taking place in four provinces. There are another two provinces in which some attacks take place. By and large, about 12 of the provinces are relatively free of terrorist attacks. As the Iraqi forces become trained to take the lead, it is possible, over a period of time, to hand the lead role to Iraqi forces in certain areas of the country and gradually, we hope, over the whole country. For a period in all these areas they will require some support and back-up from the Multi-National Division. If that day came in our area, we have not decided and do not have any plans for operating outside MND (South-East), but it is impossible to make those decisions before we get to that stage.

<p>
<a name="50704-04_para3">
<a name="stpa_6">The other point&#151;at the risk of going on too long, Mr.   Speaker&#151;is that we hope that that security development will be simultaneous with the development of political democratic control through the constitution, then the referendum, a new election and a fully democratic Government by the end of this year.

 There is no easy answer to that. It does not matter where peacemaking/peacekeeping is taking place. The moment that the non-governmental organisations are closely engaged with the developments of enhancing the stabilisation of any country in terms of reconstruction or whatever else, there must be a measure of guarantee for them, but they do take risks. Tragically, lives have been lost among NGOs and civilians, and we pay tribute to them. They are brave people. There is no simple solution. Overall we must ensure, as best we can, that the environment within which they work is stable and that, in the case of Afghanistan, the Afghan national army has primacy and there is a civil power to deal with it and to

That this House notes with concern the increasing burden of local taxation; awaits the outcome of the Lyons Inquiry but rejects the proposals for a local income tax; asserts that a local income tax would entail higher taxation on hard-working families and crippling compliance costs on local businesses and would undermine the incentive to work; believes that council tax must be reformed, with the introduction of an automatic discount for pensioners and other measures, but rejects proposals to move from a local services tax based on fixed property bands to a wealth tax; calls on the Government to reject the Mayor of London&#039;s proposals for a regional income tax in London and to cancel its plans for a council tax revaluation and higher bands in England, which would be a further stealth tax, particularly on those living on fixed incomes.
<br>



<p><a name="st_6">We sought this debate on local government taxation because the subject of council tax and local government finance was notable by its absence from the post-general election Queen&#039;s Speech, although it is anticipated that the Government will take measures to reform local government finance in this Parliament. We seem to have been waiting interminably for the outcome of the Government&#039;s review of local government finance, and while the issue of council tax burns the Government continue to fiddle&#151;in this case, the figures.</p>





<p><a name="st_7">It is the moment when people write their cheques for the council tax that they associate most directly with the   role of local government. However, that is an increasingly misguided association, because since 1997 the Government have riven apart the connection between council tax and the provision of local services. It is certainly not the case that the cost of local services is met by local taxpayers; now, local taxpayers merely top up the Chancellor&#039;s coffers. From the Chancellor&#039;s point of view it makes perfect sense&#151;by turning local authorities into tax collectors, he hopes to escape the blame for a whopping 76 per cent. increase in council tax.</p>





<p><a name="st_8">However, the electorate are increasingly sophisticated. According to MORI, 78 per cent. of the population blame national Government for council tax increases&#151;and they are right. Furthermore, they know that the figures are being fiddled. The Government have systematically engineered the redirection of central funding from efficient, Conservative-run councils to inefficient Labour-run councils.</p>





<p><a name="st_9">At the same time, the Government have set about loading unfunded cost burdens on local authorities and transferring costs and duties from national Government to local government. I call that stealth taxation by statute. The net effect is that receipts to the Treasury from council tax have increased by more than &#163;9 billion since 1997. Without doubt, council tax has been used as the ultimate stealth tax. While pensioners protest on the streets, the Chancellor is coining it.</p>

Why are they manipulating the funding formulas and pushing ahead with the ugly twin sisters of revaluation and rebanding? Is it because the cost of providing local services has gone up disproportionately? Is it because people are using a lot more locally provided services?

But council tax is not a wealth tax; it is a local services tax that is partly based on property to reflect the fact that larger properties typically make slightly greater use of public services. The swingeing increases that we are now seeing have hurt some of the poorest people, and that is what is so unjust.

Soaring council tax bills not only present problems for people in terms of meeting the cost; a series of contingent problems arise from the way in which the system has been abused.

<a name="stpa_10">What local income tax has in its favour is that it is easy to market, but it is often the case that the devil is in the detail. The campaign pitch is simple enough&#151;the amount of tax that one pays locally is determined by one&#039;s level of income. But I think that the Liberal Democrats should be had up by the Advertising Standards Authority for their slogan, &quot;Axe the Tax&quot;. The Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman&#151;the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)&#151;himself admitted that two full-time earners in a house would pay more tax, and said that the tax would bite when a combined salary was between &#163;30,000 and &#163;40,000 a year. A pensioner with savings or investments would be taxed on them. It is therefore rather disingenuous to suggest, as the Liberal Democrats have, that local income tax is a panacea for pensioners. It certainly is not.

 The biggest pressure on councils such as Shrewsbury is caused by the Labour Government&#039;s targets for affordable housing. They must provide 500 affordable housing units in the foreseeable future. Yet in 2003, they took away Shrewsbury&#039;s local authority social housing grant. That has placed a tremendous financial burden on my council, which must provide for a target set by the Government.

<p><a name="st_34"><a name="50704-07_spnew9"><b> Mrs. Spelman: </b>

<a name="stpa_11">The local income tax would also ratchet up bills for hard-working families, especially those with dual incomes. A typical working family in England would pay an extra &#163;692 a year, an increase of two thirds. Not only would the tax apply to people who have hitherto been exempt from council tax; students with part-time jobs are a particularly striking example of people who could ill afford being heavily taxed under the Liberal Democrats.

 So that the hon. Lady does not keep repeating things that are not true, I should tell her that every member of our party stood on the basis of abolishing the council tax and agreed with that, and every member of our party stood on the basis of replacing it with a local income tax, and agreed with that as well. Yes, there were criticisms of some of the presentation&#151;I criticised it myself&#151;but the substance is clear. The policy of the hon. Lady&#039;s party is &quot;Council tax: we want to keep it&quot;. We had a clear alternative, although we can argue about whether it was right. The hon. Lady never had one.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 28</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>hard-working families would lose out and young people, typically sharing accommodation, would certainly lose out. As for the councils that would have to administer the tax, their ability to plan would be hampered in the medium term because revenue derived from income is by nature less predictable than revenue derived from house values.

<a name="50704-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_12">Councils would also become slaves to Whitehall funding. The tax would necessitate more equalisation. A local income tax offers limited redistribution of the tax burden, but disregards the feelings of many pensioners who instinctively dislike the idea of their tax liability being transferred to their children and grandchildren. As I said earlier, pensioners are proud people and are prepared to pay their way. It stands to reason that they would be distinctly uneasy about their families picking up the bill for them. Let us take a practical example. A typical working family in Cheadle would see their average tax bill rocket by over &#163;1,000 under the Liberal Democrats&#039; income tax.

Local government is at the heart of national life and it has a unique role in championing the communities that we live in and helping them to prosper. The four pillars of local area agreements for local authorities over the next two years cover enterprise and economic development, safer and stronger communities, healthier communities and older people and children and young people. They provide a clear and sensible way of thinking about the arithmetic of local government.

<a name="stpa_23">In 2004&#150;05, local government in England spent &#163;127 billion&#151;a quarter of all public expenditure. The largest share, at 37 per cent., goes on education. Social services spending represents a further 18 per cent. and the police another 11 per cent. Those three services make up 65 per cent. of the total net current local government expenditure. Of that share, 65 per cent. goes on the pay of teachers, police, fire fighters and other local government workers. The share of spending on staffing costs varies, from transport, where it is relatively low, to education, where it is quite high.

The pressures do not follow the business cycle as central Government spending did in the 1980s, but instead reflect real need in areas such as social services, where an ageing population, higher dependency costs and increases in areas such as care home fees are placing pressures on local authority budgets.

Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen), may I cite the fact that local authorities in Germany and Austria get respectively 15 and 18 per cent. of the total national tax take, and they get it from central Government?

</p>





<p><a name="st_67"><a name="50704-10_spnew1"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. Of course, there is a big difference between local taxes and assigned national taxes, and the degree of thrall differs according to those two measures. Before hon. Members become too focused on the idea that, somehow, those in local government are lying inert on the floor underneath the weight of central Government, they should go to any town or city in the country and they will see a lot of dynamism, with those in local government exploiting quite a lot of freedom in performing their roles. I am sure that every hon.

 The balance of funding review concluded that there was a strong case for more money to be raised locally.

Gentleman in all seriousness that that is not just about power for the town hall; it must be about moving power from the town hall to the citizens as well. In that sense, this is not just a devolution deal between local and central Government&#151;it must engage people beyond the town hall. That is important.

 I should like to bring the Minister back to the take-up of council tax benefits, which he skirted over.

What will the Government do about that, rather than just stating an aspiration that take-up will increase?
</p>





<p><a name="st_75"><a name="50704-10_spnew9"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 I agree that take-up is an issue. I will write to the hon. Gentleman, though, because he is somewhat mistaken about the number. My understanding is that the figure is actually 53 per cent., but I will check that for him. However, neither 53 per cent. nor 33 per cent. is anything to be proud of. Take-up is certainly an issue to be considered, but it is not just a matter of publicity, however important that is, and a range of other issues is associated with it. It is certainly something that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is considering because it is a long-term issue.

<a name="stpa_33">The Government are determined to balance the commitments to spending on front-line services, a strong efficiency drive and a prudent council tax policy as part of a balanced package to support local government. The balance of funding review, which reported last July and included senior figures from central and local government, the academic world, business and professional bodies, found a strong case for shifting the balance towards more local funding. But that case depended on the feasibility and desirability of any measures to achieve it. It concluded that a variable local income tax might increase local accountability, but that a more complex funding system might be harder for taxpayers to understand, and there were potentially serious risks and disadvantages that would need to be considered in great detail, including the additional costs and burdens that the system would impose and the complexities of administration. That is notwithstanding the further point that, for dual-earner households, a local income tax presents, by any stretch of the imagination, a significant tax rise. Opposition Members must explain that.

The leaflets circulated in Cheadle claim that in some areas of Bramhall people would pay much more in local income tax, but, in fact, that would only be possible if they earned well over &#163;80,000 a year. I would be interested to know the workings behind that calculation. I am sure that people on the North Park Road estate would be interested to know that the hon.

 The Liberal Democrats&#039; own &quot;Axe the Tax&quot; website gave a figure between &#163;30,000 and &#163;40,000. The hon.

 The figures in the Conservative leaflets in Cheadle claim that people would supposedly pay much more in local income tax, but I must point out that that is only possible on an income of more than &#163;80,000. So that is a ridiculous claim.

<p>
<a name="50704-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_51">The average household income is only about &#163;23,000 a year, so figures given by the Conservative spokesmen completely misunderstand the earnings of ordinary families. Under a local income tax, about half the population would be better off, a quarter would be about the same, and a quarter would pay more. We have been upfront about that, and the hon. Member for Meriden, the Minister and I would all pay more. That is perfectly fair. Pensioners in Cheadle, however, would do extremely well. Only 4 per cent. of pensioners nationally would pay more. Many pensioners would do considerably better than they do at the moment, and about 6 million of them would not pay anything at all.

 It is fascinating to watch the spat between the Liberal Democrat and Conservative Front Benchers. The hon. Lady made a strong point about wanting to return to localism in local government finance. However, is there not a difficulty, as for many decades a fundamental principle of local government finance has been redistribution from the richer part of the country to poorer areas? Is that not equally important, and is there not a danger that in her ideological obsession with localism she may lose support for poorer areas of the country?

<a name="stpa_52">A local income tax would be much cheaper to collect&#151;around &#163;340 million a year.

The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy looked at compliance costs on businesses after it gave evidence to the Government&#039;s balance of funding review, and said that it was quite possible to use the coding system, so no extra administrative burden would be imposed on employers. As for local income tax undermining the incentive to work, I suggest that the Conservatives tell that to people who are paying a 20 per cent. marginal tax rate as they struggle to return to work, who find that their council tax benefit is removed.

<a name="stpa_53">The Conservatives do not have an answer to the council tax or to the balance of funding crisis.

That is hardly a surprise, because under Thatcher we experienced capping, the abolition of the Greater London Council and centralised business rates. The Government, however, are in no better position. They have already briefed their favourite journalists at <i>The Times</i> that they may not do anything at all about local government finance. They have an historic opportunity to do away with an unfair and unpopular tax that has been hanging around their neck since they replaced the Conservative Government. They have an opportunity to shake up radically local government finance, to localise business rates and give them back to local authorities, to get rid of ring-fencing and passporting, and to introduce a tax system that would allow us to raise far more of the money locally. Will they do it? I doubt it, because new localism is meaningless. I await a further review.

Had her claim been correct, one would expect the proportion raised from local taxes&#151;the money that the Chancellor is allegedly trying to get local people to raise as a form of stealth tax&#151;to rise and the amount coming from central Government to fall. The hon. Lady would find that the opposite is the truth.

 My hon. Friend makes a valid point. If it is accepted that more power should be returned to a local level, that goes along with the idea that funding for local decisions should be made locally, to a greater extent. Decisions on that funding, and the extent of that funding, must be made locally. There are no proposals from Conservatives to raise the amount of money that is raised locally through council tax. Indeed, the opposite is the case, given what they say about how their various giveaways should be funded. They wish to see the proportion of money that comes from the centre increased. At the same time, they say, having examined the charts erroneously, that the sums that the Government are making local people pay through local tax are increasing.

They will also be shocked to know that other grants to local government in a devolved Administration in that non-priority group were listed to increase over a three-year period by only 1 per cent.

<a name="stpa_59">We need to consider some aspects of council tax, including, as the Liberal Democrat amendment suggests, the way in which local government taxation is geared. The gearing effect shows that decisions on local government taxation automatically inflate in terms of the council tax-raising decision and the budget-making decision that precedes it. However, the Liberal Democrats have failed to see the central point. Indeed, the hon. Lady&#039;s predecessor, who was in the Siberian power station position of defending Liberal Democrat local income tax proposals, said that under his policy he would have to put &#163;1.7 billion into the pot to keep local income tax rises at 3.5 per cent. for the first year. He was, I accept, very honest when he said that that amount had gone up from &#163;1.7 billion to &#163;2.4 billion&#151;again, money from central Government resources. Local income tax completely fails to deal with the gearing problem in local government taxation.

 The hon.

The whole basis of the local income tax proposals&#151;as currently presented, for all I know, in the Cheadle by-election&#151;is that rises are kept down to about 3.5 per cent. a year, which can be done only by smoke and mirrors.

However, it requires several changes that reflect how taxation can be affordable, how the gearing process works, how the business community relates to local government in terms of paying for it, and how the palette of taxes might be broadened in order to make that whole burden bearable.

They would have to apply through the employers to the tax office to find out those residents&#039; incomes. It is no good the Liberal Democrats claiming that it can be done through the tax code; it cannot. The tax code gives information only about a person&#039;s allowances, not a person&#039;s income. Unless the local authority knew the income of each tax-paying individual in the local district, it could not calculate the product of a local income tax. It would be flying in the dark.

 There we are. We revert to the point that the tax would be nationally based and subsequently redistributed. It would be a central tax. The hon. Gentleman is right that that is exactly what happens in Germany, where a national tax is distributed to local authorities. That gets rid of the independence of the local authority.

Gentleman would happily confirm; and the joint nature of the tax means that central Government are involved in setting the base and the rate of tax,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;thus lessening the autonomy of the local authority&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_68">And, as I pointed out earlier, the system in Germany involves a percentage of central income tax being handed out. The same applies in Austria. Moreover, Scandinavia, about which the hon. Gentleman is so enthusiastic, does not have a graduated system; it has a proportional system that is extremely regressive. Is that really what he wants to introduce in the United Kingdom? Perhaps it is. If so, we are glad that we are being told that that is what the Liberal Democrats want.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-14_para8">
<a name="stpa_69">We could, however, refine the existing system in the ways that my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) has outlined. I would go a little further. One of the inequities of the present council tax system is that it does not take sufficient account of the composition of a household. It makes some recognition of it, but there are many households, in my constituency and everywhere else, with a large number of people of working age who do not effectively make an adequate contribution to local taxation. Yet there are others with a single person or a pensioner couple that are effectively paying more than their fair share for the services that are provided. If we are to reform the council tax system, I suggest that we adjust the council tax more adequately to reflect the composition of households. That would not be difficult; the necessary information is available from the census data or through voter registration details. It could therefore easily be done, and it would create a much fairer system than the complete dog&#039;s breakfast proposed by the Liberal Democrats.

Unfortunately, he spoiled the good effect by veering in the last minute of his speech into a return to the poll tax. It is one of the extraordinary features of today&#039;s Conservative party that it remains absolutely wedded to the belief that if it could get itself back to where it was in the 1980s, all would be well. Political parties that are obsessed with the past rarely command the confidence of the public. Thinking that it can find a solution to local government finance by going back to the kind of principles that generated the poll tax seems to be a delusion that is sadly typical of today&#039;s Conservative party.

 I fear that the right hon. Gentleman does me an injustice. I was opposed to the poll tax when it was introduced, and I proposed an adjusted rating assessment, because the big attraction of the rating assessment, and the council tax, is that it is collected simply from the head of household. All that I was suggesting is that council tax ought to take household occupation into account more than at present.
</p>





<p><a name="st_158"><a name="50704-15_spnew1"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, and I will not pursue that, as there are points of principle that I do wish to pursue. Any attempt to move back towards a flat rate tax related to the numbers of people living in a household would be a profound mistake, as the country rightly and overwhelmingly rejected the whole ethos of the poll tax that characterised the Conservative party in the 1980s and early 1990s.
</p>

<a name="50704-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_70">One of the curious features of today&#039;s debate is the extent to which the two Opposition parties have been vying with each other, on which other contributors have commented. It is strange that they should attach more importance to the short-term interests of the Cheadle by-election than to the long-term interests of developing a credible system of local government finance for this country, which is what we need. Let me consider some of the serious weaknesses in both their positions before concluding with a few thoughts about what should guide the way forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_71">The Conservatives have been advancing the extraordinary proposition that one can have a system of taxation based on property values without the need for    revaluation. The hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs.    Spelman) recognised, I think, that that is completely untenable. She then proceeded to say that they were not totally opposed to revaluation, although the motion in her name and that of the Leader of the Opposition talks about cancelling plans for a council tax revaluation, which indicates pretty clearly that they are opposed to revaluation. She acknowledged, however, that there was a need to take some account of values, but advanced the preposterous suggestion that because of some degree of convergence between property values in different parts of the country, there would currently be no need for a revaluation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_159"><a name="50704-15_spnew2"><b> Mrs. Spelman: </b> 
 I explained that according to the Halifax building society there is a clear convergence. Given the argument that the right hon. Gentleman is promoting, however, how does he explain the situation 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 51</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that pertains in Northern Ireland, which still has the rates system but has values based on 1975? That does not seem to present a problem in Northern Ireland.
</p>





<p><a name="st_160"><a name="50704-15_spnew3"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 It is completely non-tenable, for reasons that I shall outline, to have a values system based on historic values without any revaluation. Let me tell the hon. Lady why.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_72">First, there is the nonsense of new properties being built where a notional value must be imputed as to what that property might have been worth 15 years ago. That is difficult enough if one is building a property in a developed area, but in an area which was previously entirely undeveloped, it is a completely ludicrous process. Secondly, when properties change hands and new values are applied, unfairness will inevitably be created. Two identical properties next to each other will have different valuations, purely as a result of a change of ownership in the intervening period, which is absolutely intellectually incoherent. Thirdly, the whole system is increasingly out of date, because it is based on values created 15 years ago. For all those reasons, it is intellectually and economically illiterate to suggest that one can have a system of council tax without the need for periodic revaluation. That is why we introduced arrangements for a regular 10-yearly revaluation. The Conservatives made much fun of the Liberal Democrats for voting in favour of revaluation during the Committee stage of the Bill that became the Local Government Act 2003. The Liberal Democrats said that they did not vote for it on Third Reading. They do not seem to know where they stand.
</p>





<p><a name="st_161"><a name="50704-15_spnew4"><b> Mr. Davey: </b> 
 It is nice to see the right hon. Gentleman on the Back Benches, although we enjoyed his performances on the Front Bench.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_73">There was not a single vote on revaluation in Committee. The only amendment was tabled by the Conservative spokesman, the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), who proposed five-yearly revaluations. There was no vote on revaluation on the Floor of the House. The only votes in the House took place on Second and Third Reading.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_74">As the right hon. Gentleman knows, there was much in the Bill for which we had campaigned for many years. We did not support revaluation, but we supported many good things such as prudential capital borrowing.
</p>





<p><a name="st_162"><a name="50704-15_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Order. That intervention was far too long.
</p>





<p><a name="st_163"><a name="50704-15_spnew5"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The truth of the matter is that both Opposition parties are up a gum tree. One argues against revaluation now, but in Committee argued for five-yearly revaluations; the other adopted the view in Committee that revaluation was sensible, but now, because it is embarrassed about that, says that on Third Reading it did not vote for it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_75">This is nonsense, and the motive behind it is the revealing factor. Both parties are positioning themselves in the short term so that they can attack and criticise the revaluation when it happens without being in any way to blame. That is the position of the politically&#151;let me 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 52</b>

</p>





<p><a name="st_164"><a name="50704-15_spnew6"><b> Mr. Pickles: </b> 
 Speaking of the politically unprincipled, one of the things that have consoled us since the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s removal to the Back Benches is the number of articles that he has been writing on local government finance. Next to those articles have appeared news items from the Government suggesting that they are going wobbly on revaluation, rebanding and the whole process of local government finance. Are they being opportunist?
</p>





<p><a name="st_165"><a name="50704-15_spnew7"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman is reading my articles in the &quot;Municipal Journal&quot; and other organs. I am sure that he agrees with much of what he reads, because he has some experience of local government. Despite his present difficulty, caused by the position that his party is temporarily adopting for expedient short-term reasons, I think he will understand that this is the party that is currently pursuing a credible policy to try and create a long-term, viable system of local government finance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-15_para6">
<a name="stpa_76">Let us now consider the Liberal Democrats&#039; local income tax. Carried away by its vacuous slogan &quot;Axe the tax&quot;, the party came to believe that this was the panacea and the miracle for them, but I am afraid that the rhetoric concealed all the defects of the local income tax. It is administratively complex, as the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill) pointed out.
</p>





<p><a name="st_166"><a name="50704-15_spnew8"><b> David Howarth: </b>

 No. My time is limited, and I have already given way to a member of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-15_para7">
<a name="stpa_77">The local income tax system would be inherently complex, with 400 authorities setting different rates. It becomes even more complex when we take account of the fact that people move, unlike properties, because that means that there must be an arrangement for apportionment between areas. There would be huge additional pressures on employers, who would have to cope with the new coding arrangements. All that leaves considerable scope for evasion. The council tax is relatively easy to collect, and is difficult to avoid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-15_para8">
<a name="stpa_78">The second problem with the local income tax is its unpredictability. That does not apply to the council tax. Local authorities could find that following the closure of an important factory, there was a dramatic fall in their revenue in the short term and no means of covering it. That is clearly a serious weakness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-15_para9">
<a name="stpa_79">Thirdly, the local income tax is inherently unfair. If the Liberal Democrat proposals exempt those who do not contribute through the PAYE system, they are essentially exempting several hundred thousand of the richest people in the country, who are living on investment income and dividends, from making any contribution to local taxation. That is a scandal. Coming from a party that talks of fairness, it is one of the most ridiculous and absurd propositions that could be advanced.

<p>
<a name="50704-15_para10">
<a name="stpa_80">So the positions adopted by the Liberal Democrats and by the Conservatives are untenable. By way of contrast, the Government have rightly set up the Lyons inquiry, entrusting this work to Sir Michael Lyons, who is one of the foremost experts in the country in this field. He is widely respected and is giving careful and thorough attention to the various issues. I am confident that he will produce a credible package of proposals, in line with the brief that he was given, as outlined by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Communities and Local Government. It is important that we await Sir Michael&#039;s findings before jumping to conclusions or advocating a particular course of action. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Meriden is nodding; I counsel her to await Sir Michael&#039;s report and recommendations before jumping to any conclusions about revaluation. She will recognise that in a taxation system based on values, there will be a need for regular revaluations. I am afraid that the motion tabled in her name would have to be withdrawn or amended in the light of those recommendations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-15_para11">
<a name="stpa_81">Sir Michael&#039;s work and the preceding work of the balance of funding review, which I am proud to be associated with, give us an historic opportunity to establish a long-term framework for local government finance that provides greater certainty and greater devolution to local authorities&#151;so that they can take decisions and raise money themselves&#151;but which also recognises the importance of an equalisation framework in ensuring no undue disparities between areas, and gives incentives for high performance and the delivery of high-quality services. That should be our aim and objective&#151;local government empowered to serve communities in the most effective way, with a sustainable long-term finance system that is not the subject of short-term political squabbling among parties. I hope that Sir Michael will be allowed the freedom to produce his proposals, and that the Government will then introduce sensible proposals for reform, based on his propositions.

 It is a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford), to whom I shall refer later on, if I may. I do not usually begin a speech by disagreeing with my own Front Benchers, and I do not   intend to do so today. However, I should point out   to my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman)&#151;she is no longer in her place&#151;who said that 76 per cent. of people blame the national Government for the level of local taxation, that although that is doubtless true nationally, on the Isle of Wight it is not. There, it is the Liberal Democrats who are blamed for the level of local taxation. The people of the Isle of Wight understand that if one spends more, one has to tax more. The Liberal Democrats do not seem to have understood that point in proposing their panacea of local income tax as an alternative to council tax.

In other words, it has very few people who could afford to pay the level of tax that translating from the Isle of Wight&#039;s council tax to a local income tax would involve. As a result, the rate of tax would have to be pushed up. Nothing that I have heard so far from the Liberal Democrats during this debate has explained how they intend to help people in areas of relatively low income.

<p><a name="st_169"><a name="50704-16_spnew1"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that those of his constituents and mine who are on average earnings would pay more under a local income tax scheme?

Alas, that evidence has been removed from the website, as it had become an embarrassment to the party.
</p>





<p><a name="st_170"><a name="50704-16_spnew2"><b> Mr. Turner: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is, of course, absolutely right that they would have to pay more: the lower the average income in the constituency, the higher the rate at which local income tax would have to be levied. I have to say that I did not spend much time during the general election looking at the Liberal Democrat website. I have much better things to do, but perhaps we are about to hear an explanation now.

<p><a name="st_171"><a name="50704-16_spnew3"><b> David Howarth: </b> 
 It is no part of the Liberal Democrat proposals that we remove all equalisation between local authorities.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that clear. We are drawing out some interesting information from the Liberal Democrats.

Perhaps the Liberals would place on their website a list of the local authorities that do not need any equalisation. It would be interesting to voters in those councils to know that they are being targeted by the Liberal Democrats to make a bigger-than-before contribution to local tax.

<a name="stpa_83">The problem with local tax is, as I have said, that the more that is spent, the more that has to be raised. That is a fundamental fact that the Liberal Democrats will not accept. They will not accept that if a council spends more or wastes money, more has to be taken from the taxpayer. That is at the root of their troubles. That is why my local authority had to raise local taxation over the last four years by almost 50 per cent. I repeat that the Liberal Democrats raised taxes in the Isle of Wight by nearly 50 per cent.&#151;something that even the Chancellor of the Exchequer has not achieved. He managed to achieve a 60 per cent. increase over eight years, but the Liberal Democrats achieved a 50 per cent. increase over four years.

It was described as &quot;wholly ineffective&quot; by the Audit Commission, which also pointed out that ideas for change were simply &quot;not taken seriously&quot;. Because of the incompetence with which the Liberal Democrats administered the service, we were in danger of losing not only our fire control room, but entire control over the fire service from the island to the mainland.

However, that report came up with nothing about improving standards, only with a reorganisation. It produced nothing about standards; it was all about structures&#151;precisely the sort of thing that the Government criticise. It came up with a &#163;70 million reorganisation with no idea of where that money would come from.

It is a very popular place to visit, but three months before the local election, the Liberal Democrats dreamt up the idea of a tourist tax. They disguised it, of course, as Liberal Democrats often do, and called it a visiting vehicle tax. Whether people arrive by ferry or by air, most use a motor car to get around the island&#151;

 I assume that the Liberal Democrats want everyone who comes to the Isle of Wight to walk there on water and then live in a tent. When they calculated the effect of their tourist tax, they did not allow anything for collection. Eventually, they were forced to claim that the tax would be only about &#163;1 a tourist. How much would it cost to collect &#163;1 from every tourist, but not from those who live on the Isle of Wight? I would imagine that it would cost more than &#163;1 to collect that, so the poor benighted taxpayers of the Isle of Wight, had they been foolish enough&#151;thankfully, they were not&#151;to re-elect the Liberal Democrats to county hall, would have paid more to collect that tax than it would have raised.

<a name="stpa_90">The record of the Liberal Democrats on the Isle of Wight speaks for itself and it is reflected in Liberal Democrat councils up and down the country. For example, they sold a property for &#163;100,000 that was subsequently sold for &#163;1 million, a loss of &#163;900,000 to the taxpayers of the Isle of Wight. It was the Prince Consort in Ryde, in case anyone wishes to queue up for another property at such a price. They should bear in mind, however, that the new administration will take more care to sell things at their proper value. The Liberal Democrats also rented some office accommodation, called Enterprise house, for &#163;300,000 a year and then left it empty. They built a lay-by for &#163;250,000 and employed four chief executives in four years. They held a very successful pop festival, now in its third year, but they budgeted &#163;30,000 for it in the first year and spent &#163;380,000. They also tried to sell a property known as Northwood house, but they had to pay compensation to the prospective purchaser, because they discovered that they did not own the property after he had incurred considerable expenditure. That is the record of the Liberal Democrats in my constituency.

<a name="stpa_91">When the right hon.

In the event, the Government gave the council more money&#151;unlike most Conservative councils&#151;so I led an all-party delegation to meet the right hon. Gentleman. Out of his munificence, he took &#163;1 million from Hampshire and gave it to the Isle of Wight. The total benefit has been &#163;13 million over the past three years, but the reaction of the Liberal Democrats was not to increase council tax by only 11 per cent., but to increase it by 14 per cent.

<a name="stpa_93">For the Opposition to give an open-ended commitment, which would have to be met by the general taxpayer and central taxation, to support pensioners, whether well-off or not, is rash. Their sweeping commitment takes no account of the annually changing local government tax-raising level. The Chancellor of the Exchequer of course fully understands that position, which is why he has ensured that this year pensioners were protected from the excessive pressures put on them by council tax increases.

If additional payments to pensioners are to be made, the funding would have to be found from other taxpayers. Surely, it is better to work towards a fairer system of local taxation, so it is right that Sir Michael Lyons be given time before reporting to consider fully the implications of all the issues, such as rebanding, revaluation, council tax benefit, and how any changes will affect all groups in our society. He, too, understands that we cannot have a property-based tax without a revaluation process. Just about everyone understands that apart from Her Majesty&#039;s Opposition.

Have the Liberal Democrats considered the impact of those proposals, especially on the accounts departments of small and medium-sized businesses? Those businesses would have to cope with individual workers living in different local authority areas, all with different levels of tax, and who might, when they moved house, be required to have a complete reassessment of their tax position. That is a recipe for complexity, delay and error.

However, there are no Labour candidates standing in South Shropshire district council. Consequently, it is very hard for those who are interested in supporting the Government to do so in my constituency, I am very pleased to say.
</p>

<a name="stpa_101">We in the Ludlow constituency have a regrettably low average income. I will return to that in a moment, but it colours my remarks. Council tax is a severe burden on many people in my constituency&#151;obviously, especially for those on fixed incomes and pensioners, as other hon.

We have two district councils in the Ludlow constituency&#151;South Shropshire, which is dominated by the Liberal Democrats, and Bridgnorth, which is led by a Conservative and independent administration&#151;and I should like to share with hon. Members the contrasting approach to council tax of those two authorities.

<p>
<a name="50704-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_102">Eighteen months ago, the Liberal Democrats proposed a medium-term financial strategy, with a staggering 9.5 per cent. a year increase in council tax proposed for each of the following three years. They 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 59</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>were only prevented from introducing such a high increase thanks to the Deputy Prime Minister choosing to reintroduce the capping of local authorities and their fear that that might happen both last year and this year ahead of the general election.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_103">By contrast, I, who happened to be leader of the Conservative group on South Shropshire district council, proposed a zero per cent. increase in council tax, without any cuts in services. Another contrast is provided in our neighbouring authority&#151;Bridgnorth&#151;where the district council rate for a band D property is almost exactly half of that levied by the Liberal Democrat administration in South Shrophshire.

<a name="stpa_105">It may be of interest to hon. Members&#151;certainly to Ministers&#151;to know that, since the Liberal Democrats took control of the local authority in Stockport in 1999, band D council tax has increased by &#163;335, to &#163;1,252, which is significantly above the national average and an increase of nearly 37 per cent. over five years. Stockport has some relevance to the electors of Cheadle at the moment. My prediction, therefore, is that if we were to go down a local income tax route, those of us who are unfortunate enough to be represented by Liberal Democrat authorities would face considerably higher increases each year than those of us who live in Conservative authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_106">One of the specific problems that I should like to highlight&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) has referred to this&#151;relates to the balance of funding and equalisation issue and the redistribution of funds raised locally from those areas, such as my constituency, with lower than average incomes. Where incomes are lower than the national average, there are clearly two ways that the amount of revenue could be found: either by substantially increasing the average local income tax levied by that authority, or by increasing further the amount of equalisation funding that would come from central Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-17_para14">
<a name="stpa_107">It is hard to understand how either way would benefit the authority&#039;s residents, such as those in my constituency, who would either have to rely on central Government handouts even more than they do at present or suffer a substantial increase in local income tax. The Liberals have estimated a 3.75 per cent. average local income tax if their proposals were introduced throughout the country. We estimate that they would need to raise between 6 and 7 per cent. in our area&#151;roughly double their estimate&#151;to secure the same local authority revenue because incomes are substantially lower than the national average.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-17_para15">
<a name="stpa_108">The next point that I wish to touch on briefly is the question of administrative complexity.

Many of my constituents, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

Each individual may move in the course of a year. I accept that, at present, the Inland Revenue has an address, but it would have to be notified each time someone moved.

 I welcome this debate on a subject of great concern to many of my constituents in East Dunbartonshire. The Conservative Members who have spoken are certainly right in one respect&#151;the current system of council tax places an unfair burden on many people, particularly those on low incomes such as pensioners. Across the country, council tax bills have risen faster than inflation as local authorities have struggled to cope with additional responsibilities handed down by central Government, but often without the additional resources to deliver. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 61</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Thus the council tax has essentially been used as a stealth tax, often penalising those who can afford it least.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_115">It is a shocking state of affairs that the poorest people pay 6 per cent. of their income in council tax but the richest pay just 1.5 per cent. That surely cannot be right and it shows just how regressive and unjust this tax is. It is only due to get worse with the proposed rebanding exercises. We have already seen what has happened in Wales, where many people are now paying much more. For example, in Cardiff, two thirds of houses went up at least a band. Scotland, thanks to the Liberal Democrats, has a reprieve from the council tax revaluation while the independent review looks into the issue of local government finance.

At no time under both coalition agreements&#151;first in 1999 and then again in 2003&#151;was local income tax, or indeed the regressive rate of council tax, raised by the Liberal Democrats at all. Is that not completely contrary to your position here today?

 I welcome the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace) to the House. He will recall that the Liberal Democrats in Scotland consistently argued that the council tax was unfair. Through the many negotiations in which the Liberal Democrats have taken part, we have secured many policy commitments that the people of England and Wales do not enjoy, such as free personal care for the elderly and the abolition of tuition fees. We are campaigning on council tax and I have put forward a submission to the independent review that argues strongly for getting rid of the council tax and introducing a local income tax.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_116">The main problem with the current system is that it bears no relation whatsoever to people&#039;s ability to pay. Many of the people who have complained to me about the unfairness of council tax are elderly, which is not surprising because it is an especially unfair tax for pensioners. They might be living in a fairly sizeable family home, but they have a much smaller income than they did in the days when they were out working and paying the mortgage. We have now reached the point at which no amount of tinkering around the edges will solve the problem. The pre-election bribe to pensioners of a one-off payment to help with their council tax did not fool anyone. The problem is the unfairness of the system, which will not be solved by further complicating the council tax through handouts and making special cases. Instead, the best solution is a local income tax.

<a name="stpa_117">During the recent election campaign, I found strong support in East Dunbartonshire for the policy of replacing council tax with a local income tax. In fact, I was moved to speak in the debate following an experience that I had last Friday night. I was knocking

He said that council tax was the most important issue to him and made a plea to me to keep pushing for a local income tax because the council tax was so unfair. He explained the problems that it was causing him and his wife as a pensioner couple who had bought their semi-detached home many years ago. They did not want to feel forced to move out of their home as a result of council tax bills. I promised him that I certainly would continue to argue for an end to the unfair council tax and its replacement with a fair alternative, so that is what I am doing.

Amidst the leafy suburbs, there is hidden poverty, often pensioner poverty. While we in the House might be privileged to earn salaries that are far above the norm, let us not forget the reality in our constituencies. Even in my middle-class constituency, the average household income is less than &#163;25,000. Quite frankly, bandying about figures suggesting that an average household in Britain has two full-time wage earners bringing in more than &#163;50,000 a year just helps to reaffirm in people&#039;s minds the feeling that politicians are out of touch.

 It has been said that council tax became unpopular only when it started to increase. That is probably true. There is no doubt that it is a fact in my constituency. It is not only the increase that is the problem, but the increasing knowledge among local people of what is happening to that money. Council tax in Guildford has risen by 92 per cent. since 1997&#150;98. That is, without a doubt, mirrored to some extent in Waverley. We heard that the average council tax on a band D home has gone up 76 per cent. in the same period. Now we all face the revaluation. I cannot tell hon.

<p>
<a name="50704-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_132">The Assembly also pointed out that, as the underlying assumption is that the income from council tax will not change as a result of revaluation, it does not necessarily mean that all those moving up bands will pay increased council tax.

 No, I do not necessarily accept that. Taxation must be transparent and fair. There must certainly be an element that is geared towards ability to pay. My point is about the way in which revaluation was undertaken in Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_133">So much for the spin from the Welsh Assembly about revaluation. In the event, only 8 per cent. of homes moved down a band, but more than a third moved up. A total of 28 per cent. of homes moved up by one band, 5 per cent. by two bands and almost 1 per cent. by three bands. Nothing breeds resentment and cynicism more than broken promises and misinformation. People in Wales think that council tax revaluation was another stealth tax or a back-door tax hike. The revaluation process, as proposed by the Welsh Assembly Government, meant that, although there was no change in the headline rate of council tax, local residents faced higher bills. In Cardiff, 64 per cent. of homes went up by at least one band, and Wrexham, Vale of Glamorgan and Powys were particularly hard hit. In my county of Pembrokeshire, 35 per cent. of dwellings moved up at least one band.
</p>





<p><a name="st_200"><a name="50704-19_spnew5"><b> Mr. Patrick McLoughlin  (West Derbyshire) (Con):</b> 
 Will revaluation not be used by the Government to say that council tax as a percentage has not gone up? Following what happened in Wales, as my hon. Friend rightly demonstrated, many more people will pay far more, but the Government will still argue that the percentage raised by council tax has not gone up very much. In England, the amount of money that councils spend will rise, as will the amount of money that they take from people, but the Government will manage to argue that the percentages have not gone up very much.

<p><a name="st_201"><a name="50704-19_spnew6"><b> Mr. Crabb: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend is right.

<p><a name="st_202"><a name="50704-20_spnew0"><b> Mr. Pickles: </b> 
 Will my hon. Friend confirm that, besides the increase for individual households, the amount collected for council tax has gone up by 10 per cent. in Wales?
</p>





<p><a name="st_203"><a name="50704-20_spnew1"><b> Mr. Crabb: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has made an excellent point. It is worth bearing it in mind that, behind the numbers, real people are suffering, including pensioners whose only mistake was to work hard and buy their own home. In March, I met a D-day veteran who, within the space of a few short days, received two letters&#151;one from the Pension Service, the other from the county council. One letter informed him of his weekly pension increase this year, the other of his council tax bill for the coming year. Calculated on a weekly basis, his council tax increase more than wiped out any increase in his pension. What was given with one hand was taken away with the other.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_134">That pensioner is not an isolated example. This spring, across Wales, people experienced a serious cut in their income and quality of life as a result of council tax. People in Wales are therefore angry about the council tax revaluation. They are also bewildered and confused about what rebanding means and how it works in practice. Earlier this year, Pembrokeshire householders woke up to a local front-page headline, &quot;5 per cent. council tax rise likely&quot;. The report said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;Pembrokeshire County Council is likely to increase its demand on the council tax payer by five per cent next year.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_135">In fact, the council&#039;s demand on the council tax payer for the coming year was almost &#163;28 million compared with &#163;24.5 million last year&#151;an increase of 13 per cent. Many people would like to know how the council can raise 13 per cent. more money from a mere 5 per cent. increase in band D tax. The answer, of course, is to be found in the revaluation exercise, as the tax base of band D properties has swollen from 45,000 to almost 49,000&#151;an 8 per cent. increase. Making comparisons between this year&#039;s band D rate and the rate for last year is therefore like comparing apples and pears. The headline figure of 5 per cent. was a gross underestimation of the actual increase.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_136">The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors recently undertook research into the revaluation in Wales and stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;Council tax revaluation in England will lead to unduly large increases in council tax bills unless the tax bands are readjusted in line with house price inflation.&quot;</p>

<a name="50704-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_137">Looking at the way in which revaluation was conducted in Wales, it said that rebanding was not carried out in line with Welsh house price inflation. It warned that, if the Welsh model were adopted in England, a disproportionate number of houses would move up into higher bands in southern regions, where house prices have risen above the national average since 1991.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_138">In conclusion, taxation must be simple, understandable and transparent, and it must not place disproportionate burdens on the people who pay it. In contrast, the council tax revaluation in Wales was complex, opaque and placed burdens on people. Under the Labour Government, householders in England have

 As the second Welsh Conservative Member to contribute to our debate, may I say that it is a great shame that there are not any Labour or Liberal Democrat Back Benchers in the Chamber? This is an important debate, and the House has much to learn from the experience in Wales. Wales has shown us the future, and it does not work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_139">Wales has suffered far more pain as a result of council tax in the past few years than virtually any other part of the country. In Denbighshire and Conwy, whose councils cover my constituency, the average band D tax has almost doubled over the past eight years. The position has been made infinitely worse by the revaluation exercise that has just been implemented in Wales. We were told that the exercise would be fiscally neutral, but, in Denbighshire, 29 per cent. of households have been rebanded upwards, while only 8.5 per cent. have been rebanded downwards. In Conwy, 32 per cent. went up, while only 6.5 per cent. went down. In the ward of Llandrillo-yn-Rhos in my constituency, more than 40 per cent. of homes have been rebanded upwards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_140">The rebanding exercise is wholly unfair and amounts to a tax on house price inflation. Across Wales, there have been dramatic council tax increases. Some householders in my constituency have experienced increases this year of over 22 per cent, but the rises caused by rebanding are not simply reflected in comparisons between past and present band D figures. In Conwy, the average council tax has increased by 121 per cent. since 1997, while in Denbighshire the average increase is 105 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_141">Those increases have not been accompanied by an improvement in services&#151;quite the reverse. Rebanding generates additional local revenue, but a sum in excess of that revenue is withheld by the Welsh Assembly from the local authority, whose general budget is therefore affected. Consequently, many thousands of Welsh council tax payers are paying substantially more tax for unimproved services. As my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) said, that additional tax is an unashamed wealth tax. In fact, it is a stealth wealth tax, because it does not even have the decency to declare itself as a wealth tax.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_142">The council tax system certainly needs to amended and revised, but I caution the House against going down the route of rebanding and revaluation. The Welsh experience is a bitter one and, if it is writ large across England, the Government will be in severe trouble with taxpayers. As for the Liberal Democrat proposals for a local income tax, most average earners&#151;the people on &#163;35,000 or so a year cited by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)&#151;would think that something was terribly amiss if they had to pay an extra &#163;600 a year for unimproved services. I urge the House to accept a warning a Wales, and beware the future.

<p><a name="st_205"><a name="50704-20_spnew3"><b> David Howarth  (Cambridge) (LD):</b> 
 I shall deal with some of the points raised in the debate, starting with the   assumption by the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones) that average incomes in this country are &#163;35,000. That shows how out of touch he must be with ordinary lives. Average household income in the United Kingdom is about &#163;26,000. The idea, as the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) suggested, that under local income tax an average couple would find their bills rising by &#163;650 seems to assume that the average couple in her constituency, or at least in her head, receive an income of around &#163;50,000. That is extraordinary. Hon. Members should realise that people on salaries such as ours are in the top few per cent. of the population by income.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_143">Hon. Members, including the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones), who is no longer in his seat, have been concerned about two-earner couples. Figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies show that half of two-earner couples would be better off under local income tax. Of course, it depends which band they are in at present, but in any case only one in 10 households has two full-time earners.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_144">The question of beneficiaries from local income tax was raised. Contrary to what the hon. Member for Meriden said, the main beneficiaries would be pensioners and the low paid. During the election I met people in my constituency who were paying &#163;1,000 in council tax on an income of &#163;10,000. In one extraordinary case, someone was paying &#163;1,300 on an income of not much more than &#163;10,000. I challenge the other two parties to tell those people face to face that they think a tax system that does that is in any way fair. The council tax is an extraordinarily regressive tax. The local income tax provides a permanent solution to the regressive nature of that tax, not just a one-off that might work for a few people for a short time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_145">The idea has constantly been repeated that under local income tax, each local authority would collect the tax. That is not how it works in any other country in which it works properly. The system is administered by the national tax authorities and the same rules apply to local income tax. There is no requirement at all for a separate administration in separate local authorities.

<a name="stpa_146">Various hon. Members, including the hon. Members for Guildford (Anne Milton) and for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill) and, very surprisingly, the right hon.

It is quite possible for local authorities to set different rates, yet for the tax to be collected through the national revenue system. The right hon.

<a name="stpa_156">Anyone with experience of the Lib Dems in power, either in terms of a local authority or of an Administration, such as in Wales or Scotland, will find that that reality is different from the stated policy aims of their party. As I said to the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson), when the Lib Dems came into power with the Labour party in Scotland, one of the first things that they did was to vote to increase the business rate. Under the current system they made Scotland less advantageous as a country in which to settle a business than the other countries of the United Kingdom. That shows clearly that there is a difference between what the Lib Dems say and what they do in reality.

<a name="stpa_157">In neither of the coalition documents&#151;the documents set down, first, with Donald Dewar, a former Member of this place, and with Jack McConnell, the First Minister of Scotland&#151;did the Lib Dems ever raise the unjust system of council tax and the demands to reform it. That campaign was not part of those documents. Interestingly enough, the Lib Dems wanted to reform the voting system for local authorities. Clearly it was more important to get themselves into power first before they tackled incomes and the difficulties for people in terms of council taxes.

Local income tax seems an attractive policy on the Lib Dem website, but when we start asking questions about PAYE and how the tax will deal with large-scale redundancies in an area, issues arise about the income base. For example, my constituency is next to British Aerospace and Springfield nuclear fuels. There is also a manufacturing plant in Calder Vale, which recently announced a fairly large number of redundancies. How would local income tax respond to that, for example? There are more than 3,000 jobs&#151;perhaps 10,000&#151;that are reliant on British Aerospace.

<a name="stpa_161">The answer is that in the current year there would be no change and no problem. The grant would be as it was in the previous year. The redistributive system would be able to adjust in the following year.

 It is interesting to consider what we would be saying to the boundary committee. In future, it would have to redraft boundaries to take into account redundancies for the year before or the year before that. We would all find ourselves within peculiar district or county boundaries, which would be redrawn not on the basis of geography but on that of income. That has to be noted.

<a name="stpa_162">As for students, I take the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point that bursaries would not be taxed. However, there is a range of students who do not receive bursaries but who earn income. There are some who perhaps pay tuition fees. They go out and earn during all their holidays or during term time. If their earnings are above the threshold, do they suddenly become liable for local income tax? All students who currently have a de facto exemption would be brought into the tax bracket.

<p>
<a name="50704-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_163">Another example is cadets. Armed forces personnel sponsored by the Ministry of Defence as cadets are paid a salary. Every cadetship officer or cadet in any of the armed forces will immediately&#151;I think that they get about &#163;7,000 a year&#151;come within the scope of taxation. That means that another group of people will be brought into the system.

<a name="50704-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_164">I have mentioned the footprint but there is another word of which I am rather suspicious, and that is &quot;affordable&quot;. We have heard quite a lot from the Liberal Democrats that the tax will be affordable and that people could pay it. I could live in a large house and have no income, or a low income, or I could choose to sell my house and live in a small house, putting my money into dividends so as to get an income in that way. Affordable is a subjective concept that creeps into the conversation or into policy. What exactly is affordable? That issue must not be overlooked in the long run.

<p>
<a name="50704-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_166">I think that everyone agrees that we are dealing with a difficult issue. However, I agree with those on the Opposition Front Bench that people did not complain about council tax until the level of that tax became higher and higher. There are people who say to me that they quite like the idea of a local income tax. I then go through it, explain it and ask them questions. For example, I ask them, &quot;Would you be upset if your council tax was half the price?&quot; They then say that that is not really the issue. There are many questions still to be answered on local income tax detail. There is PAYE, dividend payments and income from other areas. How will those factors be taken into account?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_167">There are some similarities between local income tax and the poll tax in the sense that the number of people in a house will often determine the rates that people will be paying. There could be three earners in a house. There are many in that position because housing is not very affordable. Many young men and women are living with their parents, which means that sometimes there are three income earners rather than two or one. I have serious concerns about the application of local income tax in reality and I therefore urge the House to support the Opposition&#039;s amendment.

However, it is not, as Liberal Democrat Members claim, a wholly regressive tax. Some taxes are purely regressive&#151;road tax, for example. The air passenger levy is a purely regressive tax because one pays exactly the same no matter what one&#039;s income or wealth. Council tax is mildly, although not perfectly, progressive, because, broadly speaking, the bigger and more expensive the house one has, the more one pays.

However, it is a question not only of the structure of the tax but its level. In many places, including my constituency, council tax has doubled since 1997. If one has a mildly regressive tax and then proceeds to double it, a small injustice becomes a big injustice, and that is what has happened. In my constituency, the local income tax cost the Liberal Democrats votes. That was not only because teachers, doctors and nurses saw that their tax would increase, but because in places where Liberal Democrats ran the council, they increased council tax. In my area of Waverley, they increased it by nearly double the rate of Guildford next door. People felt that it was hypocritical

<a name="stpa_170">This is, in all seriousness, something that the Liberal Democrats need to consider. My constituency is an expensive part of the world and, yes, there are people on high salaries, but there are also people on low salaries who have to deal with very high costs. I met a couple of teachers who lived together in Godalming. They had bought their first house with their first mortgage, and their combined salary was around &#163;60,000. I accept that in some parts of the country that is a very generous amount of money to live on, but it is not much when one is having to buy a very expensive house and to deal with a mortgage on it. That couple&#039;s council tax would increase by about &#163;600 under the local income tax, and they would really suffer. When I talked to pensioners who would benefit from the local income tax, they would often stop thinking that it was a good idea if I explained to them that the reason why they would benefit is that hardworking young couples would have their taxes increased in return.

<p>
<a name="50704-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_171">On top of that, there are all the problems about the cost of collecting local income tax and about equalisation. That is significant for my part of the world.

 Unfortunately, we have exactly the same problem in St. Albans. Even a starter home costs about &#163;200,000, which is more than three times the income of the couple my hon. Friend mentioned. The Liberal Democrats assume that a high house price equals wealth, but that is not so. The biggest flaw with the local income tax is that it takes no account of the fact that many people&#151;often key workers such as police, nurses and teachers&#151;will need to have to have a huge mortgage to live in areas such as St. Albans, Guildford, and my hon.

Income levels are very divergent in different parts of the country, and bodies such as the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy warn that a local income tax would place greater demands on the need for resources equalisation between areas. One of the big injustices of the current system of funding local government is that Government grants lead to a great deal of reallocation of resources between different parts of the country, and that would have to increase under a local income tax.

<a name="stpa_173">Local income tax fails to address the real problem in local taxation, which is that far too high a proportion of the funds spent by local government is not raised locally but distributed from national Government. That leads to all sorts of anomalies in the local taxation system. In the case of my own county council, Surrey, I discovered that a significant amount of its expenditure every year goes towards building cycle lanes, which it has to do on the basis of central Government diktat, not what the voters of Surrey chose as their priorities in electing it. Another significant factor for Surrey county council is that if it gets a bad grant one year, it might find that it has to put its taxes up even though it has been very prudent in managing money.

<a name="stpa_174">In dealing with the issue of local taxation, we must ensure that people can vote for a local council that then reflects their choices. We need to reconnect local taxation with the people who pay for those services. In general, councils that tax and spend wisely tend to get voted in&#151;coincidentally, they tend to be Conservative&#151;and those that do not tax and spend wisely do not get voted in. People do not feel that local councils do a job that they can relate to directly or that their choices as voters will have a direct impact on the delivery of local services. That is the real issue, not whether we have a council tax or a local income tax.

My research has quickly shown that that would result in an increase of 10.6p on income tax. That figure is winging its way to the Labour committee rooms in Cheadle even as we speak. The good work force of the Woodford BAE Systems plant in Stockport will now know that not only could they be paying more income tax, depending on whom they were working alongside, but that it could go up by 10.6 per cent.

<a name="stpa_197">I am delighted to pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr.   Raynsford) who, with typical politeness, has passed me a note apologising for the fact that he cannot be here for the end of the debate. I think that it was the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) who urged Members to read my right hon. Friend&#039;s articles in the <i>Municipal Journal</i>. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that, however hard he has been reading them, he has not been reading them half as hard as I have. I congratulate my right hon. Friend on them.

<a name="stpa_198">On a serious point, my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich said that the goals of local government finance policy were greater certainty, greater equalisation, incentives for high quality delivery of local government services, and the sustainability of long-term funding with equal, if not greater, emphasis on expenditure control, both through the Gershon

<br>&nbsp;<br>efficiencies&#151;the successes of which my right hon. Friend the Minister of Communities and Local Government has already reported to the House&#151;and through macro-expenditure decisions. In the coming Session, we will debate the three-year settlement that we intend to fulfil to bring about that greater certainty and stability.

<p>
<a name="50704-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_199">I should like briefly to reply to some of the constituency points raised. I congratulate the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) on his new appointment as Conservative spokesperson on voluntary affairs. He had great fun attacking the Liberal Democrats on the Isle of Wight&#151;an easy target, but he had great fun none the less. I must point out to him, however, that his own council has recently received a 5.8 per cent. increase in its grant from central Government, and above-inflation increases for the past eight years running. I invite him to give the money back if he does not want it, but I suspect that there will not be a cheque in the post to my right hon. Friend the Minister of Communities and Local Government.

<a name="stpa_200">My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck) made a brief but very well informed speech, and I look forward to her being able to use the platform of her membership of the House to give us the benefit of her vast experience and knowledge of local government finance. She has found her voice now, and we look forward very much to benefiting from her advice.

<a name="50704-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_201">The hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) made some important points on behalf of his constituents about the fact that some people in his area are on lower incomes. He asked how that could be taken into account if the Lib Dem policy were to be introduced. That was precisely the question asked by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West and others: how would greater resource equalisation take place if the local income tax were to be genuinely local? That is the paradox that was teased out of the Liberal Democrats&#039; policy.

<a name="50704-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_202">The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) got mixed up when she said that her constituency was the most middle class in Scotland, yet incomes there were under &#163;25,000. I take her point, but she must acknowledge that a couple on average incomes, not on average household earnings, as was suggested, would experience average council tax increases of &#163;600&#151;

 It is all very well the hon. Lady shaking her head, but if the tax base were to be based on income rather than property, it would be narrowed. A greater burden would therefore fall on those people paying income tax, who are, on the whole, members of hard-working families. The Lyons review&#039;s remit is to consider whether an element of income tax could be used in balance with the existing property element&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Ah!&quot;] This is not news.

<p>
<a name="50704-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_203">We have requested the Lyons review to consider the balance of funding, building on the work that my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich has done, and to make recommendations on how best to reform the tax, taking into account the possible impact of revaluation. It will also assess the case both for providing local authorities with increased flexibility to raise additional revenue and for making the shift in the balance of funding that I have just mentioned, and conduct a thorough analysis of options other than council tax for local authorities to raise supplementary revenue. This has been an interesting debate, if only because it has teased out the differences between the two Opposition parties, both of which are clearly concentrating on what is going on in Cheadle rather than in the Lyons review.

<a name="stpa_204">This Government&#039;s record in providing a 33 per cent. real terms increase in resources to local authorities since 1997, providing incentives to councils such as those in Surrey that were mentioned, and giving better freedoms to improve services, as the Audit Commission is reporting sustained increases in local services, is one of which we should be proud. We look forward to Sir Michael Lyons&#039;s recommendations, and to further debates on this matter.

<a name="50704-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_207">In moving this motion, I am a little bemused by the Government&#039;s response. I crafted the wording of the motion myself&#151;it is a veritable pussycat of a motion. My right hon. and hon. Friends have been too generous. They have not said, &quot;Are you losing your touch? Where is the tiger in the tail?&quot; It was deliberately couched in words that I thought Her Majesty&#039;s Government would welcome. I have heard many fine words from the Prime Minister; even more remarkably, I have heard sometimes similar fine words from the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It appears that, at times, this is one issue on which they agree: they now wish to run a deregulatory Government. In this motion, I give them a little encouragement, assistance and advice. Its wording is surely unexceptionable&#151;if they are as truly committed as some of the readers of their words might expect.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;urges the Government to produce a deregulation Bill which goes beyond exhortation . . . by repealing unnecessary and burdensome laws&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_209">Do I take it from the Government&#039;s wish to strike our motion from the Order Paper when proceedings conclude that they no longer wish to have a deregulation Bill&#151;there was one in the Gracious Speech&#151;or do they wish to have a deregulation Bill with nothing in it? Are we to have yet more words and no action? Are we to have deregulation in the title, but nothing actually deregulated? That is very new Labour&#151;very fashionable circa 1997&#151;but perhaps not in the spirit of the modern world.
</p>

<p>

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_211">Surely they can assent to that very modest proposition. I wanted to include a list of all the regulations that we want repealed&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Go on.&quot;] Well, we might do that later, if time permits. I thought, in order to be in sympathy with the Government, &quot;Better the sinner who repents.&quot; I thought that they had realised that they passed too much regulation in their first eight years, and that they might agree to table a paper for the EU presidency that contains positive proposals for deregulating the EU. But no, I see from the stony faces

<p>
<a name="50704-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_213">I accept that such an idea would probably put me on the ultra-Blairite wing of the rather ragged Labour coalition, but surely it is just within the spectrum. We know that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor are locking horns on this issue. The Prime Minister makes the occasional speech, or allows the occasional briefing to be made to the press, saying that our professionals in schools and hospitals need more freedoms, hence the ideas behind the early versions of foundation hospitals and special schools.

<a name="stpa_219">What could we do? Several straightforward steps could be taken, by a deregulation Bill, which we in this House have been promised, and through the mechanism of the EU presidency, with the UK guiding the agenda with our partners in Europe on the regulations that fall from the Brussels printing presses. After all, the Government are undoubtedly good at one or two things&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear.&quot;] Well, Labour Members will love this. One of those things is making ever more rules and regulations that become the bane of our lives. Some of those regulations miss their target, some hit the wrong targets and some, such as ID cards, are regulations in search of a target, as the Government try to find something that the cards could achieve, having decided that they must tie us up in knots with that legislation.

As always under this Government, we have gold-plated those regulations and steamed ahead to implement them this summer. They were of course too sensible to implement them just before the general election. Even this Government realise that the regulations are mightily unpopular, but they will be implemented this summer. That will mean price increases and bans for popular products, affecting millions of people who would like to continue to be able to buy them.

Will the Government tonight promise that they will take counter-proposals to Brussels on that issue? Will they try to sort it out before it grinds its way through the courts? Will they accept tonight that the regulation is unnecessary and that they should use some political capital to get it rescinded in Brussels?

<a name="50704-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_222">Then there are those regulations that seem to have no purpose at all. For example, identity cards started life as a means of stopping illegal immigrants entering the country. When we pointed out that people need a passport to enter the country and that there was no need to require a different document that was available only to those established as British citizens anyway, the Government backed away from that proposal and said that ID cards could be used for crime busting. The quality of criminals is probably higher than the Government reckon, so I suspect that few burglars will take their ID cards with them and drop them on the doormat before they leave the house with the goodies. Short of that happening, it is difficult to see how ID cards would have a huge impact on catching criminals who break into our homes or do damage to our cars. Now, we are told that ID cards will combat identity theft. Apparently, that is a growing and serious crime and the Government think that ID cards will combat it when national insurance numbers, passports and other means of identification, including driving licences, cannot. Next week, ID cards may be an essential aid for anyone who has to go to a computer dating agency to sort out their social life.

<a name="50704-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_223">Then we have the regulations that are over the top and silly, out of all proportion to the possible risk. For example, we have the risk assessments that are now demanded by some councils before people can undertake sponsored walks. I read about a case a few weeks ago when the council said that the person organising the sponsored walk had to walk the circuit three days in advance and ensure that there were no dangerous rabbit holes. If there were, the organiser had to ensure that everybody on the walk was fully briefed about them before going on the walk. However, nobody told the rabbits, any of which could have dug a dangerous hole between the reconnaissance and the briefing. I wondered whether the briefing would cover that crucial point. Cannot the Government see that that is ridiculous and put something in the Bill about proportionality to try to calm down such activity?

That means that they have to go and catch more of the right kind of fish for people to eat, instead of being able to sell the dead fish and avoid having to rape the seabed further. That is madness.

They have not been deterred by the fact that fewer than one in 10 of all accidents on the road has speed as a prime or important cause and they have ignored all the evidence that shows that many dangerous accidents occur well below the maximum speed limit at junctions with a conflict of traffic and different types of users on the same road space. Because the policy rested on speed cameras, we had a reversal in the trend for several years and road deaths started going up again. I am pleased that figures for the most recent year show an overall fall, but in the area most dependent on speed cameras&#151;north Wales&#151;the trend in deaths and serious accidents has continued to rise. The Government should consider that and accept that their single over-regulated policy is not working, because it does not tackle the causes of the problem.

Recently, I saw the City of London corporation&#039;s interesting piece of research on the implementation of the money-laundering regulations in the UK, which we had to implement in line with other European partners. Overseas territories outside the EU implemented something similar based on the original G7 agreement. The independent judgment commissioned by the corporation found that it cost twice as much in relation to gross domestic product to implement the regulations in Britain as in Germany. That is a huge over-reaction by Britain. The report goes on to say that the regulations do not make the UK safer from money-laundering than Germany, they are just a costly way of doing it. So, we have a paper chase where people have to take gas bills, electricity bills and passports to their building society just to pay in &#163;100, even though they may have been banking there for many years.

<a name="stpa_235">I congratulate the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) on his speech. I enjoyed his peroration. I do not know whether he will put his hat in the ring for the soon-to-be-declared vacancy in the leadership of his party. He certainly pulled in a decent crowd tonight, so it looks as though he might be in with a shout. All the best to him, because I think it is true to say that all my right hon. and hon. Friends would welcome him as Leader of the Opposition. If he were to inherit that jewel in the British constitution, we might see a little more of him in general elections than we did in the one that just took place.

<p>
<a name="50704-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_236">I want to say a few words as an introduction. The right hon. Gentleman referred to the motion. For a fleeting moment, I thought that I, too, could be prepared to lend my support to it. However, I prefer my words to his and I am sure he will understand why. Although he made a good speech, and I congratulate him on that, the problem with it was that there were four fundamental flaws.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_237">First, the right hon. Gentleman really needed to establish that the UK economy was performing badly because of the Government&#039;s approach to regulation. Sadly for him, the facts do not support his arguments. They suggest the opposite. To give him credit&#151;I always want to be fair to him&#151;he certainly did his best; in fact, he tortured the data until eventually it confessed to him. But as we all know&#151;and the lawyers in the House will know better than anyone else&#151;evidence obtained under such duress is never admissible to prosecute a case. He will have to find some more supportive evidence.
</p>





<p><a name="st_282"><a name="50704-30_spnew0"><b> Ed Balls: </b> 
 Does my right hon. Friend remember speeches made by Conservative Members, when they were in government, about the threat to jobs if a national minimum wage were to be introduced? Does he remember the claims that it would cost between 1.5 million and 2 million jobs? Does not the fact that we 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 99</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>have 2 million more jobs, not 1.5 million fewer, show that it is possible to strike a balance between reducing regulation and setting good, sound minimum standards so that people are properly protected at work?
</p>





<p><a name="st_283"><a name="50704-30_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend. I understand that, only a few months ago, the right hon. Member for Wokingham said that he thought that his observations and calculations about the minimum wage were spot on. They were not&#151;they were completely off the target. There are 2 million new jobs in the UK economy, not 2 million fewer, as he and his hon. Friends predicted.
</p>





<p><a name="st_284"><a name="50704-30_spnew2"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 Did my right hon. Friend hear, as I thought that I did, the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) cite Germany with some approval towards the end of what passed for a peroration? Research paper 05/53, produced by the economic policy and statistics section of the Library, uses three key figures to show, first, on the output per hour measure, that Germany lags behind the United Kingdom; secondly, that, on the labour market figure, the level of employment in Germany is significantly less than in the UK; and, thirdly, on the tax burden, the UK figure of 37.1 per cent. is significantly below that of Germany. How does he account for those three figures if Germany is doing so well in its deregulated idyll?
</p>





<p><a name="st_285"><a name="50704-30_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I am not sure how the right hon. Gentleman can account for that obvious discrepancy. I want to return to the UK&#039;s relative position vis-&#224;-vis the other member states of the European Union. The British economy is certainly outperforming most of those comparators in the EU.
</p>





<p><a name="st_286"><a name="50704-30_spnew4"><b> Mr. Brooks Newmark  (Braintree) (Con):</b> 
 Will the Minister enlighten us? We keep hearing about how many jobs have been created. I would be interested to know how many of the 1.5 million to 2 million jobs that have been created by the Government are jobs for bureaucrats and how many of those individuals are regulators?
</p>





<p><a name="st_287"><a name="50704-30_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I think that about two thirds of those jobs are in the private sector. As for the additional jobs in the public sector, I do not know what the hon. Gentleman&#039;s definition of &quot;bureaucrats&quot; is, but I remember that, when I was in the Department of Health, he and his hon. Friends who sit on the Front Bench used to describe porters, cleaners and other staff who play a very important role in the national health service as &quot;bureaucrats&quot; and &quot;pen-pushers&quot;. That is simply not the case. Perhaps he wants to make such a point in his own speech. My job is to enlighten him, as he rightly said, and if he will bear with me, I intend to try to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_238">The second problem with the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s speech is that he needed to show that his own record and that of his party supported the case that he made this evening. Frankly, it does not. His own record in government and that of the Conservative party fail to match the rhetoric that he deployed in his speech tonight, and I want to return to that point in a minute.

<p><a name="st_288"><a name="50704-30_spnew6"><b> Mr. John Hayes  (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con):</b> 
 Even the Minister would not argue that farm businesses have prospered under this Government. Farm businesses have been faced with ever-greater regulation, ranging from fallen stock to controls on livestock markets. Farm incomes have fallen consistently. The number of people in farming has also declined since 1997. What assessment has he made of the impact on farming of the Government&#039;s activities and, in particular, regulation since 1997?
</p>





<p><a name="st_289"><a name="50704-30_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 We are certainly working to support farming. As for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about regulation, to be fair him, too, I am sure that he would be prepared to acknowledge that many of the regulations that he complains about were introduced to try to sort out the mess that the Conservative Government left on bovine spongiform encephalopathy and other such problems. Many of those regulations were introduced by that Government.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_239">I want to come to the wider issue about sectors in a second, but there is a third fundamental flaw in the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s case. He needed to demonstrate that the UK&#039;s position in relation to regulatory matters was getting worse vis-&#224;-vis our international competitors. In that respect, too, he had a major problem. There is plenty of evidence from this country and abroad that the UK is making good progress on better regulation&#151;evidence that he conveniently failed to mention at all during his contribution to the debate. In fact, he overlooked the views of the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Heritage Foundation and the International Monetary Fund&#151;all of which he is usually keen to pray in aid. Sadly for him, no such succour or support was available to him from those sources tonight and, again, it showed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_240">Finally, the right hon. Gentleman completely failed to present a sensible analysis of European regulatory issues. He was overcome again by his visceral hatred for everything that originates from the European Union. In fact, he got his best cheers when he was ranting at his very best about the evils of the European Union. I got the sense that he wanted to rerun some of the arguments that we had during the recent general election. Of course, I am very happy for him to do so: Labour won that election. In rehearsing all the failed policies that the Conservative party put before the British people in May, he has served only to remind Labour Members why the British people chose to return Labour for a record third term in office.
</p>





<p><a name="st_292"><a name="50704-30_spnew10"><b> Mr. Charles Walker  (Broxbourne) (Con):</b> 
 I think that it was in 2000 or 2001 that the EU had the Lisbon summit, at which those involved pledged to create 20 million new jobs by 2010. Will the Minister explain in his own words why it is so palpably clear to all hon. Members that we will miss that target? In fact, Europe collectively has not created one new job in that period.
</p>





<p><a name="st_293"><a name="50704-30_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b>

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that much of what the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) said was typical Conservative hot air? Does my right hon. Friend know that, on 2 December, the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), the then shadow Chancellor, promised me &quot;a very long list&quot; of regulations that a Conservative Government would do away with? He also told me subsequently that the right hon. Member for Wokingham, as shadow Deregulation Minister, would produce that list in January. I am not aware until tonight that we have seen even a scintilla of that list. We are still waiting for the very long list. It is hot air.
</p>





<p><a name="st_295"><a name="50704-31_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 There was a lot of hot air from the right hon. Member for Wokingham. I have seen his list of proposals that he made for the general election, and we know the outcome of that contest. I want to refer to some of the arguments that he made. He rehearsed some of them tonight, particularly his interesting suggestion that we withdraw from the common fisheries policy. I understand that he wants us to pull out of the social chapter as well, and I want to come to the difficulties that any future Conservative Government would have in delivering such a policy.
</p>





<p><a name="st_296"><a name="50704-31_spnew2"><b> Mr. Redwood: </b> 
 The Minister is generous, but I should like to take him up on the four allegations that he made. Does he accept that the United States of America has consistently out-grown this country over the past eight years because it is less tightly regulated and has a lower tax regime? Is he not aware that we are getting closer and closer to the poor performance of the heavily regulated and higher tax regimes on the continent and that we will not hit the Chancellor&#039;s forecasts this year?
</p>





<p><a name="st_297"><a name="50704-31_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 No, I certainly do not accept the latter part of the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s question.

Of course, we are willing to learn, but I want to come to the wider point because, fundamentally, his speech served a useful purpose in highlighting our different approaches to this issue. I want to explore those differences in a second, if I can get on to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_241">The right hon. Gentleman&#039;s central argument related to the health of the British economy and its international competitiveness under this Labour Government. Anyone listening to his remarks would have been left with the impression that our economy was in recession, that Britain was an unattractive place to set up a new business and that a vast army of bureaucrats&#151;to use an expression used by the hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark)&#151;were out and about strangling enterprise and innovation. But this is 2005, not the 1980s, when millions of people lost their jobs because of Tory boom-and-bust policies. It is not the early 1990s, when hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes because of yet another Tory-inspired recession. Of course, the right hon.

 The big decision to join the exchange rate mechanism&#151;which was Labour economic policy, as well as that of the Conservatives&#151;was a mistake. We have said that it was.

 I accept that that is historical fact, but the right hon.

We cannot shake off that responsibility quite as easily as he has tried to do this evening.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_242">My argument tonight is that, thanks to the policies that we have pursued since we took office, the British economy has enjoyed one of the best climates for business since records began, with sustained economic growth and stability covering the entire period that we have been in office.

Sadly for him, his views on the British economy are not even shared by other members of the shadow Cabinet. The Leader of the Opposition said of the British economy only recently:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;We&#039;ve got the most successful economy in the developed world. It&#039;s completely stable, low inflation, interest rates, virtually no unemployment and quality sustainable growth. Now America doesn&#039;t have this with its deficit.

<a name="stpa_246">We have made it clear&#151;this is one area where the right hon. Gentleman and I might agree&#151;that if the progress is to be sustained and if British companies are to remain globally competitive, helping to create new jobs and prosperity here in the UK, Government must, of course, accept their responsibility to strip away the burden of unnecessary regulation on business. I hope that we can agree on that at least. However, I think that there is a huge difference between his approach, which would, for example, compromise standards in the workplace, and the approach that we intend to take.      The measures that he put forward at the election to slash public expenditure through axing support for businesses, such as the scrapping of the Small Business Service, would hurt and not help businesses.

In fact, I have here just some of his handy work in the 1980s. Here it is&#151;213 separate pages of new statutory burdens all applying to business.

The former Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), referred to the subject of deregulation in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> shortly after leaving office. I notice that all these reminiscences and insights occur only when Conservatives leave office. The right hon. and learned Gentleman said:

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for allowing me to answer his point. He says that I used the legislative pen, but I seem to remember using it to deregulate the telecoms industry, allowing a large number of new producers to come into the marketplace and creating an extremely successful industry. That was a deregulatory use of the legislative pen and it worked.

<p><a name="st_307"><a name="50704-32_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I am not disputing that or the contribution that such an approach can make. It makes the case in many ways for the need to regulate sometimes. The candour that the right hon. Gentleman has just displayed is admirable, but it was missing from his earlier presentation to the House. He shakes his head, but we all have a chance to examine his contribution. We shall see what part of his speech made the case for regulation. That was not something that I heard him say.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_253">The point applies particularly at the EU level. The telecommunications market has been opened up since 1998 because of European law making. I know that the right hon. Gentleman is rightly a strong supporter of the single market, and it has added huge amounts to European gross domestic product and massive amounts to British GDP. Those reforms came about because the EU regulated, and not because it sat back and said, &quot;No, we are not going to regulate.&quot; As my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Ed Balls) said, there is a balance to be struck in all these things. The balance was absent from the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s remarks.

<a name="stpa_254">I am afraid that I am going to have to say to the right hon. Gentleman and his hon.

His analysis is flawed, his facts are highly selective, and his prospectus would make matters worse not better. In short, he did not have a sensible strategy at all. Happy-clappy rhetoric on the theme of deregulation may be his stock in trade, and it works well for him among Conservative Members, but it does not add up to a row of beans.

<a name="50704-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_255">Since 1997, the Government have focused their approach on better regulation, rather than simply on deregulation.

 The hon. Gentleman clearly is not saying that, but he raises an important wider issue. It is true that there is no such thing as free regulation. If we are going to regulate and impose burdens or costs on business, administrative burdens on citizens or whatever the agenda is, it is essential that we do so in the light of the best possible information about the costs. We have options and choices to make, and citizens and businesses have too. I agree, in part, that we need to improve the way that we discuss in the House and outside with business, citizens&#039; groups and others the options in front of us and the costs of taking particular measures. We have been trying to do that and, to be fair to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s Government, they were keen to try to develop that as well.

<a name="stpa_273">On business regulation, it is worth reminding ourselves that a modern, well functioning market economy depends on the rule of law for its success. The new democracies in eastern Europe, many of which have built remarkably successful economies, had to develop those rules quickly as they escaped from the clutches of communism. Rules are necessary in particular to safeguard and protect employees from unacceptable exploitation. It is worth remembering that Conservative Governments as well as Labour Governments have legislated to outlaw discrimination in the workplace.

In fact, the worst thing of all is to be dead from work if there is no occupational health and safety legislation.

<p><a name="st_320"><a name="50704-33_spnew6"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman reinforces the point that some regulation is necessary to safeguard employees. It was the right hon.

It imposes a considerable additional regulatory burden on business.

: The hon. Gentleman knows that the 1995 Act asked businesses to make reasonable adjustments, thereby ensuring that small businesses were not disadvantaged by a huge regulatory burden.

Small businesses create the vast majority of employment wealth in the country and are most disadvantaged by all the regulation. It is the small businesses that struggle.

 The hon. Gentleman is right to address the concern that small businesses can be heavily burdened by regulation from the Government, but we must remember that an employee&#039;s safety is as important if they work for a small business as it is if they work for a large business. Again, it is a matter of striking the right balance. I accept that the &quot;reasonable adjustments&quot; enabled the size and scope of the business to be taken into account, but the extent of guidance provided with the 1995 Act effectively imposed a massive additional burden on businesses of all size. I was simply giving an example of a Conservative Government increasing the regulatory burden to give protection to disabled people, which we should all support.

 I promise that this is my last contribution to our debate. The hon. Gentleman surprised all the Labour Members in the Chamber by saying that he is going to support the Conservative motion. I checked his manifesto, but I could not find a single reference to regulation, so he is obviously borrowing Conservative policies.

Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) to say whether he supported the minimum wage. We did not receive an answer to that question, but assessments of the total cost of regulation on business, estimated to be about &#163;40 billion by the British Chambers of Commerce, attribute about &#163;13.5 billion to the minimum wage. There is, however, now widespread support, even within the Conservative party, for the principle of the minimum wage. Many people would argue that it has improved the labour market and pushed companies higher up the value chain, so it is another example of regulation that protects employees and is regarded as beneficial.

Regulation to protect the consumer is going through Parliament at the moment. There is argument about some important details in the Consumer Credit Bill but, even though it increases regulation on business, it is broadly supported by the Conservative party as well as by the Liberal Democrats. Finally, rules and regulations are necessary to protect the environment. The market does not understand the imperative of tackling global warming, so a mixture of regulation and other market-based mechanisms such as emissions trading are necessary to change corporate behaviour.

<a name="stpa_281">The Government are right to point out in their amendment that in some respects the UK is seen as a leader in regulatory reform, certainly in the European context.

<br>&nbsp;<br>European field, with the clear exception of Holland, the UK has developed the concept of the regulatory impact assessment, with which the Minister dealt in his speech. The problem is that in our view it does not work as intended. I list some of the criticisms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_282">First, the Government have all too often failed to follow their own rules when preparing regulatory impact assessments. Secondly, the RIA is carried out by the Department that seeks to implement the regulation. There is a danger that it will simply be self-serving. No outside body reviews the RIA once it is prepared. The National Audit Office may look at it after the event, but there is no independence in the process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_283">Thirdly, by the time the RIA is carried out, the momentum to introduce the measure is often unstoppable. It happens too late in the process. Are we ever told, for example, that an RIA has resulted in the decision not to proceed with a new regulation? One suspicion is that that never happens. I would be interested to hear from the Minister whether there are ever occasions when RIAs reach a conclusion that a regulation should not proceed. We are never made aware of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_284">Fourthly, the assessment of impact on business is often insufficiently robust and there is no standard process for revisiting the regulation once it has been in force for a time to measure its actual impact and to compare the reality with what had been predicted in the original RIA. Fifthly, there is insufficient transparency in the process. It is impossible to determine how the costing has worked and who has been consulted. Sixthly, and perhaps above all else, there has not been a sufficient cultural shift in Whitehall Departments. The pressure is still to regulate, rather than to make a genuine attempt to examine all other options for resolving a problem without resorting to regulation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_285">I suggest the following steps to help change the culture and slow the pace of new regulation. To start with, there should be some independence in the regulatory impact assessment process. It could involve an independent body conducting the assessment, or an independent assessment panel of suitably qualified individuals looking at the RIA once it had been prepared. The panel&#039;s conclusion would be available to Parliament before it considered the measure. This element of independence would focus the minds of civil servants and would be likely to act as a constraint on the flow of new regulation. It is an approach pioneered in the Netherlands with marked success.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_286">Secondly, there must be much more effective assessment of impact. That would necessarily involve industry bodies more effectively in determining the likely cost of regulating, and also in examining whether there are alternative ways to proceed that would be more cost effective. Thirdly, there must be transparency in the process. Information, including the method of calculating the impact and all other background material, should be routinely published on the Department&#039;s website.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_287">Fourthly, there must be a post-implementation assessment of each new regulation, perhaps three years after enactment. That could be carried out by the independent assessment panel that I proposed. Finally, each regulation affecting business should include a sunset clause, which would force a further assessment of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 113</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>its worth. If the Government wanted the regulation to survive, they would have to justify it again to Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-34_para13">
<a name="stpa_288">So far I have dealt only with Whitehall. The process at European Union level is less advanced and even more disturbing. The flow of new regulations, directives and other EU decisions has grown massively over the years, peaking in 1998 at 3,901&#151;more than 10 a day. By 2003, the number had declined somewhat, but still it reached more than 3,400. We now have a European RIA of new regulations but it is rightly criticised for lack of rigour. A survey of a sample of EIAs, as they have become known, found that only half had quantified both costs and benefits. Too often they are nothing more than a flimsy paper exercise. The British Chambers of Commerce has found in a sample that 10 out of 12 UK EIAs carried out in respect of EU regulations were published after the regulations had come into force, thereby negating the entire purpose of the assessment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-34_para14">
<a name="stpa_289">All of the proposals that I have put forward for the UK could be applied equally to the EU. I welcome the fact that the Cabinet Office has apparently today reasserted the Government&#039;s commitment to deregulation as a priority for the UK&#039;s EU presidency. Interestingly, it was reported in the <i>Financial Times</i> this morning that Ministers will advocate a new independent body to scrutinise proposals for regulation. If independence is appropriate for the EU, presumably it is appropriate also at national level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-34_para15">
<a name="stpa_290">There is an added dimension to the European level of regulation that merits consideration. Tim Ambler of the London Business School has highlighted that directives provide scope for interpretation at national level. Each member state can implement a directive in its own way. The process provides the opportunity for so-called gold-plating.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-34_para16">
<a name="stpa_291">Logic suggests that if the measure is required at EU level, it should be implemented uniformly throughout the single market. That suggests that it should be implemented in a regulation that applies directly and does not involve any further regulation at national level, or it should be left to member states to decide whether to legislate. Going down the directive route inevitably involves legislation both at European level and member state level, leaving confusion throughout the EU and also leaving businesses and individuals unclear as to their rights. Tim Ambler highlights the risk of legislating at multiple levels of government, which ensures that there is a lack of clarity. That leaves the citizen entirely confused.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-34_para17">
<a name="stpa_292">As well as being far more robust in the way in which we examine regulatory proposals that are coming forward, we must seek to reduce existing regulation. Both at national and European levels there is a need to tackle the vast accumulation of regulation. There must be a rigorous approach to reducing and simplifying the burden, and the Dutch have again taken the lead. The Government have stated their objectives and they will be judged against their rhetoric. One approach that is worth considering is the one in, one out discipline. Every time that a Department seeks to impose a new regulation, it would have to propose the cull of an existing one. The concept that the regulatory burden has grown large enough and that something must give to facilitate the introduction of a new regulation is logical and attractive.

I should like to draw his and the House&#039;s attention to the activities of two neighbouring councils in Scotland. Perth and Kinross council, which strangely enough is controlled by the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party, sought public liability insurance for a G8 alternatives demonstration this week, only to withdraw the requirement two weeks later. Stirling council, which is Labour-controlled, agreed the site for a G8 alternatives eco-village with the appropriate level of guarantees but without the need to back-pedal from a situation that it had itself created. That is a good comparative example of how councils are in control of making their own decisions without intervention from central Government.

<a name="stpa_300">I welcome the Government&#039;s commitment to dealing with the burden of unnecessary regulation on businesses and public sector providers. I must declare an interest, as stated in the Register of Members&#039; Interests, in that I run a building supplies business in Scotland. Coming to this House with a business background, I understand that unnecessary regulation on business and public services can hold back enterprise and stifle ambition. The burden of paperwork ensuring that companies conform to regulations from Westminster and Brussels can take a considerable time to complete and, as such, has an impact on the time management of employees and directors alike.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_301">This is not, however, a new phenomenon. Having been involved in the building trade for more than 25 years, I have noted that red tape has always placed a burden on companies and employees. The Government&#039;s ambitions here and now represent a real attempt to change the culture that exists within Government, which often creates needless administrative processes for companies and sometimes holds back the development of smaller companies. The Government&#039;s desire to remove unnecessary regulations while maintaining the benefits of many existing regulations makes their aim stand out from the Opposition&#039;s.Good regulation has provided protection for employees and consumers. It has ensured that standards are kept high and that health and safety is maintained. As we heard earlier, the UK is recognised world wide as a leader in regulatory reform. As our economic prosperity shows, we can ensure that those reforms add to our international standing.

The reason for better regulation is clear. We will experience not only the benefits of freeing up employee time but financial benefits for businesses. I am sure that many of my hon. Friends have seen the estimation that by implementing changes to such regulations we can increase British prosperity and productivity by approximately &#163;20 billion.

<a name="50704-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_303">Similarly, the removal of some regulations and paperwork in the public services will free up time for public service employees, allowing them to focus more on the provision of their specific service and improve efficiency. However, that must neither be done through the removal of standards by simply erasing the regulations as Conservative Members wish, nor by compromising key reforms such as increased paid holiday for part-time workers, increased maternity and paternity rights or the minimum wage, which Conservative Members found they did not have the time to support when it was introduced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_304">A different approach to inspection is also required. A large proportion of the forms that businesses must complete results from the many inspections to which they are subject. Adapting the process whereby inspections are made so that companies do not face unnecessary repeat inspections will cut down the burden that that places not only on companies but on the bodies conducting the inspections. That will free up time for inspectorates, allowing them the opportunity to perform more thorough inspections and potentially allowing an opportunity to review the necessity for some inspectorates.

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is an imbalance in some Departments between authority and accountability? For example, let us consider the inspection regime of the Health and Safety Executive, which can rightly force a change in working practice in a business. However, if an accident subsequently occurs, the burden falls on the employer and the Health and Safety Executive will walk away, even though it forced the change in working practice.

Friend the Chancellor clearly demonstrated his commitment in the Budget, and Departments will be challenged to simplify and reduce regulations. The move to a more intelligent, risk-based approach will be good for most businesses, which will experience a lightening of their load. By reducing the number of inspectors who deal with business from 29 to seven and those who deal with public services from 11 to four, businesses, the public sector and the inspectorates will all become more efficient.We are beginning to experience improvements in Departments; for example, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has committed itself to reducing its administrative burden by 25 per cent.

We want our business leaders to develop their businesses and to be able to face the challenges of an ever-changing world.

Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood). He did not say anything about the balance of payments, the record UK trade deficit, or the fall in our productivity. Nor did he say anything about the offshoring of manufacturing jobs.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_311">The Minister did not say very much about our loss of competitive position, which is very serious indeed. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham mentioned the fact that we have fallen in the World

</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_312">The Minister should take on board the fact that the overall picture is far from rosy. The problem is that we are undermining many of the important supply-side reforms that took place in the 1980s and 1990s. That matters, and we have fallen in the league of world competitive rankings entirely as a result of excessive regulation and red tape. That observation is backed up by every independent commentator, including the CBI, the Institute of Directors, the Engineering Employers Federation, the British Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of Small Businesses and the Forum of Private Business. When describing the level of regulation that had been put on business, my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham mentioned a figure of &#163;40 billion-plus since 1998. In fact, the CBI&#039;s figures are worse, because they show that the annual level of increase is &#163;6 billion. That obviously works out at an even more worrying figure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_313">In the few brief moments available to me, I should like to examine some of the drivers of regulation, and to work out what we could do to reverse them. One of the main drivers is undoubtedly the European Union, which is responsible for roughly 40 per cent. of all the regulations affecting industry and business in this country. As my right hon. Friend pointed out, we should not just sit back and take on the chin every one of those EU directives. When the Conservatives were in government, we had an opt-out from the social chapter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_314">The Prime Minister may talk about the deficiencies of the European business and social model, rail against some of the directives coming down the track, and complain bitterly about the agency workers directive, but we are completely powerless to do anything whatever about it. We can argue our corner, but because we are signed up to the social chapter, we have no right of veto&#151;we have to implement whatever the directives require. We have no flexibility whatever. Therefore what the Prime Minister says about the deficiencies of the EU social model, and the need to move closer to the American model with a free market economy, will mean nothing unless we can get back an opt-out from the social chapter. It was claimed that that was impossible, that we would have to renegotiate various treaties and use our bargaining position, and that it would be completely unfeasible. How negative is that? If we go in with that attitude, of course we will not make progress. The Government have made it clear that they are not interested in changing anything for the better.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_315">The second driver of excess regulation, as I see it, is gold-plating&#151;that peculiar British habit and tradition of extending the scope of directives, not taking advantage of derogations that might be on offer, and providing much tougher sanctions than demanded by the directive. There 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 119</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>are many examples of that, but I will give just one, which I examined when I dealt with employment matters from the Front Bench in the previous Parliament&#151;the EU part-time workers regulations, implemented through a statutory instrument in 2000. The EU directive stated that part-time workers must have the same rights as full-time employees, but left member states to decide how to implement the requirement. The UK regulations, however, included a provision that UK firms must issue any part-time employee who queried their terms and conditions with a written statement setting out all the reasons within 14 days&#151;a much more onerous provision than in any other EU country. No wonder the British Chambers of Commerce argued that that was a classic case of gold-plating. Until we get a grip of this peculiar UK phenomenon, we will not significantly improve the situation in terms of excessive regulations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_316">Obviously, the third driver are Her Majesty&#039;s Government. All Opposition Members know that they have interfered and deliberately over-regulated. For example, Employment Act after Employment Act has put more burdens on business, escalating central control and intervening the whole time. In many areas, the Government have gratuitously and unnecessarily placed extra burdens on business.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_317">That goes hand in hand with what I have described as    the fourth driver of excessive regulation&#151;administrative creep, or the extent to which government has grown in size. As my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) has pointed out many times, the bigger government becomes, the greater the propensity to regulate and interfere. I find the sheer extent of that growth very worrying and disturbing. One of the statistics that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster did not mention was the change in central Government employment since 1997. He talked about how well the economy was going, and how unemployment had fallen, but he did not mention the 1 million job losses in manufacturing. Obviously, they have been compensated for by the huge increase in jobs in central Government. One would have hoped that Britain would be at the forefront of trying to drive forward wealth creation, but while central Government employment has fallen by roughly 8 per cent. in countries such as France, Germany, Sweden, New Zealand and Italy since 1997, the UK lies in second place in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development world chart, with an increase of 8 per cent. Of course we need more doctors, teachers and nurses, but we do not need all these people interfering.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_318">One example of that is the Department of Trade and Industry. Many of the great industries have been transferred out of the state sector into the private sector. One would have expected the DTI to become smaller. Far from it: its budget has risen from &#163;2.7 billion in 1998 to &#163;5.2 billion in 2005&#150;06, and the number of civil servants and other employees has almost doubled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_319">Nothing that we heard from the Minister will do anything about those drivers. We heard nothing from him about how the compensation culture will be dealt with. We heard nothing about the huge extra burden imposed on businesses by the increase in insurance premiums, and nothing about the time and effort that businesses must now devote to employment tribunals in

<br>&nbsp;<br>an attempt to combat that compensation culture. Unless we can change attitudes in Whitehall and reverse the &quot;big government&quot; process which means more interference and more regulation, we will not be serious about deregulation, wealth creation and encouraging entrepreneurs.

 Before I came to the House, I was fortunate enough to do a job that I loved. I was a lecturer at Cranfield School of Management. Over the past seven years I have helped scores of my students to start their own businesses, and have helped scores of entrepreneurs to enable their businesses to grow profitably. The businesses range from Moonpig.com, an online greetings card business, to Real Burger World, a slow-food burger company in south London which I heartily recommend to Members. I also advised many companies whose representatives took advantage of Cranfield&#039;s business growth programme. When I talked to those people I heard many complaints about cash flow, about late payments from suppliers and customers, and about the difficulty of growing a business while keeping it profitable. Better regulation, however, was not the subject of the biggest or the most important complaints.

It should allow small businesses to compete effectively against large companies, and allow them to compete for public contracts; we in this country have not always been successful in that regard. Such reform should also ensure that smaller and larger companies have equal access to finance. However, it should also remember that business takes place in society; that the environment should not be polluted; that fly-tipping instead of paying for waste disposal is a crime; that employees should have training in machinery and health and safety; and that no construction project or &quot;dream building&quot; is worth the life of a worker who is killed or crushed by machinery.

I am delighted that one of our priorities for the EU presidency is to lead the way on better regulation, and to ensure that fewer regulations come from Brussels. We have been successful in taking that message to other European countries, and there is a willingness to learn and to share our experience. But I also welcome legislation from Europe that helps our small businesses to compete better in a global marketplace.

That was clearly wonderful news for his business, because for a short while he was able to enjoy that rare thing that most businesses dream of&#151;a monopoly. In our efforts to make the best, most environmentally friendly products in Europe, legislation can in fact act as a market opportunity, in which our world-class businesses can compete and thrive.

They remembered the banks knocking on their doors in 1991, when interest rates hit 10 per cent. and peaked at 15 per cent. They remembered 1992 to 1996, when 1,000 businesses a week went bust.

<a name="stpa_333">Let us put regulation in its place; it serves us, not the other way round. Small businesses are run by human beings with families who understand the pressures of the modern world. When the Government were introducing maternity rights, one owner-manager said to me, &quot;All this talk about not employing pregnant women&#151;I&#039;d hire someone who was nine months&#039; pregnant if she was the best person for the job.&quot; Small business owners live in the real world, and they want real-world solutions.

<p><a name="st_336"><a name="50704-37_spnew1"><b> Mr. Brooks Newmark  (Braintree) (Con):</b> 
 I would like to thank the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) for her contribution. I felt that, with her experience of small business, she made some very sensible points, particularly about the need to strike a fair balance with regulation. Nevertheless, I would like to remind Labour Members of their 1997 manifesto commitment:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">&quot;We will not impose burdensome regulations on businesses, because we understand that successful businesses must keep costs down.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-37_para14">
<a name="stpa_336">As we have heard from many Members this evening, earlier this year the British Chambers of Commerce published its latest findings, showing that the costs of new business regulations introduced since 1997 are now approaching &#163;40 billion. That figure actually excludes the national minimum wage. It does not include it, as the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) claimed that it did. Indeed, the CBI has said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">&quot;The Government must stem the red tape tide and make the regulatory environment more business-friendly. There is a pressing need for regulations to be cut-back and simplified.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-37_para15">
<a name="stpa_337">Nevertheless, the Government announced back in August 1998 that no policy proposal that had an impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies should be considered by Ministers without a regulatory impact assessment first being carried out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-37_para16">
<a name="stpa_338">While regulatory impact assessments are in theory required to estimate the costs and benefits of regulation, there is no indication in the Cabinet Office guidance notes that proposed regulations should be aborted if, as is increasingly the case, their costs to business are found to outweigh their benefits. Indeed, the British Chambers of Commerce found that 23 per cent. of the RIAs it sampled in 2002&#150;03 did not even attempt to quantify costs to business, and that 71 per cent. did not quantify the benefits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-37_para17">
<a name="stpa_339">Another problem is that the scope of cost-benefit analysis carried out in regulatory impact assessments is drawn extremely widely. The former Cabinet Office Minister, now the Minister for Europe, the right hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, South (Mr. Alexander), said that an RIA procedure
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42">&quot;requires the responsible Minister to certify that he or she is satisfied that the benefits of the proposed measure justify its costs. The Minister will consider the full range of benefits arising from the measure, including social, environmental and economic&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 22 July 2004; Vol. 424, c. 515W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-37_para18">
<a name="stpa_340">However, there is no objective way of measuring social or environmental benefit. RIAs can easily be reduced to subjective impressions. Furthermore, there is little scrutiny of the extent to which the particular costs and benefits predicted by officials prove accurate, once regulation actually comes into force.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-37_para19">
<a name="stpa_341">Professor Ambler and Francis Chittenden, who studied 165 of the 197 RIAs published between July 2002 and June 2003, found that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;in many cases completion of RIAs remains a bureaucratic task to be despatched with as little effort as possible.&quot;</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-37_para20">
<a name="stpa_342">That impression was reinforced by a Government special adviser, who told the Social Market Foundation&#039;s regulatory best practice group:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44">&quot;It would not be far off the truth to say that&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_344">an RIA.
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">&quot;They have never made any difference to our work&#151;we&#039;ve got commitments to discharge and we&#039;re not going to let procedure get in our way.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-37_para23">
<a name="stpa_345">So far, approximately 1,100 regulatory impact assessments have been issued since their introduction in 1998. In his study on behalf of the British Chambers of Commerce, Professor Ambler notes that in:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47">&quot;many cases regulation is transferring government&#039;s administrative and social policy onto industry. In other words, whether intentionally or not, many regulations act as a form of taxation.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-37_para24">
<a name="stpa_346">A good example of that may be seen from the current proposal for the Inland Revenue to take on the role of calculating and paying statutory maternity pay, maternity allowance and statutory adoption pay. The partial RIA on that topic states that it will cost the Inland Revenue &#163;55 million in one-off costs and &#163;26 million a year in ongoing costs to take that work over from employers. Since employers are currently required to administer those payments on behalf of the Government, employers are effectively contributing a lump sum of &#163;55 million plus &#163;26 million per year to the Inland Revenue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-37_para25">
<a name="stpa_347">I would therefore draw the Minister&#039;s attention to some of the BCC&#039;s recommendations on ways to improve RIAs. First, a Minister agreeing to an RIA where the quantified benefits do not appear to exceed the costs should explain why, in his or her view, the RIA is justified nonetheless. Secondly, Ministers, when signing, should also certify that the RIA meets the Cabinet Office guidelines and justify those areas where it does not. Thirdly, where consultees provide estimates of costs and benefits, a summary of those figures should be reported in the RIA. If those figures differ significantly from the Department&#039;s own estimates, a review date should be set&#151;it suggests within two years&#151;to examine the actual costs and benefits, as the guidelines already suggest in all cases. If, on completion of the review, it becomes apparent that the costs of the regulation are not justified by the benefits, the regulation should be revised or repealed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-37_para26">
<a name="stpa_348">Fourthly, sunset clauses should be used, except where the Minister, when signing, explains why it would be inappropriate in a particular case. Fifthly, the Better Regulation Executive should maintain an up-to-date database and website of all RIAs, which should be serial numbered and linked to relevant documents. Finally, the BRE should publish an annual report, audited by the National Audit Office, of the Government&#039;s regulatory performance and compliance. That report should include additional costs and benefits arising from major regulations that have a significant impact on society, the economy and the environment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-37_para27">
<a name="stpa_349">Overall, however, the real objective is the need to achieve a significant net reduction in the regulatory burden presently placed on business.

<p><a name="st_337"><a name="50704-38_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Theresa Villiers  (Chipping Barnet) (Con):</b> 
 What every Government, including our own, have to realise is that it is no longer as easy to dictate to a whole industry or a market how they run their business, because, faced with unreasonable or excessive regulation, many can simply vote with their feet and relocate elsewhere. If consumers do not like the rules that the Government choose to impose on them, they can often easily avoid them by visiting a website based offshore or simply getting on a budget flight to a country where they are allowed to engage in the practice they want to. Legislators now have less power over our daily lives than they used to have and Governments need to recognise that we live in a changed and globalised environment. That must affect how they design regulation, where they choose to regulate and where they acknowledge that they should not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-38_para0">
<a name="stpa_350">Obviously, a degree of regulation is useful to ensure that markets work efficiently and consumers are protected, but it is clear from the debate that the Government have imposed an excessive amount of regulation. They are not solely responsible for the problems, because the EU is another cost driver. A range of international organisations, many of which are increasingly opaque and unaccountable, also shape regulation in this country, such as the Financial Action Task Force, the World Intellectual Property Organisation, the World Trade Organisation and the Bank for International Settlements. We need to look at how such organisations work to try to reduce the flow of regulation that we receive from them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-38_para1">
<a name="stpa_351">As we have heard, it is the natural instinct of a legislator to regulate. In a sense, that is what many people feel that they are in this place to do, and we must produce a political counterweight to that instinct. With hindsight, when a risk emerges, no legislator wants to be part of the Government who failed to regulate it away, but we need to acknowledge that we cannot regulate away all risk and we should not try to do so. One problem is that the legislators who produce new laws do not have to foot the bill&#151;it is not like advocating more public spending. The people who actually have to pay the bill for new regulation are businesses, their customers and their employees whose jobs are threatened.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_352">I want to consider briefly some of the ways in which we might produce a genuine political counterweight to the urge to legislate. All Governments talk about deregulating but few deliver it. As many speakers have said, we need to ensure that legislation is properly costed and that a proper cost-benefit impact assessment is made before the decision to legislate. We need to consider whether legislation is necessary or whether competition could provide an acceptable solution to the problem. Is there a real market failure and, if so, is legislation the best way to tackle it?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_353">To make a reasoned judgment on those questions, we need serious, effective and sound regulatory impact assessments that provide a range of options. As we have heard, RIAs are too often bland, superficial and self-serving. It is vital that they present decision makers with various options&#151;including that of no action at all&#151;from better enforcement of existing rules to small-scale changes in the regulatory structure of significant new legislation. Options to exempt small businesses should 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 126</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>always be considered but they are not a panacea for over-regulation, because jobs can be threatened by the over-regulation of large businesses, too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_354">When the National Audit Office looked at the RIAs produced by the Government, there was concern that only two in the sample contained a series of options for Ministers. We can contrast that with the situation in other countries. For example, in Australia, the assessment for the Fuel Quality Standards Bill included seven options and 40 pages of in-depth analysis. We need more research into standardising and strengthening the analysis of the decision on whether to regulate or legislate. We need more standardised and rigorous data collection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_355">The Treasury green book, &quot;Appraisal and Evaluation in Central Government&quot;, identified another problem:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48">&quot;a systematic tendency for project appraisers to be overly optimistic&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_356">That is classic Treasury understatement. There is perennially a bias in favour of an optimistic approach to the usefulness and effectiveness of regulation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_357">As well as improving the analysis of cost impact assessment, we need to increase the political weight behind it. Cost assessment should ideally be conducted by an agency that is independent of Government. Again, there are precedents overseas. In the Netherlands, such a model has been successfully pioneered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-38_para8">
<a name="stpa_358">Another option is to grant affected parties the right to challenge a piece of legislation in the courts if no proper cost-benefit analysis was conducted. That has worked well in the United States, where the courts have begun to strike down secondary legislation if it is not properly costed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-38_para9">
<a name="stpa_359">Above all, it is important that, when the House signs off on a piece of legislation, we do not consider that our job is done. We should continue to assess and review whether the legislation should remain on the statute book, especially in the case of EU directives. There should be a built-in method of assessing whether they should remain. Ideally, almost all regulation should be subject to sunset clauses. There should be regular review of absent sunset clauses and of cost impacts to see whether the original problem has been solved or whether it could be dealt with by competition. We need to consider whether our existing law is still effective in solving the problem. The House should make such review a priority, as it is vital to securing both the competitiveness of our nation and our continuing prosperity.

 We have heard Labour Members boast about the 2 million new jobs that have been created since 1997, and a number of Conservative Members have pointed out that many of those jobs were in the public sector. However, we should acknowledge that some of those jobs are in the private sector. Indeed, I come from one of the growth areas in the private sector: a few weeks ago, I worked as a lawyer specialising in financial services regulation, which is a booming part of the economy because of the ever-increasing rules and regulations applied by the Financial Services Authority. Even quite large and sophisticated financial services firms require assistance in dealing with the authorised persons regime,

</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-38_para10">
<a name="stpa_360">Let us take the FSA as an example. A lot of the rhetoric that comes from the FSA is highly encouraging and welcome. It talks about a risk-based, principle-based approach, which is largely welcomed in the industry. However, what we often get with regulators and, I suspect, with the Government is that much of the rhetoric and intent is welcome, but does not work out in reality. Although the talk at senior level is of a risk-based approach, when it comes to transmitting that in practice, what we get is a much more rigid adherence to detailed rules&#151;a box-ticking approach. That is what a lot of the industry finds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-38_para11">
<a name="stpa_361">I know from personal experience and from a study carried out by the Centre for Policy Studies that such things are common. It is no surprise, therefore, that even the Prime Minister recognises some of the difficulties with this specific issue. He says that there is

<a name="50704-38_para12">
<a name="stpa_362">Of course, that contrasts with the Chancellor&#039;s approach when he says that the FSA is a world-leading example of how to regulate financial services, but perhaps I shall leave that aside for a moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-38_para13">
<a name="stpa_363">I quoted the speech that the Prime Minister gave to the Institute for Public Policy Research on 26 May. I have read through it, and it is a reasonable and impressive speech, but it contrasts with the Minister&#039;s speech in which he painted a picture of a world where regulation was not a problem in business, in the public services or in the voluntary services. Everything seemed to be absolutely fine. However, the Prime Minister in referring to &quot;intrusive regulation&quot; said:

<a name="stpa_364">I should have thought that this evening provided an ideal opportunity for Labour Members to recognise the problem, but there is no sign of them doing so whatsoever. It is also worth pointing out that the Minister quoted a couple of senior Conservatives who, after leaving government, spoke about the difficulties of deregulation. It appears that the Prime Minister is even more advanced, because he has not yet left the Government, but already recognises the Government&#039;s difficulty in deregulating.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-38_para15">
<a name="stpa_365">I shall move on to other areas. I referred to financial services and, of course, business regulation is a key aspect, but let us also consider local government. My constituency faces a specific health and safety problem with monuments in cemeteries. There is a legitimate health and safety issue with such monuments because some tragic incidents have occurred in recent years. However, a disproportionate approach appears to be applied by the Health and Safety Executive in requiring that every monument, even if only 18 in or 2 ft above the ground, must be rigorously tested and removed. That causes a great deal of concern for my constituents and a degree of sensitivity.

 We have had a useful debate that was powerfully opened by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) and included valuable contributions from my hon. Friends the Members for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham), for Braintree (Mr. Newmark), for Chipping Barnet (Mrs.   Villiers) and for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke).

<a name="50704-39_para0">
<a name="stpa_368">What a pity that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster just did not seem to be aware of the economic impact of the regulations that his Government are imposing. He gave a complacent account of the state of the British economy and seemed to fail to recognise the problem of regulation. All that he needed to do was to read this morning&#039;s <i>Financial Times,</i> in which he would have found that Sir David Arculus&#151;who is, after all, the head of the Government&#039;s own taskforce&#151;estimates that the cost of regulation to the British economy is between 10 and 12 per cent. of GDP. That makes up to &#163;150 billion of regulatory costs on the British economy. Of that, some is, of course, desirable or necessary regulation; we recognise that. However, on Sir David&#039;s estimate, one third is bad regulation. That means that &#163;50 billion is the cost of bad regulation. That is the scale of the challenge that the adviser to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster set out. What a pity that he did not seem to recognise it.

<a name="50704-39_para1">
<a name="stpa_369">Many of us see at close hand in our constituencies the effects of some of the Government&#039;s ill-thought-out regulations. I think of the volunteer who helped to check the electric wiring at our local church hall. He will now have to pay an exorbitant price to be certified as a competent person to carry on doing something that he had been doing as a volunteer. I think of the money laundering regulations that mean that people who want to start a small business and get on with creating wealth for our country have to spend weeks, if not months, presenting documents to a bank before they can even open a bank account. I think of the threat posed by the Licensing Act 2003 to our village halls and to many of our local charities. I think of the social hall attached to a firm in my constituency that previously paid &#163;16 a year to be registered as a place where people could come and enjoy a pint and that is faced with a fixed charge of &#163;1,000 and an annual payment of &#163;300. Those are the burdens and human costs of the regulations that this Government have imposed, but one would not have believed it from anything that we heard from the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

<a name="stpa_375">The Government set themselves the target of repealing and reversing 60 regulatory orders by 2005, but what happened? The score was a mere 25 orders, but they have got out of their manifest failure to meet that target by rewriting it, so the target is now 75 regulatory orders by 2008. That reflects their failure to tackle the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-39_para8">
<a name="stpa_376">The Government promised to introduce business planning zones. The Treasury document, &quot;Enterprise Britain: a modern approach to meeting the enterprise challenge&quot; said, under the heading &quot;Regulatory reform&quot;:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55">&quot;New planning reforms will allow local authorities to cut red tape for new and expanding businesses by removing the need to apply for planning permission in designated Business Planning Zones.&quot;</p>

<a name="50704-39_para9">
<a name="stpa_377">Three and a half years on, where are these designated business planning zones? They do not exist yet&#151;not a single one has been created. The Government talk about things, but they do not do them.

<a name="50704-39_para10">
<a name="stpa_378">We have a Ministerial Committee on Regulation, Bureaucracy and Risk. It even has a Sub-Committee: the Sub-Committee on the Panel on Regulatory Accountability. The Sub-Committee has the Prime Minister as Chair, but just in case he needs support, it has a joint Chair: the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In case the Chair and the joint Chair are not enough&#151;after all, the Sub-Committee is supposed to be cutting back on bureaucracy&#151;the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is the alternate Chair. The Sub-Committee is supposed to hold Departments&#039; regulatory performance to account, but what has it done? What has it achieved and what has been delivered? Of course, very little has happened.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Prime Minister says. It was not what the Prime Minister said in his speech to the Institute for Public Policy Research on 26 May 2005, when he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56">&quot;The result is a plethora of rules, guidelines, responses to &#039;scandals&#039; of one nature or another that ends up having utterly perverse consequences.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-39_para12">
<a name="stpa_380">Those words of the Prime Minister were very different from those that we heard today from the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-39_para13">
<a name="stpa_381">The Prime Minister went on in that speech to describe some of the problems realistically. He spoke about the Financial Services Authority, which was established to provide clear guidelines and rules for the financial services sector and to protect the consumer against the fraudulent. He said that the FSA was
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57">&quot;seen as hugely inhibiting of efficient business by perfectly respectable companies that have never defrauded anyone.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-39_para14">
<a name="stpa_382">One wonders who introduced the FSA. Whose legislation was the Prime Minister so savagely attacking? He was attacking his own legislation. The body was his own creation and the Prime Minister knew that there was a problem because he went out of his way to attack his own policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-39_para15">
<a name="stpa_383">Several of my hon. Friends have pointed out that the Prime Minister has talked frankly about the problems of EU regulation. In the same speech he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58">&quot;About 50 per cent. of regulations with a significant impact on business now emanate from the EU.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-39_para16">
<a name="stpa_384">Conservatives Members know that that is a problem. He went on to say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59">&quot;And it often seems to want to regulate too heavily without sufficient cause. The EU vitamins directive is a good example.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-39_para17">
<a name="stpa_385">Conservative Members have regularly challenged the Prime Minister and the Government on the effect of the EU vitamins directive. It was no good him turning up to attack it last month because when he was asked about it by Conservative Members during Prime Minister&#039;s Question Time last December, he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60">&quot;As ever, we must proceed according to the science, and the position set out by the Government is the one that I support.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 1 December 2004; Vol. 428, c. 633.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-39_para18">
<a name="stpa_386">He delivered a speech last month in which he attacked a regulation that he supported.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-39_para19">
<a name="stpa_387">The Prime Minister went further in his speech by attacking other regulations. He said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61">&quot;A village in the Cotswolds was required to pull up a seesaw because it was judged a danger under an EU Directive on Playground Equipment for Outside Use. This was despite the fact that no accidents had occurred on it.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-39_para20">
<a name="stpa_388">One might think that a powerful example of over-regulation attributed to that EU directive. The only trouble is that there is no such EU directive on playground equipment for outside use. In fact, playgrounds are not regulated by the EU at all. No EU directive covers playgrounds. So we have a Prime Minister who turns up to announce that he is against red tape, who denounces his own legislation, who claims to agree with us on a directive that he has defended from the Dispatch Box, and who invents EU directives that he can then attack. He is not a very good chairman of this panel on regulatory bureaucracy if he knows so little about his Government&#039;s policies.

<p><a name="st_340"><a name="50704-40_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Cabinet Office  (Mr. Jim Murphy): </b> 
 We have had a timely and interesting debate. Among other things, we heard about rabbit holes, the Warren commission, grassy knolls and even nits in the Members&#039; Changing Room, although I have not yet seen those. We also had contributions from my hon. Friends the Members for Ochil and South Perthshire (Gordon Banks) and for Wakefield (Mary Creagh), and the hon. Members for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham), for Braintree (Mr. Newmark), for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) and for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke). I agree with the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire more than most, if only because he quoted the Prime Minister. One tip I was given this evening for my first winding-up speech was always to agree with the Prime Minister when he is quoted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-40_para0">
<a name="stpa_390">My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield said that we need to get the balance of regulation right in terms of laudable aim and risk. She talked with great experience from her life before being elected to this place. My hon. Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire brought his business experience to the debate when he stressed the need for us to support small businesses. He asked about providing one source of information in a one-stop shop for small businesses. I am delighted to remind him that the Department of Trade and Industry website has a specific one-pager on compliance for small businesses. I shall give him that address. It is one aspect of what we are undertaking.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-40_para1">
<a name="stpa_391">Sole traders need one form to set up. Private companies need five. That may be too much, but 20 licences, certificates and registrations were needed to start a business in the 1990s. We have also introduced 400 deregulatory measures, cut small companies&#039; corporation tax and extended research and development tax credit, providing &#163;400 million to businesses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-40_para2">
<a name="stpa_392">We also heard an interesting speech from the hon. Member for Braintree, who clearly has strong and detailed opinions on regulatory impact assessments. He will have the opportunity to raise those specific points when we discuss various Bills in the Chamber and in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-40_para3">
<a name="stpa_393">The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk, in his usual passionate and unique way, offered generous praise to the former Chairman of the Trade and Industry Committee. I also heard him offer sedentary support to the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr.   Redwood) in his possible leadership challenge. Perhaps new hon. Members do not know that the hon. Gentleman served for six years as a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind), who has his hat in and out of the ring. I look forward to that conversation on his backing for the right hon. Member for Wokingham.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 132</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-40_para4">
<a name="stpa_394">The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet has large footsteps to follow in the shape of Sir Sydney Chapman, who had a strong reputation and was respected by hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber. She and others talked about the need for risk-based assessment as we regulate. They were correct in doing so. We are also committed to reducing the number of regulators who interact with business from 31 to seven, to reducing the number of inspectorates that interact with public services from 11 to four, and to introducing not one but two deregulation Bills. We are determined to make progress in reducing the number of inspections of good councils and schools, strong police forces and other bodies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-40_para5">
<a name="stpa_395">We have had an interesting debate. Better regulation is crucial if the UK economy is to meet the challenges of established economies in the US, Japan and elsewhere. It is also crucial if we are to continue to be one of the most successful economies in Europe&#151;if not the most successful&#151;if we are to remain the most stable economy in the G8 and if we are to position our economy strategically so that we can meet the challenges of the coming economic age and the massive global challenge posed by India and China. We will never compete with India and China if we accept the Opposition&#039;s rhetoric about low-cost employment. Our competitive edge will depend on our having the best skilled work force, and on basic innovation and world-class research. Better regulation will play an important part in achieving that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-40_para6">
<a name="stpa_396">Turning to other contributions, the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) highlighted the Liberal Democrats&#039; priorities, as we heard about support for a national scheme of dog licensing from a party that opposed the national minimum wage.
</p>





<p><a name="st_341"><a name="50704-40_spnew0"><b> Jon Trickett  (Hemsworth) (Lab):</b> 
 His speech was barking.
</p>





<p><a name="st_342"><a name="50704-40_spnew1"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 Of course it was, and it seemed to be longer than, in fact, was the case. There was a point at which I hoped that the hon. Gentleman would offer to send me a copy of his speech, and save me listening to the last 10 minutes. He asked about regulatory impact assessments, and I can confirm that, after consultation, a series of amendments have been made to proposed pieces of legislation in the UK and in the European Union, some of which have been withdrawn as a consequence of negative RIAs. He asked whether the use of sunset clauses would become standard. We do not believe that that is necessary. It is necessary in some cases such as legislation on civil contingencies and anti-terrorism laws, but we do not wish to use them as standard, because it would create great uncertainty among business and others about the direction of government. It would also be much more expensive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-40_para7">
<a name="stpa_397">The hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) is rightly considered by himself and others as having two brains, but that assessment is called into question by his publicly stated desire to lead his party. Tonight, he should have used his two brains to help write two speeches for the Tory spokesmen. Without wishing to be unkind, the speech by the right hon. Member for Wokingham was a cut-and-paste assembly of stories from page 17 of various editions of the <i>Daily Mail</i>. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I know that I am being generous. In a 30-minute speech, he only woke up in the final 30 seconds. Listening to him, I was reminded of a man 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 133</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>for whom time stands still. It is as if in the mid-1990s he fell asleep at his desk as Secretary of State for Wales, and only woke up today. He attacked inefficiency in the UK economy and talked about the scourge of mass unemployment, but as he stirred from his slumbers, he did not seem to realise that we have moved on from the days in which 3 million people were unemployed and interest rates were set at 15 per cent. for one year and at more than 10 per cent. for four years. He missed the fact that regulation doubled under the Conservatives and that the number of statutory instruments increased to more than 3,000. It is no surprise that he is one of the few former Tory Cabinet Ministers who has failed to dip at least one toe into the pond of the Tory leadership challenge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-40_para8">
<a name="stpa_398">Labour Members believe that the UK&#039;s competitiveness&#151;its sense of purpose and its ability to compete in the EU and elsewhere&#151;is essential if we are to remain at the cutting edge of the EU and meet the challenges of the world economy. We need strong, positive and determined leadership in the EU; we need to continue record levels of investment in, and reform of, the public services; and we need to maintain a stable and dynamic economy. I urge my hon. Friends to oppose the motion and support the amendment that stands in my name and those of my hon. Friends.

<p>
<a name="50704-42_para1">
<a name="stpa_402">Even as we speak, events in New Forest primary care trust are unravelling fast. Only this week, the <i>Lymington Times</i> featured an article headed:

</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-42_para2">
<a name="stpa_403">I should explain that the two hospitals to which I shall refer are Hythe hospital and Fenwick hospital in Lyndhurst. Both hospitals are much loved. Both were created as a result of money raised by the local communities, both have a high reputation, and both were part of something called the community health services trust, which was still in place when I became the Member of Parliament for New Forest, East in 1997.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-42_para3">
<a name="stpa_404">I am reliably informed that running the community health services trust was always financially tight, but that there was no question of its operating in deep deficit&#151;a deep deficit that has become catastrophic in the four years or so since the trust was replaced by New Forest PCT. I would say a word or two about the financial aspects, but that it is not the matter on which I propose to concentrate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-42_para4">
<a name="stpa_405">Certainly a good many PCTs started with deficits. I understand that New Forest PCT started with a deficit of about &#163;2 million. But by March this year I was being told by the chief executive that the deficit would be up to &#163;11 million, and now that gentleman&#151;Mr. John Richards&#151;states that it will be &#163;13.5 million.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-42_para5">
<a name="stpa_406">When the PCTs were set up, there was an immediate expansion of management. Ten PCTs came into existence in Hampshire alone, instead of a single health authority. There have been many explanations for the increase in the debt. I have been told, for example, that New Forest has been charged up to 30 per cent. more for the same services because we are regarded as being more prosperous. It is a fact, however, that the community or cottage hospitals have never been a great drain on the national health service. Even today, the League of

</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-42_para6">
<a name="stpa_407">To be fair to the PCT, I should say that I got in touch with Mr. Richards, told him about the debate and offered him an opportunity to give his account of why there is such a gigantic debt. He replied:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65">&quot;The PCT has a recurring deficit as of the 1st April 2005 of &#163;13.5 million&quot;</p>

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-42_para9">
<a name="stpa_410">I hope that that is clear to everyone, even if it is not clear to me.
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68">&quot;This helped to reduce our overspend last year. The underlying deficit is added to by the funding of mandatory NHS investments/inflation (consultant contract, pay awards, agenda for change etc) which has to be passed on to all our providers. The impact of prior year commitments and the full year effect of last year&#039;s developments adds to our deficit, the bulk of which relates to the full costs of acute hospital activity under payment by results. Effectively the New Forest has in the past not paid the full cost as per the national tariff which gives us an in-year cost pressure. This is compounded by the fact that emergency admissions to hospitals are rising above the national average.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-42_para10">
<a name="stpa_411">That is the financial picture as painted by the PCT. I do not wish to dwell further on that, because the PCT is not using financial pressure as the argument for closing in-patient beds in the New Forest&#039;s community hospitals. On the contrary, we are being given a doctrinal update of what we were given when so many mental health establishments were closed previously, in order to bring about care in the community. We are being told that people in in-patient beds in community hospitals do not really need to be there, and that they would be much better catered for in their own homes. We are told that there will be a consultation exercise.
</p>





<p><a name="st_361"><a name="50704-42_spnew3"><b> Sandra Gidley  (Romsey) (LD):</b> 
 The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the consultation affects Romsey hospital, which is in my constituency. Is he also aware that a bed-usage survey claimed that only a small percentage&#151;some 16 or 17 per cent.&#151;of people in community hospital beds need to be there? But the problem is that it is difficult to get hold of that document or to find out the assumptions on which it was based. Nor has there been any consultation with local general practitioners.
</p>





<p><a name="st_362"><a name="50704-42_spnew4"><b> Dr. Lewis: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is absolutely right, and I thank her for her contribution. A great deal of secrecy is involved in this process, and I give notice now that I intend to apply, under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, for as many documents as I can obtain from the PCT, in order to determine its real strategy with regard to closing beds. It has become blindingly obvious that the intention all along has been to close these hospitals and to remove a whole layer of care.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 144</b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-42_para11">
<a name="stpa_412">I began by saying that we were supposed to have a consultation exercise. I was assured at several of the public presentations that I attended, which were given by the PCT chief executive and members of his staff, that that consultation exercise had yet to begin. I was given an absolute assurance at those meetings that the consultation would come later, and that there were five options on which people could give their views to the PCT. They ran the full gamut&#151;from not closing any community hospital beds to closing them all. Now, we are led to understand that the goalposts have been shifted. The scene has been shifted, and in fact a piece of extremely sharp practice has been carried out. We are now told that the five options have become two. Given the tenor of my remarks, it will not surprise Members to learn that those two options are to close a lot of beds, or to close them all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-42_para12">
<a name="stpa_413">In a letter to the chairman of the health review committee, the chief executive of the New Forest PCT said that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69">&quot;the feedback from the public has been that the most valued local services are outpatients, investigations and day surgery, and that where possible they would prefer to receive care in their own homes. Inpatient beds were seen as a lower priority.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-42_para13">
<a name="stpa_414">That will come as news to the 4,300 people who have signed a petition protesting against the closure of in-patient beds in the Fenwick hospital in Lyndhurst.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-42_para14">
<a name="stpa_415">My time is very short, as I wish others to have a chance to contribute to the debate, so I will just say this. It is clear&#151;indeed, it is a mathematical certainty&#151;that the closure of these hospitals will make the financial position worse, not better. It is absolutely obvious that if 20 patients are to be catered for in 20 different homes, they will require more people to support them than would be required if they were concentrated in a single location such as a cottage hospital. Even now there are not enough people to support those who require attention in their own homes and if the cottage hospitals disappear, one of two things will happen. Either people will remain at home when they should be in a cottage hospital, or they will go into the only remaining hospital beds&#151;the expensive beds in the general hospitals. Indeed, general hospital beds are three times as expensive as community hospital beds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-42_para15">
<a name="stpa_416">I want to end my contribution on a positive note. Hampshire county council, which has been repeatedly rated as excellent, is introducing plans to provide 500 nursing care beds at 10 locations in the county. Out of the 500 beds, 100 will come to the New Forest. If the number rises to 800 beds, including rehabilitation beds, it will mean 160 beds in the New Forest. There is every possibility that Hampshire county council can come to the rescue here by using the sites, if not the buildings, of these cottage hospitals to keep these much loved and much valued enterprises alive. Speaking for myself, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would have a lot more confidence in an excellent county council running these establishments than in the absolute catastrophic mess made by an incompetent management that has filled the local service with dismay and despair.

<p>
<a name="50704-43_para0">
<a name="stpa_417">What on earth is happening, Mr. Deputy Speaker? We are told that we are spending ever greater amounts on the national health service. We know that we are paying ever greater amounts in our income tax and national insurance contributions, but why are we not getting our share in south-west Hampshire? How is it that we are now being told that the New Forest primary care trust may not be able to honour the decisions of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence when it comes to prescribing and that either all or most of our community hospital beds are to be closed?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-43_para1">
<a name="stpa_418">What I really resent is being told that less means more, that all this does not represent a cut at all, as it is part of a new, improved model of working and an improvement in the service. We are even told that these people do not need to be in hospital as they would be much happier at home. Teams are to be provided, we are told, to go into people&#039;s homes to care for them so that they do not have to go to hospital. Anyone who has a domiciliary care package funded by social services in Hampshire will know that the staff to provide those services simply cannot be had. The notion that the cash-strapped New Forest PCT will be able to provide the services is utterly fanciful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-43_para2">
<a name="stpa_419">The hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) referred to the bed survey. I have deep reservations about the work that went into that and I have received representations about it from general practitioners in the New forest. It simply does not take into account the fact that the typical stay in an acute bed in Southampton or Bournemouth is a week, whereas in the New forest community or cottage hospitals it is four weeks, because of the emphasis placed on rehabilitation. Add to that the completely inadequate arrangements for transferring patients from acute care back into the community&#151;let us say in a rest home or a care home&#151;and we have a recipe for absolute disaster. It is bad enough that beds are being blocked in acute hospitals, but if we lose the beds now available in the community hospitals in Milford and Fordingbridge in my constituency, for example, we will place an enormous burden on what is held out as the great prize&#151;the new hospital to be built in Lymington.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-43_para3">
<a name="stpa_420">Lymington holds out an enormous opportunity because it allows the possibility of bringing back some of the acute care that is now carried out in Bournemouth and Southampton, with huge financial savings for the New Forest primary care trust. However, if we close the beds in the New Forest community and cottage hospitals, we run the risk of that opportunity completely disappearing, at great financial cost to the New Forest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-43_para4">
<a name="stpa_421">The hospitals in Fordingbridge and Milford are near the centres of population and, more particularly, near the centres of elderly population. That is an important factor in the New Forest, where public transport is largely non-existent. The hospitals have a good standard of facilities, supported&#151;as my hon. Friend has pointed out already&#151;by extraordinary efforts by leagues of friends. They have an excellent record of clinical and rehabilitation care and infection control. Both are next door to local GP practices&#151;a very important factor&#151;and they both have parking, which Southampton hospital, Bournemouth hospital and the new hospital at Lymington do not have, which is another important factor.

<a name="stpa_422">Under section 10(2) of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, the Minister has the power to set aside the requirement on the New Forest primary care trust to balance the budget. I urge her to take the opportunity to do so this year, so that we can examine the case that has been made and ensure that an enormous opportunity for the new hospital in Lymington is not lost through the closure of the facilities in Milford and Fordingbridge. Their closure would place a huge burden on the new hospital that it would not be able to discharge, with financial and ongoing consequences for the primary care trust.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-43_para8">
<a name="stpa_425">We must also recognise that within our hospitals, acute and community, a wide ranging debate is being held about whether all the services currently provided are fit for purpose and whether some of them could be better provided in a different environment. In addition, as the number of elderly in our population is expanding, we need to look into providing services that meet people&#039;s needs in different circumstances. I am sure that every Member in the Chamber acknowledges that older people prefer to have services that enable them to continue an independent life in their home environment for as long as possible. They want local services, but not necessarily in a hospital.

However, it is important that the stakeholders who lead the consultation listen to local communities and make their case.

 To whom are those local decision makers accountable and by whom have they been elected?

<p><a name="st_367"><a name="50704-43_spnew3"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman knows, it is the responsibility of PCTs, working in partnership with strategic health authorities, to determine how best to use funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, tackling health inequalities and modernising services. There have been discussions and consultations with local service users on the best use of services and they will continue. I am sure that hon. Members will agree that hospital and community services need to continue to modernise to meet the needs of patients. That is the process under way in the New Forest.

<a name="stpa_429">Hon. Members, especially on the Conservative Benches, have always been keen to advocate prudent financial management. There are some real issues relating to deficits and efficiency. Part of what we are trying to encourage, which I hope that hon. Members will support, is a good look at how services are being provided and whether they meet the needs of local communities or whether they could be provided in a better way to meet both local needs and financial accountability.

<a name="stpa_430">The two primary care trusts responsible for community hospitals in the constituency of the hon. Member for New Forest, East&#151;New Forest PCT and Eastleigh and Test Valley South PCT&#151;have formed an alliance under one management team to undertake a strategic review of community services. Nationally, there is increasing emphasis on providing services for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 148</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>patients, where possible, in the community&#151;I acknowledge that it may not always be possible&#151;enabling them to remain at home, without the need for a stay in hospital. That is a vision of a patient-centred service&#151;not one size fits all, but a service that delivers health care where the patient wants it, and it underpins our drive to modernise NHS services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-43_para14">
<a name="stpa_431">Locally, other factors have necessitated the alliance&#039;s review of community services. Five community hospitals will come under the review: Milford on Sea, Hythe, Fenwick Hospital in Lyndhurst, Romsey and Fordingbridge. They are all about 25 minutes drive from one another. Together, they provide up to 119 beds, including GP, consultant, maternity and orthopaedic beds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-43_para15">
<a name="stpa_432">Research commissioned by the alliance shows that only 16 per cent. of patients in the community hospitals were treated appropriately. More than half of in-patients are waiting either to transfer to a more appropriate facility or to their own home with appropriate support. I heard what the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) said about the research on which that is based and I am happy to provide her, where I can, with some information. I understand that someone was sought to carry out an extensive consultation of some 1,300 service users. I am sure that the hon. Gentlemen and the hon. Lady agree that the alliance must review how better services can be provided for patients.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50704-43_para16">
<a name="stpa_433">There are some other difficulties. Some of the community hospital buildings are inappropriate to modern health care and require an estimated &#163;20 million to bring them up to standard. Apparently, there have been difficulties in recruiting the staff needed to deliver clinically safe services&#151;one of the issues uppermost in patients&#039; minds when they enter a hospital. For reasons of patient safety, 20 beds at Fenwick hospital have been closed since February. The minor injuries unit at Hythe hospital was also closed for more than 18 months.

<p><a name="st_368"><a name="50704-44_spnew0"><b> Dr. Julian Lewis: </b> 
 Exactly the same techniques have been used at Hythe and Fenwick hospitals. They relate to saying that the recruitment of nurses has been inadequate. At Hythe hospital, there was a shortfall for a month. When that shortfall was made good and those involved were ready to reopen, the PCT refused to allow them to do so. They are not a bunch a disinterested people who are trying to make an open-minded assessment, but a bunch of outside hatchet men who are determined to close those hospitals. The Minister says that only 60 per cent. of the people should have been there, but where will that 60 per cent. go when the hospitals are closed? It is not even those hospitals that are responsible for the financial deficits. The whole thing is a set up.

 Order. The hon. Gentleman must leave the Minister time to reply.

<a name="50704-44_para0">
<a name="stpa_434">Part of the consultation involves considering the better use of beds. For example, a recent bed audit at Southampton hospital showed that 30 per cent. of patients awaiting transfer from the acute hospitals were

<br>&nbsp;<br>awaiting transfer to community hospitals. That equates to 23 patients for the New Forest. Community hospital provision for those patients needs to be spelt out in the strategy document and should be considered across the piece to ensure that patients are treated in community hospitals, not acute hospitals, where that best serves their interests. However, those people who would be better placed outside community hospitals should be looked after in an appropriate service for their needs   elsewhere. Therefore, the discussion relates to considering how the whole service might best be provided.

<p>
<a name="50704-44_para1">
<a name="stpa_435">The Lymington unit, while still open, has also experienced some staffing difficulties. Against that backdrop, I would at least hope that hon. Members will recognise that the status quo is not an option. The alliance has taken a broad approach to identify a way forward. It has presented strategic options to improve community services for adults and older people to the two PCT boards and to the Hampshire and Isle of Wight strategic health authority.

<a name="stpa_436">I shall point out a number of new services that are available in the community. A new respiratory assessment unit for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease opened on 1 July, thus allowing New Forest patients to be seen closer to home, rather than having to travel to Southampton. The heart failure nurse for the New Forest, based at Hythe hospital with a clinic at Lymington, offers lifestyle and nutrition advice and support on coping with heart failure. The nurse also makes home visits. The endoscopy service, based at Lymington and available to New Forest residents, has expanded, thus allowing more people to be seen closer to home.

<a name="stpa_437">All those issues are difficult because people get used to what they have, but this is part of an exciting agenda, with more money that the Government have provided, to develop services that are not only fit for purpose but that have a sustainable future in an ever-changing health environment.
