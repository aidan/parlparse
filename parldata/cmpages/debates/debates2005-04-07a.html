<p><a name="qn_o0">1. <a name="50407-02_wqn0"><b> Paddy Tipping  (Sherwood)</b> 
 (Lab): How much was paid in coal health claims up to 31&nbsp;March; how many claimants have benefited; and if she will make a statement on plans to increase the speed at which claims are processed. [224748]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="50407-02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Nigel Griffiths): </b> 
 We have paid &#163;2.6&nbsp;billion to nearly 420,000&nbsp;claimants. Some &#163;64.5&nbsp;million of that was spread between 13,094&nbsp;claimants in my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency. I pay tribute to his work in that regard. On 28&nbsp;February, the Department began to make fast-track offers to claimants. We aim to ensure that remaining claims are dealt with as speedily as possible.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="50407-02_spnew0"><b> Paddy Tipping: </b> 
 The sum of &#163;2.6&nbsp;billion for coal health claims is very significant. Will the Minister remind us that the last Conservative Government refused the claim, and will he make it his policy to put more money into more miners&#039; pockets more quickly?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="50407-02_spnew1"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 Indeed. I pay tribute to all hon. Members who have striven to ensure that they get justice for sick miners and their widows and families.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="50407-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Michael Clapham  (Barnsley, West and Penistone)</b> 
 (Lab): I welcome the Minister&#039;s statement. In Barnsley, &#163;166&nbsp;million has been received in the community; in my constituency the figure was &#163;39&nbsp;million. I draw his attention to yesterday&#039;s report by the Select Committee on Trade and Industry which recommends that the 3,500&nbsp;to 5,000&nbsp;surface workers who have less than five years&#039; service should be admitted to the scheme. Will he examine that recommendation seriously and consider either implementing a new scheme for such workers or bringing them into the current scheme?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="50407-02_spnew3"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 I gave evidence to the Select Committee and I understand that its report was produced this week. I have not yet had a chance to study 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Apr 2005 : Column 1562</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>it, but I think that my hon. Friend knows that we give every sympathetic consideration to helping sick miners and their families. The surface workers issue is difficult, and he knows that I have taken a keen interest in it. I have not yet found evidence that would allow us to extend the scheme, but I will obviously read the Select Committee&#039;s deliberations with great care.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="50407-02_spnew4"><b> Jeff Ennis  (Barnsley, East and Mexborough)</b> 
 (Lab): Obviously, the announcement by the Minister is fantastic news. My constituency has benefited from almost &#163;79&nbsp;million in compensation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">I wonder whether the Minister will take this opportunity to update the House about the negotiations to establish a minimum compensation level of &#163;500&nbsp;for chronic bronchitis? This week, I encountered yet another example of a former miner suffering from it in Hemingfield in my constituency who was receiving a full and final settlement of just &#163;53.01. It is important that we examine the issue and establish the minimum fee as quickly as possible.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="50407-02_spnew5"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend. Indeed, on Monday I had a meeting with the head of the National Union of Mineworkers in Scotland to discuss how we could progress with the minimum fee. The solicitors made a proposal, and said that, as their average fee including VAT is about &#163;2,300, they might sacrifice some of that to make up any payment offers under &#163;500&nbsp;up to that sum. We are now working on the mechanism that would allow that to be delivered.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="50407-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Dennis Skinner  (Bolsover)</b> 
 (Lab): Is the Minister aware that those who worked for other employers as well as the National Coal Board and British Coal have some difficulty? As he knows, there is a problem with multi-claims. Some private employers are refusing to pay their whack out of the total payment. Therefore, we must jump on them severely to try to get the claims settled. Such claims form the bulk of the outstanding claims. If we can get that show on the road and deal with the fast-tracking of &#163;1,000, we will make much more progress for the next Parliament and get a lot more money.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="50407-02_spnew7"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 We certainly will. Indeed, we have already honoured our part of that bargain. I am certainly the Minister to jump on such people.

We carefully examine additional investment, and the record on regional selective assistance is that for every pound of public money&#151;we have put in more than &#163;2&nbsp;billion since 1998&#151;we get more than &#163;9&nbsp;of private sector investment. As I understand it, the Quinn Glass production facility is on hold for planning reasons, which is a matter for the planning system. We will continue to support private sector investment in this country. Thanks in part to the stable macro-economic conditions that we have created, business investment has risen for the past seven quarters. The record on investment is outstanding, and it is a vote of confidence in the British economy.

That is why we established the passport to export scheme. In the past, several companies secured public support and subsidy sequentially for some years.

<p><a name="st_o50"><a name="50407-04_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Energy and E-Commerce  (Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien): </b> 
 The emissions trading scheme affects 12,000&nbsp;installations across the EU and aims to tackle the problem of global warning and climate change by reducing emissions. To protect our competitive position in the world, the UK Government have allocated allowances to industry in a way that recognises their projected needs. One sector that has a below business-as-usual allocation is the electricity supply sector, but it is not subject to substantial international competition.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o51"><a name="50407-04_spnew0"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for that reply, but I am sure that he is aware that his Government are in danger of speaking with forked tongue. His Department has agreed to negotiate with Europe on this matter, but the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is the lead Department. Under the national allocation plan, a number of high-energy industrial companies have reached a climate change agreement that will be subject to a decision&#151;taken behind closed doors and with no politicians present&#151;of a comitology committee of national officials in the European Commission on whether the climate change agreements will be exempt from the Commission&#039;s trading plan. The Minister was kind enough to meet me to discuss this point. Will he assure me that progress has been made and that those companies will not face the double whammy of being subjected to a national allocation plan and a European Union emissions trading scheme?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o52"><a name="50407-04_spnew1"><b> Mr. O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 The Government believe that the provisions of the climate change agreements satisfy the temporary exclusion criteria that allow installations to opt out of phase 1&nbsp;of the EU emissions trading scheme. We are working with companies to reach agreement on how to put forward various proposals to the EU to allow certain exclusions. Obviously, the final allocations cannot be made until the Commission and the comitology committee have made a decision. We have, however, informed operators that they should monitor emissions from 1&nbsp;January 2005, in case approval is not given. I take the hon. Lady&#039;s point, however, and when we return to Government in due course, I shall be happy to discuss with her the problems in her constituency.

<b>7 Apr 2005 : Column 1572</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I urge my hon. Friend to consider the precarious competitive position of that industry, which is subject to emissions limits under the climate change agreement. Will he ensure that he takes no action on emissions agreements that will dent the industry&#039;s competitiveness any further?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o54"><a name="50407-04_spnew3"><b> Mr. O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 If we are to deal with global warming and climate change, there will be implications for industry. Those implications will, however, stretch right across the EU and, we hope, across the wider world as well in due course. All of those areas will have to take steps to deal with emissions. We are watching with great care to see how the ETS and the climate change agreements will operate, to ensure that the UK maintains its competitiveness. That will apply to the glass industry as well.

 (Con): Will the Minister confirm that Britain was unable to take part in the EU emissions trading scheme when it began operating on 1&nbsp;January 2005&nbsp;because his Government got the national allocation plan wrong? Will he also confirm that the Government have had to go to the Commission on bended knee to try to change the allocation to make it less damaging to British industry and that the Commission has said no? Who is going to take responsibility for this mistake?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o56"><a name="50407-04_spnew5"><b> Mr. O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 I will not confirm the nonsense that the hon. Gentleman has just spouted. The Government propose to issue the allocation of 736&nbsp;million allowances&#151;which has already been approved by the Commission&#151;as soon as possible to allow the operators of UK installations covered by the scheme to start participating fully, as they wish to do.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-04_para0">
<a name="stpa_o6">There is an argument over 20&nbsp;million of the allocations. Those relate to one specific sector&#151;energy generation&#151;because we have allocated the rest of industry on the basis of its projected needs. Therefore, although one sector will be affected, it is not subject to substantial international competition and we believe that it will be able to deal with that. We also believe that we have a strong case and we are prepared to take it to the European Court of Justice if that should prove necessary.

 (Lab/Co-op): Is the Minister aware that even people who have been around as long as I have can change their mind? When I was on the energy review committee, as a former nuclear sceptic, I came to the view that we can achieve our emissions targets and a balanced energy policy only if we replace our existing nuclear capacity. When will the Government grasp the nettle and take a decision on that?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o58"><a name="50407-04_spnew7"><b> Mr. O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 We wait for those companies that want to make a viable economic proposition to build a nuclear reactor. If they came forward, we would have an open mind on the issue. We have been very clear about that. We have said that we would publish a White Paper and hold a widespread consultation, but I have to tell my right hon. Friend and the many supporters of nuclear power generation in the House that at this point there is not an economic case that is causing companies to come forward and volunteer to build a nuclear reactor. If that should change, we would have an open mind.

<p><a name="st_o59"><a name="50407-04_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Nigel Griffiths): </b> 
 Many small businesses are the economic dynamos of our economy and to promote small business growth, among other things, we raised the VAT threshold to the highest in Europe, abolished automatic fines for late payment for 200,000&nbsp;small businesses, introduced a flat-rate VAT scheme to cut red tape for up to 700,000&nbsp;small and medium-sized enterprises, and abolished corporation tax for 150,000&nbsp;businesses.

Has he noticed that the Chancellor has committed to implement in full the Arculus report, which includes the principle of regulatory budgets and a one in, one out principle for new regulation, yet the Secretary of State has already committed, if re-elected, to new regulations that will cost small business up to &#163;200&nbsp;million to &#163;300&nbsp;million in additional regulatory burdens, according to her own Department&#039;s impact assessments?

The important thing is that the way we have tackled regulations means that a record number of small businesses started in Britain last year, and the survival rates are the best for a decade. Last year, 445,000&nbsp;businesses were started. That is more than 1,000&nbsp;businesses for every working day. We are the party of business growth.

 (LD): I should celebrate the last women&#039;s questions of this Parliament by sticking up for men, because their work-life balance is important too. The reality for many families is that men work full-time and that women often choose to work part-time. The pay gap is 46&nbsp;per cent., so it make financial sense for the men in such families to go out to work rather than the women. The Government have signally failed to tackle that aspect of the pay gap, which is extremely disappointing. Can the Minister tell us what she has done to address the problem?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o75"><a name="50407-05_spnew7"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 The first thing that we did was introduce the national minimum wage, which has almost eliminated the pay gap for low-paid workers. With tax credits on top, that has made an enormous difference to women, particularly lone mothers, who work part-time, as they can now secure a living wage for themselves and their children. We have ensured that part-time workers receive full-time rights&#151;a hugely important step that was opposed, I seem to recall, by the Conservative Opposition&#151;and through our new laws on flexible working rights we are seeking to make sure that part-time working is not confined to low-paid, low-skilled, undervalued jobs but is available all the way up to the most senior, well-paid jobs. By making sure that men as well as women have more choice and control over their working hours, not only will we make it easier for both fathers and mothers to balance work and family but we will reduce, then eliminate the pay gap.

I have no doubt at all that we will want to act on its recommendations, The commission is looking at the underlying causes of the pay gap, particularly the different choices that girls and young women make about the subjects that they study and the training that they undertake. Well over 90&nbsp;per cent. of hairdressing apprenticeships, for instance, are taken by women, but well over 90&nbsp;per cent. of engineering apprenticeships are taken by men. Those young women do not have any information at all about the pay consequences of their choices.

Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight)&#151;with whose views, obviously, I totally disagree&#151;of the opportunity of being in the House unless he stands as an independent, which, as a loyal Conservative, he does not wish to do. Can you make any comment that would help parliamentary democracy in this respect?

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. I wonder whether you have had an opportunity to consider the report of the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which examined the whole issue of complaints of privilege. We understand that the precise circumstances in question might not come within the remit of the work done by that Committee, on which I served on the House&#039;s behalf, but anything that prevents a Member of Parliament from doing his duty to his constituents&#151;which seems to be the case, setting aside the precise circumstances at the moment&#151;reduces the validity of

 Let me try to answer those points of order. May I say that I have the highest regard for the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight)? Ever since he came into the House, I have found him most courteous and a very good parliamentarian. May I say to the hon. Members for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) and for Walsall, North (David Winnick) that I well remember the black days when there was mandatory reselection, and at that time I was a member of the parliamentary Labour party. It was very cruel that Members of Parliament had to leave their constituency and cease to be candidates for no good reason other than vindictiveness. I am not saying that that is the case with the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, but that was the case in the 1980s.

<a name="50407-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">What I can say, as Speaker of the House, is that there is no question of privilege, and that this is not a matter that can be raised in the House. It must be raised with the individual parliamentary parties involved&#151;with the 1922&nbsp;Committee, and with the Conservative or Labour party. It is not a matter for the Chair. I am sorry that I can say no more than that.

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. I really must ask you for clarification. I know that you have been taking legal advice on this. Why can we not talk about such a fundamental issue in Parliament? It seems to us to bring the House into ridicule when we cannot discuss an attack on the fundamental right of a parliamentarian to speak his mind&#151;in this case, someone with a proven record of being a loyal member of a party, who has done nothing wrong as far as any of us can see, although we may disagree with his views. Yet, because of some obscure, ancient rule, we in this House with 659&nbsp;Members cannot discuss this matter.

 That is not the case. The hon. Gentleman raised the matter on a point of order, and what I told him was that it could not be discussed on a point of order. There are ways of raising the matter, however, and it can be debated in the House. The hon. Gentleman asked me to make a ruling. I am the custodian of the rules of the House, and there is nothing that I can do under the rules of the House; but to say that the matter cannot be discussed in Parliament is inaccurate.

Clause 10&nbsp;would have given the Home Secretary a power to direct the Serious Organised Crime Agency to set itself targets to measure how well its performance fulfilled any strategic priorities determined by the Home Secretary under clause 9. That would have added to SOCA&#039;s accountability. Nevertheless, both here and in the other place the Conservative party expressed concern about the perceived political influence of the Home Secretary over SOCA. In the interests of securing consensus on the SOCA measures, we agreed that clause 10&nbsp;need not stand part of the Bill. After all, the SOCA board would itself want to establish a robust performance management and assessment regime.

<a name="stpa_3">In the same vein, I commend the amendments to clauses 18&nbsp;and 19. The amendments would also have the effect of reducing any alleged political interference in the affairs of SOCA. They remove the Home Secretary&#039;s ability to attach conditions to the payments of grants to SOCA, thereby giving the agency greater flexibility in apportioning its funds to meet the unique challenges of tackling serious organised crime in the 21st century. On the other hand, the amendment to clause 17&nbsp;will ensure, reasonably, that were the Home Secretary to request Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectors of Constabulary to inspect SOCA wholly or partly in Scotland, he must consult Scottish Ministers before doing so.

The new clauses inserted by the amendments extend the functions of the Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office, the new prosecution body that is to replace the Customs and Excise Prosecution Office, so that it may also institute and conduct criminal proceedings that arise out of a criminal investigation by SOCA. That will ensure, in line with the Attorney-General&#039;s wishes, that the skills and experience that have been built both within the Crown Prosecution Service and CEPO in prosecuting serious organised crime are available to SOCA. The new clauses also provide for the issue of joint directions by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Director of Revenue and Customs Prosecutions, setting down criteria for determining which prosecutor will take responsibility for any given case initiated by SOCA.

 I have already said that the amendments to schedules 7&nbsp;and 18&nbsp;simply make further consequential amendments and repeals in respect of existing powers of arrest made redundant by the new framework in clause 106. Amendments Nos. 27&nbsp;and 44&nbsp;are intended to deal with a particular problem that we faced in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami with the identification of British casualties. As hon.

<p><a name="st_36"><a name="50407-08_spnew1"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 There is an order-making power, so the matter will return to the House. The hon. Gentleman is right: I have taken part in numerous demonstrations over the years. However, I also remember only too well when I was not allowed to demonstrate in Parliament square but was stuck on the other side of Westminster bridge and not allowed to go any further. We should acknowledge that the opportunity to demonstrate in Parliament square is not particularly old, and that we are trying to ensure that that right still exists. The commissioner will not be able to refuse anyone the right to demonstrate in Parliament square, but conditions will be attached. That has been made clear both in correspondence and discussion, in Committee and in the other place.
</p>

<a name="50407-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_28">Amendment No. 30&nbsp;responds to the concerns expressed by hon. Members on Report in February about the requirement to give at least six days&#039; notice of any demonstration. We recognise that there should be provision for a shorter notice period in exceptional circumstances. The amendment therefore provides that where it is impracticable to give six days&#039; notice, notification may be given not less than 24&nbsp;hours before the start time of the demonstration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_29">Amendment No. 35&nbsp;allows the Metropolitan police to give authorisation for a demonstration by fax or e-mail if organisers agree. This is particularly relevant if an organiser is unable to give six days&#039; notice for the demonstration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_30">The other amendments in this group are minor technical amendments. I hope that what I have said at least demonstrates that, on a hotly debated issue, we have listened and suggested amendments. The fact that the House of Lords, where there was also strong feeling about this issue, accepted them shows what progress we have made on this issue of concern.
</p>








<p><a name="st_37"><a name="50407-08_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mitchell: </b> 
 This is a sensible group of amendments and I need not detain the House for long. I just want to pick up on two points that the Minister made. The first is about amendment No. 30, which deals with Parliament square. Although there are passionate views on both sides of the argument on both sides of the House, the debate was informed by a Select Committee report. There was a unanimous view in the Committee that something needed to be done about the situation&#151;if I may describe it in that neutral way&#151;outside the Carriage Gates in Parliament square.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_31">We support the thrust of amendment No. 30&nbsp;and accept that in normal circumstances six days&#039; notice is not unreasonable, but where it is unreasonable, 24&nbsp;hours is the right period. We are grateful to the Government for accepting that argument, which we put clearly in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_32">I turn now to amendment No. 64. We have some doubts about the drafting, but we are inevitably concerned, as we said in Committee, about what I would call function creep for police community support officers. We want to emphasise that while we do not oppose the amendments, we think it essential that proper detailed independent analysis be done on the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Apr 2005 : Column 1589</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>work that CSOs carry out; any form of function creep without that proper evaluation is unwise, and in that case the Government should think again. With that small reservation, we are happy to support the amendments.

<p><a name="st_38"><a name="50407-08_spnew3"><b> John McDonnell  (Hayes and Harlington) (Lab):</b> 
I welcome the amendments, but in doing so I still find it dispiriting that on the last day of this parliamentary Session we are restricting our constituents&#039; rights to demonstrate in Parliament square. I accept that the amendments will make demonstrating easier than the Government originally intended. We look forward to the details of the order that will ensure that Trafalgar square is not included in this legislation in a way that would allow future Governments, perhaps capriciously advised by the police, to restrict demonstrations there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_33">In most of the debates, people have detailed their experiences of demonstrating in Parliament square and Trafalgar square, but I have not yet done so. We all have a bit of form on these matters. I have been arrested on demonstrations in both Trafalgar square and Parliament square, and on both occasions I was not prosecuted. In fact, on one occasion I was represented by my right hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng), and I received compensation from the Metropolitan police for wrongful arrest. I just wanted to get my form on the record as well. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I heard from the Whips some form of expression of regret that I was not detained for longer, and I can appreciate that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-08_para6">
<a name="stpa_34">In interpreting this legislation we must be clear that the proposals may in some way limit the right to demonstrate in Parliament square. As the Minister said&#151;it needs reiterating&#151;no police officer or Metropolitan Police Commissioner can refuse authority to demonstrate in Parliament square.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-08_para7">
<a name="stpa_35">Secondly, there is nothing in the Bill that provides that there is to be a restriction on the number of applications from an individual, or a group of individuals, to demonstrate in Parliament square. The amendments make it reasonably practicable, therefore, for an individual to submit applications on a regular basis, even by fax or e-mail, to demonstrate in Parliament square, so I hope that Brian Haw has obtained a fax machine and has access to e-mail. The amendments enable him or others to submit a series of applications, almost on a daily basis, to enable them to return to Parliament square to demonstrate in a way set out in the proposed legislation, which takes into account the issue of noise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-08_para8">
<a name="stpa_36">I welcome the amendments. I think that they assist the process in which we can say that Brian Haw and others are not going away, and will not be deterred from enabling themselves to demonstrate in Parliament square in future on issues of critical importance, such as Iraq and other matters.
</p>








<p><a name="st_39"><a name="50407-08_spnew4"><b> Peter Bottomley: </b> 
 I start where the Minister started, which was with DNA and fingerprint identification of those who may have died. It is worth making the point that under other legislation we should make provision for people voluntarily to provide samples for DNA 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Apr 2005 : Column 1590</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>testing or fingerprints for later identification, for those who are not on the national register. It seems that we are restricting the usefulness to those whose fingerprints or DNA may be held on the national register&#151;but that register will not contain everyone in the country. I am not saying that that should be compulsory, but we should make provision so that for whatever purpose may be useful in future, people can say, &quot;I would like my samples and my fingerprints to be available where necessary.&quot; It is a point for the future. I welcome the provision made so far. The House will note that the Minister said that this is not only for the tsunami disaster but for other occasions&#151;we cannot anticipate what they would be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-08_para9">
<a name="stpa_37">The ability to demonstrate is important. Indeed, it is vital, but I am a traditionalist in that I was brought up with the idea that there could not be placards too close to the Houses of Parliament, and that demonstrations would break off when they came past Parliament. It would be better if we returned to that situation. There is the question of transition. The noisy encampment that we have had outside Parliament has not been a blessing. The fact is that it has happened. The sooner we can ensure that people can protest in a way that does not cause health and safety problems for those who service this place, and the general public, the better. If it is goodbye Mr. Haw, then goodbye.

 Clause 124&nbsp;and schedule 10&nbsp;are fundamentally about protecting vulnerable communities and closing an inequality in law that is exploited by those who seek to cause damage to those communities. By introducing incitement to religious hatred, we sought to deliver justice and fairness to members of all faiths, and I am sorely disappointed that the Opposition parties in the other place have chosen not to support the provision.

<a name="stpa_40">There is no ulterior motive for introducing the proposed offence. We have been committed to doing so for some time.

 For reasons that I stated at the time, I supported the clause to which my hon. Friend is referring. Does she agree that in practice it would not have meant that one could not criticise a religion or criticise religious practices? Like a number of Members, I have no faith, but I have recalled on a number of occasions the fact that we can affirm, because of Charles Bradlaugh, who was four times refused the right to take his seat because he had no religion. As what has been proposed would in no way ban criticism of religion&#151;which I do not want to engage in, but which I would not challenge the right of others to express&#151;it is difficult to understand why there should be such criticism of trying to protect people who do not have the protection that Jews and Sikhs have now.
</p>








<p><a name="st_46"><a name="50407-09_spnew1"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 My hon. Friend puts the case eloquently. The clause in no way attacks the right of free speech. In no way does it attack the rights of comedians, academics, politicians or anyone else to criticise individual religions. We are trying to protect individuals against whom hatred is incited because of their religious faith. As I have said, we lifted the wording from that in the current law on incitement to racial hatred. That raises the question of how Members of this place, and those in the other place, can support the law on incitement to racial hatred yet not support clause 124. As with incitement to racial hatred, a high threshold is set. There is also the Attorney-General&#039;s involvement. That would have applied in this instance, too.

 We come to one of the most hotly contested aspects of the Bill, but it is not a central aspect, which is why the Minister has moved that we agree with the amendment to remove the clause and schedule dealing with religious hatred. The debate has gone on in the other place and in Committee, and I shall not rehash the arguments that divide us across the House. I shall make just three or four points.

<a name="stpa_46">Let there be no doubt in the mind of the Minister or anyone else that there is agreement in all parts of the House that we need to prevent religious hatred. The issue that divides us is how best to achieve that. My party has consistently supported the anti-discrimination legislation to protect people from being discriminated against in respect of their religion. Our fear is that the Government have not thought through the effect of the measure that they are putting before the House. We made it clear on Second Reading that although we largely supported the Bill, this was one aspect that we&nbsp;could not support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_47">The measure would curb free speech. It is outside the fine British traditions of religious tolerance and fierce religious debate, which have characterised the history of our country. We believe that the existing law deals with incitement to violence and words designed to cause alarm, distress or harassment. We remain convinced that the Government are wrong in their contention, and right in the amendments withdrawing the provisions. The best way to deal with evil and intolerant ideas is to confront and defeat them in open debate, not as the Government originally envisaged in the Bill. We support the amendments to remove the misguided provisions from the Bill.

Rowan Atkinson the comedian, who enjoys enormous support throughout the country, was famously in the forefront of the campaign against it. Academics, journalists, authors, human rights campaigners and many on the Labour Benches expressed concern about the implications of the proposal and the threat that it posed to freedom of expression.

 I have been listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. I do not want to discuss the issues raised by the play in Birmingham or the Jerry Springer programme, but I wish to correct the hon. Gentleman. The clause deals not with satire or with taking a view against a religion, but with incitement to hatred against someone on the basis of their religious belief.

Given the list of serious organisations that have doubts about the Bill, whoever is in Government after 5&nbsp;May should hold an open forum with those groups, and with religious groups, to reach agreement on what is useful and acceptable. I would support what the Minister might have said, which is that the clause does not refer to &quot;Muslims&quot; but treats all religions in the same way. I praise her for that, because it is sensible.

<a name="50407-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_60">I end my remarks by saying that I welcome the opposition of the community in Worthing to the recent arson attack on the local Islamic centre. I will not say any more because people may be charged. I support the Islamic centre&#039;s open evenings that bring people together about once a month. To those Christians who go there to say that they do not agree with us, I say that it is one of the things about having different religions and even different denominations. It is only a few hundred years since we burnt people at the stake for different interpretations of the same book.

The new clause inserted by amendment No. 39&nbsp;enables the police to have access to insurance industry data relating to vehicles whose use is no longer insured. The second new clause permits police to carry out an evidential breath test not only at a police station but at a hospital or at or near a place such as the roadside where a preliminary breath test has been administered. I think that we can all agree that both measures will contribute to road safety. They were welcomed by all parts of the other place.

<a name="stpa_69">We agree that two key clauses have fallen away from the Road Safety Bill, which will not be enacted in this Parliament. The measures to allow the police to secure relevant information from insurance companies and, in particular, to conduct roadside breath tests are important, and they command support on both sides of the House. We are grateful for the assurances in the other place that the police will be properly trained and supported in administering the evidential burdens test.

<a name="stpa_72">I agree with the Minister that the provisions setting up SOCA are important. As I said earlier, although the Bill was a bit of a Christmas tree Bill, it has been improved significantly, and its central thrust certainly commands my party&#039;s support. SOCA will undoubtedly help to tackle the soaring levels of crime in Britain. However, we need far more than SOCA: we need 40,000&nbsp;extra policemen and women to police our streets; we need less micro-management from the centre; and we need more local accountability. The Bill does not address those issues, but they will no doubt inform the debate over the next four weeks. I believe that those issues are a compelling argument to vote Conservative on 5&nbsp;May.

 I shall confine my remarks to amendments Nos. 39&nbsp;and 40, and I am pleased that Viscount Simon took the opportunity to add two welcome measures to the Bill giving powers to the police.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_73">Amendment No. 39&nbsp;concerns the disclosure of information about the insurance status of vehicles and, by implication, whether a driver is insured to use a particular vehicle. It is a technical change to remove an inhibition, and it is welcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_74">There is a problem with insurance companies that we must face and, again, an open discussion is required. The loadings on insurance premiums for young drivers are now so great that I suspect that a number of parents do not add their children to their insurance policies. Both the additional risk, as calculated by the underwriters, and the fact that it is a good idea for young drivers to be nominated to policies are important, but some insurance companies make it so difficult that some young people and some people who have had trouble with the law&#151;I admit to having experienced such trouble&#151;find themselves making the wrong choice of not being covered. People should be covered, but the level of cover is a matter for debate, and we should return to that issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_75">Amendment No. 40&nbsp;concerns the power to require specimens of breath at the roadside or in hospital. It is not vital to know whether this point is covered by this clause or some other provision, or whether the Government are minded to introduce a relevant provision. When I was a junior Minister in the Department for Transport, if a blood sample was taken in hospital from someone who had been injured in a crash for blood matching, and if there were grounds for suspecting that that person had been driving while above the legal limit for alcohol, it was not possible to analyse the blood without the patient&#039;s consent&#151;I am not sure whether it was possible to analyse it with the patient&#039;s consent&#151;to see whether there was prima facie evidence of an offence having been committed. I hope that the Home Office, the Department for Transport 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

On Second Reading, she set out that improving outcomes for children and learners should be at the heart of everything that our Department does, and that is also at the heart of this Bill.

 I am grateful to the Minister for generously giving way so soon. The Bill misses the point. The real problems with standards generally in education include the bizarre ways of teaching reading that have crept into our schools over the decades and the fact that 60&nbsp;per cent. of lessons in our comprehensive schools, including core subjects, involve mixed-ability teaching. Politicians from all parties must start to address those kinds of issues if we are to tackle standards in our state schools in this country.
</p>








<p><a name="st_70"><a name="50407-11_spnew3"><b> Mr. Twigg: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes the reasonable point that legislation is only one of the ways in which we can raise standards. The role of legislation is important in providing the framework, and Parliament and Government clearly have an important role in providing the resources for schools, but what really makes the difference, as he rightly reminds us, is what actually happens in the classroom. He raised today, as he has on other occasions, the importance of setting. He has also raised the importance of high quality teaching in respect of English in general and reading in particular.

The commitment that I gave today is that in responding to the Select Committee report we shall do exactly what my hon.

It is vital that we as a Department, local government, schools themselves and Ofsted&#151;about which the Bill talks a great deal&#151;ensure that there is coherence between the emphasis on autonomy and the emphasis on high standards, collaboration and real accountability.

 We did not oppose the Bill on Second Reading and we do not propose to do so today. In fact, it is difficult to oppose a Bill that re-enacts so much of the legislation on school inspections that the last Conservative Government introduced in the first place. We support the move to a lighter-touch inspection regime that the Minister outlined; he is right to reduce the burden of inspection visits on schools as well as to increase their frequency where required. Several head teachers to whom I have spoken have welcomed those changes, as well the move to a shorter notice period heralding the start of an inspection.

<a name="50407-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_87">As I said, we will not oppose the Bill. I suspect, however, that the Liberal Democrats will do so, as they have expressed only recently their commitment to abolishing Ofsted and being soft on school standards&#151;a retrograde step that would let down many of the parents who want to see standards raised.

<a name="stpa_89">I commend the work that my noble Friends Lord Hanningfield and Baroness Morris did in the other place to strengthen protection for rural schools faced with the threat of closure and to enhance the consultation process surrounding the closure of special schools, too many of which have been closed, putting at risk, in the eyes of parents, the choice that they have for their children with special educational needs. Conservative Members are committed to introducing a moratorium on the closure of special schools after the general election to give parents of children with special educational needs a real choice when it comes to the education of their children.

There is nothing in the Bill to tackle the problems identified in today&#039;s highly critical Select Committee report on the teaching of reading. That was mentioned by my hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Apr 2005 : Column 1603</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>who has consistently championed the use of phonics; indeed, he has raised it in the House twice this week. When the Government respond to the report it will be interesting to see how they embrace that. Having looked at the research from the Clackmannanshire study, I understand that phonics can make a huge contribution to the teaching of reading in our schools. It is not right to say that the national literacy strategy places as much emphasis on phonics as the Clackmannanshire approach, and we need to ensure that the strategy reflects best practice so that all children can benefit from methods such as synthetics phonics. We must tackle the fact that one in five children leaves primary school without being able to read to the required level of ability. That impairs and hinders their progress in secondary school and throughout the rest of their lives.

 I apologise to the House for arriving a little late and missing the first couple of minutes of the debate. I am unfamiliar with the hectic pace of legislation at this stage of parliamentary proceedings, being more used to the sedentary pace that we normally have.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_92">Having said that, speed has characterised the passage of the Bill. I was appointed to the Standing Committee expecting to take over after its first sitting, but when I arrived at the end to get my orders for the second day I found that the Bill had gone through in a single day. That reflects the fact that if legislation is sometimes revolutionary, this Bill certainly could not be so characterised&#151;indeed, it is rather more evolutionary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_93">We shall decline the invitation of the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) to vote against the Bill, on the ground that he explained: it creates a lighter-touch inspection regime for Ofsted. It would be illogical for a party that is genuinely concerned about bureaucratic burdens on schools and the potential intrusiveness of the inspection system to vote against a measure that makes it slightly less burdensome. We therefore do not intend to vote against the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-12_para9">
<a name="stpa_94">I want to put down a marker about schools&#039; organisation, with which the Bill deals. We do not know how it will work in practice but, at this time of year, when allocations to individual schools begin to arrive on parents&#039; doormats, I am sure that all hon. Members receive letters expressing concerns. There is a fundamental problem with the rhetoric that all the parties have been using in recent years, whereby they promote the notion of parental choice while regimes to remove surplus places continue to exist. There is a fundamental inconsistency in those positions because choice requires the availability of a certain amount of capacity to satisfy it. In the Bill, the Government take on centrally more of the burden of determining some of those difficult issues. They will remain difficult, and the regulations and subsequent detail that are relevant to the problem that I outlined will be important in the forthcoming Parliament and to Ministers, from whichever party they come.

<a name="stpa_97">I believe that people realise that Crossrail is a project of national, not only regional, significance. The strategic transport improvements that it brings will be experienced across the country and the scheme will be a catalyst for safeguarding a national economy that is strongly related to the performance of our capital city.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_98">Today, I simply wish to dwell on the parliamentary procedures of the carry-over motion rather than the detail and substance of the Bill. However, I shall say a few more introductory words. In transport benefits, Crossrail will enable better access to the capital for the hundreds of thousands of workers who commute into London every day. It will provide strategic interchanges for local, national and international business and leisure travellers. In economic benefits, London plays a major role in supporting regional economies and jobs, through commuting, product and service purchases, fiscal transfer and economic activity.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_99">The Bill was introduced on 22&nbsp;February, and has subsequently been through several essentially procedural steps. When the Bill was deposited, it was supported by a regulatory impact assessment, a race equality impact assessment, a book of reference, an estimate of costs, an environmental statement and a non-technical summary of that statement, parliamentary plans and sections, a European Court of Human Rights statement, a housing statement and explanatory notes. Some 4,600&nbsp;landowners notices were served and approximately 400&nbsp;street and footpath notices were put up. The environmental statement comprises some 3,700&nbsp;pages and nine volumes and is supported by a further 14,000&nbsp;pages of specialist technical reports. The book of reference contains more than 5,000&nbsp;entries, which would need to be re-checked if the Bill had to be deposited again because the book of reference must be no more than 28&nbsp;days old at the time of deposit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_100">The scheme as defined by the Bill, including the parliamentary plans and sections, a schedule of works and so on, represents the culmination of the best part of four years of work by Cross London Rail Links, which employs around 100&nbsp;staff and 90&nbsp;consultants. For those who are interested in such data, around 14&nbsp;tonnes of material were distributed to 140&nbsp;different locations to meet the requirements of Standing Orders, which include ensuring that documents are available for public inspection locally. Notices were also published to advertise the introduction of the Bill twice in the weeks of 21&nbsp;February and 28&nbsp;February in <i>The Times</i>,<i> Evening Standard</i> and 18&nbsp;local newspapers along the route.

<a name="stpa_101">The Bill was deposited and secured its First Reading, during which the whole route was safeguarded. Subsequently, because it had already been consulted on but was not part of the final declared route, the Abbeywood to Ebbsfleet route was also safeguarded. On 10&nbsp;March, examiners&#151;Clerks of the House who check compliance with Standing Orders&#151;looked at the Bill, took evidence that notices had been served, documents deposited and advertisements made. They received no objections but they reported that the Bill had failed to meet Standing Orders relating to the time of deposit and notices.

<a name="stpa_102">On 17&nbsp;March, the Commons Standing Orders Committee met to consider the examiners&#039; report and hear from the Government&#039;s agent why it was desirable, especially to minimise the period of uncertainty for those affected by the works, for the Bill to proceed as soon as possible despite the fact that it had not fulfilled the Standing Orders. The Committee decided to dispense with Standing Orders on timing, thus allowing the Bill to proceed. A similar procedure was undertaken in the other place by its Standing Orders Committee on 22&nbsp;March.

<a name="stpa_103">The purpose of the motion is simply to ensure that the Bill can be carried over for consideration in the next Parliament and that all the work that I have described and that has been done thus far is not wasted. Carrying a Bill over an election is feasible and, indeed, precedented for a hybrid Bill. There will be no curtailing of appropriate scrutiny. There will be the usual opportunities for hon. Members to debate the principle of the Bill on Second Reading, and for their constituents to be heard in front of a Select Committee composed of hon. Members of this House, and subsequently in a Select Committee of the other place. The Select Committee will sit in a quasi-judicial capacity and have the opportunity to hear a range of submissions in considering petitions against the Bill.

<a name="stpa_104">If the Bill is not carried over, despite the cross-party support and that of the overwhelming majority of the business community in London, which has been vocal and forthcoming in its backing for the project, we would have to redo all that I described&#151;for example, serving approximately 5,000&nbsp;landowners with notices, advertising in the press and updating all the documents required at the time of deposit, thus doing again all the referencing to check everything that is entailed. Whatever people feel about the merits of the project, I do not believe that anyone is especially wedded to the notion that, purely because of the interruption&#151;for want of a better word&#151;of an election, the Bill should not be carried over and presented for Second Reading at the earliest opportunity. Several people are directly affected by the Bill and it would not be good public policy to make them undergo all those processes again and suffer the subsequent uncertainty.

 I think that the Member has been misled. The last Bill to be carried over was the obnoxious City of London (Ward Elections) Bill, which we did so much to try to defeat. Will he give us some idea of his proposals for Crossrail? If we do not carry over the Bill, we shall have no project. The Bill is the basis of the project. I was hoping that he was going to say that he supported the carry-over and the expenditure on the development of Crossrail. Perhaps he could get to the point.
</p>








<p><a name="st_84"><a name="50407-14_spnew1"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 On the hon. Gentleman&#039;s first point, he is right to say that the last Bill to be carried over was the City of London (Ward Elections) Bill, but that was a private Bill, not a hybrid Bill. The point that I was making was that this would the first hybrid Bill to be carried over since the Channel Tunnel Bill. The hon. Gentleman also asked me to make a commitment to the Crossrail project, but no serious prospective Government&#151;such as we are&#151;would be prepared to write a blank cheque for any project, however desirable people might think it is. If the hon. Gentleman is seeking a blank cheque from me today for the Crossrail project, I am afraid that he is going to be disappointed, just as he will have been disappointed by the failure of his own Government to provide one. The Minister talked about this being a &#163;10&nbsp;billion project, but we know that it is already projected to be much more expensive.

However, we must face up to the reality that the Bill has not yet been debated in the House. It was brought in at the tail end of this Government&#039;s term of office, and what the Minister has said cannot be regarded as a substitute for activity. There has been a notorious lack of activity by the Government in relation to this issue.

<a name="50407-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_111">While I am happy to support this motion to allow the scheme to go forward, I remain unhappy that Maidenhead is Crossrail&#039;s proposed western terminus. Since that decision was announced, I have talked to numerous people, organisations and industry bodies, and no one can understand it. One argument is that it would cost &#163;300&nbsp;million to electrify the stretch of track between Maidenhead and Reading, but that would be negligible given the estimated cost of &#163;10&nbsp;billion for the scheme. It has also been said that Cross London Rail Links Ltd was worried that it would be left with the cost of re-signalling Reading station, yet talks with representatives of Network Rail reveal that the scheme is in the budget for before the date of completion of Crossrail. The money is there, and the only money that Crossrail would be expected to pay would be for anything extra needed solely for Crossrail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_112">It has also been said that Crossrail is not coming to Reading because the company is worried about being left with the cost of upgrading Reading station.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;The Strategic Rail Authority has considered possible upgrade options for Reading station, but is not in a position to undertake further development of this scheme within its currently funded investment programme.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 12&nbsp;January 2005; Vol.&nbsp;429, c. 575W.]</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_114">I am bewildered as to the real reason for Crossrail not going to Reading. I fail to understand why it is not in the interest of the scheme to gain access to the interchange at Reading, feeding into services to the midlands, Wales and the south-west. Why does Crossrail not want to gain all the revenue from commuters travelling from Reading to the City of London, for whom this would still be a better service than going into Paddington and changing, either to the underground or to Crossrail itself? It is well known in transport circles that the fewer changes people have to make, the more likely they are to use public transport. Why make the journey more difficult for people than is necessary?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_115">I recognise that people who have travelled long distances from areas significantly to the west of London are more likely to carry on into Paddington and transfer there, as they do now. I am sure, however, that there are many more in between who would come to Reading and transfer to Crossrail for the direct route into London and across to the Eurostar services that we shall soon have at Stratford. That will not happen if Maidenhead is Crossrail&#039;s western terminus.
</p>

<p>

There is little doubt that it is essential to London&#039;s future competitiveness and growth. In many ways, the biggest threat to the competitiveness of the capital is our transport system. All business regards this as the single most important issue that faces London and it is important that we have proper investment of the &#163;10&nbsp;billion, and rising, across London&#039;s transport system over the next few years.

They have talked about the green light being given to Crossrail when little more than a flickering amber light has been given.

I would like to know why other routes were not considered in more detail. I hope that we will have an opportunity on Second Reading, after the election, to explore this a great deal further. There is little doubt, particularly without the finance being in place, that there is a blight on many tens of thousands of my constituents in Westminster, and I suspect on hundreds of thousands of constituents in London and beyond.

 Today&#039;s carry-over motion is vital, because it will allow the Crossrail Bill to be suspended until the new Parliament commences. I cannot overemphasise the importance of ensuring that this momentum is maintained and that Second Reading take place as soon as possible in the new Session.

 It will not have escaped your attention, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but I am the only Member seeking to catch your eye who does not represent a London or south-east constituency. I have a confession to make: I woke up to Crossrail a bit too late, although I have always supported the project in principle. I remind the House that there is nothing new about Crossrail: the first such services operated in about 1860, when trains on the Great Western main line went through to Farringdon on what are now the Metropolitan and Circle lines. Sadly we lost the service at some point in the late 19th century&#151;

<a name="stpa_134">The Bill as drafted has several drawbacks and I am not at all sure that it is the right Bill to carry over. The first drawback is that it appears to give a lot of power to the Mayor of London. I understand that, earlier today, as part of the deal done on the Railways Bill, some of the powers that that Bill would have given the Mayor were removed. I am not sure that services running to the west of London, which will have a serious impact on the Great Western main line, should be handed into the power of the Mayor of London.

<a name="stpa_136">I like Maidenhead a lot. My family has strong links with the town and my great-great-great-great uncle was mayor of Maidenhead in the 18th century, so I am delighted that it is to have a wonderful new railway service&#151;but that service should go to Reading, as the hon. Member for Reading, East (Jane Griffiths) said. At this point, may I say that I agree with everything that my hon.

 The Worcester-Maidenhead axis is interesting, but does the hon.

<p><a name="st_102"><a name="50407-16_spnew7"><b> Mr. Luff: </b> 
 Sadly, the hon. Gentleman is absolutely wrong. He draws me on to the constituency point I wish to raise in connection with the Bill and the reason why I have reservations about carrying it over. It was alluded to by the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) in what will probably be his last intervention as a Member of Parliament. He is an old friend of mine&#151;I was his boss once and he mine, and we go back a long way. It therefore grieves me to have to draw the House&#039;s attention to the fact that he was slightly wrong. In fact, although the Bill as drafted will increase track and platform capacity at Paddington station, it will reduce capacity on the lines into Paddington. That is the crucial point.

</p>








<p><a name="st_106"><a name="50407-16_spnew11"><b> Mr. Tyler: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to make another intervention. Does he not agree that carrying over the Bill creates the opportunity for the concerns that he and I have expressed this afternoon to be properly examined, unlike the alternative of pushing it though at speed today?
</p>








<p><a name="st_107"><a name="50407-16_spnew12"><b> Mr. Luff: </b> 
 That is a very good point. My concern about that suggestion is that the Bill refers specifically to Maidenhead and those who know the workings of the railway services between London, Reading and the west know that Maidenhead is a very odd place to terminate services and that making it the terminus could have serious implications for the management of the railways. Although I support Crossrail in principle, I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me that the Bill, even as drafted, does not preclude an extension of Crossrail services to Reading, which is what one of the consortiums&#151;Superlink, I believe&#151;proposes.

<p><a name="st_112"><a name="50407-16_spnew17"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Bearing in mind that I might not have a chance to respond to the debate, let me say that Cross London Rail Links, which came up with the original business case, suggested Maidenhead and all the consultation was done on that basis. Not least because of the efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East (Jane Griffiths), we looked at the virtues of a Maidenhead-Reading route, but we were unable to do that because by that time the route had almost been locked down to the existing one. However, we have said since the Bill was published that we will consult on safeguarding the Maidenhead-Reading route, perhaps as a prelude to including it when the Bill has passed. The issue therefore remains live, not least because of my hon. Friend&#039;s endeavours.
</p>








<p><a name="st_113"><a name="50407-16_spnew18"><b> Mr. Luff: </b> 
 That is a genuinely helpful intervention, and I shall conclude very shortly, as I appreciate what the Minister has said. However, if the carry-over is agreed today&#151;that will obviously happen&#151;the Committee that considers the Bill must look carefully at capacity issues for the west country, Wales, Oxfordshire, Wales, Worcestershire and Herefordshire. I fear that trying to fit all the freight and passenger services into those two railway lines could have serious consequences. The significant sums that the railway would cost would be better spent on other enhancements to the rail network, such as upgrading the entire line to the west country and Cornwall, a sadly neglected corner in the economic development of our nation. That is certainly the view of the west London branch of Friends of the Earth.

 Like other hon. Members, I shall be brief in my support for the carry-over motion, which is essential if we are to make rapid progress in the next Parliament on securing funding for the scheme. To some extent, I agree with hon. Members that, while the Bill is important in putting such provisions into law, we also need an agreement on funding and the cost of the project. Costs are already high. If Mr. Kiley&#039;s figure are correct, they are already &#163;14&nbsp;billion to &#163;15&nbsp;billion. By the time Crossrail is built, they will be considerably more, because inflation will have increased. We therefore need an agreement on funding and, like many other candidates in the election, I support the scheme and the funding that it requires.

<a name="stpa_141">May I draw the Minister&#039;s attention to the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) about blight compensation? The line does not go through my constituency, and impinges only on the southern part of my borough but, because it is a massive scheme, it has an impact on everyone in London and could lead to incredible improvements in transport infrastructure. However, blight is a huge factor in long-term planning issues. Businesses and landowners around Heathrow terminal 5&nbsp;have been given blight compensation from the beginning of that scheme. Unfortunately, people in the path of the Crossrail development, even if they support it, will not have their land purchased under compulsory purchase orders and will not receive compensation in the period in which it fails to go ahead. The planning process would be encouraged if blight compensation were paid from the beginning of such schemes, as that would provide an incentive for promoters, whether in the public or private sector, to develop them as quickly as possible.
</p>








<p><a name="st_116"><a name="50407-17_spnew2"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 To clarify the point about the development of the third runway at Heathrow and other airport expansion schemes, the proposals for the blight compensation scheme are currently subject to consultation and discussion. However, my hon. Friend is correct that there is a legal duty on the British Airports Authority, working with the Government, to offer blight compensation, which could readily be transferred to other schemes to provide security for long-term planning processes.

He will accept, however, that by developing Crossrail we encourage overall rail traffic usage, which has a knock-on effect on the rest of the system.

The platforms at Ilford station will have to be extended, and Seven Kings and Goodmayes stations will also be affected. Just outside my constituency, Chadwell Heath station will be affected.

If we did not carry forward this incomplete and rather pathetic piece of work, we could ask the new Parliament&#151;it will, after all, be full of thrusting new Members with exciting new ideas and hopefully many new Ministers as well&#151;to do the job properly. It could take into consideration the points made by the Members present today and perhaps come up with something much more viable and useful. In other words, carry-over would probably be the worst thing to do in this case. A fresh outlook with fresh minds and initiatives would be by far the best.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I seek your advice about the contents of an e-mail sent by Nick Barrett, chief executive of the Ramblers Association, to other staff members, describing the arrangements for leave for the Labour candidate in the Congleton constituency, who is himself an employee of the Ramblers Association. I have just received a copy of the e-mail, in which Nick Barrett, the chief executive, states that Nick Milton, the candidate,


</p>

It is particularly unfortunate that this wicked move by someone who is apparently employed by a charity, of all things, should happen at this very moment, probably taking advantage of the fact that little or no parliamentary time is left. My hon. Friend could be urged to see whether any further parliamentary opportunity can be taken even now so that we can put a stop to such wickedness and nonsense.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_161">I will briefly summarise the Government&#039;s position. I recommend that the House accept the amendments for the simple reason that securing the Bill is important for public protection. I very much regret that the Opposition have made a reduction in the number of proposed regional casinos in the first stage a condition of their support for this Bill. The conventions and circumstances of the time, however, require agreement. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Apr 2005 : Column 1624</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>The Opposition had previously supported eight such casinos, then reduced the number to four, and now insist on one. On the basis of the Government&#039;s original proposition agreed in Committee, some seven local authorities will miss out on the potential benefits for regeneration in the first stage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_162">We believe that regional casinos should be tested, primarily for any impact that they might have, because of the different nature of the regime, on problem gambling, but also for their power to regenerate run-down towns and cities. As the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) is aware, we reserve the right to ask Parliament again what number of regional casinos is necessary to test their impact.
</p>








<p><a name="st_147"><a name="50407-19_spnew3"><b> Mr. John Whittingdale  (Maldon and East Chelmsford) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for setting out the purpose of the Lords amendments. The Bill is very different from that which received its Second Reading on 1&nbsp;November. I want to pay tribute particularly to the work of my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr.&nbsp;Moss) and Baroness Buscombe in another place. We support all the amendments, each of which improves the Bill, but because amendment No. 50&nbsp;represents by far the biggest shift, I shall comment on that, as it has allowed us to reach agreement on the passage of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_163">We very much welcome the fact that we have been able to reach an agreement. We have always recognised that much in the Bill is important and necessary, and failure to update the law would leave the public with inadequate protection, especially in relation to remote gambling, which is already a huge business and likely to increase further. Responsible operators, such as those in the Interactive Gaming, Gambling and Betting Association, and providers of remote gambling such as BSkyB, have made a strong case that it is in their interests to be able to reassure their customers that they are subject to regulation, unlike their competitors from wilder shores.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_164">The area of greatest controversy in the Bill remains the introduction of regional casinos. Originally, the Government argued that there could be up to 40&nbsp;casinos, each of which would have 1,250&nbsp;machines. That could have led to the introduction of something like 50,000&nbsp;category A machines, which have been identified as carrying the highest risk of creating gambling addiction. Throughout the process, we have sought to increase safeguards against problem gambling and other concerns such as organised crime. For that reason, my colleague in another place, Baroness Buscombe, successfully persuaded their lordships to insert an amendment to increase the identification requirements, particularly to protect children who might otherwise be able to gain access to the gaming area. We accept that the Government have addressed that concern in a different way. For that reason, we will not press the two Lords amendments that Baroness Buscombe introduced, and we will accept the Government&#039;s alternative.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_165">Even though the Government were forced in Committee to restrict the number of regional casinos to just eight, many organisations, such as the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Salvation Army, have continued to argue that there is a significant risk of vastly increasing problem gambling. In our view, it was 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Apr 2005 : Column 1625</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>unthinkable that a measure that remains so controversial should have been rubber-stamped in the wash-up after just five hours of debate in Committee in the other place. Indeed, their lordships managed to consider just 11&nbsp;out of 353&nbsp;clauses. In recognition of that, we considered that it would be far better to have just one regional casino as a pilot. Although the advisory panel will need to give proper consideration to possible locations, we are convinced that it should be located in a leisure resort, away from city centres. From the beginning, Members on both sides of the House have recognised that Blackpool has a strong case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_166">Therefore, on the basis that the Government have been willing to accede to our proposals, I am happy to give the Opposition&#039;s support to amendment No. 50&nbsp;and to the Bill.
</p>








<p><a name="st_148"><a name="50407-19_spnew4"><b> Mr. Don Foster  (Bath) (LD):</b> 
 The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) referred in passing to the concerns that many have expressed about the short period allowed in another place for debate on a very large number of amendments, which we have an opportunity to discuss today. I was delighted that last night, in another place, my noble Friend Lord Clement-Jones sought assurances from the Minister that if the various measures that we are debating are agreed to, and if the Bill receives Royal Assent, urgent consideration will be given to them by both the newly established gambling commission and the Government. I was delighted that the Minister in another place gave that assurance and I hope that the Secretary of State will repeat that today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_167">The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford also rightly referred to the most controversial part of the legislation in relation to casinos. What he did not say&#151; although I suspect that he would agree with me&#151;is that there is all-party support for large elements of the Bill, such as measures to introduce a much tougher regulator in the form of the gambling commission, regulation of internet gambling for the first time, and other measures that have been supported for a long time. Greatest concern, however, has centred on the issue of casinos.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_168">It is worth recalling that when the Bill was first brought to the House, the Secretary of State said clearly that if the Bill, in the form in which she introduced it at that time, led to any increase in problem gambling, it would be a bad Bill and would have failed. Despite her assurances, considerable concern existed on both sides of the House, not least about the proposal to introduce new super-casinos, as they have been described. It is worth reflecting that those casinos will not only be much larger than we have seen previously in this country but will contain up to 1,250&nbsp;category A machines that would have allowed unlimited stakes and prizes, about which a great deal of concern has been expressed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_169">We, too, sought to persuade the Government to reduce the number of super-casinos and to introduce a pilot period to test two things: first, whether it would add to regeneration in the area in which it is located, as the Government claim would happen; and secondly, to be assured that it did not lead to any increase in problem gambling. We were keen for the number to be reduced, and we were given an assurance. Now, following further 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Apr 2005 : Column 1626</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>deliberations, another reduction is being proposed. We are more than happy to support the trial of just one super-casino.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-19_para12">
<a name="stpa_170">The Secretary of State said that the Government reserved the right to increase the number later. I hope that the Secretary of State will reassure us that that is not a hint that as soon as we return after the election there will be any such move.

<p><a name="st_150"><a name="50407-20_spnew0"><b> Mr. Foster: </b> 
 The issue might have to be considered by me, indeed&#151;but whoever is in a position to produce secondary legislation, I hope that we shall at least hear from the current Secretary of State that it will happen only after a suitable opportunity is provided for a trial of the one super-casino that we currently propose. I will make that pledge on my party&#039;s behalf, and I have no doubt that the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford will do the same. I note that the proposal for a reduction to just one super-casino initially came from my noble Friend Lord Greaves, but be that as it may, it now appears to have all-party support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_171">I end with one more plea, which echoes the words of the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford. Whatever location the commission recommends to the Secretary of State for the new super-casino&#151;and, as others have said, there is a strong case for Blackpool&#151;I hope that we will take on board the recommendations of the Joint Committee that carried out the pre-legislative scrutiny, and make it a destination casino. People should have to make an effort to visit it, rather than simply finding it on the high street. I hope that the Secretary of State will assure us that that is what she has in mind.
</p>








<p><a name="st_151"><a name="50407-20_spnew1"><b> Mr. John Greenway  (Ryedale) (Con):</b> 
 I apologise for not being present for the Secretary of State&#039;s speech. The lottery of the London traffic and the timing of the debate are the only excuses that I can proffer.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_172">Having chaired the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee, I want to make three points that I consider important. First, the issue of mega-casinos has dogged the Bill from the start. It was the most contentious aspect of the Committee&#039;s work. We were introducing a new concept to the gambling environment, on which there are many different views. The Secretary of State and I might have preferred there to be more than one pilot, but it was argued in the Committee that we should recommend the trial of just one regional or destination casino. We did not do so, because at the time the concept was not in the Government&#039;s mind, but Committee members who have observed the reaching of this conclusion over the past 48&nbsp;hours have expressed to me their satisfaction that we can both test the argument that a destination casino could regenerate a town such as Blackpool&#151;which I sincerely hope will be the preferred destination, given all the time and effort that has been put in&#151;and prove that access to machines with unlimited stakes and prizes would not lead to a rise in problem gambling. Although I believe that to be true, I know that many people are not convinced. We need this pilot, and also the pilots involving large and small casinos with significantly more machines than have hitherto been available in gambling destinations.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_173">I think that it would have been a grave error to allow this issue to thwart the Bill&#039;s progress. I believe that the most important recommendation made by my Committee to both Houses was that without the Bill, there would have been an increase in gambling of doubtful legality. We have seen an explosion of gambling opportunities&#151;not just via the internet but by means of mobile telephony, often involving young people&#151;and that is likely to increase during the next three to five years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_174">It is inconceivable that Parliament could allow the Bill to fall, given the pressing need to regulate all that gambling. It is not regulated at present, and&#151;as the Secretary of State knows, for I have said it forcefully on many occasions and in many forums over the past few months&#151;I consider the vital point to be not how many casinos there are or how big they are, but the explosion of gambling on the internet, on websites and on mobile telephones.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_175">I know that visible gambling&#151;people going into a mega-casino and playing on rank upon rank of gaming machines&#151;offends some, but they must not ignore what I consider to be the far greater problem of unseen gambling. People may lose their homes, all their money and their whole way of life through internet gambling that is not regulated. I believe our United Kingdom industry shares my view that this must be a regulated and respected part of the gambling industry, which is why I am so glad that we are to pass a Bill that has occupied the time of so many people for so long.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_176">That was, in fact, my third point. I thank and pay tribute to all the many people who have been involved in the process, not just Ministers and their officials but my hon. Friends the Members for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) and for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr.&nbsp;Moss), the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my noble Friend Baroness Buscombe. They have devoted much time and effort to arriving at this point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_177">This is a hugely challenging Bill, and I feel strongly that this is a good day for our country. We are recognising that gambling is part of the leisure industry&#151;part of our way of life. Some people may not like it, but we must face reality, and I fervently believe that the Bill tries to do that. This is not the end of the argument, by any stretch of the imagination. The Bill sets out what is virtually a whole Parliament&#039;s work after the election: the establishing of the commission, codes of practice, regulations and the framework that will govern gambling for many years to come. I pay tribute to all who have been involved in the process.
</p>








<p><a name="st_152"><a name="50407-20_spnew2"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones  (North Durham) (Lab):</b> 
 I, too, welcome the amendment, but I am sad about one aspect. I supported the Bill at the outset, partly because it would liberalise the industry but also because&#151;as the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) said&#151;it would regulate the parts that needed regulation. I was a member of the Standing Committee, and I found it frustrating that the Bill kept changing. If there is anything to be learned from the process and the point that we have reached today, it concerns the Government&#039;s thinking before they produce complex Bills such as this, and what they want to end up with.

<a name="stpa_178">I thought that the Committee chaired by the hon. Member for Ryedale did some very good work. I am a big fan of pre-legislative scrutiny. Much of that work, sadly, was ignored, although it should have constituted the foundation of the Bill.


</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_179">The Bill was pulled in different directions. I have a lot of respect for the Minister who piloted it through Committee. He also felt on occasions that one week he was being pulled one way, and another week, the other way. He did a fantastic job in trying to pilot it through.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_180">On the issues around super-casinos, or regional casinos, I would have liked more than one. I agree that it will be difficult to have a true test with just one area. We got carried away with the fact that the super-casinos were going to be a panacea, bringing redevelopment and regeneration in all types of areas. That is why we saw a feeding frenzy of various potential applications throughout the country. Newcastle city council, a Liberal Democrat council, is trying to support an application locally. A lot of time and effort have been wasted in local government and in the gambling industry, which have not only lobbied but put forward plans. That could have been avoided if at the first stage we had been a little clearer about where we wanted to end up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_181">I strongly support the proposal that the regional casino should be in a place such as Blackpool, which in its lobbying made a clear and coherent case as to why that area should be chosen. I hope that if that goes ahead, we do not wait too long before we have experiments elsewhere to judge the effects.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_182">On the industry as a whole, I agree with the hon. Member for Ryedale when he says that, overall, we have had a clean industry in this country. It has provided some good quality jobs and is well run. The Bill will add to that in introducing better regulation of parts of the industry. I have only one concern as regards where we are at now, with one super-casino proposed: the potential damage that has been done to the existing industry&#039;s confidence. Whichever lead Ministry after the election deals with gambling, it needs to build up relationships again with the industry and ensure that that industry, which has been well run for many years, is given the confidence to expand. It would be a mistake to think that casino gambling or another area of gambling can be predicated on one super-casino. We should not take away from the fact that some of the smaller, existing casinos do a lot of good work, not only employing people locally but ensuring the high standards to which the hon. Member for Ryedale referred.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-20_para12">
<a name="stpa_183">The Bill has had a long gestation period. It would have been a mistake if it had fallen today for the reasons that were outlined by the hon. Gentleman. Whole areas of gambling are not regulated at the moment, but they need to be regulated. That is what was sad about some of the discussion in the popular press. I understand why certain sections had the discussions concerning the super-casinos, but they did not recognise that today people can go out and gamble freely without any regulation. We need some publicity about the fact that the Bill will bring in regulation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-20_para13">
<a name="stpa_184">In welcoming the fact that this period is coming to a close, I support the proposals, but let us hope that, post the election, we not only get the super-casinos in place 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Apr 2005 : Column 1629</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>but ensure that regulation under the Bill can be bedded in. Whichever Government Department deals with it after the election, it must ensure that it has good relationships with the gaming and betting industry.

<p><a name="st_153"><a name="50407-21_spnew0"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 I rise to put one or two points on the record. I do not think any legislation in this Parliament has undergone the scrutiny that this legislation has. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) and to his colleagues on the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee. A total of 160&nbsp;recommendations were made by the Committee, 130&nbsp;of which were adopted and incorporated in the Bill, so it is about as far from rubber-stamped legislation as it is possible to imagine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_185">Once we have passed the Bill, we will have arguably the most protective gambling legislation in the world. That will safeguard our record as a country with one of the lowest rates of problem gambling, obviously excepting those countries where gambling is banned.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_186">The final point is in relation to the comments by my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones). There has been a process of parliamentary debate&#151;just that&#151;about a tricky issue and the debate has focused essentially on the role of regional casinos and the number of regional casinos. It developed from the position on Second Reading, where the Government&#039;s view was that the number of regional casinos should be determined by the market, but within the context of a very clear regulatory framework, with a veto being available to local people as to whether they wanted casinos. Therefore, the debate to which he refers is a debate about numbers. It is not a debate about substance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_187">It is important that the industry remains supportive of this Bill and has confidence in it. The decision to reduce from eight to one the number of regional casinos in the first stage means probably the loss of &#163;600&nbsp;million of inward investment to some of those parts of the country where that inward investment is most needed, and the loss of probably in excess of 40,000&nbsp;jobs. No Government can bind the next Parliament, but it will be for the next Parliament to decide whether, in the light of demand and consistent with the precautionary principle, that number should be increased.

<a name="50407-21_time0"><h5>3.33&nbsp;pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_181"><a name="50407-21_spmin4"><b>The Minister for Europe  (Mr. Denis MacShane): </b> 
 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para24">
<a name="stpa_209">The International Organisations Bill is designed to ensure the effective functioning of international organisations and bodies. The measures are required to enable Her Majesty&#039;s Government to meet outstanding international commitments to confer legal capacity and privileges and immunities on a number of international organisations and bodies and certain categories of individuals connected to them, or to ensure parity of treatment between organisations where appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para25">
<a name="stpa_210">Under existing legislation, we are unable to confer privileges and immunities on these organisations, even though we have signed international agreements committing us to do so. Some of the agreements are of long standing, dating back more than a decade.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para26">
<a name="stpa_211">For most of the organisations concerned, the privileges and immunities will be conferred by Orders in Council, which will be subject to the affirmative procedure. Consequently, Parliament will have ample opportunity to scrutinise and debate the specific privileges and immunities that will be conferred on these organisations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para27">
<a name="stpa_212">Let me now turn to why we grant privileges and immunities to international organisations and bodies. Privileges and immunities are conferred on organisations and bodies so that they can carry out their functions without being impeded. The long-standing policy of HMG is that privileges and immunities should be granted primarily on the basis of functional need, to ensure that only those privileges and immunities necessary for the organisation to function effectively are granted. All cases are separately negotiated and it is rare that two organisations benefit from identical privileges and immunities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para28">
<a name="stpa_213">Immunities granted to the staff of international organisations are generally very restricted. Of the 3,000&nbsp;staff of international organisations based, or with offices, in the UK, only 80&nbsp;senior officers enjoy the equivalent of full diplomatic privileges and immunities. The remainder have no entitlement beyond immunity for acts performed in the course of their official duties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para29">
<a name="stpa_214">As regards privileges, the Government&#039;s policy adheres to the internationally accepted principle that states should not financially benefit from the presence of an organisation on their soil, and that one member state should not tax another through the medium of an international organisation. Immunity from the jurisdiction of the courts of the host state is justified by the need for independence of the international organisation and the necessity of precluding any undue interference by the host state with the activities of the international organisation. That ensures that the organisation can then work in an environment of independence and security without fear of legal reprisals. That is an established principle of international relations.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para30">
<a name="stpa_215">I turn to the details of the Bill. Clauses 1&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;concern the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Commonwealth Secretariat Arbitral Tribunal. The Commonwealth 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Apr 2005 : Column 1633</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Secretariat is the primary intergovernmental organisation of the Commonwealth. The CSAT is an internal arbitral body established to resolve contractual disputes between the Secretariat and its staff, or any other person who enters into a written contract with it.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para31">
<a name="stpa_216">The Bill will change the following three aspects of the privileges and immunities enjoyed by the Commonwealth Secretariat. At present, the Secretariat has immunity from the jurisdiction of the courts in the UK, except in cases where the immunity is waived by the Secretary-General, in cases concerning motor accidents or motor traffic offences, and where arbitration proceedings are undertaken in respect of a written contract with the Secretariat.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para32">
<a name="stpa_217">That last exception, concerning arbitration proceedings, has been interpreted by the courts in the UK as allowing the courts to exercise supervisory jurisdiction over CSAT arbitration proceedings under the Arbitration Act 1996. That particular exception to immunity will be removed by clause 1&nbsp;of the Bill, which will bring the Secretariat&#039;s immunity provisions into line with those enjoyed by many other international organisations based in the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para33">
<a name="stpa_218">The extended immunity will not apply to written contracts entered into by, or on behalf of, the Secretariat before clause 1&nbsp;enters into force. For those contracts courts will continue to have supervisory jurisdiction under the Arbitration Act 1996.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para34">
<a name="stpa_219">The Bill will also change the privileges and immunities of the Commonwealth Secretariat staff. Clause 2&nbsp;will accord the president and members of CSAT the same immunity from legal process in relation to their official acts that is conferred on the Commonwealth Secretariat staff under the Commonwealth Secretariat Act 1966. The Bill provides that if the CSAT is replaced by an equivalent successor body, an order may be made by the&nbsp;Secretary of State to amend the 1966&nbsp;Act for the purposes of conferring privileges and immunities on the&nbsp;successor body equivalent to those enjoyed by the CSAT.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para35">
<a name="stpa_220">Clause 3&nbsp;confers exemption from UK income tax on all staff of the Secretariat in respect of salaries and emoluments that they receive as its staff. That new exemption will not apply to pensions, annuities payments or to income received by staff from other sources. It is conditional on the Secretariat establishing an internal tax system for its own benefit, as is currently the case with a number of other international organisations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para36">
<a name="stpa_221">I turn to the other organisations affected. Clause 4&nbsp;concerns the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The Bill will bring it within the scope of the International Organisations Act 1968, enabling the United Kingdom to implement the political commitments it made when it endorsed the 1993&nbsp;Rome Council decision to confer on the OSCE domestic legal capacity and privileges and immunities. That will confirm our support for its work.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para37">
<a name="stpa_222">Clause 5&nbsp;deals with EU bodies established under title V&#151;Provisions on a Common Foreign and Security Policy&#151;or title VI&#151;Provisions on Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters&#151;of the treaty on the European Union. To ensure there is no misunderstanding, I should emphasise here that we are not talking about bodies or institutions set up under the treaty establishing the European Community.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Apr 2005 : Column 1634</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para38">
<a name="stpa_223">Under existing obligations, the Government are committed to conferring legal capacity and privileges and immunities on title V and title VI bodies of the treaty on the EU, and certain categories of individuals connected to them. At present there is no legislation which allows us to do this. The Bill will add a further section to the International Organisations Act 1968&nbsp;to enable the UK to confer the necessary legal capacity and privileges and immunities, by Order in Council, on those bodies and individuals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para39">
<a name="stpa_224">At present there are three EU bodies on which privileges and immunities will be conferred under this Bill. They are: ATHENA, the EU Satellite Centre and the Institute for Security Studies. ATHENA is a financing mechanism set up to enable member states to contribute towards the financing of EU military peacekeeping missions, as the EU budget cannot be used for military operations. The satellite centre provides valuable satellite imagery analysis which helps the EU monitor crises across the world, and the Institute for Security Studies adds academic analysis and strategic thinking to the development of common foreign and security policy as a whole.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para40">
<a name="stpa_225">Clause 6&nbsp;concerns the International Criminal Court. The ICC is a permanent court, based in The Hague, established by the Rome statute of the ICC. The purpose of the ICC is to try individuals for some of the most serious crimes known to mankind: genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para41">
<a name="stpa_226">The court is now taking its first operational steps. It has opened two investigations, in northern Uganda and in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Most recently, on 31&nbsp;March, the Security Council passed a UK-sponsored resolution to refer the situation in Darfur to the court. The court will have to operate in some of the world&#039;s most difficult environments, so safety is paramount. In order to ensure its staff can work effectively, they need to be granted the added security provided by the ICC privileges and immunities agreement, which the United Kingdom signed in 2002. The Bill will amend the International Criminal Court Act 2001&nbsp;to allow the UK to confer all the privileges and immunities necessary to fulfil its obligations under the ICC privileges and immunities agreement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para42">
<a name="stpa_227">Clause 7&nbsp;applies to the European Court of Human Rights. The court forms part of the Council of Europe. It enforces the Council of Europe&#039;s convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, also known as the European convention on human rights.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para43">
<a name="stpa_228">The sixth protocol to the general agreement on the privileges and immunities of the Council of Europe confers privileges and immunities on members of the court. The UK has signed and ratified the sixth protocol subject to a reservation on article 1, which requires the conferral of privileges and immunities on family members of judges. The Bill will amend the International Organisations Act 1968&nbsp;to allow the UK to implement article 1&nbsp;of the sixth protocol fully and withdraw its reservation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-21_para44">
<a name="stpa_229">Clause 8&nbsp;concerns the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, ITLOS, which was established by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which the UK is a state party. The agreement on the privileges and immunities of ITLOS provides that the tribunal, and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Apr 2005 : Column 1635</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>various categories of individuals connected with it, shall enjoy privileges and immunities. The UK signed the agreement but cannot ratify it as existing legislation does not permit its implementation. The Bill will bring ITLOS within the scope of the 1968&nbsp;Act, enabling the UK to confer privileges and immunities on the tribunal and so ratify the agreement.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial implications of the Bill are minimal. The only loss of revenue that might occur would be by way of refunds of VAT on travel and incidental costs for visiting officials. We estimate that this would be under &#163;1,000&nbsp;per annum. The Bill will not impose any additional regulation on the business, charities or voluntary sectors. By enabling us to confer privileges and immunities on them, the Bill will confirm our support for the work of these organisations and will be a clear demonstration that the UK is meeting its international commitments. I commend the Bill to the House.

Gentleman. He is one of those people who, even if they cannot make friends, certainly influence people. His comments on what he referred to as &quot;les n&#233;o-cons&quot; in France the other day gave an enormous boost to the no campaign in the run-up to the constitutional referendum on 29&nbsp;May.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_230">May I say, with no offence to the Minister, that I am disappointed that the Foreign Secretary is not in his place today? He wrote to me about the Bill and told me about the importance that he attached to it. I thought that that importance might be sufficient to bring him to the House for what would be his last performance at the Dispatch Box on the Government side of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_231">In today&#039;s interconnected world, single nations often cannot deal with the challenges that face them individually. We must co-operate where possible through mutual recognition of diverse standards, and that in the end requires international organisations. The servants of the international organisations that enable such co-operation to take place have customarily been granted certain immunities from local laws and from taxes. Such privileges are essential to ensuring that those organisations run smoothly, but they cannot come at the cost of the organisations and their members being made accountable for their actions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_232">Although we broadly support the Bill, we have some questions which we hope the Minister will be able to answer. First&#151;he has dealt with this, but I am not wholly convinced by his explanation&#151;the Bill confers certain privileges on EU bodies to which it gives legal status. What is the legal basis for this, when the European Union itself does not enjoy a legal personality? The question was raised in the House of Lords European Union Committee and the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee. Surely the Bill cannot assume that the constitution will in due course be ratified? It would be very dangerous if it did so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_233">The Bill also extends privileges and immunities to family members and the households of officials. I hope there is no possibility of British taxpayers subsidising

<br>&nbsp;<br>shopping trips for members of those organisations and their spouses. I raise the matter because there have been recent examples and articles in the media concerning what has become known as the UN gravy train and the so-called abuses by the children of UN staff. I know that there are planned reforms to the UN and I wish the Secretary-General every success in implementing them. With regard to today&#039;s business, will the Minister give a categorical assurance to Parliament that that cannot and will not happen under the provisions of the Bill?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_234">We have a further serious concern. Clause 4&nbsp;deals with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which includes among its members some states such as Belarus, whose record on human rights is on a par with Zimbabwe&#039;s. Does the Minister agree that we must be very careful about giving immunities and privileges to the ruling elite of such countries, particularly in view of the signal that that sends to those struggling against undemocratic regimes in other parts of the world?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_235">In the light of article 1&nbsp;of the sixth protocol, I understand that we signed a reservation when we agreed the European convention on human rights overall. Can the Minister confirm that this reservation was included in the instrument of ratification deposited in November 2001&nbsp;and reaffirmed in 2003&nbsp;in respect of the Isle of Man? Will he please explain to the House what has happened to that reservation?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_236">Some of the immunities in the Bill concern monetary immunities. Why, when we have already waited so long to implement these changes to monetary immunities and privileges, have the Government chosen to implement them now, regardless of how low the cost is said to be? The country is already highly taxed. As the Minister knows, we have already seen 66&nbsp;stealth tax rises under the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_237">We must take care to protect the rights of employees of international organisations. Concerns have been expressed for the human rights of employees who work in the Commonwealth Secretariat as regards transparency and their ability to air grievances, and about the accountability of the organisation, should employees be made immune from the British court system. Will the Minister please comment on that and reassure the House that what is provided in the Bill is compatible with the European convention on human rights?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_238">Finally, my colleague in the other place, the noble Baroness Rawlings, introduced an amendment concerning the immunities granted to employees of the European Union. The amendment would have meant that clause 5, which covers the various privileges and immunities accorded to EU personnel, could not come into force until the Government

<a name="stpa_239">of those privileges and immunities and of whom they ought to be extended to. Given the forthcoming British presidency of the Council, initiating such a review would be straightforward. Although the Bill does not compel the Government to do so, an incoming Conservative Government would want to initiate such a review. I hope the Minister can give the same undertaking.

<p><a name="st_183"><a name="50407-22_spnew1"><b> Mr. David Chidgey  (Eastleigh) (LD):</b> 
 The Minister will be aware that the Bill has had far more extensive debate in the other place. He will know from that debate that the Liberal Democrats support the Bill&#039;s intentions but have some reservations regarding, in particular, the first three clauses. We have always been concerned that the Bill should not impair the right to a fair hearing. Those who are affected by the immunities given must have recourse to adequate alternative avenues of dispute resolution, a point raised by the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram). Fully independent alternative mechanisms must be in place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-22_para11">
<a name="stpa_241">We have had concerns that extending the Commonwealth Secretariat&#039;s immunity, beyond that required by existing international obligations, to exclude the limited judicial oversight available under the Arbitration Act 1996&nbsp;may risk disproportionate interference with the rights of access to court. There have also been concerns about recourse for employers of the Commonwealth Secretariat, in particular concern that the internal dispute-resolution mechanisms set out in the Bill on recourse for employees of the Commonwealth Secretariat might not be fully independent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-22_para12">
<a name="stpa_242">The Minister will be aware that my noble Friend Lord Wallace took a particular interest in the Bill and debated it at length. He expressed strong concerns about the emergence of a growing class of international officials in Britain, Europe and elsewhere which is immune from domestic taxation and beyond the obligations and protections of domestic law. He added that


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;The justification of extending immunities to families again seems to be questionable.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-22_para13">
<a name="stpa_243">Lord Wallace also raised the question of how far international immunity should be maintained and extended. He felt that the powers, privileges and status of the European Commission and many of its agencies were questionable&#151;in particular

</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-22_para15">
<a name="stpa_245">The Minister mentioned the number of officials affected, but&#151;if I can catch his attention for a moment&#151;will he clarify a point for me when he responds? He said that only 80&nbsp;senior officials, of the 3,000&nbsp;officials of intergovernmental organisations based

 I am most grateful to you for making that point on my behalf, Mr. Deputy Speaker. As I am not allowed to address the Minister directly, I was hardly able to point out that he did not seem to catch the comments that I was making.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-22_para16">
<a name="stpa_246">I repeat my point for the benefit of the House and, in particular, of the Minister. The Minister said that only 80&nbsp;chief officers were likely to be affected by the measures, and I should be grateful if he clarified that when he replies to the debate. Although he said that there were 3,000&nbsp;officials, of whom only 80&nbsp;were affected, I am uncertain whether he meant that. From debates in the other place, my understanding was that there is some concern that the 3,000&nbsp;officials, plus their families and dependents, could easily number 6,000&nbsp;people, and that that figure is likely to grow. As the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes has said, we are concerned that the measure may become a gravy train.

<a name="50407-22_para17">
<a name="stpa_247">In my closing remarks, I shall address the human rights aspect of the Bill in more detail. I serve on the Joint Committee on Human Rights, so I am familiar with its report about the issues raised by the Bill, and I am particular concerned about the Government&#039;s response to that report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50407-22_para18">

<a name="50407-22_para19">
<a name="stpa_249">The Joint Committee argued that in respect of the Commonwealth Secretariat, the Commonwealth Secretariat Arbitral Tribunal and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, there is no international legal obligation to confer immunity from suit. I would particularly like the Minister to respond to that point, because he knows that the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the hon.

The Bill may well be desirable and necessary, and it may well be required to fulfil this or that obligation, but I hope that our agreement to this Bill will not in any sense imply that we completely underwrite all the organisations involved or expect them to continue indefinitely and without question.

However, this is about existing treaty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agreements&#151;we are not talking about the constitutional treaty in any way. Some EU bodies need legal capacity and privileges and immunities to operate. Once one has agreed to European Council decisions&#151;that is where Ministers of national Governments decide, not the Commission or a bureaucracy&#151;or to other measures to establish them, the UK is under an obligation to confer them under international law. The fact that the EU does not have a legal personality except to the extent that it concludes agreements pursuant to articles 24&nbsp;or 38&nbsp;of the treaty on the European Union is immaterial.
