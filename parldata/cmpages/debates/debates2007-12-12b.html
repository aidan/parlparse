We are not satisfied with where we are, but what I recognise are the statistics and results for people, such as on child poverty&#151;600,000 have been lifted out of poverty&#151;and the fact that millions of people are benefiting from new tax credits and benefits to support children, and that children are doing better in education than they have done for many a year. I assure the House that through Ministers and Departments working together and through the work of Cabinet and Cabinet Committees and the delivery unit, we have a robust system to check constantly our progress on how we are delivering.

 With the support of the whole House, I start by paying tribute to our armed forces in Afghanistan and elsewhere. They are doing vital work, giving so much every day in dangerous places in the service of our country. Let me particularly pay tribute to the 86 British servicemen and women who have lost their lives in Afghanistan, 42 of them this year alone. I know that the whole House will join me in honouring the memory of the fallen and saluting the courage of all our military and civilian personnel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="71212-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07121260000171">Let me, on the morning of the capture of Musa Qala, praise the professionalism and resolve of our forces in recent days. They have helped to defeat the insurgents and in a vital district of Afghanistan they have restored peace. Let me make it clear at the outset that as part of a coalition we are winning the battle against the Taliban insurgency. We are isolating and eliminating the leadership of the Taliban; we are not negotiating with them. For six years, 38 countries have come together with the people and Government of Afghanistan to rebuild this failed state, to prevent the return of the Taliban, and to root out al-Qaeda. I can tell the House that Britain will continue to meet our obligations and honour our commitments, discharging our duties on this task and to the people of Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="71212-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07121260000172">Having been reviewing our strategy since July, I now want to announce the next stage. It is a long-term and comprehensive framework for security, political, social and economic development in support of Afghanistan. This long-term comprehensive framework entails, first, more Afghan ownership, with the Afghan army, police and Government building on NATO military achievements and taking over more responsibility for their own security. Secondly, we support localisation and then reconciliation, with Afghans building on the creation of a democratic constitution by developing and strengthening their institutions not just at national but at provincial and local level as we support that search for political reconciliation. The third aspect is reconstruction. In what is still one of the poorest countries on earth, where only one in three has clean drinking water, life expectancy is just 43, and 80 per cent. of women cannot yet read, we will help to ensure, through reconstruction and development, that more Afghan people have an economic stake in their future. Fourth, to underpin this, we will help to ensure greater burden sharing by all partners and allies, with each of us playing our part&#151;as hard-headed realists, not idealists&#151;in the long haul to help the Afghans themselves to govern and secure their own land, and together therefore shifting our emphasis from short-term stabilisation to long-term development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="71212-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07121260000173">The foundation, now and in the future, for our comprehensive framework is military support for the Afghan Government against the Taliban-led insurgency, also denying al-Qaeda a base from which to launch attacks on the world. Throughout last winter, Taliban propagandists repeatedly promised a &#147;spring offensive&#148;. Instead, it is the British and other NATO forces, together with the Afghan army, who have taken the initiative. We have been driving the insurgents and  <br>

extremists out of their hiding places, preventing them from regrouping and attacking the areas around the provincial capitals where stability is taking hold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="71212-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07121260000174">It is this military success that has preserved Afghanistan&#146;s emerging democracy: a constitution, fragile but still intact; a free media; and a changing society where, unlike six years ago when women were banned from education, from work, and from virtually all of public life, there is now a higher proportion of women MPs in Afghanistan than in many western countries, and 5 million children are at school, 2 million of them girls once denied education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="71212-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07121260000175">We need to hold and to reinforce what we have achieved together, so Britain will maintain a strong military force in Afghanistan of around today&#146;s figure of 7,800. That is a contribution second in size only to America&#146;s. We will increase our support for our forces: I can announce today, fully funded from the reserve, 150 new protected patrol vehicles specially procured for Afghanistan, bringing to 400 the total of new protected vehicles bought in the last 18 months for Iraq and Afghanistan. We will combine that with increasing numbers of Sea King helicopters in Afghanistan, and through NATO, new contracts will be negotiated for leasing commercial helicopters to move routine freight, freeing up military helicopters for military tasks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="71212-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07121260000176">However, because we know that military success is only one part of the framework&#151;a necessary but not sufficient condition for progress in Afghanistan&#151;we will train Afghan forces to take ownership of their own security. Next year, we will aim for 70,000 trained Afghan soldiers, 20,000 more than now, supported by a rising number of British trainers and mentors&#151;340 of them&#151;that will be part of an overall NATO training force of over 6,000. Already, the Afghan army is proving itself in Musa Qala.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="71212-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07121260000177">But the challenge of supporting an Afghan lead on security goes wider than the armed forces; it includes the police, courts and prisons. Here we are dealing with decades of failure and corruption, and progress has been slow, but by March 2008 there will be over 800 international police trainers, including 65 police from Britain. That must be matched with a wider effort across civic society, which we will continue to support, for judges, courts and prisons&#151;working with the grain of Afghan traditions but within international norms. One way forward is to increase our support for community defence initiatives, where local volunteers are recruited to defend homes and families, modelled on traditional Afghan &#147;arbakai&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="71212-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07121260000178">To ensure that longer-term political and economic objectives are the guiding force behind the security campaign, we have brought the British civilian and military personnel together into a colocated headquarters. We will continue to strengthen their integration, and at the same time we will recruit and deploy more specialists who speak the local languages and understand tribal dynamics. But again, the Afghans themselves must be persuaded to take the lead in improving local and national government, and on my recent visit I saw the scale of the challenge, but also the opportunity, and the importance of our support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="71212-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07121260000179">I can announce today that from our Afghanistan aid programme, which has already spent &#163;490 million in six years, Britain will fund two additional programmes for local government: first, to help the Afghans create  <br>

stronger provincial and local governance, including building the capacity of the directorate of local governance and supporting civil society groups to hold local government to account; and, secondly, to provide more support for the national solidarity programme, which builds the capacity of local communities to run their own development projects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="71212-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07121260000180">As a measure of the importance we attach to stability in building local capacity, we will immediately move infrastructure projects forward in Musa Qala, which we have recaptured, and upon which we now wish to build, on firmer foundations. That process will include a work programme for up to 10,000 people, and plans to rebuild and refurbish the district centre, and to rebuild the main high school and four mosques in the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="71212-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07121260000181">Our objective is to defeat the insurgency by isolating and eliminating its leadership. I make it clear that we will not enter into any negotiations with these people. As I have also made clear on countless occasions&#151;most recently in Afghanistan&#151;our objective is to root out those preaching and practising violence and murder, in support of men and women of peace. President Karzai&#146;s message to former insurgents is that if they are prepared to renounce violence, abide by the constitution and respect human rights, there is a place for them in the legitimate society and economy of Afghanistan. He and his Ministers told me this week that already some 5,000 fighters have laid down their arms. We will support President Karzai and his Government in their efforts to reconcile all parties to Afghanistan&#146;s democratic constitution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="71212-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07121260000182">We know also that Afghanistan will never be stable without the constructive engagement of its neighbours. During my visit, President Karzai agreed on the need for greater regional cooperation. We continue to work with the Afghan and Pakistan Governments, the G8 and others to help bring stability across the Afghan-Pakistan border. Iran, too, must start to play a more constructive role, and I urged President Karzai to turn the current ad hoc meetings and structures that he has with Pakistan and other countries into more substantive mechanisms to bring stability and security to the region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="71212-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07121260000183">The third priority is reconstruction and development &#151;always at its most challenging where poverty is combined with insecurity and insurgency, but a strong long-term commitment to which is vital for the Afghan Government if they are to take responsibility successfully for the future of their country. I can therefore announce to the House today that, in total, Britain will make available &#163;450 million in development and stabilisation assistance for Afghanistan for the years 2009 to 2012. This money will cover short-term priorities and longer-term objectives.</p>

A new growth fund, starting with an initial &#163;30 million, will kick-start the development of basic legal and regulatory frameworks, build Government capacity to involve the private sector in providing public services, and pilot business training programmes. This will be led by a  <br>

council of Ministers, business representatives and other experts, who will build contacts with the private sector inside and outside Afghanistan. They will advise the Government on how to increase investment and economic growth, and monitor the progress being made. Britain will also provide an additional &#163;10 million for small loans, which will be of special help particularly to women, to start up or expand businesses; 70 per cent. of the initial applicants have been women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="71212-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07121260000185">Our long-term objective is to support Afghanistan&#146;s own national development strategy by channelling our aid through the Afghan Government&#151;which we believe to be the best route to achieving sustainable progress and the best value for money&#151;on a long-term basis, helping the Afghans to plan ahead and, with good governance, to focus on their own priorities of economic growth, improving health and education, and building rural livelihoods. But we also recognise the need for short-term, high-impact stabilisation projects&#151;better roads, more reliable power supplies, clean water and sanitation&#151;which can make an immediate difference to the lives of ordinary Afghanistan citizens and show them the benefits of improved security and governance. Part of the &#163;450 million that I announce today will help to fund Britain&#146;s new cross-government stabilisation unit, which has Afghanistan as its first priority, and which, with a global budget of &#163;260 million over the next three years, will drive forward reconstruction projects and provide expert civilian support to rebuild basic services.</p>

We are providing &#163;90 million this year to help them in their long-term efforts against the drugs trade. While the situation with the poppy crop in Helmand province is difficult, it must be our aim to match the progress achieved in the rest of Afghanistan, where the number of poppy-free provinces has increased from six to 13 through a combination of stronger governance, targeted eradication&#151;on which I have urged President Karzai to move forward&#151;disruption of traffickers, strengthening of the justice system, and promoting legitimate agriculture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="71212-0004.htm_para16"><a name="07121260000187">We will continue to work with our partners who have proved steadfast in Afghanistan, and I welcome the recent announcements from Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Germany and Estonia that they will maintain or increase their troop numbers. This progress must, I believe, now be matched by contributions from other countries in NATO, the EU and beyond. We are talking to all our partners to address the immediate need for more training teams for the Afghan security forces, especially the police, and we are having detailed talks with a number of countries on more support helicopters, which are needed. Where countries are unable to deploy their own troops or equipment, we are urging them to look at innovative ways to burden share and to help to fund those countries that can provide troops and equipment.</p>

security, governance and economic development. Because this priority and the need for a more consistent, integrated and co-ordinated international approach are now recognised across our partners, Britain continues to push for what will be the next step in this process: the appointment of a strong UN envoy to bring greater coherence across the international effort in security, governance and development and in relations with the Afghan Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="71212-0004.htm_para18"><a name="07121260000189">Britain will continue to fulfil our obligations to the Afghan people and the international community. We will support the Afghan army, police and Government as they progressively take over greater responsibility for their own security. We will work with our international partners and help the Afghans themselves to strengthen stability, foster democracy and build prosperity. At all times we will support the hard work, dedication, professionalism and courage of our armed forces, who are doing everything in their power to defeat terrorism and to lay the foundations of a stable and secure future for Afghanistan. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

 I thank the Prime Minister for his statement; there is much in it that we support and welcome, particularly what he said about equipment. With the recent success in Musa Qala, I believe that we can say that the men and women serving in Helmand today are every bit the equal of those who stormed the beaches in Normandy, who held the line at Inchon in the Korean war, or who retook the Falkland Islands.</p>

I am sure that this is the time that the whole House will want to send them our very strongest backing. [Hon. Members: &#147;Hear, hear.] I have been to Helmand twice in the last two years, and I have set out previously the significant course corrections that we need to make to avoid failing in Afghanistan. To prevent failure, I believe that we have to follow three principles: first, that, as the Prime Minister said, military success alone is not enough; secondly, that greater political progress is needed, based on a practical approach, rather than believing that we can impose a fully fledged western democracy in a deeply traditional society; and, thirdly, that the international effort needs to be much better co-ordinated.</p>

Does that not demonstrate once again the error of briefing the press in advance of making statements in this House? But is it not more serious than that?

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para1"><a name="07121260000194">Specifically on British forces, we have seen success in Sangin, at the Kajaki dam and now in Musa Qala, but is the Prime Minister satisfied that this time, there are sufficient Afghan forces to hold the ground that has been taken? On equipment and training, Lord Guthrie recently raised the example of a brigade being deployed to Afghanistan without having first been trained on medium machine guns. Is the Prime Minister satisfied that this will not happen again? As he knows, one cannot spend time in Helmand without hearing concerns about the lack of battlefield helicopters. He talked about that in his statement. Does he now regret the decision to cut the helicopter budget by &#163;1.4 billion in 2004, and can he explain why the Government waited until this year before placing orders for new and converted helicopters?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para2"><a name="07121260000195">The Prime Minister talked about burden sharing. Can he tell us precisely what progress is being made in ensuring that we get a greater contribution from our NATO allies?</p>

Will he now take up another suggestion&#151;simple&#151;that soldiers&#146; leave should begin when they step off the aircraft on UK soil, not when they leave Afghanistan?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para4"><a name="07121260000197">On pay, is it not now clear that the new Ministry of Defence computerised pay system is not working properly? We had problems with the Royal Air Force earlier, and now we have some Territorial Army officers not being paid at all. Can the Prime Minister tell us today how many people are not being paid properly and what he is doing to put these failures right?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para5"><a name="07121260000198">Next, political progress. The general problem is that the writ of the Karzai Government does not extend to the whole country. In many places, Helmand included, the Afghan police are seen as corrupt. What steps are we taking in terms of mentoring, leadership, training, pay and discipline structures, and after six years, why are we still not getting this right?

We have been arguing for more than a year that there should be a single high-profile figure to take charge of co-ordinating the international effort and providing real leadership in the way that Lord Ashdown did in Bosnia.

corrected after they have gone out, but he might want to advise the Prime Minister rather more about how to get the content right in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para8"><a name="07121260000203">On aid&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Calm down, dear; there are more questions to answer. On aid, can the Prime Minister&#151;with the help of the Foreign Secretary, who is now fully engaged in this&#151;tell us how much of the very substantial UK aid is being spent in Helmand and how much in the rest of the country? Should we not be focusing our aid efforts to a much greater extent where our soldiers are deployed and where so much is at stake?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para9"><a name="07121260000204">This country is giving a tremendous amount to Afghanistan in money and in lives. Conservative Members believe that it is a worthwhile effort, but the country wants reassurance. With that in mind, can the Prime Minister give a commitment to full quarterly reports to Parliament on this issue? Ultimately, as the Prime Minister knows, our success or failure in Helmand depends on the ordinary Afghan and on whether he or she feels safer and better off since British forces arrived. Does the Prime Minister feel that we are in danger of disappointing the high hopes of security and reconstruction?</p>

<p><a name="st_o109"><a name="07121260000205"><a name="71212-0005.htm_spmin1"><a name="07121260001204"><b>The Prime Minister:</b>
 First, let me deal with where we agree. We agree on praising the bravery, courage and professionalism of the forces. On Monday, I met some of the men who had either been in Musa Qala or who were about to go there, so I know what a tremendous effort British forces have been part of&#151;working with the Americans and with the Afghan forces themselves, while at the same time taking a leadership role with enormous skill, expertise and bravery. They have reason to celebrate a huge success this Christmas, which turns back the Taliban at the time when people are retreating to the hills for Christmas. That is a psychological blow against the Taliban as well as a military success. It means that over the next few months we can build on what we have achieved in Musa Qala so that people in that area have a stake in the future&#151;a Taliban-free future for that province.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para10"><a name="07121260000206">We also agree that work has to be done with the Afghan Government on fighting corruption and the drugs trade. We agree that there is a need for a co-ordinator, and we have been pressing for that for some years. At the same time, the changeover will take place in February, as had been announced previously by the Government to the House of Commons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para11"><a name="07121260000207">We further agree that it is important for our aid money to show results in Helmand where we are based. Of the &#163;450 million going into aid over the next few years, a very substantial part will go to Helmand. It is also important to build up the government of Afghanistan, so we want to increase the authority of the national Government over the whole country. That is why some of our resources are going into building systems of government, including for economic development across the whole country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para12"><a name="07121260000208">Let me repeat what I said in my statement&#151;that our aim is to isolate and eradicate the Taliban insurgency and to isolate the leadership. We are not negotiating with the leadership and we do not propose to do so. However, we want to support President Karzai in his efforts at reconciliation. If he is successful in bringing across members of the previous insurgency, who then  <br>

declare that they will give up fighting, support democracy and be part of the system, that will show that the efforts to achieve reconciliation will have been important to the whole country&#146;s future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para13"><a name="07121260000209">The right hon. Gentleman rightly stressed the importance that should be attached to the Afghan leadership and the Afghan people taking more ownership. I repeat that there will be 70,000 Afghan members of the armed forces by the end of next year; 20,000 more will be trained during the course of next year&#151;and at a very high level because they are benefiting from the expertise of the British forces. Forces on the ground tell me that the Afghan army is well trained and well equipped for the tasks that it has to carry out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para14"><a name="07121260000210">On equipment, six Merlin helicopters have been ordered and will be available later, while eight Chinook helicopters are being upgraded for the work that can be done in Afghanistan. I have also announced that new blades are being fitted to Sea King helicopters for such work. As part of burden sharing, I have approached a number of European Governments, particularly in eastern Europe, who are not involved to the same extent as we are in the Afghanistan effort, and asked them to provide helicopters to support the NATO effort. I am confident that, in addition to the helicopters that we are adding to our fleet, we will get more support from those east European countries as the process of burden sharing takes root.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para15"><a name="07121260000211">The right hon. Gentleman raised several other issues. On pay, we have a new computer system and I believe that the Defence Secretary&#146;s efforts to ensure that it improves and gets the right payments to people are now bearing fruit. On the question of payment to the troops themselves, I think that it will have to be recorded that over the last year, we have tried to improve the position both through the troops&#146; pay settlement and through the allowances given for being at the front. We in Britain have a six-month rota, while America tends to be longer, which is one of the reasons why the arrangements that the right hon. Gentleman asked about are different. There is a &#163;2,300 payment for being on the ground in theatre for several months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para16"><a name="07121260000212">We have also improved the allowances available for council tax, which has been reduced by &#163;140, while at the same time extending facilities available for e-mailing, computers and telephoning&#151;providing more minutes and more facilities for contacting relatives at home. Postal services have also been made free for the armed forces, which is entirely right. I am conscious that we need to do more on accommodation for the armed forces at home, which is why a substantial amount of the spending settlement has been allocated to accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para17"><a name="07121260000213">On each of those areas where questions have rightly been asked about the support that we give our armed forces, we are systematically taking action to improve what treatment is available. That is in recognition of what I suspect the whole House will want to support&#151;the courage, professionalism and dedication of the people who give up their time to serve our country and serve democracy for the future.</p>

Musa Qala, but is it not the case that all rural guerrilla armies attach little importance to holding towns, and that, conversely, the military command of NATO has acknowledged that it finds it very difficult to hold territory that it has cleared? What has fundamentally changed the dynamic of this conflict to give the Prime Minister a more optimistic view of the future?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para18"><a name="07121260000215">In respect of the UK contribution, the Prime Minister made some helpful, sensible and practical suggestions about the supply of helicopters, but has not the number of functioning Apache helicopters fallen from 60 per cent. to 50 per cent. over the last year? Is not one of the lessons the fact that we need to think more fundamentally about reorientating the defence budget towards immediate defence needs rather than those of the cold war? Will he have a fresh look at the very large &#163;6 billion Typhoon commitment, which, if cancelled, would free up resources for immediate defence needs and troop welfare?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para19"><a name="07121260000216">On the number of troops employed, is the judgment about numbers based on defence needs or is it simply reflecting the reality, acknowledged by the chiefs of staff, that British forces&#151;including the 4,700 who were tied down at Basra airport providing cover for the continuing American presence in Iraq&#151;are massively overstretched?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para20"><a name="07121260000217">The Prime Minister is absolutely right to stress the importance of development assistance and we greatly welcome that, but is it not true that the annual budget of the Afghan Government on development is about &#163;18 billion and that a large part of it is disappearing into waste and corruption? What is being done to introduce more effective safeguards?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para21"><a name="07121260000218">The Prime Minister acknowledged the role of the poppy economy in the lives of peasant farmers in Afghanistan, so what is he doing to stop the indiscriminate destruction of poppy crops driving those farmers into the arms of the Taliban?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para22"><a name="07121260000219">Finally, may I ask the Prime Minister about the precarious position of British public opinion? Is he aware that surveys in the past year suggest that a majority now favours withdrawal within a year and is increasingly concerned about the 86 deaths? There is a consensus among the parties in the House that we should continue to support the Afghan forces, but what is he going to do to persuade British public opinion that this activity is necessary and right?</p>

 I had hoped that there would be all-party agreement on what we are trying to achieve in Afghanistan. I am disappointed that the hon. Gentleman does not fully appreciate what I think is the central message of Afghanistan. Afghanistan is the front line against the Taliban and we must prevent the return of al-Qaeda to use the country as a base, and to do so we must strengthen the politics, society and economy of Afghanistan. I hope that that will be common ground.</p>

now have competent Afghan forces, which are able to move in and take control of the area with the support of the Americans, the British and other NATO forces. I believe that over the next period of time we shall see an ever more competent Afghan army, given support by trainers from Britain and elsewhere. At the same time, as I reported, people who either had an indirect relationship with the Taliban or were previously fighters are coming over and deciding that their future lies within the democratic constitution of Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para24"><a name="07121260000223">As far as the weaponry is concerned, I mentioned that Merlin, Chinook and Sea King helicopters would be moving into Afghanistan in greater numbers over the next period of time. We need fast jets as well, as the Secretary of State for Defence reminded me, but the hon. Gentleman should not pose one against the other. We are determined not only to provide the equipment that we can for our forces, but to persuade other countries to share the burden. If there is one lesson of the past year or two, it is that we can, if we work at it, persuade other countries to play a bigger role in making their contribution to Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para25"><a name="07121260000224">The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of heroin. It is true that half the heroin of the world comes out of Helmand province. It is also true that although we have made huge progress in other provinces, where poppy growing has ceased, we have not made the progress that we want to make in Helmand. Addressing that issue will mean a mixture of things. I hope that he would agree that it will mean eradication of the crops on the ground, rather than aerial bombing, as well as persuading people to take up different activities. This is not a short-term easy win for us, but something that we have to work at over the next period of time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para26"><a name="07121260000225">One of the ways we can do that is by strengthening what the hon. Gentleman rightly said is a weakness&#151;the central Government of Afghanistan. Of course there has been corruption, and waste and failure, but it is important to remind ourselves that progress has been made. However, as I stressed to President Karzai when I met him, it is important that he should have Ministers in place who command confidence. It is also important that he should work with the development effort, which should be more co-ordinated, on behalf of the 38 nations involved in Afghanistan. If we can do both those things over the next year, I believe that we shall see greater progress.</p>

who have performed brave service in Afghanistan, through the work of the Navy and the naval reserves. I also agree with her that women have an important part to play in the future of Afghanistan. When I said that Afghanistan had a higher proportion of women MPs than most western countries, I was talking about a country where 80 per cent. of women were not given the chance to read and where primary and secondary education were denied them for years. Enormous advances are being made. I also agree with my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="71212-0005.htm_para27"><a name="07121260000228">There is another point to make.

When it comes to vital equipment, I believe that it is possible to persuade some of our allies in NATO&#151;and, indeed, some outside&#151;to make a contribution where they have equipment that can be put on the ground.

The business leaders whom we meet in Afghanistan are well aware that it needs a far more diversified economy. When we visit the local areas, it is clear that unless we provide alternative employment it will be possible to exploit local people&#146;s need for work and prosperity through the narcotics trade. It is therefore essential for the aid budget and the development work that we are doing to offer alternative livelihoods.</p>

The military covenant, and the commitment that it implies, extends not only to the troops but to their families.

Highlanders&#146; barracks in Canterbury during the summer? The feedback contained a litany of criticism, including complaints about partners being deployed for too long and people&#146;s pay being regularly messed up, and about a cut in the financial assistance for people travelling back to Scotland from their barracks in Kent.

 I am sure that such shortcomings do need to be sorted out. The first of those&#151;the too frequent deployment of the armed forces&#151;is certainly worthy of our attention. It is well documented that our armed forces are very stretched. We have not, as yet, prised the word &#147;overstretch&#148; from the lips of any Minister, but senior officers and some of the defence chiefs are less reticent about acknowledging that we are asking an awful lot of the troops, and that that constitutes overstretch. For several years the defence planning assumptions have been exceeded and the harmony guidelines, which determine or indicate how frequently the armed forces should be out on active duty&#151;six months in every three years&#151;have been habitually broken. The hon. Gentleman refers to exactly that point when he tells us about the feedback from families. This is a serious issue and the situation cannot go on as it is. If it does, in the words of General Sir Richard Dannatt, there is a distinct danger that we could &#147;break&#148; the Army.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has heard the reaction of the House. Someone&#146;s pride in being a member of the armed forces and their satisfaction with their lot across a wide front are two very different things. I am picking up on the latter point, which is the subject of this debate.</p>

 There has been a series of difficulties with the transfer to the joint personnel administration. Possibly my hon.

the right approach and that, for the reasons articulated today, this is something that we must do. It will remain a serious burden on, and challenge for, our armed forces for many years to come. We must try to ensure that that long-term commitment does not mean that deployments abroad are longer and more frequent than they should be. That is one of the key senses in which the military covenant is being broken, and there is quite a lot of agreement in this House about that. Even the Government have acknowledged that there is some way to go and that more will need to be done. This autumn, the Royal British Legion launched its campaign to honour the covenant, and that has played a useful part in raising public awareness of these problems and concentrating the minds of the political community.</p>

 On that campaign, does my hon. Friend agree that probably every Member of this House regularly receives representations from constituents who have served in the armed forces and suffered as a consequence? In some cases, people have suffered loss of hearing from long exposure to blasts. Yet such people are often denied pensions or compensation&#151;indeed, the MOD spends considerable sums denying any kind of connected responsibility. Does he agree that that matter ought to be part of the covenant and that it should be recognised that if one has a disability as a result of serving in the armed forces, one should get proper compensation?</p>

 In principle, that is supposed to happen. The whole point of the military pension is that, in principle, it recognises and acknowledges exactly those points and makes some ongoing remuneration to cover them. I come across those who are dissatisfied with the military pension award that they have received, as I am sure other hon. Members do. There sometimes seems to be a difference in attitude between how the British face up to things such as Gulf war syndrome and the approach taken by the Americans and other of our allies. They tend to be far more ready to acknowledge things and to step in to offer remedy.</p>

 Was it not the Labour Government who brought in the armed forces compensation scheme in the last Parliament, which for the first time introduced lump sum payments for those injured in battle?

 I am sure that nobody opposed that, as it was a worthwhile scheme. However, the hon.

 My hon. Friend is right, and further improvement is clearly needed. The Government have said that they will introduce a new Command Paper to address the welfare of the armed forces.

We look forward to seeing their proposals and we welcome the fact that it must be implicit in their intention to introduce such a paper that they are acknowledging that a wide range of problems needs to be put right.

 I welcome the debate launched by the Royal British Legion on this issue. I do not believe that the covenant has been broken, but we do have to do much more to improve it and to remain focused on it. The hon. Gentleman has mentioned several issues, including families and so on. I had the privilege of serving as the veterans Minister. Does the hon.

I recently heard from some serving troops in Iraq, who said that they were very grateful for the extra parcels from home, but there were some slight complaints that the Prime Minister&#146;s visit over the weekend meant that they were not able to use phones or the internet on Sunday night. That brings me to the thorny subject of the use of the internet and telephones.</p>

I have made that point before, and received support for it from others. The last SDR was the best part of a decade ago, and the world today is very different in terms of the stresses and strains and the demands placed on our armed forces. Another SDR is long overdue, and if we are to better fulfil the military covenant and consider where our future priorities lie, it is an absolute necessity. We should get on with a new SDR now and we should also make a commitment to doing so regularly. The Americans have one every four years, and we should do so at least once a Parliament.

In December last year, the former Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Mike Jackson, described forces accommodation as &#147;frankly shaming&#148;, and there has certainly been an unfortunate catalogue of errors. Lieutenant-General Sir Freddie Viggers, the Adjutant-General, recently conceded that the Army has to fight for receipts from asset sales to be reinvested in the housing programme, but our armed forces should not have to lobby the Government for quality accommodation for themselves and their families.

 It certainly reaps most of the benefit, but the Annington deal was in 1996 and the present Government came to power in 1997. It is easy to blame the whole problem on the Annington deal, and it certainly was a rotten deal for the taxpayer, but since 1997 the Treasury has had huge capital receipts from the disposal of military assets and estates.

Almost half the single living accommodation remains of the lowest standard&#151;graded fourth out of 4&#151;and only 18 per cent. is of the highest standard. The MOD itself estimates that even if current investment continues, 30 per cent. of the accommodation will remain at grades 3 or 4 after 2013. The Government do not have a sufficient sense of urgency. They are beginning to acknowledge the problem and are introducing programmes to try to address it, and I commend them for that.

The Adjutant-General, Sir Freddie Viggers, has been willing to put his head above the parapet while he has been in post and say that too much accommodation is of a poor standard, too old or not modern enough in how it is fitted for families. We have a long way to go to bring about the improvement that we would want in the 41,000 units left in the estate. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="71212-0008.htm_para3"><a name="07121260000320">It is worrying that an average of 20 per cent. of married quarters&#151;this was covered on the radio this morning&#151;are empty at any given time. It costs the Ministry money to pay the lease for properties that are not filled. I accept that when large numbers of people are moved around, as happens with the armed forces, a percentage of the properties will always be empty. That would probably be a higher percentage than would be experienced by a commercial landlord. Nevertheless, it seems an awful lot when we consider that the MOD is paying to rent family accommodation in the private sector at the same time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="71212-0008.htm_para4"><a name="07121260000321">The Ministry has told us that it would cost &#163;750 million to bring all the family accommodation up to grade 1. It has also acknowledged that a minimum of &#163;50 million will need to be spent each year to make the necessary improvements. The figures for 2006-07 show that the MOD did not spend anything like the &#163;50 million that has been acknowledged to be necessary. The process, if it continues at the speed at which the work is being done and the money is being spent, rather than the speed that is being talked about, will take almost 50 years unless the MOD can improve radically on its performance in 2006-07. There is a long way to go.</p>

In the year from March 2006 to March 2007, MHS received almost 9,000 complaints. The call centre received some 200,000 repair call-out calls in that year and dropped almost 9 per cent. while people were hanging on at the other end. It is no wonder that the families of our armed forces are getting somewhat exasperated wondering when essential repairs will be conducted, particularly when they involve ageing boilers in need of repair in the depths of winter. The situation was summed up well by General Sir Michael Rose when he said recently that</p>

by the victims themselves. I have spoken to some of them individually. They are very appreciative of the high quality of medical care available at Selly Oak. It is clear that their aftercare, when they can be pushed back into different parts of the UK, does not match the high standard that they have experienced at Selly Oak.

In a letter to defence chiefs, he was reported to have criticised the level of pay, the lack of training and equipment, the appalling housing and, most of all, the treatment of injured soldiers.

The Government have begun various good initiatives to meet the challenge posed by mental health for both serving personnel and veterans, but I believe that we might face a significant influx of mental health patients in the years to come.

balance as well. I welcome this debate, as it is important that all the people of Britain become more aware of the efforts and sacrifices being made by our armed forces on their behalf. In addition, we all need to think about our security over the years ahead and therefore about what level of spending we should commit to defence.

We have already announced six new Merlin battlefield support helicopters, the first of which arrived in July, and a sixth C-17 transport plane to move troops and equipment into theatre quickly. Moreover, the Prime Minister announced to the House earlier today an investment of more than &#163;150 million in 150 new protected vehicles.

The hon. Member for North Devon talked about substandard accommodation, but all our properties meet the decent homes standard. Only 145 service family homes are in the lowest standard, and by the end of this financial year the number will be reduced to about 81, so it is wrong to say that thousands of service homes are substandard&#151;they are not. Our standards are higher than those in other areas, and we have no intention of lowering them to make the figures look better. Our service people deserve better, but it is unfair to suggest that there are thousands of substandard homes.</p>

 I am well aware that there is a major programme over the next five years to deal with accommodation, and that in my area about 10,000 houses are being built. Throughout the UK, an enormous amount of house building is taking place, so one of the practical problems might be insufficient workers for the repair programme. Would it be possible to set up a joint development programme so that local authorities and social housing associations combine with the Ministry of Defence? That would be very practical.</p>

We should make sure that we are as open as we can be with people and that we reduce the appalling length of time that people have to wait. Under the current system, we wind up with a military police investigation, which sometimes goes on for months or even years. In many instances, we do not even start a board of inquiry until after that investigation is finished. A coroner is not happy or prepared to start his inquest until after the board of inquiry has completed its work and has reported. Meanwhile, the families are waiting and waiting, not certain about what happened to their loved ones and unable to get closure. We need and want to do more on that, but I am not sure that providing legal aid in the coroner&#146;s environment is always the most appropriate thing.</p>

 I would simply point out that these casualties result from operations.

We know the position that the Minister has been put in by the Treasury. He has been told that if he wants to fund coroners&#146; inquests and representations, the money will have to come out of some other budget in his Department. That is not acceptable.

 There is not a blanket idea of never funding legal assistance for families, but, in the overwhelming majority of cases, the coroner investigates matters himself. If we want to put money into legal representation, in that fact-finding inquisitorial process, that is money that is coming from elsewhere. The hon.

I suspect that it was scripted by an Army staff officer, who thought it was a good idea at the time. There is nothing wrong with that. We should adopt it and work on it.

In Warminster in my constituency, 59 per cent. and 50 per cent. of pupils at the Avenue school and the nearby New Close primary school respectively come from service families. In Wiltshire overall, the figure can go up to 80 per cent. in some primary schools. That picture is repeated across the country in areas where there is a large military presence.</p>

The children involved are great kids who deserve the very best, but they are handicapped by a funding formula that ignores their needs and the results of turbulence in particular. Such children are invisible in the pupil level annual school census; if they join and leave during the school year, it is as though they never existed for the purposes of the funding that their LEA gets. What effect does the Minister think that has on school finances? Is it any wonder that service children&#146;s results are so relatively disappointing?</p>

The Prime Minister said from his desert soapbox that 1,000 troops would be home for Christmas, but he failed to say that the pledge was backdated to June.

As we develop a programme to make things much more stable so that people can choose to stay in their homes instead of moving to Germany, that will mean much more stability not only in the home, but for the children who attend school.

My experience in Germany showed me that the best thing to do is to put all the children in the same school, because if any disaster befell a family it was amazing how that reflected itself all the way down through the families of the armed forces to affect the children, who depended on each other. I spoke to people at a local primary school a few months ago, and it was amazing how the young kids who were based in Germany and Cyprus before coming back to Britain had gelled. That was good to see. Because of the housing that is available to mothers and fathers, many of them have chosen and will choose to remain where they are in the long term instead of moving about as they have hitherto.</p>

It is brilliant to find that we now have single people&#146;s accommodation with a television and a single bed and no other person in the room. It is very good for them to have that facility in some of the new build that has taken place. However, there will be a practical problem throughout the UK in trying to get workers for some of the schemes that are under way. In many areas, those workers will not be found. It is difficult in my area, where prices have rocketed and are three times what they used to be; that is why we are having to bring people over from the eastern countries to do the work. In appropriate areas, joint ventures between social housing organisations, local authorities and the MOD might be the way forward. I am glad that the Minister has agreed to meet me to discuss that.</p>

The Government have undertaken to ensure that when people leave the Army they are on an equal footing when they go on to the housing list. I genuinely hope that they, and all Opposition parties, will take a different view. In Midlothian, armed forces personnel get priority so that when they leave the armed forces they go to No. 1 on the housing list. I have never once received a complaint from any member of the public about that position. If we are truly going to recognise the role of the armed forces, perhaps the leading lights from the three main parties can agree on one thing.</p>

When kids from a Scottish regiment come back from abroad, they come back not to an English education, but to a Scottish education, and that must be recognised. When the Defence Committee took evidence in Scotland, I was truly ashamed by the ignorance of officials in the Scotland Office who did not understand the questions that we were asking. We stated that view in our report&#151;it was an outrage. I ask the Minister, when he talks about how we develop programmes throughout the UK, to remember that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in many cases different. Although 87 per cent. of the UK&#146;s population is in England, a disproportionate number of those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in the armed forces, and let us ensure that we deal with everybody as part of the UK.</p>

hear two generals who were committed to the issue before them, were not afraid to say somewhat controversial things, and willing when they did not have the answer to admit as much. I am like the former defence Minister, the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig), who said that he could not recollect former chiefs who reported to him raising these matters when they were in office. One wonders how much credibility there really is among those people in the other place who continually make these comments when they are out of service but did little or nothing at the time. Mike Jackson gave evidence to the Defence Committee many times about the morale of the Army, and I cannot remember one occasion when he said that one of the key issues is junior ranks&#146; accommodation or, for that matter, service accommodation generally.</p>

I hope that the Minister for the Armed Forces will look carefully at the points that that colonel raised in his resignation letter. That is a man who has had the job of commanding a unit and has had to face what the hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) had to face in commanding soldiers in the Balkans&#151;dealing with the daily issues that soldiers face and the pressure that they are under on the front line. It is not about their own safety and what is affecting them, but about what is going on at home. That is why so many Members, including the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy), intervened about the family welfare packages that are available. It is essential that we get that right and that we have a duty of care not only to service personnel but to the service family in its entirety.</p>

With regard to families not having legal representation automatically, we should not forget that that would be a matter not just of the MOD paying, but of people having access to legal aid. It would not fall on the MOD if the legal aid regulations were worded to the effect that the circumstances of a death could be treated in a certain way if they were sufficiently extraordinary&#151;in the same way as they would if someone died in police custody or in prison. I cannot understand why we cannot overcome this problem. The cost would not fall on the defence budget, and the matter has to be seriously considered. The Prime Minister, in one of the interventions that he took on his statement this afternoon, said that he would look at it. We need to look at a change to the legal aid regulations, which would allow further change to happen.</p>

 Despite the fact that the hon. Member for Westbury signed the amendment, I am sure that he would not have been the first Front-Bench spokesman who had signed something without reading it. Our motion certainly talks about the overall package of welfare, and it would have to be a pretty mean-spirited person who did not recognise that that, in its entirety, meant the welfare package for service personnel: housing, education, health&#151;the whole gamut.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="71212-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07121260000475">On the question of housing, I represent an area where there is a high proportion of service housing, and I am a little mystified about where the 140 unfit houses are located. I cannot believe that they are all in Portsmouth. If there are only 140 unfit houses in the MOD estate, I cannot believe that they are all located in and around the Portsmouth area. That figures needs to be considered with a great deal of caution; I suggest that we look at it further. We must be renting more than 140 houses in the private sector because there is not suitable accommodation for service families in Portsmouth. I know for a fact that we are doing so. It is interesting that the current Chairman of the Select Committee on Defence continually tells us that it was his last task as a Minister at the MOD to sell off the housing estate. I am sorry that he is not with us this afternoon, because he would have another chance to justify that awful decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="71212-0011.htm_para16"><a name="07121260000476">The only winner in that disposal was Annington Homes. It is clear that the disposal of surplus assets has made up nearly half, if not all, of the price it paid the MOD for the initial acquisition. I am at a loss to understand why the MOD is building houses at the same time as Annington is selling them. I have yet to understand how that equation works out to the benefit of the nation. We sell off our service homes and say that we will rent them back. We allow some of them to fall into disrepair. They are no longer used by service personnel because they are not fit to live in, and Annington then gets the privilege of selling them off. At the same time, the MOD is spending hundreds if not millions of pounds in the greater Portsmouth area alone to replace housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="71212-0011.htm_para17"><a name="07121260000477">Let us get it right on housing. I admire what the Government have done about single person&#146;s accommodation for junior ranks in the Portsmouth area. That has greatly improved, but there is still a long way to go. Based on the estimate given to the Defence Committee five years ago, it will take 20 years to bring all single service accommodation up to standard. In Aldershot, we were renting four-bedroom houses so that six Paras could live in them because the accommodation available was inadequate and shameful. One of the reasons that they moved to Colchester&#151;apart from the fact that Essex has some attractions and that they would have the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) representing them&#151;was the appalling state of the single-service accommodation in Aldershot, which was demolished as soon as they moved out. It certainly was not the football that attracted them.</p>

Over the years, along with other towns in Lancashire, Blackpool has contributed more than its fair share of servicemen to difficult spots. When I first came to this House, one of the things that first drew me into contact with veterans&#146; organisations was the campaign for compensation for far east prisoners of war. That compensation was achieved under this Government after more than 40 years of failing to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="71212-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07121260000483">I strongly welcome what the Royal British Legion has done by introducing its campaign. It has focused minds throughout the House on the various issues, and the organisation has been commendably fair minded in the way it has pursued them. That is one of the reasons I sat down with my local Royal British Legion association to talk about some of the key issues that have been raised with it, and I want to touch on them a little later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="71212-0011.htm_para22"><a name="07121260000484">We have, quite rightly, heard a lot about the practical nuts and bolts of service conditions today.

I did have the privilege, however, of editing the magazine <i> History Today</i> for 12 years, and in that context I dealt with and met many historians and the actual veterans whose service we are considering. Honouring our servicemen is not just about honouring them through practical conditions, but honouring them through remembrance of their service and their achievements. The recognition of those achievements is extremely important; it has a practical consequence, and links into their needs today. </p>

I might add in passing that the British Legion in Blackpool has played a tremendous role not just in supporting veterans, but in fundraising. Because of the nature of Blackpool as a leisure and tourism town, the British Legion organisation there has raised &#163;100,000 over the past 18 years through its annual Poppython, which is a 10-hour entertainment extravaganza that raises money in the weeks before Remembrance day.

We have talked about priority NHS treatment for veterans. Many veterans are not aware of that entitlement; indeed, many primary care trusts do not know about it either. That is why I have written to the chief executives of all my local trusts, including the Lancashire Care NHS Trust, to ask whether they have protocols for this, and whether veterans are receiving the priority treatment to which they are entitled. We must also remember that veterans suffer from a wide range of conditions, many of which might not emerge until 30 or 40 years after their active service.</p>

Last year, I laid my wreath at the Blackpool war memorial, following the parents of Gunner Lee Thornton, who was killed while on active service in Iraq. His parents are still awaiting his inquest, and I have written to the Blackpool and Fylde coroner on their behalf to ask what we can do to speed up the process.

&#147;the dead Army&#148;&#151;but by serving officers themselves. I am thinking particularly of the comments made by General Sir Richard Dannatt and the perhaps more discreet comments from Air Marshall Stirrup, the present Chief of the Defence Staff, about a range of issues that have also been mentioned today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="71212-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07121260000499">There is nothing new about tensions between politicians and senior officers. It comes down to personalities, politics, budgets, resources and, of course, policies. Our history is littered with robust individuals in the military, including Nelson and Wellington, and Roberts and Wolsey in the late 19th century. Relations between politicians and the military during the first world war were often appalling&#151;between Lloyd George and Haig, for example. There was also a robust relationship between Churchill and senior officers in the second world war. People such as Mountbatten and &#147;Shan&#148; Hackett also spring to mind. There have been faults on both sides.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="71212-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07121260000500">I suggest, however, that it is unusual to have had such an outpouring of feeling not only from retired officers&#151;to have all the former Chiefs of the Defence Staff speaking as one is quite unusual&#151;but from serving officers. We should accept the fact that, although most military personnel have a deep interest in political issues and will argue strongly not only about military matters but about matters that concern them as ordinary voters, including the environment, the police and that kind of thing, they tend to have a pretty low opinion of politicians. I suspect that we come just above child molesters and journalists in their rating system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="71212-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07121260000501">When the former Chiefs of the Defence Staff spoke out, the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) suggested that they were all part of a Tory plot. I do not think that that is the case at all. I suspect that many of them have never voted Conservative; some might not vote at all. The fact is that these serving and retired military men believe that the stresses and strains that the armed forces have been under for the past two or three years are unprecedented. The fact that Richard Dannatt, who is normally a most cautious and discreet man, spoke publicly strikes me as significant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="71212-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07121260000502">I believe that the military covenant is in danger of breaking down because the chain of command itself is under such enormous pressure. Many middle-ranking and senior officers believe that their men and women&#151;and, more importantly, their families&#151;do not believe that the chiefs of staff are accurately and forcefully representing their concerns to Ministers; hence they feel forced to speak out. Anyone familiar with the array of military blogs will know the reactions of servicemen and women to this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="71212-0012.htm_para11"><a name="07121260000503">One of the problems that the Government face is that their strategic defence review in 1998&#151;which was warmly welcomed by the military establishment, which participated fully in it&#151;was, sadly, never properly funded. Indeed, the man who drove it through, Admiral Essenheim, ended up retiring early from the Navy in disgust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="71212-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07121260000504">For decades, as we all know, the military appear to the Treasury to have cried wolf on resources. On so many occasions&#151;be it the Falklands, the Gulf war,  <br>

Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Iraq or Afghanistan&#151;they have said before those conflicts, &#147;We have insufficient resources.&#148; Invariably, they deliver. Why? At the end of the day, they do so because they cannibalise their resources; because, as former Prime Minister Blair knew, they have a can-do mentality; and, more recently, because we have been borrowers from the Americans. Without being able literally to borrow kit in Afghanistan, the armed forces would not be able to operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="71212-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07121260000505">The military fear that eventually the armed forces will be irreparably damaged if this current tempo continues, and that there will be, in the words of General the Lord Guthrie, some degree of &#147;operational failure&#148;. What is the attitude of Ministers to this? I do not accept the criticism of some colleagues that the problem is that none of the defence Ministers has any military experience. That is the norm and is likely to be the future norm, and it does not mean that they cannot perform their functions properly. After all, one does not have to be a train driver to be Secretary of State for Transport, or to be a teacher to be Education Secretary. What those in the professions that operate within those Ministries look for is Ministers who are competent and forceful and can explain the case and, where necessary, take responsibility for failures and inadequacies that they are ultimately responsible for. I am afraid to say that one of the Government&#146;s problems is that the Prime Minister has a reputation, unlike his predecessor, for not being particularly interested in defence. He has almost a Gladstonian attitude to defence, and it has not been helped by spinning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="71212-0012.htm_para14"><a name="07121260000506">Many comments have been made about the fact that the current Secretary of State is double-hatted. I do not cast any aspersions on his hard work&#151;he is a very committed man and I suspect that privately, he is deeply embarrassed about being double-hatted. However, the message that that sends to the servicemen and their families is entirely negative. It does not matter if he is doing only one hour a week on that other job; what matters is the perception, as much as anything else. That has contributed in part to what I believe is the erosion of the military covenant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="71212-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07121260000507">The crucial element missing from any debate about the military covenant and relations between Ministers and the military is the role of the policy-making civil servants, who are absolutely crucial. In my day at the MOD, they were quite formidable. Sir Michael Quinlan, the permanent under-secretary, was a man who made the Chief of the Defence Staff automatically put an exercise book down the back of his trousers and my noble Friend Lord King start hiccupping nervously. He was a formidable man. I am not sure whether the policy-making civil servants of today are of the same calibre, but they are crucial in developing many policy areas and in maintaining the military covenant. We need to look more carefully at their role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="71212-0012.htm_para16"><a name="07121260000508">If the House at least accepts my contention that there are problems&#151;even if they do not accept that there is a breakdown of the military covenant&#151;how do we repair them? First, Ministers just have to try harder and not spin. They have the responsibility of repairing mutual confidence. Equally, the military should not leak. They should not go to the media because if they do, why should their ordinary soldiers, sailors and  <br>

airmen not do the same thing if they happen to disagree with the operational orders of a senior officer? This is going to depend on robust personal relationships. I see nothing wrong in the fact that there will be robust discussions between the military and Ministers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="71212-0012.htm_para17"><a name="07121260000509">Finally, we need to look at the whole question of our national security strategy and institutions. If we do not get this right, we will have future conflicts in which the relationship will break down completely, and we will revert to a position in which politicians and the military have mutual antipathy, as they did during the first world war, when the military were referred to as &#147;brass hats&#148; and civilians were referred to as &#147;frocks&#148; because of their frock-coats.

 I am aware of the time, Mr. Deputy Speaker, so I shall be as brief as I can be. It is a privilege and a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson), who made a characteristically excellent speech, although I disagreed with some of his points. I will not deconstruct his speech, but I agreed with much of what he said. The Conservative Front-Bench spokesman, the hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison), introduced himself as, effectively, a serving officer. I remember the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk sticking it to me in an Adjournment debate regarding what I did before I was a Member here, albeit in a slightly different context. Nevertheless, things have moved on and it seems to be much more the norm for officers&#151;on the other side of the House, uniquely&#151;to get operational experience and to come back here and make their recent expertise known in the House. That is no bad thing and it adds to the mix in a useful and important way.</p>

 It is not my intention to criticise; my point is that it is pretty much the norm for Members to go on some kind of operations, and to come back to the House and give it the benefit of their expertise. That change has occurred in the past five or 10 years, and it has certainly occurred in the relatively short time that I have been here. That is a good thing, but it flags up the complicated nature of the relationship between people who have served, those who are serving&#151;be they members of the Territorial Army or of the reserve forces&#151;and those who are on half pay. I might be wrong, but I think that some former Chiefs of the Defence Staff are on half pay, rather than being retired officers in the other House. I want later to address a few aspects of the behaviour of the former Chiefs of the Defence Staff.</p>

out how important it is that we have a meaningful and proper debate about the resources that we spend on defence and how we spend them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="71212-0012.htm_para19"><a name="07121260000514">The accommodation situation is still a disgrace. I have no idea how we as a nation, regardless of which party is in power, have allowed military accommodation to reach a point where, frankly, it is not good enough. The Government are doing what they can. They have put in &#163;5 billion&#151;we have all heard the figures, which have been mentioned many times&#151;and they are doing many things that will benefit serving personnel. A future Conservative Government might well do something similar&#151;I have no idea&#151;but I notice that when the Conservatives tell us that we should spend more than the uplift we are already spending, they never add to that a spending commitment. That has to devalue to some degree what they say. When they come up with a spending commitment, they may have a stronger moral edge to their argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="71212-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07121260000515">I mentioned the hon. Member for North Devon simply because it is wrong to say that the covenant is akin to a legal contract&#151;that it is almost like terms and conditions of service, or a document that lays down the relationship between a Government and their service personnel. Much of what we should be doing with the military covenant is about people&#146;s attitudes. We have all heard the stories recently about troops being forced out of swimming pools and people putting in planning objections to buildings&#151;at Headley Court and elsewhere&#151;that will be used by people visiting their loved ones who have been injured in the forces. These things are commonplace and it is the job of all of us and others&#151;including the media, I would like to think&#151;to change people&#146;s attitudes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="71212-0012.htm_para21"><a name="07121260000516">Fundamentally, it is true that how much money we spend as a nation on defence is a big issue. We frame it in terms of a proportion of our gross domestic product or sometimes we talk about increasing expenditure in real terms. Whatever we do, there is an argument to be won with the public at large. For that reason, when we talk about the military covenant, we should think in those terms&#151;of the public at large&#151;rather than just in terms of the relationship between Ministers, the Government and service personnel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="71212-0012.htm_para22"><a name="07121260000517">I want to add a mild note of criticism. People generally tend not to criticise the Royal British Legion and, on the whole, I do not either. I do think, however, that a touch of some aspects of its campaign over the military covenant has jumped into that space for criticism. It may have been done for good campaigning reasons, but it has jumped into that space where people have tended to view the campaign as a criticism of the Government. I find it slightly peculiar that the Royal British Legion put on events at party conferences, yet did not allow Ministers to speak on the grounds that it would be political. Why come to party political conferences? It seemed rather peculiar. The Royal British Legion&#146;s campaign has largely been sound and appropriately delivered, but some aspects in the margins should be thought about again more critically before it launches into its next big campaign on whatever subject.</p>

who want to put themselves above politics, yet they will quite happily stand at the launch of a perfectly legitimate &#147;Way Forward&#148; Tory party document. I realise that Conservative Way Forward is more a Tory think-tank than an official party document, but it is preposterous in the extreme to think that former chiefs of staff can write a foreword to a political pamphlet and then try to pretend that they are above politics. That is a farce. Frankly, although I realise that they have a great deal to contribute&#151;they are enormously talented and capable officers&#151;if they want to put their political cards on the table, let them do it, but let us not shilly-shally about what their political sentiments are.</p>

I think I am right in saying, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that I am allowed to get some data on my BlackBerry as I am sitting here. I say that because this may not be a complete list. I do not think that General Guthrie mentioned the fact that he was a paid director of Colt Defence, Siboney Ltd, Sciens Capital, and Rothschild; or that Field Marshall Inge mentioned that he was a paid director of Aegis, which clearly has interests in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. They are excellent companies, by the way, and I know that they will be very excited and pleased to see themselves referred to in this place today. Lord Boyce is a paid director of WS Atkins and of Vosper Thornycroft. I may be wrong, as I have just had a quick perusal of the <i> Hansard </i>from the other place. I do not know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, what the rules are and I doubt whether they have broken any of them. However, I will say that former chiefs of staff are probably earning more from their directorships than paid Members of this House and that if they do not want to declare those directorships and if they want to get politicised and personalised&#151;</p>

General Jackson has made many comments recently, and I sometimes think that he is being criticised for having been highly professional about how he conducted that relationship. Perhaps it is time for the former chiefs of staff in the other place to reflect on whether they think that their co-ordinated and politicised outburst of a couple of weeks ago helped or hindered the relationship between Ministers and the current chiefs of staff. If a Minister is chatting to a chief of staff about the important issues of the day, he might be thinking that in a couple  <br>

The former chiefs of staff next door have done considerable damage. I know that they will not be embarrassed. From what I can see of them, they are not embarrassed at anything as they think that they are above politics. Well, they are not.</p>

Bearing in mind the former service of my colleagues on the Front Bench, my hon. Friends the Members for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) and for Westbury (Dr. Murrison), I will concentrate most of my comments on the Army, but some if not all of them will apply to the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force.

It is more like 10,000 men under strength, and it is rapidly approaching a position where battalions, brigades and regiments are incapable of operating in the field and where units are deploying on operations at a non-combat-effective strength, as I shall illustrate in a moment. Why do we not hear about that in more detail? The reason is that, with respect, it is only anoraks such as me who have been deeply involved in this stuff in the past who understand it&#151;I do not mean to sound like an old sweat, but there we are. Also, we do not hear from the former Chiefs of the Defence Staff, because they were responsible for a drama that occurred several years ago, which has now turned into a crisis that is likely to bring units to their knees, if it has not done so already.</p>

I understand that. The point is that those young men who are out there as regular Army reinforcements with the 2nd Yorkshires will get almost no tour gap at all. I shall describe the effect of that later. What is also interesting&#151;I ask the Ministers please to listen to this&#151;is that there are no battle casualty replacements beyond the pool of 17-year-olds who will turn 18 while the battalion is in Afghanistan.</p>

The system said &#147;You have some 17-year-olds who are about to turn 18. Physician, heal thyself.&#148; He was able to do that. Then senior officers began to be killed.

I want hardened, trained sergeants, captains and the like.&#148; The system said to him &#147;Phone a friend. Get hold of your mates. See whether they can provide another captain or another sergeant for you.&#148; He ended up robbing Peter to pay Paul&#151;going to units in theatre asking BCRs to come forward.

As for the reality&#151;which I illustrated with the figures for the 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment&#151;I reckon that about 10,000 men are under strength or combat-ineffective. On top of that, the Government in their wisdom have decided to disband three battalions.

adjunct of the manpower equation, which consists first of recruiting, secondly of retention of recruits during training, and thirdly of retention of serving soldiers. The MOD must get a grip. It is perfectly possible to recruit. Believe me, I have done it, in a recruiting famine&#151;admittedly a few years ago, but when the economy was in considerably better shape than it is now. Along with others, I produced a battalion that was 100 men over strength. It can be done. I will not listen to the excuses of&#151;with respect&#151;the Scots in particular, who say that it is impossible to recruit in Scotland. If it can be done in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire to the level that we achieved, it can be done anywhere. At present, with the armed forces&#146; reputations never higher and with the economy, sadly, rapidly deteriorating and all the implications that that carries, it is a disgrace that we see no recruiting parties in the constituency of Newark. There are kids there who are gagging to get into uniform.</p>

If you do not have enough blokes, the nasty bits come around too often, and when the nasty bits come around too often, the blokes leave. They do not leave because they want to; &#145;er indoors makes them go because she is fed up with living in Tidworth, which has rotten schools and rotten housing and is a million miles from Nottingham where mam is with the kids, back in St Ann&#146;s or somewhere similar. She cannot see her family, and her husband is not just away, but away and in serious danger. Then he comes back and cannot go on his career course because there is no time. That means that he cannot be promoted and cannot pick up the extra money that would come with promotion, and she exercises not unreasonable but wholly irresistible pressure on that young man to leave the Army. As a result, we lose the services of the most important, best-trained and most gallant men whom we have.</p>

 I welcome the debate. I recognise the hard work done by the Royal British Legion, but I agree with my hon.

However, the most disgraceful example that I have seen in the past few weeks is the pamphlet produced by the hon.

On armed forces compensation, the criticisms coming from the Conservative Front Bench would have more credibility if they had also been made when the relevant Bill was passing through the House, but they were not. I served on the Committee that dealt with that Bill, and I can say that it was this Government who brought in lump sum payments for the first time for wounded servicemen and women. All the hon.

For at least the past five years the forces have been operating above predicted deployment levels. One in six soldiers is on missions more frequently than the harmony guidelines rule. Health professionals are the worst hit, and reservists fill far too many of the posts. The situation is so desperate that the forces are scraping around for volunteers. Military bandsmen have been put on standby to replace infantry battalions, and storemen from Faslane are being asked to do front-line duties in Iraq.

With overstretch and under-resourcing we are in danger of abusing the good will of the armed forces and turning the can-do ethos into a make-do muddle. I am sure that many people agree that the Iraq campaign was a huge mistake in its own right. It had not only a massive impact on our reputation on the world stage, but an equally damaging effect on our armed forces because of overstretch. The number of attacks reduced in Basra as a result of our withdrawal from Basra palace, and the logical conclusion is to withdraw from Iraq altogether. We also have serious doubts about 2,500 personnel being the minimum force protection that is required from next spring. The Minister for the Armed Forces referred earlier in the year to a figure of 5,000. I have two questions for that Minister. Are we relying on the Iraqi forces to protect our forces in Iraq? Will the Minister respond to claims that a deal has been done with General Mohan to free Mahdi army prisoners in return for relief from the attacks on our forces?</p>

The Armed Forces Pay Review Body has highlighted the reduction of about 14,000 bed spaces in respect of modernisation between 2001 and 2007. During that time, the MOD delivered &#163;2.2 billion in asset sales to the Treasury.

The Royal British Legion has done an excellent job in working with the homeless, with the Compass project and with ex-service personnel in prison. Other wonderful organisations include BLESMA, the British Limbless Ex-Service Men&#146;s Association, which does an amazing job with amputees.

I spoke with the Royal British Legion before it announced the campaign, and it recognised that the Government have done a lot to improve the support for and treatment of our armed forces and their families. It recognises that, but of course it wants us to do more. We have announced a Command Paper, which will consider what we have done and what we need to do across the Ministry of Defence, the armed forces and the whole Government to support our armed forces and their families. I welcome that, because it will do a lot of good work. It will report in the spring and provide an important benchmark for what we have done and what we will do in the future.</p>

The pathway of care will be rigorously monitored, by Ministers and by those involved at the centre. I believe that that important step forward will ensure even better standards of service and care for our armed forces personnel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="71212-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07121260000571">The hon. Member for North Devon talked about establishing military wards in the medical defence units around the country. Those units have military medical people who work with NHS staff, but we do not believe that they should have solely military wards, as usually there are not more than two wards full of military patients at any one time. However, it is true that we are developing a military-managed ward at Selly Oak. Lots of military people are involved in that, including a military ward master, and we are also in discussions about how the new hospital building there can be used to improve the care that we offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="71212-0014.htm_para10"><a name="07121260000572">In the minute that remains, I want to remind the House about all the things that the Government have done for the armed forces. For example, their pay rise this year was the best in the public sector, amounting to more than 9 per cent. for the most junior ranks. Military personnel also get an operational bonus worth &#163;2,320, as well as council tax relief. The welfare package for our armed forces is the best that we have ever had, and the facilities at Headley Court and Selly Oak offer greatly improved support and welfare provision for casualties and their families. I believe that our armed forces now get the best medical care that has ever been provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="71212-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07121260000573">As I said earlier, significant amounts of money have been spent on housing for our armed forces, and much progress has been made in that regard. Other improvements include the modernisation of terms and conditions for the Gurkhas, which has been welcomed by many people. In addition, we have taken many initiatives to improve recruitment and retention in the services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="71212-0014.htm_para12"><a name="07121260000574">I welcome this debate. The Government are doing a great deal to improve the support extended to our armed forces and their families. I believe that it has never been better, but we continue to look at what more we can do, and I am sure that the Command Paper that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has announced will lead to further improvements in the future.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="71212-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07121260000963">We are very much in the middle of a banking crisis that is without precedent&#151; certainly in my lifetime and probably for most of the last century. I was always brought up to believe that banking runs occur in far-off countries and that the lender of last resort is an obscure academic construction that appears in monetary textbooks, not the real world. However, I suspect that when the dust has settled on the Northern Rock affair, future generations will think of it much as people think of the South Sea bubble: a major historical event when a speculative bubble in financial markets burst. If one were to be pessimistic by thinking that the crisis will continue unabated, one could well seek a historical precedent in the Creditanstalt in Austria in 1931. Those events had major financial and economic repercussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="71212-0014.htm_para18"><a name="07121260000964">We are dealing with enormous sums: approximately &#163;30 billion of Government loan, which excludes the deposit guarantees. To try to help Members get their heads around that, I point out that 30 billion is a &#147;3&#148; with 10 noughts. It is impossible to be precise about how much money is involved because the Government do not give the necessary information, and neither does the Bank of England. The information can only be inferred from the Bank&#146;s balance sheet, but the figure is approximately of that order of magnitude.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="71212-0014.htm_para19"><a name="07121260000965">To put the amount in context so that we can make sense of such an enormous number, I simply equate it to a little bit less than the annual defence budget. Given that it is a one-off payment, we are talking about six Iraq wars. Such a sum would build a high-speed train route from London to Edinburgh, and enough money would be left to build another one to Glasgow. The sum is the equivalent of about &#163;5 million for every Northern Rock employee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="71212-0015.htm_para0"><a name="07121260000966">That leads me to a key aspect of the argument: we are talking about not just money, but people. I have been to Newcastle several times in the past year to talk about its economic situation. Northern Rock is a major employer in north-east England. I understand that it has about 3,500 employees in Newcastle and about 1,500 in Sunderland. In addition to that employment, it has been an important part of the repositioning of the north-east of England from manufacturing towards financial services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="71212-0015.htm_para1"><a name="07121260000967">In addition, the Northern Rock Foundation makes an important charitable contribution. It has spent some &#163;175 million over 10 years, but it does not just spend a lot of money. As I discovered when I walked along Hadrian&#146;s Wall last summer, an enormous number of local charities rely on the foundation for obtaining charitable money quickly and effectively. They receive the money from the foundation much more effectively than they do from the national lottery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="71212-0015.htm_para2"><a name="07121260000968">Before Ministers stand up and pose as angels of the north, it would be worth while for them and their Back-Bench colleagues&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I entirely understand why Labour Back Benchers will quite reasonably wish to speak up on behalf of their constituents and their constituents&#146; jobs. If I was in their position, I would do exactly the same. However, if they have not already done so, I urge them to study the document on the principles for assessing Northern Rock proposals, which is the basis for the Government&#146;s sale. Those who have studied it will realise that it says absolutely nothing&#151;not one word or one syllable&#151;about either employment in north-east England or the Northern Rock Foundation.</p>

<p><a name="st_o277"><a name="07121260000969"><a name="71212-0015.htm_spnew0"><a name="07121260001749"><b>Jim Cousins (Newcastle upon Tyne, Central) (Lab):</b>
 I have studied that document, too. Has the hon. Gentleman looked closely at the last part of it, which refers to a long-term recapitalisation of the business and a sound business plan in the medium term? Will he bear it in mind that that statement of principles was put out on behalf of not only the Government, but the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority, which can hardly deal with the matters about which he is thinking?</p>

<p><a name="st_o278"><a name="07121260000970"><a name="71212-0015.htm_spnew1"><a name="07121260001750"><b>Dr. Cable:</b>
 If the hon. Gentleman is basing his hopes on a sound business plan from the private bidders, I fear that he may well be disappointed. I will come to the details of the private bids in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="71212-0015.htm_para3"><a name="07121260000971">A couple of days ago, I had a long session with one of the bidders, who had just come back from a tour of Northern Rock&#146;s north-east facilities. He said that he did not know whether to laugh or cry. He had been round the call centre, where every single employee was reading books and magazines because there was no work to do. Any Labour Member who imagines that some of the vulture investors who are part of Mr. Branson&#146;s consortium have the slightest interest in preserving that employment are labouring under an illusion. I do not know whether they realise, for example, that one of his largest investors is a gentleman called Wilbur Ross, who made billions of pounds in the United States smashing trade unions and ripping away company pension schemes. My starting point is that the employees of Northern Rock and the people of north-east England deserve rather better than that, which is what is likely to come out of the private bidding process.</p>

 Is the hon. Gentleman at one with the leader of the Liberal Democrats on Newcastle city council who, along with the majority of elected politicians in the north-east, supports efforts to get a solution for Northern Rock? Is he not in danger today, with the emotive language that he uses, of running down the company and making matters worse?</p>

 I am a strong fan of the leader of Newcastle city council. The Liberal Democrat group runs that city admirably. He has been endeavouring on an all-party basis both to honour the 100-year history of the bank and to find a solution to it. I have discussed it with him several times. He understands that the options are running out and that the solution that I am proposing&#151;temporary public ownership&#151;will probably serve the interests of the people who live in that region better than the hopeful venture being promoted by the Government.</p>

 I understand theoretically some of the points that the hon. Gentleman is making, and I have read the motion. Is he aware that Northern Rock employees do not want nationalisation? If it is difficult now to sell the business as a going concern, they wonder how much more difficult it will be to do so in future.

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="71212-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07121260000990">At this point, it will be useful to summarise why the Liberal Democrats have taken the position we have.

The financial shock that hit the markets a few months ago was unprecedented and unexpected, but that does not excuse the Financial Services Authority, the regulator, which should surely have spotted the high risk associated with Northern Rock&#146;s reckless expansion. None the less, the event was unexpected. We reacted to it by supporting what the Government did to stop the run&#151;that is, guarantee deposits. That was a sensible reaction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="71212-0015.htm_para8"><a name="07121260000992">At the time, I opposed an open-ended unconditional loan to bail out the banks. Ever since the Government made that decision, they have been digging a deeper and deeper hole for themselves. There is nothing wrong in principle with exploring the idea of trying to get a private bidder, and that is why I do not fundamentally quarrel with some of the interventions from Labour Members. However, it has become painfully and increasingly apparent that, with the money markets now largely closed, it is simply impossible for any of the bidders, however credible or reputable, to raise the amount required, including the money necessary to guarantee the full repayment of the taxpayer. That is our position now.</p>

 The taxpayer is already heavily implicated in the company. Its liabilities include the deposits, which are already guaranteed, and they would include the loans that are rolled over but are not being rolled over at present because the market will not do it. In practice, the taxpayer is 100 per cent. liable for all these liabilities as they come due. If it was a nationalised company, temporarily, the Government would have some control over the process instead of being an entirely passive spectator. Let me retrace the steps to some of the key decisions that the Government have made. In September, there was a key decision to provide what was said at the time to be unlimited support. The question that needs to be asked&#151;it relates to the intervention by the hon.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="12 Dec 2007">

<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column 376</b><br>
Member for Houghton and Washington, East (Mr. Kemp)&#151;is what estimate was made of the likely deposit withdrawal and the extent to which commercial loans would have to be replaced? At about that time, Lloyds bank made a proposal that involved &#163;30 billion-worth of Government loans. The Chancellor, as we understand from the records, personally rejected that option on the grounds that the commitment of Government money was too large. We now know that &#163;30 billion has already been advanced in Government loans without resolving the problem, so somebody made a horrendous miscalculation about the sums that were going to be involved. We need to know how that happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="71212-0015.htm_para9"><a name="07121260000995">A second basic question that I have been asking throughout is: why was this loan advanced in a completely open-ended and unconditional way? The Government, as the major creditor, could have said, &#147;We will advance credit to the bank subject to the removal of the chief executive and others who were directly responsible for getting the bank into trouble in the first place.&#148; Any major creditor could reasonably insist on conditions, but the Government said, as did the Chancellor, rather pathetically, on several occasions in the Chamber, &#147;We can&#146;t do anything about this because we don&#146;t own the bank.&#148; We now have an extraordinary situation whereby the chief executive of the bank, Mr. Applegarth, who drove the bank on to the rocks, is still sitting in the chief executive&#146;s chair driving the company and managing the Government&#146;s taxpayers&#146; money. It is an extraordinary situation for the Government to have allowed to arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="71212-0015.htm_para10"><a name="07121260000996">Another fundamental question that I have asked is: when the loan had been advanced, what security did the Treasury or the Bank of England, or both, insist on in return for taxpayers&#146; money? One would have thought that that was a reasonable, prudent provision to request. I have been writing letters to the Governor of the Bank of England to ask him what security was available, and he has written me a letter that is so shameless that even Sir Humphrey would have been embarrassed to sign it. There are no figures in it, nor an explanation of what happened to the rolled-up interest on the loan. It is completely and utterly uninformative and, frankly, borders on the impertinent, because the Bank of England and its Governor are saying that elected representatives have no right to know what happens to public money. That is a completely unacceptable position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="71212-0015.htm_para11"><a name="07121260000997">We can infer&#151;we do not know it because it has never been confirmed&#151;that roughly half the funding of the bank loan is secured pretty solidly against the assets of the bank, but the other half is not. Most of it is secured against what are called the free assets of the bank; in other words, it takes a secondary role to that of secured creditors such as Granite, which accounts for about half of the balance sheet. It is argued that that is fine because the money is secured against the bank&#146;s mortgage book. However, it has emerged that among the assets of the bank against which the Government loan is secured are &#163;8 billion-worth of unsecured loans. It appears never to have occurred to anybody in the Treasury or the Bank of England to ask how secure those assets were.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="71212-0015.htm_para12"><a name="07121260000998">The confidence of the Government and the Bank of England was based upon a belief that Northern Rock had a very good repayment record from its borrowers.  <br>

On paper, that looks perfectly true. However, people have now started digging&#151;notably Panmure Gordon, one of the brokers, which has established that a lot of bad debt is actually being hidden because the Northern Rock bank did not employ the sort of rigorous practices employed in other institutions such as Alliance and Leicester and Bradford and Bingley. However, whether or not that is the case, there was an underlying optimism, all based on the strength of the mortgage book and on the value of the domestic property that underlies those assets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="71212-0015.htm_para13"><a name="07121260001003">The optimism that I described rests upon the fact that the assets of the bank primarily consist of mortgages, many of which were obtained at the peak of the housing market in the earlier part of this year. There was an extraordinary explosion of growth in the Northern Rock bank&#151;it grew by about 55 per cent. and took 20 per cent. of the market in the earlier part of this year. That growth was not backed up by deposits, and it accounted for the fact that the bank had to borrow heavily in the wholesale market, which then seized up. As I told the House a few weeks ago, it was possible then to go to the Northern Rock bank and obtain a mortgage of about 125 per cent. of the value of a property, and of four to five times a person&#146;s income. That was the sort of frenzied borrowing that took place at the peak of the market. I checked yesterday, and those loans are still on offer. This is a supposedly responsible lender in the middle of a banking crisis, dependent on loans from the Government.</p>

 I am very interested in what the hon. Gentleman is doing. He is continuing to run down the bank, which I do not think is a very clever thing to do.

 My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. His intervention underlines why, historically speaking, Northern Rock was so highly regarded, particularly as a building society but later also as a bank.

They differ in that Branson&#146;s consortium wants a takeover and is willing to trade on the basis of the Virgin reputation as a way of attracting new deposits, while Luqman Arnold is not interested in a takeover.

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="71212-0016.htm_para5"><a name="07121260001015">Nor should we be under any illusions about the motives of the people who are bidding. I have never met Mr. Branson, but he seems to be an engaging character who has had some successful ventures. He is, however, a front man for a consortium of hedge funds and private equity operators whose aim is to make a killing. He is proposing to invest about &#163;200 million in a company whose gross assets will be more than &#163;100 billion, and he will be hoping to sell it on in due course and make a large capital gain that, as he is registered overseas, might well not attract UK taxation. So we are not talking about Mother Theresa here; we are talking about some very tough short-term financial investors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="71212-0016.htm_para6"><a name="07121260001016">As I talk about the bidders, it is coming back to me that the Government have made a bad mistake&#151;even within their own policy&#151;in giving preferential status to one of the bidders, the Branson group. The other bidders have discovered, as they enter the early stages of due diligence, that the Government&#151;and the taxpayer&#151;are paying the legal fees of the Branson consortium but they are not willing to pay theirs. Understandably, they are aware that they are not operating on a level playing field.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="71212-0016.htm_para7"><a name="07121260001017">I do not want to run Mr. Branson down, but it is a matter of fact&#151;of which I was previously unaware&#151;that he has a criminal record for tax evasion. There is therefore good reason to believe that the people who have to stump up the money for his consortium may well not regard him as a fit and proper person to run a public company, let alone a bank, and let alone as someone responsible for &#163;30 billion-worth of taxpayers&#146; money. So there are real questions about whether this private bid is ever going to succeed.</p>

 I am sure that Sir Brian Pitman is absolutely admirable. He is a 75-year-old ex-banker with a formidable history and I am sure that he is serious. I have talked to some of those associated with both the people in question, and they are serious people. That is not the problem&#151;the problem is how they are going to raise, in markets that are now almost closed, the staggering amounts of money that they need to realise their bid. That is the issue&#151;it is not about their character or their history in running banks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="71212-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07121260001021">The private sale is becoming increasingly problematic, so we effectively have two options. One is to put the bank into administration, which is probably what everybody would regard as the &#147;nuclear&#148; option. Under those circumstances, not only are the shareholders in the north-east wiped out, but there are question marks over what happens even to the guarantee deposit. It would take a long time for those guarantees to be fed back to the depositors, and there would be continuing questions about deposits in other banks because of the difficulties. How would the public loan be retrieved? It would be retrieved either by a very slow run-off as the mortgages were redeemed, or through a fire sale in what is currently a very depressed market. Administration thus presents enormous problems, which is why we Liberal Democrats are suggesting that a period of temporary nationalisation is the least worst of the three basic options available: nationalisation, private sale or administration.</p>

Professional management would have to be hired, and they would have to get to the root of what is going on at this bank. It might prove to be a very sound institution deep down, with a lot of very good assets; we do not know. However, if, having dug down, those managers establish that that is so, they can re-launch it in future years and there would be a substantial upside for the taxpayer that would not result from a private sale. On the other hand, they might discover that it is a can of worms&#151;we do not know&#151;and if so there will have to be a gradual run-off in what is a very difficult environment.</p>

achieve it. Frankly, however, the Government have an overriding responsibility to protect the interests of taxpayers, who have put &#163;30 billion into this bank already. These objectives are not fundamentally incompatible, but it will be difficult. There are precedents for such an approach succeeding, although not many. In the United States, the Federal Reserve took over Continental Illinois bank, which was in a comparable position. It was not done for ideological reasons; I think that a Republican Administration were in power. The bank was turned round and eventually sold, so there are precedents.</p>

 I recognise that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s preference, like ours, is for a private sale. However, in advancing his case for nationalisation over administration, what analysis has he done that leads him to suggest that taxpayers, whom he has just identified as the primary beneficiaries of either of these routes, would do better out of nationalisation&#151;given that they would potentially be taking on all &#163;110 billion of liabilities, plus redundancy liabilities that we have not even calculated yet&#151;than administration, through which they are currently exposed only to &#163;30 billion-worth of liabilities?</p>

 None of us knows exactly what would happen because none of us has been exposed to the details of the bank&#146;s position. The Bank of England will not tell us and we do not have the resources to carry out the due diligence on the company. There is,  of course, the possibility, which I have just alluded to, of temporary nationalisation&#151;as has happened historically and as occurred with a small national mortgage bank that was temporarily nationalised and resold very successfully under the Major Government. It was a small enterprise, but it did happen. The whole point is to provide some legal and institutional stability in the hope that, in the end, not only will the taxpayer be repaid but any increase in the value of the bank from its currently depressed market conditions will accrue to the taxpayer. That is the objective.</p>

 Why does the hon.

It would then be for the bank to work out whether it needed to put itself into a kind of voluntary run-off and do it in an orderly fashion or whether it could actually grow the business.

 It is partly what the Bank of England has been trying to do, albeit not very successfully.

One of the problems that arises is that other banks&#151;even very sound banks&#151;are running into serious difficulties in raising capital from the markets. We know that there may well be a very nasty shock in the domestic property market. It is absolutely essential that the Treasury and the Bank of England are totally focused on how to deal with these emerging problems. At the moment, they are totally preoccupied with the problem of the Northern Rock bank, getting the wider problem of the emerging financial crisis completely out of perspective. The Government have failed so far, so they should pick themselves up from the floor, act quickly, take the bank into temporary public ownership and, we hope, limit some of the damage that has already been caused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="71212-0016.htm_para16"><a name="07121278000009">However, this has clearly been a testing time. The disruption to global financial markets that we have seen over recent months was triggered by problems in the US sub-prime mortgage market, as hon. Members will know. When the markets realised the extent of the problems in that market, they began to have doubts about the value of other asset-backed securities. Uncertainty about which institutions were exposed and to what extent meant that institutions lent to each other at much higher rates or not at all. The result was a large reduction of money in the market generally and an increase in the cost of borrowing not just for those with exposure to sub-prime mortgages, but for all institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="71212-0016.htm_para17"><a name="07121278000010">In those circumstances, Northern Rock faced specific difficulties, not because of direct exposure to sub-prime mortgages, but because its business model depended on securing substantial sums from the securitisation and money markets. In September, it became clear that Northern Rock was having severe difficulty in accessing the financing that it needed and that it had no option but to go to the Bank of England. On 13 September, the Chancellor, on the advice of the Governor and the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, authorised the Bank to provide special liquidity support.</p>

 The Economic Secretary&#146;s answer to the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) was not wholly satisfactory.

A month down the line, on 12 or 13 September, the Bank was still refusing to pump in extra cash, which is what the European Central Bank and the Fed did.

 I will press on, because I have some important points to make, but I will give way to the hon. Lady in due course. What I say next may answer the points that have been made so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="71212-0017.htm_para0"><a name="07121278000034">I know that there has been much interest in the amount of support that the Bank is giving. The Bank publishes its balance sheet every week, but&#151;this is important&#151;in common with other central banks it does not provide details of any specific operations, because it believes that doing so would undermine its ability to provide such support. A running commentary on any operations would be likely to have adverse effects that none of us would want&#151;even, I hope, Liberal Democrat Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="71212-0017.htm_para1"><a name="07121278000035">As the House will know, as well as the support provided by the Bank of England there are the Government&#146;s arrangements to guarantee all deposits in Northern Rock, which will remain in place during the current instability in the financial markets. There is therefore no need for savers to take their money out, although of course they are free to do so. Those arguments were necessary, as I hope everyone will agree, and the guarantee will not be removed without proper notice being given to depositors. The Treasury has made it clear that that notice will be not less than three months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="71212-0017.htm_para2"><a name="07121278000036">Together, the ongoing support of the Bank of England and the guarantee of deposits have given Northern Rock an opportunity to consider its strategic options for the future, and it has asked for expressions of interest in purchasing the business. As a major creditor the Government clearly have a direct interest in that process, and will therefore have to agree to any proposals for the future of Northern Rock. On 19 November, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor set out clearly to the House the principles against which such proposals will be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="71212-0017.htm_para3"><a name="07121278000037">First, we must consider the interests of the taxpayer. The money that has been lent must be returned at an appropriate time and rate, and the Government will consider all options with a view to reaching the best outcome for the public purse. Secondly, we want to protect depositors. It is essential for us to do all that we can both to safeguard their interests and to maintain the service given to them. Thirdly, we will of course maintain wider financial stability. As the Chancellor has said, any outcome must also meet European Union state aid rules. The Government are happy to talk to any bidder that satisfies those principles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="71212-0017.htm_para4"><a name="07121278000038">As Members will know, Northern Rock is taking part in accelerated discussions with the Virgin consortium, but says that it is not ruling out other bidders or alternative options. In answer to a specific question from the hon. Member for Twickenham, I can say that the Government are not paying the fees of the Virgin group. I understand that there is an arrangement between Virgin and the company to pay fees up to a specified cap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="71212-0017.htm_para5"><a name="07121278000039">The hon. Gentleman argued that rather than those options being pursued, Northern Rock should be nationalised. As the Chancellor has made clear, we do not intend to rule any option in or out at this stage. But when the hon. Gentleman speaks of public ownership of Northern Rock as a temporary solution, he means that we should use it to try to find a private buyer, and that is exactly what we are already trying to do. As the Chancellor has said, we will of course continue to keep the House informed of developments.</p>

 I thank the hon. Lady for giving way. Her last statement was almost too much.

period. In response to the second part of my hon. Friend&#146;s question, we have not ruled any options in and we have not ruled any options out at this stage. As the Chancellor has said, we will continue to keep the House informed of developments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="71212-0017.htm_para6"><a name="07121278000046">Let me turn to the third part of my contribution. It is clear that there are lessons to be learned from what has happened over the past few months. As we look to learn them, we will be guided by three important principles. First, the primary responsibility for managing risk is and must remain with individual financial institutions and investors. Secondly, that needs to be backed up by strong national regulatory frameworks. Thirdly, regulatory authorities in different countries need to co-operate effectively across borders. With those principles in mind, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has set out our proposals for the international response to what has clearly been an international set of events, and we will continue to work closely on them with the financial stability forum and the International Monetary Fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="71212-0017.htm_para7"><a name="07121278000047">There are also lessons to learn at home, particularly from the fact that the existing financial services compensation scheme clearly did not have the desired effect of giving consumers the confidence they needed. As a first step, the Financial Services Authority has increased the coverage of the scheme to 100 per cent. of deposits up to &#163;35,000, but over the past few months we have been asking whether further reforms to the scheme are required.</p>

<p><a name="st_o346"><a name="07121278000048"><a name="71212-0017.htm_spnew12"><a name="07121278000296"><b>Julia Goldsworthy:</b>
 The hon. Lady spoke earlier of the fact that the Treasury still had all options on the table. Can she confirm then that Treasury officials have drafted a Bill for the nationalisation of the bank, on the basis that that might happen?</p>

 All options are on the table, and we are therefore taking appropriate actions to ensure that they remain on the table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="71212-0017.htm_para8"><a name="07121278000050">I was talking about depositor protection. We have also been exploring possible options to reduce both the likelihood of bank failure and the impact of failure if it does nevertheless occur. Our initial discussion period on those issues closed last week, but we intend to consult on more detailed proposals in the new year and we will legislate on that matter next year, if necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="71212-0017.htm_para9"><a name="07121278000051">At home and abroad, we are learning the lessons of what has clearly been a testing time. We are also continuing to work to resolve the situation with regard to Northern Rock. As I have said today, we have set out clear principles that proposals for Northern Rock&#146;s future must meet, and we will continue to assess proposals against them so that we can protect the interests of taxpayers and depositors and the wider financial stability. I have also said once again today that we are not ruling any option in or out at this stage, but that our preference is for the company to find a private buyer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="71212-0017.htm_para10"><a name="07121278000052">Let me conclude by saying that I believe that providing support for Northern Rock was the right decision, and that it is right to see that support through.</p>

 After all the headlines and hype of the last few days, I had expected the leader of the Liberal Democrats, the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), to come to the House with a clear, well thought-through plan demonstrating what the purpose of nationalisation was, what would happen when the bank was in state control and what his exit strategy would be. However, we heard little to demonstrate that the nationalisation idea was anything more than a gimmicky headline&#151;but we should, of course, have expected that from the Liberal Democrats. The hon. Gentleman is known to be nimble on his feet, but given today&#146;s performance, if he ever achieves his ambition of appearing on &#147;Strictly Come Dancing&#148; he would be all sequins and no steps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="71212-0017.htm_para12"><a name="07121278000057">I also expected more of the Economic Secretary to the Treasury. Unless the Chancellor makes a statement before Christmas, this debate is all that we shall hear about the Government&#146;s position on Northern Rock, which is why we welcome the fact that the Liberal Democrats have secured an Opposition day debate on this issue. We had expected to be given a more substantive statement from the Chancellor before Christmas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="71212-0017.htm_para13"><a name="07121278000058">My speech will make it clear that a number of unanswered questions remain. We know that taxpayers, Northern Rock&#146;s employees, the creditors, the bidders and the shareholders face uncertainty. The Economic Secretary&#146;s brief speech did little to clear up that uncertainty. She said little about how the sale was progressing. Equally worryingly, she said little about the Government&#146;s plans in the event that the sale falls through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="71212-0017.htm_para14"><a name="07121278000059">Let me be clear that Conservatives want a rapid private sale of Northern Rock. We want a sale that safeguards the interests of taxpayers, maintains financial stability, protects consumers and, we hope, results in a bank with a viable future preserving valuable jobs in the north-east. Although we all share those aims, we cannot forget that we are in this crisis because of the Government&#146;s incompetence and mismanagement. Every problem in this crisis has been compounded by their dither and delay, and by confusion and chaos. Everyone accepts that the problems in the credit market are a global phenomenon, yet only this Government appear to be mired in a crisis of the magnitude of Northern Rock.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman laudably expresses a wish that we should have a solution to this involving a private sale that satisfies all the concerns, including those of the north-east. Is he therefore arguing that the taxpayer should forgo some part of either the &#163;30 billion that has been lent or the interest on that sum in order to make the sale possible if it proves difficult?</p>

 The Government, and the Chancellor when he gave evidence to the Treasury Committee&#151;I shall come back to the words that he used in a minute&#151;made it clear that we would get the money back. That is the commitment that the Chancellor made, and we want to hold him to account on satisfying it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="71212-0017.htm_para15"><a name="07121278000062">The problem has become so bad that nationalisation is being discussed as a potential solution, but Labour Members should be in no doubt that nationalisation would be a signal of the Government&#146;s failure, rather than a triumph. Nationalisation has become an option only because of the litany of mistakes made by the Government: they failed to prepare for the problems in the banking sector, despite the advice of the Governor and the Financial Services Authority; they lacked leadership when the Bank became the lender of last resort; they were indecisive over guarantees; and they mishandled the sale process. We must ask ourselves every step of the way what the Government have done to get us into this mess.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="71212-0017.htm_para16"><a name="07121278000063">The first mistake that the Government made occurred when the Prime Minister&#151;the then Chancellor&#151;rejected the clear and unequivocal advice of the Governor of the Bank of England that reforms were needed to the rules on early intervention and deposit protection. During an interview with Robert Peston on last month&#146;s &#147;File on 4&#148; the Governor said:</p>

Is this another example of the then Chancellor ignoring advice from outside his inner circle of advisers?

 At the time, we said clearly that it was a great analysis, but that we did not accept the policy recommendations it contained. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) and Simon Wolfson made a good analysis of some of the problems in the British economy and they made some proposals for policy prescriptions.

It is ironic, in retrospect, that the private sector solution on offer at the time, from Lloyds, was vetoed by the Government because it would have involved the Bank lending money to Lloyds to enable it to take over Northern Rock. However, here we are now, a few weeks later, in a situation in which taxpayers&#146; money will continue to fund Northern Rock once a private sector solution has been found.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="71212-0017.htm_para23"><a name="07121278000076">The Chancellor rejected that bid for Northern Rock, and the wholesale market dried up, so he then agreed that facilities should be provided to Northern Rock with the Bank of England acting as lender of last resort. The leak of the announcement of that policy on 13 September and the formal announcement the following day triggered the queues of retail depositors. Those queues were a clear signal to the authorities that retail depositors did not understand what lender of last resort meant. An action that should have reassured depositors panicked them.</p>

It could have a long-term impact on London&#146;s standing if prompt and decisive action is not taken following this crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="71212-0018.htm_para1"><a name="07121278000078">The strength of our regulatory regime has hitherto been one of the key factors in London&#146;s success and is one of the arguments that we have been able to use to counter the pressure for greater regulation from Europe. It is vital that this crisis does not erode that standing, and the Treasury will need to work much harder in Europe to defend the strengths of the regulatory regime and put in place the right reforms to make regulatory supervision more effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="71212-0018.htm_para2"><a name="07121278000079">It is also important to recognise&#151;and why the Chancellor&#146;s competence is now in question&#151;that while the prospect of a run had been contemplated by the tripartite authorities, no plans were in place to reassure depositors. It appears that no plans were discussed until the queues formed. We know that over the weekend of 15 and 16 September there were discussions about whether retail deposits should be guaranteed to reassure depositors and stem the flow of withdrawals. Again, we know that the Governor had recommended that on the Sunday morning, but again the Government dithered. Remarkably, even on the very day that the guarantee was announced, No. 10 briefed at lunchtime that no guarantee would be on offer. By 6 o&#146;clock, the Chancellor had decided to go for it. Again, there was dither and delay while an indecisive Chancellor made up his mind.</p>

Having given the guarantee, the Government are now consulting on reform of the existing arrangements to find a permanent solution to the problem. If only they had responded to the advice of the Governor and the chairman of the Financial Services Authority earlier in the year. Even the reform and consultation have caused confusion. When the plans were first announced in <i> The Times</i>, the Chancellor appeared to suggest that he wanted a scheme to cover deposits of up to &#163;100,000.

He did not detail what his strategy for running the bank would be. Would he want to continue to accept deposits? In his speech today and in previous statements to the House and the media, he has been very critical of Northern Rock&#146;s lending practices. Would he want to continue to offer mortgages, or would he close down that aspect of the business? How would he manage the existing book of mortgages? Would he encourage prepayments, or would he roll them over? How much more money is he prepared to put at risk while Northern Rock is in public ownership? Those are all decisions that a nationalised bank and its owners&#151;the Government&#151;would need to make. The hon. Gentleman failed to set out a clear strategy for a nationalised bank.

It would be an indictment of their handling of the crisis. At every step of the way, the Government have demonstrated incompetence. The Prime Minister ignored the proposal from the Governor of the Bank of England for reforming the rules to do with early intervention and deposit insurance. The Chancellor failed to display leadership by not having a plan when it was announced that the Bank of England was acting as the lender of last resort. That triggered a run on Northern Rock, in the face of which the Chancellor dithered over whether to issue a guarantee to depositors. Even when he announced it, he was not sure what he had guaranteed. The Chancellor and his aides have sown doubt and confusion in the sale process, keeping options open but remaining unclear about what they are.</p>

I have spoken regularly to the workpeople over the past three months. The workpeople in my constituency&#151;4,000 of them&#151;want the business to be kept intact and they believe that the best way of doing so is to find a private bidder to work in partnership with the Government to secure the business&#146;s future.</p>

If a private bidder is not prepared to become involved in the business at this time, with the necessary banking support from the Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank and Citibank, why should we expect that they would be after a period of nationalisation? I do not know what short term is in this context, but why should we expect that, after three months, six months, three years, or six years, the private sector is going to be any more prepared than it is now? That makes a nonsense of the position, as the workpeople and the shareholders have already recognised.</p>

There are no easy ways forward on an issue such as this. I have spent a lot of time talking to all the bidders about the detail of their options. I have spoken to the board of Northern Rock and other stakeholders. Realistically, all that can be done is for the Government to protect their back as well as they can with the loan finance that has been made available, to make sure that the depositors are safe&#151;otherwise there is no chance of ever getting any more deposits in the business, either now or following restructuring&#151;and to move forward gradually to try to reach a solution.

There is an understandable desire to see a knight in shining armour coming to the rescue, but such knights as have appeared are not self-evidently in a position to repay the vast and unprecedented debts to the taxpayer that the company is piling up.</p>

No one in the House would be prepared to advance any basis on which small shareholders would be protected from the consequences of what has happened. The big losers in the region will be those who work for Northern Rock, the many businesses that supply it, those who benefit from Northern Rock&#146;s sponsorship in the community and, significantly, all the good causes in the region that benefit from the Northern Rock Foundation, which owns 15 per cent. of the shares and got 5 per cent. of Northern Rock&#146;s profits.</p>

The official history of Northern Rock makes it clear that it was devised to persuade reluctant building society directors and members to support demutualisation. It was designed to persuade them that there would be a block of shares that would help to resist takeover by anyone from outside the region, and that the region would continue to benefit from the future success of Northern Rock. What an irony that that 15 per cent. shareholding now has little or no value and certainly will not be a blocking share to a takeover, which people in the region are now anxiously asking for. The events have had a wider impact on confidence in the region. The Government must realise that they could help confidence in the region in many ways that go beyond Northern Rock itself.</p>

Many of us were worried by the speed of the company&#146;s expansion, but we did not know&#151;although the directors must have known&#151;that it was five times more exposed than any other UK bank to borrowing from the markets, relative to the size of the institution.</p>

of what he said. I am still not convinced that the bank&#146;s position was sustainable, or that we can be certain that a run would not have happened, but the speed with which the run took place indeed resulted from that news bulletin deriving from that leak. Would we not all like to know how that came about and whether there was any motive on anybody&#146;s part that generated the leak?</p>

That is essentially what the defenders of the bank&#146;s previous policy are saying&#151;that the regulator should have stopped them having a bad business model, and that banks cannot be relied on to cater for unexpected circumstances. Banking is about managing the risk of the unexpected. That is what banks are for. What happened to risk management?

The association was completely unaware of its name being used and had not received a penny from the trust or network of trusts, whose real purpose was to facilitate the securitisation of the bank&#146;s loan book in terms intended to benefit charitable trusts. It transpires that other banks, including Halifax-Bank of Scotland, Standard Life and Alliance and Leicester, have all engaged in similar exercises, which may involve breaches of UK charity law or procedures.</p>

That looks increasingly uncertain. The big danger is that the bank will be driven into administration, in which case the north-east&#146;s interests are not even in the queue for the proceeds of the resultant fire sale&#151;and it would be a fire sale, selling into the market at a bad time.</p>

to ask whether that would be the best way to help the region, and note that it took not something about the north-east but a threat to London&#146;s banking system to drive those huge amounts of money out of London. Why is London, so to speak, sending so much money to the north-east? It is doing so because London&#146;s banking system, on which London depends, was threatened by what was happening at Northern Rock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="71212-0019.htm_para15"><a name="07121278000140">The taxpayer is pouring into Northern Rock sums far beyond the wildest dreams of regional bodies, local authorities and the whole north-east business community, with no guarantee of getting more than a part of it back, no current interest payments, and precious little control over what is happening to all the money. That is why Northern Rock probably will be nationalised, and, if not, will probably go into administration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="71212-0019.htm_para16"><a name="07121278000141">We probably ought to bite the bullet now, but in doing so we must recognise what the Government&#146;s principles failed to recognise&#151;that the north-east has suffered and will continue to suffer from this disaster, and that the interests of the region must be one of the guiding factors in deciding how the business can be managed into a state where it can survive as a regional financial institution. That is what it was, before it was taken so recklessly into an aggrandising policy that has proved so disastrous. Frankly, to expect more than that&#151;to expect to get more than a modest regional institution at the end of the day&#151;would be unrealistic. Even now, no private bidder, realistically, looks able to promise that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="71212-0019.htm_para17"><a name="07121278000142">We also need to ensure that the foundation survives. I hope that it will, and with wider participation from businesses in the region. At one time in London there was a 1 per cent. club of businesses that gave 1 per cent. of their profits to a charitable foundation. Here we have a ready-made charitable foundation, and I hope that more businesses in the north-east will see that it could belong to them in future. Whatever emerges from Northern Rock, it is unlikely to produce the yield for the Northern Rock Foundation that Northern Rock itself produced.</p>

abroad&#151;I have spent a great deal of my time doing that&#151;spends most of his time in hotel bedrooms watching CNN. I was absolutely amazed to see queues of people waiting to draw their money out of Northern Rock. I happened to be in Tokyo to visit various banks, including the Bank of Japan, and the people there were exceedingly polite and hardly likely to raise the matter with me. The fact is, however, that it did a great deal of damage to the prestige of British banking. That is perfectly clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="71212-0020.htm_para2"><a name="07121278000163">One of the people I visited while in Tokyo was the governor of the Bank of Japan when it went into its great financial crisis in 1985; he is an old friend of mine whom I have known for more than 40 years. He told me that he had to buy up the equity of almost all the leading Japanese banks. They were starting to sell that equity back at a considerable profit when I was there. It is worth noting, however, that it had taken them 15 years to reach a position where they could start to do that. We should not assume that this crisis over Northern Rock will be solved in a matter of weeks or months. It is going to take years to unravel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="71212-0020.htm_para3"><a name="07121278000164">The scale of the so-called credit crunch problem has yet to be fully revealed, and we might end up with the world&#146;s major banks engaging in massive asset reductions. When Citibank, the largest bank in the world, has to borrow $7.5 billion from the Abu Dhabi investment fund at 11 per cent. interest, and has to offer that amount in convertible preference shares, it is a pretty serious situation. I was in Abu Dhabi when the then ruler, Sheikh Zayed, opened the new, rather modest, building to house the Abu Dhabi investment authority. Of course, it is now a building of almost unexampled magnificence, as Lord Curzon might have said. The fact is that Citibank is paying 11 per cent. for that money. We can just imagine the arguments that went on before it agreed to that rate of interest, which is more than double what the Fed was proposing as the present inter-bank rate in the United States.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="71212-0020.htm_para4"><a name="07121278000165">The most dangerous aspect of this situation is the growing reluctance of banks to lend to one another. Inter-bank lending is a crucial and essential part of the banking system. Also, the central banks are in danger of losing monetary control if, when the Fed and the Bank of England reduce their bank rates, the inter-bank rate rises. That is what has been happening, and it sends a very dangerous signal. There are historical parallels, including what happened in Japan in the 1980s. Excess competition in the banking sector led to a huge property bubble and ended in one of the longest recessions in history. Japan is still technically in recession, 15 years later, and its interest rate is 0.25 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="71212-0020.htm_para5"><a name="07121278000166">The resignation of a few prominent chief executive officers, accompanied by huge golden handshakes, will not satisfy public opinion. The fact is that we face a grave international situation. The largest bank in the world, Citibank, is borrowing billions of dollars at 11 per cent. This means that money power has moved out of western hands and into those of Russia, China, India and the middle east. Have I only got 17 seconds left? I cannot solve the world&#146;s financial problems unless I am given another half hour.</p>

 There were two important points in that last contribution&#151;among the travel adverts. One was that this problem in Northern Rock is going to take some years fully to resolve, and a certain amount of patience is going to be required to resolve it. The other was that the Northern Rock problem is a problem not just for one small English region, but for the whole British financial community and for London&#146;s standing in the world. It would be sensible to bear both those points in mind in dealing with this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="71212-0020.htm_para6"><a name="07121278000169">Today, five central banks, including the Bank of England, have announced that they will work together on ways of putting far more cash into the international banking system. That will only increase the growing anger in places such as Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham about this whole situation. If the same arrangements that were announced today had been in place four or five months ago, the Northern Rock collapse would not have occurred. There might still have been problems at Northern Rock, but the collapse would not have occurred. There is a far bigger problem out there than Northern Rock itself, and one bank in the north of England has now become a scapegoat for a much wider set of problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="71212-0020.htm_para7"><a name="07121278000170">In August, the Governor of the Bank of England presented himself to us as the hard man who would face the markets down. Where is that policy today, and where would Northern Rock and the City of London have been if his judgment of the situation at that time had been rather better?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="71212-0020.htm_para8"><a name="07121278000171">When we come to questions of judgment, we must also look at the contributions made on this issue by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable). Northern Rock is now trying to rebuild its deposit base. It is advertising attractive savings at attractive rates, which is the proper thing to do to rebuild that base, and it is trying to retain its existing deposit base by offering incentives to some of the savers who have stayed with it. What does the hon. Gentleman say? What did he say this very afternoon in this place? He said that the workers are doing no work, and that the default rates at Northern Rock&#151;they are one of its real market strengths, and they give its workers not just a great deal of pride but market value in the financial sector&#151;were not genuine. Previously in this House, he described the mortgage practices of Northern Rock as being</p>

attention&#151;this is a very important point&#151;to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s very negative comments about the preferred bidder that Northern Rock has selected.</p>

 One thing that my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham did say that could be tested against the factual record is that the bank is today lending up to 125 per cent. of the value of a property, near the peak of the housing market, on four or five times people&#146;s earnings. Does the hon. Gentleman think that that is wise practice today?</p>

<p><a name="st_o388"><a name="07121278000177"><a name="71212-0020.htm_spnew5"><a name="07121278000338"><b>Jim Cousins:</b>
 I come back to this point. One of the real skills built up by Northern Rock&#146;s workers is making mortgage lending available to the lower end of the income scale and making those mortgages work in a sustainable way. So far, the published record indicates that the bank has been very successful in doing that. That set of skills is of enormous value to our current housing market and it would be sensible not to downgrade those skills and destroy that reputation, which would make that work impossible.</p>

 I am grateful and I will be brief. Does the hon. Gentleman agree with Citizens Advice, which highlighted this issue today, saying that many people on low incomes are taking on too much debt and that the banks should be acting more responsibly? That was raised as a general issue.</p>

<p><a name="st_o392"><a name="07121278000181"><a name="71212-0020.htm_spnew9"><a name="07121278000342"><b>Jim Cousins:</b>
 But it is precisely that general underlying point&#151;a sound one&#151;that reinforces the value of Northern Rock&#146;s lending practices in being able to make lending available to workers on lower incomes and to make it work on a sustainable basis. Northern Rock&#146;s default rates were among the lowest of the big mortgage lenders&#151;a point that needs to be repeated time and time again, because it is part of the real hidden value in the Northern Rock business, which must not be thrown away for nothing in our debates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="71212-0020.htm_para10"><a name="07121278000182">The hon. Member for Twickenham also sought&#151;I return to the point&#151;to downgrade the preferred bidder. He referred to Richard Branson, the gentleman who runs the Virgin consortium. I freely acknowledge something that is not widely known&#151;that the name Virgin has everything to do with tax and very little to do with sex. It is a reference to the British Virgin islands, which were the original tax location of that particular business. All that is fair stuff and fair copy. That is why the hon. Member for Twickenham should have acknowledged the significance of the Government&#146;s requirements, set out clearly in a letter of 25 November, which is available to the House. It states that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="71212-0020.htm_para12"><a name="07121278000184">Now we come to the question that I asked the hon. Member for Twickenham in an intervention: what is the point of nationalisation? Is it to secure Northern Rock&#146;s future as a growing business, headquartered in the north-east? The hon. Gentleman was not very clear in his answer, but the real answer appears in his motion, which refers to</p>
<a name="71212-0020.htm_brev4"><a name="07121278000253"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;temporary public ownership as the only action that will guarantee the loans are paid back in full as soon as possible at the lowest risk to taxpayers.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="71212-0020.htm_para13"><a name="07121278000185">It could not be clearer that the purpose of nationalisation is to put the Government at the head of the queue of creditors in getting their money out. Those are the worst possible conditions in which to be considering the bank&#146;s future. That is a profoundly irresponsible policy. It is nationalisation for fire sale and nationalisation for break-up. Nationalisation for sustained recovery and growing on the business would be a different proposition, but that is not the proposition that the Liberal Democrats are putting forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="71212-0020.htm_para14"><a name="07121278000187">I return to the heart of the matter. The north-east of England does not want to exist for ever as a welfare-dependent region. My hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson) pointed out that we have in Northern Rock an important business, in a growing part of the British economy, headquartered in our region, which few big businesses are now, whose lending practices have been a success. That is part of the new economy of which the north-east of England wishes to be part. The Question before the House is: how do we secure the future of Northern Rock, so that it can play its part in the wider recovery of the north-east economy? If Northern Rock goes down or is broken up, made bankrupt or run off, as the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) mentioned, that would be a disaster for the north-east. It would do psychological damage to the north-east, just as the first Thatcher recession did between 1980 and 1981. Yet that is the hidden meaning of the policy of nationalisation that has been put before the House today. It must be rejected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="71212-0020.htm_para15"><a name="07121278000188">There is a wider point, however. If Northern Rock goes down&#151;broken up in a fire sale, nationalised with the Government putting themselves at the front of the queue of creditors&#151;that will do enormous damage to the City of London&#146;s reputation not only in this country and Europe, but throughout the world. That is not a policy that can be contemplated. How will the Government deal with other banks in order to make arrangements for the run-off of sub-prime mortgages, of which Northern Rock has very few, if they are themselves the owner of a bank? It is a ridiculous&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="71212-0020.htm_para16"><a name="07121278000191">It is clear that the origins of the crisis extend way beyond this country and the confines of Northern Rock, and lie in the difficulties in global credit markets and the inability of Northern Rock in particular to achieve its regular securitisations in order to provide funding. However, the problem was identified in January this year by the FSA in its remarks on the state of credit availability and the implications for liquidity around the world. They were also endorsed by the Bank of England in its quarterly review in April, yet individual financial institutions in this country were slow to react, to put it mildly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="71212-0020.htm_para17"><a name="07121278000192">Northern Rock continued with, and in some areas even increased, its pace of lending, increasing its share of the mortgage market in the first half of the year to 20 per cent. There are many reasons for that, which we could go into. It is fitting that we are having this debate on the day when Northern Rock is being removed from the FTSE 100 index, to mark its demise from its previous position in our financial services sector. The business model was clearly flawed, and the executives in the bank were carried away, partly as a result of their lack of experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="71212-0020.htm_para18"><a name="07121278000193">Northern Rock&#146;s board appeared before the Treasury Committee, and it is notable that the chairman, who was acknowledged not to be a banker and who had quite properly offered his resignation to the senior non-executive when the crisis struck, has been replaced by somebody else who is not a banker. He has recently been non-executive director of a major bank, but his entire career was spent in the oil industry. The chief executive of the bank, who was responsible for the rapid growth in its lending, is still there, as we heard earlier. The chairman of the audit committee&#151;the same person as the chair of the risk management committee&#151;who oversaw the explosion of lending was the only member of the board who was a recognised banker. As emerged earlier today, he was Sir Derek Wanless, the man who was appointed by the Prime Minister to review the finances of the national health service.</p>

They reacted through the tripartite arrangements that had been established by the Chancellor as Chief Secretary to the Treasury 10 years ago, and by the present Prime Minister when Chancellor. It is now clear as day that the tripartite arrangements had not been stress-tested when they were put in place, and it was therefore not at all clear how decisions would be made, and by whom, during a crisis. That fundamental uncertainty about where responsibility lies and decisions are made in the depths of a crisis lies at the heart of the Government&#146;s reaction to this crisis and some of the false moves that they have made. The first real test of the tripartite arrangements has failed.</p>

 I know that hindsight is an inexact science, but will the hon. Gentleman offer a view on whether it might have been better to lend &#163;30 billion to Lloyds TSB or to Northern Rock?</p>

<p><a name="st_o398"><a name="07121278000200"><a name="71212-0020.htm_spnew15"><a name="07121278000348"><b>Mr. Dunne:</b>
 That is precisely the point that I was about to make. With the benefit of hindsight, it is undoubtedly clear that had the Government decided to advance the facility to Lloyds TSB, it would have done so on terms that would have been commercially more attractive to the bank. That would have meant that the bank would not have had to pay the penal rate of interest that is causing part of the problem to the profitability of the remaining part of Northern Rock. I shall say more about that shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="71212-0020.htm_para21"><a name="07121278000201">Much has been made of the fact that what was on the table was not a firm proposal. Indeed, the Chancellor told the Treasury Committee that there was no firm proposal. However, my research makes it clear that Northern Rock ran a competitive bidding process among institutions that might have been in a position to make a bid, that the process began on 20 August, and that by Friday 7 September Lloyds TSB had concluded that it would proceed with an offer, but only on condition that the Government facility of &#163;30 billion was made available at LIBOR flat, a commercial but not penal rate of interest. That offer would have been via a scheme of arrangement, a court procedure, and would therefore not have been conditional on shareholder consent, which would potentially have frustrated the bid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="71212-0020.htm_para22"><a name="07121278000202">The offer was there. It was not completely unconditional, but had the Government accepted it, confidence would have been provided for Northern Rock&#146;s funders and much of the present mess would have been avoided. Had a different decision been made it would undoubtedly have attracted political flak at the time, and there would have been difficulty, but it would have been nothing compared to what we have now.</p>

Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central suggested&#151;decided to brief the BBC on the extent of the problem surrounding Northern Rock on Thursday 13 September. The lender of last resort facility was announced the following day. A decision was made to leak some information&#151;I am not accusing the Chancellor directly, but someone made the decision&#151;and the next day, when the announcement was made, Northern Rock made a statement about its financial prospects. The failure on the part of Government was that no joint decision was made by the parties involved, the three members of the tripartite arrangements and the company. Nor was the decision made at the same time to extend the deposit guarantee, as has been referred to. Had both guarantees been announced together, and had there been a common statement from those concerned, considerable confidence would have been given to the market, we would not have had a run on the bank, and we would not be in the mess we are in. Furthermore, it now seems that the Government were taking all these decisions about critical aspects of market practice without any external advisers. Goldman Sachs was appointed  <br>

only a week after the guarantee was provided. That is another example of poor decision making at the heart of Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="71212-0021.htm_para1"><a name="07121278000204">The next poor decision was the security package that the Treasury and the Bank of England negotiated for their facility. The Bank of England is a bank so it understands security and it appears that it took security over the best assets available, which is good for the Bank of England. The Treasury is not a bank and did not take such good security. What package of security has the Treasury taken? The Economic Secretary gave us a clue; it seems that it does include the seller&#146;s share owned by Northern Rock in the mortgage collateral within Granite. The seller&#146;s share is, I believe, &#163;7 billion of the worst tiering of security within the Granite structure, which effectively means that if the Granite mortgages start to default that will come out of the Government&#146;s security package first&#151;in other words, it is the weakest form of security. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="71212-0021.htm_para2"><a name="07121278000205">What will happen if either of the current offers are pursued? It will be interesting to hear from the Economic Secretary in her winding-up speech what security the Bank of England and the Treasury will be encouraged to surrender. Will they share in the risk with the bidding group, or will&#151;as would be more normal practice&#151;new money coming into the business require priority in security, in which case the Government would be left with even lesser quality assets?</p>

I very much hope that taxpayers will receive all their money back&#151;that is the outcome we all want&#151;but it is hard for me as a former banker to see how that can possibly occur. While the chairman of the Financial Services Authority confirmed yesterday to the Treasury Committee that he regards Northern Rock as solvent, that is due only to the Government facility, since it has not been able to meet its debts as they fall due since mid-September, which is why it went to the Bank in the first place. We now know from the Economic Secretary that the security package includes Northern Rock&#146;s residual share of the mortgage held in Granite, ranking behind &#163;48 billion-worth of security, at the last count, in Granite. It is composed of unsecured lending and home-equity release mortgages, which are the UK equivalent of sub-prime mortgages.

Nationalisation is not a solution that protects the taxpayer. It could do so only in the event of benign market circumstances and over a prolonged period, with the bank being run as a business in competition with every other financial institution that is in the mortgage business around the country by a Treasury that, frankly, is not equipped to do so. It is highly unlikely that those circumstances will prevail. The other circumstance in which it might possibly work is as a facilitation of a back-to-back deal with a private sector purchaser. As I pointed out in an intervention, nationalisation places the Government in the position of being a 100 per cent. equity owner responsible for meeting all &#163;110 billion of liabilities that might fall due. Is that a responsibility that the Liberal Democrats really want the Government to undertake?</p>

 I do not know how much light this evening&#146;s debate has been able to throw on the problems in the inter-bank market or the problem of Northern Rock. It has shed a lot of light on the state of the Front-Bench teams of the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. Once again, it has shown that the Conservatives have no original ideas. As has become blatantly apparent this evening, they are not even prepared to answer their own questions. They are in the business of saying contradictory things to different people, of gesticulating in different directions, and of hinting that their policy line is one thing and then, when that becomes inconvenient, simply saying that it was not party policy when it was stated after all. We have seen through them this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="71212-0021.htm_para5"><a name="07121278000211">The Liberal Democrats, who called for this debate, have also shown that they are all over the place, even though they have a concrete proposal in the form of nationalisation&#151;it is surely the wrong one. It makes no sense for the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) to say that he is extremely worried about the exposure of taxpayers&#146; money through the Bank of England deposits with Northern Rock and a second later to say that he thinks the taxpayer should not just have the deposit risk of a defined amount of money, but should take on the equity risk too by nationalising the bank. That equity risk will not only be the existing equity risk, because, as has been pointed out by the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), who made a sensible intervention for once, future liabilities in the form of redundancy liabilities and so forth can crystallise subsequently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="71212-0021.htm_para6"><a name="07121278000212">The hon. Member for Twickenham said two other odd things this evening. One was that there has not been a comparable banking collapse since Creditanstalt in 1931. A range of banking collapses have occurred since then&#151;there were a number in the 1970s involving the secondary banking crisis. One such collapse happened to London and County Securities bank, which had as its director at the time Jeremy Thorpe, then leader of the Liberal party. It is little wonder that the hon. Gentleman does not want to remember that one. That situation had to be solved by the famous lifeboat, which turned out to be a successful support  <br>

operation. The leader of the Conservative party is even more ignorant than the temporary leader of the Liberal Democrats, because he said, at Prime Minister&#146;s questions, that there had not been a comparable bank crisis or run on a bank for 140 years. He was even further from the mark than the Liberal Democrats are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="71212-0021.htm_para7"><a name="07121278000213">Another extraordinary thing took place. The hon. Member for Twickenham knows quite a lot about economics, but he allowed himself to be completely seduced into demagogy of the most irresponsible and superficial kind this evening. He started comparing &#163;30 billion-worth of deposits placed by the Bank of England with Northern Rock&#151;if that is what the real figure is&#151;with the cost of high-speed trains or hospitals. He knows as well as anyone, and perhaps better than most, that if one buys high-speed trains or hospitals, one loses the cash because it will have been definitively given away. If one places money on deposit with a bank, one has it there. Unless any further write-offs, in addition to existing provisions on the book of Northern Rock, prove to be more than the value of the equity, all the deposits will be repayable, and it is inconceivable that more than a very small proportion of those would be the target of subsequent provisions. The hon. Gentleman knows that. He was merely trying to play to the gallery and to be demagogic when to do so is thoroughly irresponsible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="71212-0021.htm_para8"><a name="07121278000214">What should we do in this situation? The Government are doing the right thing. It was right for the Bank of England to intervene, because that is what lenders of last resort are for. It would be disastrous to have a banking collapse when the inter-bank market is in a considerable psychological crisis, and we are right to prevent that from happening. We should continue with the present arrangements&#151;that may be for much longer than next February, and that does not matter&#151;until we can find a suitable trade sale. Ultimately, if that did approach not work, we would have to opt for administration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="71212-0021.htm_para9"><a name="07121278000215">I hope that the Government bear one point in mind: the enormous moral hazard involved if there were any attempt&#151;I am sure that the Government would not be tempted to do this&#151;to bail out shareholders. That would be wrong. They bear the equity risk of the business and they would have been the beneficiaries had the high-risk strategy of funding the bank up to 70 per cent. on the inter-bank market worked, so they must take responsibility for that strategy that their management adopted. We cannot have the moral hazard of shareholders in that situation being bailed out, otherwise every bank will think that it can adopt the highest-risk strategies, whether on the asset side or the liabilities side, because if it works they will get the reward and if it does not, the taxpayer will pick up the tab. The result of that would be corruption of good banking standards throughout the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="71212-0021.htm_para10"><a name="07121278000216">I welcome today&#146;s important news that the regulators and lenders of last resort here in the European Union and in the United States have got together to provide liquidity for up to three months for the world banking system. What we need in this crisis is exactly what the Government have displayed&#151;calmness, strong nerves and consistency. It is clear that the only Front Benchers displaying those qualities tonight are my right hon. and hon. Friends.</p>

 I had hoped for a greater welcome in the House for this debate, because this is the only opportunity we have had since the issue blew up to discuss points that so many hon. Members from Newcastle and the surrounding north-east area have raised about what should happen to the employees of Northern Rock. The Conservative Front-Bench spokesman said that his party had called for a statement on the issue, but that would not have allowed a full discussion. As my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) said, the fact that the Conservatives did not even feel it necessary to table an amendment that could have outlined some of their views shows how little they have to contribute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="71212-0021.htm_para11"><a name="07121278000218">Today has been an opportunity to raise wider issues about the run on the bank and allow parliamentary time to discuss, and possibly express our preference for, some of the options on the table. Whatever the final outcome, it is clear that there will be a human cost to this episode, although the Minister explicitly did not mention that in her remarks. It was raised by hon. Members with constituents who work for Northern Rock, and we heard some valuable contributions from my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), and the hon. Members for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson), for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson) and for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins), who rightly raised the uncertainty that the staff face. We do not wish to criticise that uncertainty and we share their pain, but they face a difficult and challenging future whether a private buyer takes it on, or the bank goes into administration or is taken into public ownership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="71212-0021.htm_para12"><a name="07121278000219">We cannot expect a private buyer to be Mother Theresa or a knight in shining armour. There are difficult times ahead, and our argument is that taking the bank into temporary public ownership would be a way to provide some stability and a platform for progress. If hon. Members have any criticisms, they should be for the people who devised Northern Rock&#146;s business model, which, the Minister acknowledged today for the first time, had a major role to play in the downfall of the bank. However, I would ask who was responsible for supervising that business model and who set up the circumstances that enabled it.</p>

However, the issue that he raised was not to do with that, but with who took on oversight of the banks. Perhaps if that had stayed with the Treasury, the tripartite arrangement might have been slightly clearer. Early warning signs were not picked up and acted on and the legislative framework was inappropriate. There was a delay in guaranteeing deposits, which stoked public concern, and some of the responsibility, ultimately, has to go back to the Government.</p>

 I was talking about the impact on taxpayers of the Government loan of some &#163;30 billion. That equates to a loan from every taxpayer in the country of &#163;820. Again, that is only an assumption, which we can make because the Bank of England publishes its balance sheet. We have not had explicit information from the Treasury on the terms of the loan or the amount of money that it expects to loan&#151;either up until now or in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="71212-0021.htm_para22"><a name="07121278000230">People have a right to know the extended terms of the loan. I ask the Minister to state explicitly the security. Is it based on the fixed or floating assets? If she can give a clearer answer than she did earlier, I shall be grateful. What can she do to ensure that people are reassured that the Government will seek full repayment of the loan as soon as possible and that a clear time frame will be set out? That information has been far from forthcoming and needs to be provided. Ultimately, if taxpayers are providing this money, they have a right to know that information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="71212-0021.htm_para23"><a name="07121278000231">Of course, it has been a tough time for shareholders, too. Many small shareholders benefited by becoming shareholders when Northern Rock demutualised in 1997, as has been mentioned, and they own about 25 per cent. of Northern Rock&#146;s shares. As always, there is a risk in trading stocks and shares. Financially, it is more&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

 The shareholders are also taxpayers. If the average shareholding for a small shareholder is about &#163;600 and the average tax contribution is &#163;800, they are still net out of pocket. Their anger should be directed at those people who were delivering the business model.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="71212-0021.htm_para24"><a name="07121278000234">It is worth pointing out that the majority of shareholders are hedge fund traders, who do not invest in the long-term security. They invest in the short term, which does nothing to benefit the long-term viability of the bank. For many people, and potentially for the wider economy, there have already been significant consequences of the run on the bank. That raises two fundamental questions. Have lessons been learned, and could the Government have done anything better? There has been some acceptance of failure in the tripartite arrangements and in the regulatory framework. The Government sought to address some of that in the Queen&#146;s Speech.</p>

how it has changed and on how it compares with the inter-bank lending rate. There has been nothing on the security of the loan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="71212-0021.htm_para26"><a name="07121278000236">Another key area of failure has been the Government&#146;s delay in reaching an agreement on a private sale. The longer the debate goes on, the more public money is invested in Northern Rock and the less likely it becomes that there will be a viable takeover by a private organisation at the end of the process. Will the Government accept that they are undermining the viability of a private sale? Will they accept that they are in an incredibly weak negotiating position? Essentially, they are taking part in a poker game where they are showing their opponent the cards and playing with an unlimited number of chips provided by the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="71212-0021.htm_para27"><a name="07121278000237">Every week that goes by, the crisis is costing the taxpayer more money, there is less chance of a proper recovery, and it becomes more probable that the bank will have to end up in public ownership. The position is unsustainable, and that is why we say that the Government must bite the bullet. The least worst option is to take Northern Rock into temporary public ownership, with a view to selling it off later. That would surely be better than the proposition&#151;which the Conservatives seem to support&#151;that the Government would write unlimited blank cheques merely to avoid the dogma involved in taking the bank into public ownership. In fact, the tales of Rolls-Royce or the public mortgage bank that was referred to earlier show that the Conservatives have a record on these matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="71212-0021.htm_para28"><a name="07121278000238">Finally, why is the problem so urgent? All the options are on the table, but the Government must act quickly. If the bank has to be taken into public ownership, that has to happen quickly, perhaps over the recess, and that is why we suggest that enabling legislation should be brought forward now. Will the Minister who winds up the debate confirm that her officials have drafted that legislation, on the assumption that it will be needed sooner rather than later?</p>

He had a wonderful time with his speech: he described one of the private sector consortiums seeking to buy Northern Rock as &#147;vulture investors&#148;, called the Governor of the Bank of England impertinent and said that Richard Branson was engaging but had a criminal record. He added that Northern Rock was bleeding to death, in a bid to frighten anyone interested in keeping their money in the bank or in helping us to provide a solution to what is an extremely difficult problem. I shall restrict myself to observing that, by saying as much, he is not helping.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="71212-0022.htm_para6"><a name="07121290000018">The hon. Member for Twickenham said that there was a great deal of urgency about the need to tackle the problem, but then spent 40 minutes saying how urgent we had to be. We look forward to the new leader of the Liberal Democrats taking over next week, when we will be able to describe the hon. Gentleman as &#147;Mr. Has-Bean&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="71212-0022.htm_para7"><a name="07121290000019">I want to spend a bit of time explaining the principles behind our support for Northern Rock, which has given the bank the opportunity to consider its strategic options for the future. First, the Chancellor has made it clear that the interests of the taxpayer must be protected. I know that it is a matter of concern for hon. Members that substantial sums of money have been lent that must be repaid at an appropriate time and rate. The Government will consider all options with a view to reaching the best outcome for the taxpayer. Other things being equal, we shall view favourably proposals that minimise any residual Government involvement or funding from the public sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="71212-0022.htm_para8"><a name="07121290000020">Secondly, we want to protect depositors. It is essential that we do everything we can both to safeguard their interests and to maintain the service provided to them. We shall view favourably any proposal that minimises disruption to the service provided to Northern Rock&#146;s customers. We expect proposals to include plans for communication with customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="71212-0022.htm_para9"><a name="07121290000021">Thirdly, any proposal must maintain wider financial stability. We shall, therefore, assess proposals to ensure that they will result in a substantial long-term capital  <br>

structure that meets the tripartite authority&#146;s stability and policy objectives, and that there is a viable medium-term business plan. As my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary said earlier, the Chancellor has told the House several times that any outcome must meet European Union state aid rules. Any proposal for Northern Rock&#146;s future must meet the principles I have just set out, and it would have to be approved by the Government.</p>

 Order. There are far too many conversations in the Chamber. Members who have been here throughout the debate want to hear the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="71212-0022.htm_para11"><a name="07121290000025">As Members know, Northern Rock has asked for expressions of interest in purchasing the business, and has announced that it is taking forward discussions with the Virgin consortium on an accelerated basis. Let me be clear, however: no options are being ruled in or out at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="71212-0022.htm_para12"><a name="07121290000026">The hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) made great play of the supposed proposal to buy Northern Rock that was rejected in August. In fact, there was no firm proposal on the table but, as the chairman of the FSA said, there was an exploratory inquiry whether the Bank of England would be prepared lend an institution about &#163;30 billion at commercial rates. Referring to the so-called offer, Sir Callum McCarthy told the Treasury Committee:</p>
<a name="71212-0022.htm_brev2"><a name="07121290001503"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I think it would be incorrect to regard the private sector solution as being a firm, cut and dried offer, it was still at an exploratory stage and there were a number of other issues which would have to be dealt with.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="71212-0022.htm_para13"><a name="07121290000027">There was no offer for the bank in August.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="71212-0022.htm_para14"><a name="07121290000028">Neither the Government nor the Bank would normally provide commercial lending of up to &#163;30 billion for a going concern. Such a loan would be subject to approval by the European Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="71212-0022.htm_para15"><a name="07121290000029">The Liberal Democrats have suggested that we should nationalise the bank. As Treasury Ministers have made clear on a number of occasions, no option is being ruled in or out at this stage. However, I think all Members agree that a proposal from a private buyer that meets the principles we have set out would be the best option, and our preference is for the company to find a private buyer. When the hon. Member for Twickenham talks about nationalisation as a temporary solution, he must mean that we should try to find a private buyer. That is exactly what we are attempting to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="71212-0022.htm_para16"><a name="07121290000030">I conclude by returning to the central issues of the debate: whether the Government should have provided support to Northern Rock, and how we should move forward from the current position. The alternative to the Government&#146;s authorising the Bank to provide support to Northern Rock was to allow the company to fail. I do not recall any Member of the House arguing for that option at the time, although now that the going has got tough some of them appear to be running away from the consequences of the guarantee they supported. The House should be assured that the  <br>

Bank of England&#146;s lending is secured against assets held by Northern Rock, and that the FSA continues to say that Northern Rock&#146;s main asset base&#151;its mortgage book&#151;remains strong and secure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="71212-0022.htm_para17"><a name="07121290000032">It is of course in everyone&#146;s interests that the situation with regard to Northern Rock is resolved as soon as possible, but it is also essential that the public interest is protected and that any proposals for Northern Rock&#146;s future meet the principles that the Chancellor has set out: protecting the taxpayer, protecting depositors and maintaining wider financial stability.</p>

 I am presenting this petition on behalf of some 2,000 residents of Spital, who have signed it to mark their concern about the closure of their local post office.

Indeed, it is interesting to note that they are now at the highest levels since the 1980s. In the 1980s and 1990s, the fertility rates of women in their 20s were actually declining. Since the 1970s, as more women have entered higher education and the labour force they have been increasingly delaying reproduction into their 30s or 40s and this has led, I think, to a greater need for assisted reproduction. That seems to correlate with the demand for assisted reproduction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="71212-0024.htm_para9"><a name="07121290001473">The rise in fertility over the past five years, as reported by the statistics unit of the ONS, is a result&#151;it says&#151;of a large increase in immigration from abroad, as well as the increased support for child care and the maternity legislation introduced, of course, by the Labour Government. The ONS points out that some 20-odd per cent. of births were to people who were born abroad. There is some argument about that and its relevance, but it implies that immigration can develop fertility rates in this country to a higher level. That has yet to be shown over a period of time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="71212-0024.htm_para10"><a name="07121290001474">The general trend in Britain towards a declining birth rate is mirrored in western Europe. Several factors, such as lifestyle factors, an increase in sexually transmitted diseases and a rise in obesity, as well as environmental factors involved in urbanisation and urban lifestyle that affect fertility, have led to a rise in male and female sub-fertility. There are also socio-economic factors, which have allowed couples, as I say, to delay having children. Lack of affordable housing, flexible and part-time career posts for women, and affordable and publicly funded child care have contributed to those low fertility and birth rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="71212-0024.htm_para11"><a name="07121290001475">Couples are delaying starting a family, which has led to a decline in fertility levels due to ovarian ageing and related reasons that have led to a reduced chance of conception. Other factors include tax increases, changes in national insurance and so on, but the main thing I am trying to point out is that the reproductive rates and the need for assisted reproduction are reflected in wider events in our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="71212-0024.htm_para12"><a name="07121290001476">However, I do not want to talk only about reproduction and social issues; I want to spend some time on the issues of scientific service and assisted reproduction treatments. I have a feeling that unless we are careful, the debate on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill will get taken over by a lot of bioethical issues, as we saw in the recent debate in the  <br>

Lords, and we will end up talking about regulation, rather than considering the new scientific endeavours that are coming forward. Of course we must debate bioethics&#151;no one is against that&#151;but I want to talk about assisted reproduction and some of the things that are happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="71212-0024.htm_para13"><a name="07121290001477">We talk about in vitro fertilisation, but in practice assisted reproduction is more than that. It includes all fertility treatments&#151;ovulation induction, interuterine insemination and gamete intrafallopian transfer, as well as IVF. There are various ways to add eggs and sperm together to allow the conception of a child, yet we regulate only IVF. We do not consider whether the other ways of developing an embryo should be regulated. That is quite obvious in the Bill, which is lacking in that those other technologies are not considered. I guess we think that IVF will be the only treatment in the future. Because of that, we worry about the welfare of the children and about the need for a father&#151;all these issues are being debated&#151;but what about the welfare of the woman and the effects of treatments on her? For example, ovarian stimulation, whereby women are, in my opinion, overdosed with vast amounts of hormones, is being shown to be quite unnecessary. A single dose of a hormone or a reduced level can be just as effective in producing eggs and, at the end of the day, the embryo.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="71212-0024.htm_para14"><a name="07121290001478">In the regulation of assisted reproductive technologies, medical practices, laboratory practices and new technologies and research are all regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which has concentrated on those areas. There are inconsistencies in clinical protocols, the uses of drugs, dosages and practices. People, particularly women, are confused about the gross inconsistencies in clinical practices and they feel vulnerable. I think that the entire service should be delivered within the NHS, but I am not going to say that people are being forced into the private sector, to pay astronomical sums of money to receive any of those treatments, many of which have certainly not been scientifically studied or undergone proper clinical assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="71212-0024.htm_para15"><a name="07121290001479">In my opinion, the Healthcare Commission has been efficient in regulating and monitoring clinical practices, looking at clinical complications, including morbidity and mortality, and taking effective action where necessary. Perhaps the Healthcare Commission should regulate IVF medical practice, with advice from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the royal colleges. We need an efficient and accessible clinical watchdog, but that is not proposed in the Bill at all. We are talking about legislation to deal with assisted inception involving IVF treatment, which is the mainstream clinical treatment, but we need a watchdog&#151;a Government or parliamentary body&#151;to address how it should be assessed and funded. Joining two bodies together seems to have been rejected, with a single body being put forward. We need to debate that. All those issues will have to be discussed in the debate on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, but I have my worries that that will not happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="71212-0024.htm_para16"><a name="07121290001480">My further worry is that people will tag on amendments to the Bill about abortion. I am quite prepared to stand and argue about the principles of abortion for days and days, as are other people; but if   <br>

we are not careful, abortion will be tagged on to the debate through amendments and take it over, meaning that the issues that I am raising will not be reflected in the good legislation that all sides recognise we need, in terms of the outcomes of research and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="71212-0024.htm_para17"><a name="07121290001481">We also want a clear and comprehensive presentation of information to the wider public. Term live birth rates should be a measure of success rates. League tables are published in <i> A Patient&#146;s Guide</i>, but I think that it contains misleading information, and that detailed information about clinical trials should be included. Information about complications, morbidity and mortality rates per clinic should be published, not just success rates. The public need to know all that as well. It would be good if reports followed up what happened to the women involved and their children at different stages in their lives, but we do not have much information about that either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="71212-0024.htm_para18"><a name="07121290001482">I think that if we are not careful, we will not get through all the issues that will be discussed when the Bill is debated. We will spend a great deal of time discussing all the ethical and moral issues surrounding the decision of same-sex couples to have babies, and we will also be expected to try to discuss abortion, which will be quite impossible. I think&#151;and I hope the Minister will comment on this&#151;that either a Joint Committee or a House of Lords Committee should consider abortion in its own right, taking account of all the evidence that is presented. I do not mean just scientific and medical evidence, but evidence dealing with the moral and ethical aspects. A House of Commons Committee was established, but examined only the scientific aspect. The issue should be seen as a whole in the context of the society in which regulations will be implemented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="71212-0024.htm_para19"><a name="07121290001483">Will patients be charged for eggs? Will fees be charged for individual cycles? Will three cycles be necessary, or will one be sufficient if less hormone is needed for stimulation purposes? I initiated a debate on the issue in Westminster Hall a few months ago, when my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton) was the Minister responsible for public health. I think she considered the points that I made, and I should be pleased to hear whether there have been any developments in relation to reduction in the use of hormones which, in my opinion, seriously affect embryos and women&#146;s health. I believe that smaller doses could produce equally high success rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="71212-0024.htm_para20"><a name="07121290001484">That leads to the question of the number of embryos that are being implanted. We want only one to be implanted; we do not want multiple births and all the concomitant problems that may arise. According to Scandinavian countries, current technologies can be quite successful in developing a single embryo that proves healthy and able to bring satisfaction to people&#146;s lives. People want to have children, or to continue to have them, but for various reasons&#151;which I have outlined&#151;cannot have them. It is possible that infertility is more rife than it used to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="71212-0024.htm_para21"><a name="07121290001485">I want to say a little about survivors of cancer, particularly young people who receive severe treatment and whose ovaries may be damaged if it continues for a long time. It is their choice, or that of their parents or loved ones, but I think there should be a way of determining whether the sperm and egg should be stored for use in later life, after they have recovered. We  <br>

had a ceremony today involving CLIC Sargent, which is involved in such cases. Thankfully many young people have recovered&#151;survivorship is the name of the game for young people with cancer now&#151;but many have been severely affected at one stage in their chemotherapy treatment, and the treatment may have damaged their eggs or sperm. We need a mechanism to ensure that if they want assisted-reproduction techniques to be applied to their sperm and eggs, those techniques are available. I do not think that such issues are entirely reflected in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="71212-0024.htm_para22"><a name="07121290001486">Many people have drawn attention to the continuing problem of postcode prescribing. The way in which primary care trusts operate the technologies varies greatly&#151;they are available in some areas but not in others&#151;and I think we need a proper analysis of the position. We hear about drugs, but we should know more about the technologies. I am excited about all the new possibilities, and the way more people are being give the right to have children. However, when we are drawing up a human embryology Bill, we should ensure that it reflects all the developments that are taking place out there. We should not nit-pick when it comes to technologies. We should not regulate some and fail to regulate others. Hopefully we will not regulate some of them; self-regulation may be possible. However, I doubt that very much, when we still have strong private sectors in the health service and we are coming from a situation where assisted reproduction is still costing those who are rich and can afford it lots of money and other people cannot afford it and cannot have the treatments. That is a real challenge for the Government and these issues will come to the fore during the debate on human embryology. We must talk about it fully, and not just nit-pick. I speak as somebody who chaired the Select Committee that dealt with this issue, and who has the scars on my back to prove it. I also served on the Joint Committee. Everyone thought it was an interesting area to discuss, but they felt disquieted afterwards that many issues had not been touched on. I hope the Minister will pick up on that and be able to say whether we will be able to do a good job or an excellent job.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) on securing the debate, which is on a subject of great concern to many people in all our constituencies. May I begin by making a few remarks on his comments on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, which is currently being discussed in another place? It provides not only for in-vitro fertilisation to be regulated, but for donor insemination and artificial insemination to be regulated, and it has recently been extended to cover the regulation of donor sperm services provided through the internet. The remit of the regulations for fertility treatment was considered by scrutiny of the draft Bill in a Joint Committee of both Houses. In responding to the report, the Government took note of the strong arguments that had been put.</p>

creation? It is also about the regulation of embryos created from combined human and animal genetic material for research. It will make sure that there will continue to be a ban on sex selection of offspring. It recognises family and social support and the best interests of the child. It also makes alterations by lifting some of the restrictions on collected data to make it easier to do follow-up research. May I also remind my hon. Friend that abortion is not included within the scope of the Bill and that that will be a matter for this House?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="71212-0024.htm_para24"><a name="07121290001489">My hon. Friend also touched on the important question of the services available now through the national health service for those seeking fertility treatments. Since becoming the Minister for public health, I have, as we would expect, received letters from people who cannot have a child and find that their local primary care trust cannot help them immediately. In some cases, their PCTs have said that they cannot help them at all. Those letters express the distress people feel in that situation&#151;the impact of finding out that their family will not happen as planned, and in many cases the sense of being let down by the national health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="71212-0024.htm_para25"><a name="07121290001490">My hon. Friend referred to a postcode lottery in prescribing. There are of course many other people who do receive NHS fertility services, and I hear far less from those people, as we would also expect. Even so, those receiving IVF treatment are unlikely at present to be receiving up to the three cycles of IVF as set out in the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines. I have made it clear in this House that I am concerned about this inequitable access to IVF, and I have no hesitation in saying today that we need to address that. In a moment, I shall update the House, and my hon. Friend in particular, about the further steps being taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="71212-0024.htm_para26"><a name="07121290001491">My hon. Friend spoke with a great deal of feeling about the ways in which we could look at assisted reproduction treatments differently, encouraging lower doses of drugs and ensuring that all the treatments are regulated in the best possible way. The Bill&#146;s proposal is precisely to undertake that. I would be pleased if he were to write to me in detail, if he feels able, about the particular points and concerns that he is raising.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="71212-0024.htm_para27"><a name="07121290001492">More generally, clinicians and others may have evidence about particular treatments, including new ones. The Department of Health has asked clinicians who favour minimal assisted IVF to give evidence directly to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. In progressing this approach, it must be made clear that where clinicians and others have evidence about treatments, which may be new or not commonly practised, it would be helpful if such information was made available to NICE. In 2008, NICE will be assessing whether its fertility guideline needs to be updated and, if so, to what extent. It is right that it should have the information in order to take that decision. I implore my hon. Friend to follow that approach.</p>

fertility patients&#146; support organisation, Infertility Network UK, to work with the NHS to identify and share best practice in the provision of IVF. Infertility Network UK is visiting a selection of primary care trusts, which have a range of types of provision, to explore the differences and to ensure that good practice is identified and shared. The visits are in progress. Meetings with about 12 PCTs have either taken place or are in hand, and more will be arranged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="71212-0025.htm_para1"><a name="07121290001494">Recognising the continuing variation in provision&#151;my hon. Friend touched on that&#151;we have extended the project&#146;s remit. In July, I announced that the NHS, with Infertility Network UK, will develop social access criteria to help PCTs to develop a standardised approach across the county for providing couples with NHS treatment. We have also announced that we will monitor IVF provision to help identify where further work is required to assist PCTs in assessing the needs of fertility patients and to deliver services in an equitable way. Many of the points that my hon. Friend touched on will be dealt with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="71212-0025.htm_para2"><a name="07121290001495">Monitoring has begun to examine what is happening in the different PCTs. A survey carried out through strategic health authorities asked questions about the level of IVF provision, expenditure and local access criteria. So far, the response rate has been 90 per cent.&#151;we are chasing up the remainder. We shall consider the best way of achieving long-term IVF monitoring on many of the issues that have been identified and on IVF&#146;s availability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="71212-0025.htm_para3"><a name="07121290001496">The replies to the survey unfortunately show continued variation from PCT to PCT, and that is frustrating for patients. That goes to the heart of the point that my hon. Friend raised about access to accurate and standardised information about the treatments. However, the vast majority of the PCTs are providing at least one cycle of IVF, although some are not transferring any embryos that have been frozen and stored. I wrote to PCTs about that when I came to office in the summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="71212-0025.htm_para4"><a name="07121290001497">The survey currently shows that some 30 PCTs provide two or more cycles of IVF, and we will verify that as soon as we can. We are setting up an expert group to advise on the work, with the NHS and the Infertility Network UK. That may not go as far as my hon. Friend suggests, but it offers a good starting point. I have written to the Chairman of the Health Committee to tell him and the Committee members of our intentions. The group will have a broad remit to identify the barriers to full implementation of the NICE fertility guidance and to provide advice, support and information to overcome those barriers. There are other issues that we may need to reflect on following this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="71212-0025.htm_para5"><a name="07121290001498">As well as the discussion of NHS infertility provision in the other place, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has called for a professionally led national strategy to reduce multiple births that occur following fertility treatment and that contribute to a significant number of premature and low-weight babies. As the expert group looks at the range of issues relating to NHS IVF and provides advice, I will ask it to advise on that issue specifically, and it will have much to consider, as this brief debate indicates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="71212-0025.htm_para6"><a name="07121290001499">I hope that I have been able to give some indication to my hon. Friend of the progress that we are trying to  <br>
