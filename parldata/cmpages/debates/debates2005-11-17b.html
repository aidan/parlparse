 (Lab): If she will make the temporary ban on imports of exotic birds permanent. [29228]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="51117-01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Mr. Ben Bradshaw): </b> 
 The European Union ban on the import of captive birds has been extended until 31&nbsp;January 2006. The Government are considering the arguments for and against a permanent ban. That will be discussed with EU and trading partners in the months to come. Subject to certain conditions, restrictions placed on gatherings of pigeons will be lifted today.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="51117-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Devine: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that answer. I am sure that he is aware of the concern, not only in my constituency but throughout the country, about the damage that bird flu could do, especially following the deaths in China and other parts of Asia. What reassurance can he give the House about the action plan that he is developing to ensure that similar tragedies do not occur here?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="51117-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The threat of avian flu is being taken seriously across Government. For DEFRA&#039;s part, and as we hold the European presidency, we are taking a lead in Europe. We are constantly updating our contingency plan and we are ever vigilant in surveying the potential spread of avian flu. Just last week, we held a table-top contingency exercise to test our avian flu contingency plan.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="51117-01_spnew2"><b> Michael Fabricant  (Lichfield)</b> 
 (Con): I know that the Department is taking the matter seriously, but I must ask whether the Treasury is also doing so. I have pressed the Minister on this issue before, but I must do so again. Why will there be only six sniffer dogs at British ports to detect the illegal importation of birds and other animals? With only six sniffer dogs available, and each animal able to work for only five hours at a time, how can that stop the illegal importation of such birds?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="51117-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 It is six more sniffer dogs than any other EU member state has, and it is six more than this 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1086</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>country had when the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party was last in power. We are spending &#163;20&nbsp;million more than his party spent on border controls of illegal imports. As my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine) has just reminded the House, we have also imposed a ban on the import of birds.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="51117-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. James Paice  (South-East Cambridgeshire)</b> 
 (Con): According to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, last year nearly 700,000&nbsp;birds were imported into the EU, 19,000&nbsp;of which came to the UK. However, according to the EU, only 67,000&nbsp;came into Europe, of which a staggering 66,000&nbsp;apparently came to the UK. Can the Minister explain the 10-fold discrepancy in the figures? As we now know that avian flu has been brought into the UK through the bird trade, is he worried that if he does not know how many birds are brought in, he cannot know how effective our border controls are and cannot therefore enforce the biosecurity that we all need?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="51117-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 No, I do not accept that. As the hon. Gentleman points out, the UK is not among the largest importers of wild birds. The southern European countries&#151;Spain, Italy and France&#151;have a much higher level of imports. The hon. Gentleman omitted to say that CITES does not support a permanent ban on the import of wild birds, for conservation reasons.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="51117-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Colin Breed  (South-East Cornwall)</b> 
 (LD): The Minister will know that one of the lessons learned from the foot and mouth tragedy was that action plans should be regularly tested and updated. I am interested to learn that a table-top test was held a few weeks ago. When was such a test held previously?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="51117-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman should know, we published our latest avian flu contingency plan in July, as part of the Government&#039;s generic contingency plan for exotic diseases. Although it was made public at the time, few hon. Members noticed, because avian flu had not yet hit the headlines. The plan is constantly reviewed. Recently, we have increased the level of precaution that we intend to take in the event of an outbreak of avian flu in this country owing to the potential role played by wild birds. The plan is constantly being tested and updated, given the changing risk assessment provided by our veterinary advisers.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="51117-01_spnew8"><b> David Mundell  (Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Minister accept that many people, such as Mr. Gary Wall in my constituency, carry out legitimate bird import and breeding activities? When a ban is implemented, I hope that the interests of those people will be taken into account, because&#151;as CITES accepts and the Minister has just suggested&#151;they are carrying out important conservation activities.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="51117-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman should speak to his Front-Bench colleague, the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice), to whom I have just made the point that there are those&#151;including CITES, the organisation responsible for the conservation of rare species&#151;who support the legitimate and regulated trade in wild birds, not just because they fear that otherwise it 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

 (Con): If she will ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to raise import duties on foreign milk coming into the UK. [29230]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="51117-01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Jim Knight): </b> 
 The UK is part of the single market in which goods are traded across the European Union. The percentage of raw milk imported into the UK amounted to 0.45&nbsp;per cent. of domestic production in 2004. Import tariffs for agricultural goods entering the UK from outside the EU are EU wide and subject to World Trade Organisation rules.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="51117-01_spnew10"><b> Daniel Kawczynski: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for that reply, but he knows that milk imports to this country can also come in powder form. I sincerely believe that the Government are not doing enough to help dairy farmers such as my constituent, Mr. Stuart Jones, who face a crisis in the industry. I plead with the Minister on bended knee&#151;I am not normally this emotional&#151;to do more for my Shrewsbury dairy farmers before they go out of business.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="51117-01_spnew11"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 We are working hard for the likes of Mr. Jones and the dairy industry. We accept that these are difficult times, which is why we set up the dairy supply chain forum. That is working hard to add value, which the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) was talking about in Westminster Hall last week. Dairy farmers will make money by adding value and improving profitability.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="51117-01_spnew12"><b> Paddy Tipping  (Sherwood)</b> 
 (Lab): Does the Minister accept that it is no good preaching free trade while not practising it at home? There are problems in the dairy sector, and is not the thing to do to focus on the supply chain and make sure that there is trust between producers, processors and, most importantly, retailers?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="51117-01_spnew13"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 Of course I agree with my hon. Friend, who is knowledgeable in these matters. We need to increase transparency and trust, and Lord Bach is heading up that work through the forum.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="51117-01_spnew14"><b> Sir Peter Tapsell  (Louth and Horncastle)</b> 
 (Con): Are the Government fully aware of the desperate financial situation facing many milk-producing farmers in this country? The amount of milk imported from the continent will increase enormously if they are forced out of business. What will the Government do to help? The problem is that the retailers, in the form of the big supermarket chains, have forced the price of milk down so far that it is not economically possible for even the most hard-working and efficient farmer to earn a living. Have the Government considered bringing back the milk marketing board&#151;or something of that kind&#151;the abolition of which I strongly opposed at the time?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="51117-01_spnew15"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 As I have said, we are well aware of the problems faced by dairy farmers. I met representatives 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1088</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of the National Farmers Union yesterday, and we discussed at length the problems that they face. Like us, though, they want their businesses to be able to operate effectively; it is for the Government to try to facilitate that, and that is what we are doing.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="51117-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Roger Williams  (Brecon and Radnorshire)</b> 
 (LD): My party is certainly not in favour of raising tariffs on imports to stimulate trade with third world countries, but will the Minister speak to the EU Commissioner responsible at the WTO negotiations and ensure that tariffs on food coming into this country are not reduced until other market-distorting subsidies in other countries have been put to bed, giving our farmers a fair chance to produce profitably?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="51117-01_spnew17"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 Yes, we need a balanced package. Our long-term goal is progressively to abolish all trade-distorting agricultural subsidies and all barriers to agricultural trade in the form of tariffs and quotas.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="51117-01_spnew18"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton  (Macclesfield)</b> 
 (Con): The Minister is a very reasonable man. Does he not think it strange that in a country with absolutely the right environment for milk production, where the grassland is the best in the world for milk production, dairy farmers, including those in my constituency, are going out of business because they cannot compete, not least because of the activities of the superstores to which my hon. Friend the Member for Louth and Horncastle (Sir Peter Tapsell) referred? Is it not possible for the Government to do more to assist the dairy farmer, because at the end of the day only productive farming can maintain the countryside?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="51117-01_spnew19"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is also a reasonable man, and I thank him for his question. A lot of the symptoms that he described in dairy farmers&#039; operations are why there is a good long-term future for farming, because all the circumstances are right. Many people talk about the problems of supermarkets, which is why my noble Friend Lord Bach and I will next month meet Ministers at the Department of Trade and Industry to discuss the operation of the market, and particularly the role of supermarkets.

<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="51117-02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Mr. Ben Bradshaw): </b> 
 Bovine TB restrictions affected approximately 5.2&nbsp;per cent. of cattle herds in Great Britain between January and September 2005, compared with approximately 4.7&nbsp;per cent. for the same period in 2004. Corresponding figures for Cheshire show that 2&nbsp;per cent. of herds were restricted owing to a TB incident in the first nine months of 2005, compared with nearly 3&nbsp;per cent. for the same period last year.

 It might help the hon. Lady if I reassure her that we are well aware of all the representations made by professional veterinary organisations, including the BVA, and we expect to make an announcement on the issue shortly.

<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="51117-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): Will my hon. Friend take some advice from this side of the House? Given that the Government have made it clear that the only answer to bovine TB is science, is not looking for short-term solutions, whether that is blaming the badger as the cause or blaming it as the transmission mechanism, as wrong as arguing that the badger does not have a part to play? If we look for short-term solutions, we will end up in a bigger mess.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="51117-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is quite right. It is critical that Governments of all political colours do not make decisions that either are short term or could make the situation even worse. We must take that into careful consideration when we make our announcement later this autumn. A difficulty highlighted by the hon. Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton), who talked about targeting infected badgers, is that there is no way of telling whether a badger has TB until it is dead.
</p>

 (DUP): I am sure that the Minister will agree that the farming community is doing its utmost to prevent the spread of TB in the farm animal population. What will the Department do to rid the wildlife population of the disease? We cannot expect members of the farming community continually to test farm animals for TB while their animals are being re-infected, probably from contact with wildlife.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="51117-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I accept that many farmers take sensible biosecurity precautions, but there is always room for improvement. Eighty per cent. of TB cases are spread from cattle to cattle, but there is always more that we can do. I expect that some of the announcements that we will make later this autumn will be about what more can be done to prevent the spread of TB between cattle as well as how we may address the wildlife problem.

 Slow progress, I am afraid. Humane sterilisation or contraception that can be administered easily&#151;namely, orally&#151;is still some way off.

 All that the Department can know is information that is available. As far as I am aware, there is no clear indication why the first finches died, but the right hon.

 There may be a slight misunderstanding here. There has never been individual testing of all birds. Indeed, for many years the practice has been to pool samples, because it is convenient and because the interest in the past has always been in whether a whole consignment is infected&#151;if disease is detected, the whole consignment is killed. I know that the House will understand that the Department must tread with particular care in respect of incineration. The appropriate authority, which is the local authority, is conducting an investigation, and we were not in a position to say anything about that investigation without its agreement. It has now agreed that there should be mention of the fact that some of the birds died and were incinerated, because it is important to account for all the birds in the facility. However, I cannot say more to the House about an ongoing investigation.

 I thank my hon. Friend for that full reply. The report is very good, but it is also worrying, because, for example, it indicates that some 25&nbsp;per cent. of movements by heavy goods vehicles involve the transportation of food. To mirror some of the earlier questions about local supply, in this day and age it is arguable that the distance that food is transported is not only bad for the environment but reduces quality and nutritional value. I note that my hon. Friend has said that he will meet Department of Trade and Industry Ministers to see what they can do about the supermarkets, which are responsible and must play a role if food miles are to be seriously decreased. I wonder what he intends to say&#151;

 I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#039;s comments about the report. He is right to highlight the importance of local food for a number of different reasons, but we should bear in mind the fact that the external costs associated with UK food transport are just over &#163;9&nbsp;billion a year, of which &#163;5&nbsp;billion is attributed to the cost of congestion and &#163;2&nbsp;billion to road accidents, and we must make sure that we debate the matter in that context. We are making efforts across Government to ensure that our transport is more sustainable, and I will certainly take up my hon. Friend&#039;s points when I meet DTI Ministers.

What steps is he taking to encourage the supermarkets to re-examine their wholesaling and distribution arrangements to try to minimise food miles?

 Best practice is at the heart of achieving that goal, which we all share. The Government have encouraged the efficient distribution of food and drink, including by the supermarkets, in our sustainable distribution strategy. In addition, we have challenged the industry to reduce the external costs of domestic food transportation by 20&nbsp;per cent. by 2012.

 I can chase up any questions that the hon. Lady wants replies to. I know that she has been&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particularly keen to see a flood alleviation scheme for Thirsk. Hambleton district council previously promoted such a scheme, but has now decided not to continue with that, so the responsibility for the watercourse will transfer to the Environment Agency on 1&nbsp;April next year. It will then incorporate the scheme into its investment planning programme. I know that the hon.

<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1106</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to Mr. Samson, at the publisher Weidenfeld and Nicholson, relating to Sir Christopher Meyer&#039;s book&#151;which made for interesting reading, but was not entirely appropriate as a book. However, Sir Gus O&#039;Donnell said that the Government had no comments to make about the proposed book. Is not that extraordinary?
</p>








<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51117-06_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 No one is suggesting that there is no room for improvement in the Child Support Agency, but I emphasise to the hon. Gentleman that the CSA is dealing with about 1.4&nbsp;million separate cases. About 511,000&nbsp;cases are on a new system; 652,000&nbsp;cases are on an older computer system; and 286,000&nbsp;cases have been moved from the old system to the new system. That demonstrates that there has been significant change. Indeed, the Government&#039;s reform arrangements mean that whereas under the old scheme only about 50&nbsp;per cent. of non-resident parents had a nil assessment, under the new scheme just under 90&nbsp;per cent. pay at least &#163;5&nbsp;a week. The new, more streamlined system has meant that more parents are contributing. However, I am not suggesting to the House for a moment&#151;neither was my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister yesterday&#151;that there are no further issues of reform, improvement and streamlining the system that do not need addressing. That is why there is a review, and it is why that review must improve still further the arrangements for child support.

<a name="51117-06_para12">
<a name="stpa_28">As for ID cards&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am perfectly willing to answer only one of the questions, but the hon. Gentleman asked a number, as ever, and referred to Dame Stella Rimington&#039;s observations, in a personal capacity, about identity cards. Perhaps I could encourage hon. Members to read all the comments. I realise that, first thing in the morning, there is always a temptation simply to look at the headline or perhaps the first paragraph of the story, but Dame Stella&#039;s comments are rather more balanced than he suggested. She said that she felt that ID cards would have a purpose, provided that the technology was effective and that they could not be forged. That is clearly part of the Government&#039;s ambition and something that we have set out to the House on a number of occasions. If the hon. Gentleman wants to debate that again, I am sure that he can do so when the Identity Cards Bill returns to the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-06_para13">
<a name="stpa_29">The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of pensions in the light of the forthcoming Turner report. I will not comment on leaked documents at this stage. I understand that the final report will be published on 30&nbsp;November, and there is an issue that the country must address, not least because people are living longer. That is obviously something to be celebrated&#151;something for which, I anticipate, the Government will claim credit&#151;but we have a situation today where four people are in work for every person who has retired. That compares with 10&nbsp;people for every one in work 50&nbsp;years ago, and it compares with the prospect of only two people being in work in the future for every person who is retired. That inevitably means that we must have a review of pension arrangements to ensure that people can lead a decent, comfortable life in retirement. There are challenges&#151;they are challenges for all hon. Members&#151;and I hope that Members will approach them in that proper and sophisticated way.

That means that, from time to time, there is a rationalisation&#151;a change&#151;in the distribution of our support activities across the country, but that is always done with a view to ensuring the maximum support that we can give to our armed forces. I am sure that, in due course, my right hon. Friend will deal with those issues when he addresses the House.

 Last week at business questions, the sad case of Mrs. Anderson was raised. She gave birth at 4.30&nbsp;am after a long labour, but was thrown out of the hospital at 9&nbsp;am, less than five hours after the birth. I requested a statement from the Secretary of State for Health on the matter. The Leader of the House declined that request, but kindly said that a Health Minister would contact me. During the past week I have received no telephone calls, no e-mails, no letters nor any contact from a Health Minister at all. Will the right hon. Gentleman comment on that?
</p>








<p><a name="st_65"><a name="51117-10_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 The matter needs to be followed up and I will ensure that it is.

 Given that of Britain&#039;s 78,000&nbsp;convicted prisoners in jail 10,000&nbsp;are overseas nationals, will the Leader of the House arrange for the Home Secretary to make a statement to the House about how he intends to address the &#163;300&nbsp;million annual cost of the exercise and whether he will present proposals to return to secured detention in their countries of origin the staggering number of convicted overseas criminals in our country?
</p>








<p><a name="st_67"><a name="51117-10_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 It is important that those who can be returned safely and securely to their countries of origin should be returned. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is assiduous in making sure that, where we can do so, the British taxpayer does not bear the burden of overseas nationals in our prison facilities. However, it is equally important that we give effect to the decisions of the courts. I am sure the hon. Gentleman would otherwise have been congratulating the Government on ensuring that we take firm action in relation to those who break our laws.

 On Saturday morning, there will be several thousand of my constituents in the high street of Hemel Hempstead celebrating&#151;or commemorating, perhaps&#151;30&nbsp;years of trying to save the Hemel Hempstead hospital. I am sad to say that the hospital is facing the biggest crisis ever. It is about to have its intensive care unit, its cardiac unit and a brand-new stroke unit closed, and the accident

<br>&nbsp;<br>and emergency acute services will close as well. May we have a debate in the House about where the money is going, because it is not arriving on the front line in Hemel Hempstead?
</p>








<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51117-10_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I can give the hon. Gentleman a very clear answer. In the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire strategic health authority, of which his constituency is part, there are 2,975&nbsp;more nurses, 659&nbsp;more doctors and 168&nbsp;more national health service consultants. That is where the extra resources are going. They are going to the front line, and they are providing and paying for better national health services in his constituency than ever was the case under Conservative Governments.

 The farming industry is still a major industry in Northern Ireland and many are the challenges facing it, including the burdens of legislation and regulation emanating from Europe and unfair competition from foreign produce, so will the Leader of the House find time for a major debate on that very important industry?
</p>








<p><a name="st_71"><a name="51117-10_spnew15"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 There is no doubt that the farming industry in Northern Ireland and other parts of the United Kingdom makes a vital contribution, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that it is one of the most protected, supported and assisted industries in not only the UK, but Europe, not least as a result of the European Union common agricultural policy. I pay tribute to farmers and their contribution, but he must recognise that we cannot allow farming in the European Union to stand still, because it requires significant change and reform.

 Earlier, the Leader of the House chided my hon. Friend the shadow Leader of the House for his comments about barmy Britain and trawling tabloids. If he read Rabbi Julia Neuberger&#039;s book, &quot;The Moral State We&#039;re In&quot;, he would find a thoughtful exposition of how several of those absurd regulations affect the voluntary sector. On Sunday mornings, for example, I help to coach at Wimbledon hockey club. I understand the need for Criminal Records Bureau checks, but why must I reapply triennially, which is absurd? The Leader of the House has agreed to hold a debate on how regulation is affecting industry. Will he also agree to a debate on how absurd, barmy British regulations are affecting the voluntary sector?

<p><a name="st_73"><a name="51117-11_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right to highlight the problem he faces on Sunday mornings, which I recognise as an issue for many people who help and support young people in sport and voluntary service. I accept that it is necessary to re-examine how people who assist young people in sport are required to submit to multiple tests on their background and suitability, and the Government will do that. However, I hope that he accepts that it is not simply a question of saying that that area must be deregulated, because we have seen several disturbing cases in which regulation has failed, with disturbing&#151;even tragic&#151;consequences. It is necessary to strike the right balance, but I sympathise with him on that point.

<a name="51117-11_head0"><h3 align=center>Defence Airfields Review</h3>

<a name="time_1">
<a name="51117-11_time0"><h5>12.22&nbsp;pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_74"><a name="51117-11_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence  (Mr. Adam Ingram): </b> 
 I should like to inform the House about developments in the defence airfields review. As my right hon. Friend the then Secretary of State for Defence told the House on 21&nbsp;July 2004&nbsp;in his statement on &quot;Delivering Security in a Changing World: Future Capabilities&quot;, a review of defence airfields is under way to ensure the best use of the defence estate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_39">The review is taking the form of a series of business cases, two of which have addressed the basing requirements for new aircraft&#151;the joint combat aircraft and the Nimrod MRA4. I am pleased to inform the House today of my basing decisions for those aircraft. The decisions will enable the detailed planning that precedes the introduction of new aircraft and facilitate wider estate rationalisation. We will consult the trade unions on this decision and the implications for civilian staff.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_40">The JCA is due progressively to replace the Harrier fleet towards the middle of the next decade and the Nimrod MRA4&nbsp;is expected to replace the Nimrod MR2&nbsp;from around the end of this decade. The state-of-the-art, multi-role JCA will provide significantly increased performance and improved strike and reconnaissance capabilities, as well as incorporating stealth technology. The Nimrod MRA4&nbsp;will offer enhanced surveillance support over a greater area in both the land and maritime environments. Final procurement decisions will be taken in due course.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_41">The JCA basing study has been very thorough, including the widespread consultation of local authorities, and it considered a number of locations in two stages. On 10&nbsp;March this year, I wrote to hon. Members affected by the outcome of the first stage, notifying them that RNAS Yeovilton, RAF Kinloss and RAF Wittering were discounted from further consideration. The study then concentrated on five locations&#151;RAF Cottesmore in Rutland, RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire, RAF Lossiemouth in Moray, RAF Marham in Norfolk and RAF St. Mawgan in Cornwall. After careful consideration of the options, I have decided that the initial base for the JCA will be RAF Lossiemouth, currently home to the Tornado GR4, as it offers the most operationally satisfactory and cost-effective solution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_42">As I said in March, our work made an assumption that two JCA bases would be required. However, since it is too early to say whether a second base will be needed after the Tornado GR4&nbsp;fleet goes out of service, I have decided that only one base should be selected at this stage. Further work will be undertaken in the event that a second base is required, but we are still a number of years away from making that decision. The study shows that either RAF Cottesmore or RAF Marham would be appropriate for the second base. In any event, both these RAF stations have defined uses into the next decade and beyond, with Harriers at RAF Cottesmore and Tornado GR4s at RAF Marham. RAF Leeming, currently a Tornado F3&nbsp;base, was ruled out as a possible second base because of the disproportionately high noise impact.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1120</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_43">RAF St. Mawgan was not selected because the business case demonstrated that it was an expensive option. I announced in March that that station would go into care and maintenance from April 2007&nbsp;following the relocation of the Sea King helicopters currently based there. In the light of my decision on JCA basing, I can now confirm that there is no long-term RAF Strike Command requirement for the airfield. We shall therefore be considering alternative defence uses or possible disposal. The future basing of the remaining units at RAF St. Mawgan will also be considered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_44">I wrote to hon. Members in October 2004&nbsp;to inform them that we were considering whether RAF Kinloss or RAF Waddington would be the most suitable base for the Nimrod MRA4. RAF Kinloss is currently the base for the Nimrod MR2, while RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire is our primary ISTAR&#151;intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance&#151;base. I subsequently advised the House in March 2005&nbsp;that, irrespective of the outcome of the business case, we had decided to base the MRA4&nbsp;initially at Kinloss as it would not be possible to prepare the necessary infrastructure at Waddington in time for the aircraft&#039;s arrival around the end of the decade.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_45">The business case has now shown that, while there would be some advantages in basing the MRA4&nbsp;with the other ISTAR assets at Waddington, it would not justify the financial investment, and I have therefore decided that the MRA4&nbsp;will remain at Kinloss. That decision does not change RAF Waddington&#039;s role as the primary ISTAR base. On current planning, I also expect RAF Kinloss to become a base for some Tornado GR4s from around 2013. The arrival of the JCA at RAF Lossiemouth will require at least some of the Tornado aircraft based there to be relocated to RAF Kinloss until the aircraft goes out of service in the mid-2020s.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_46">Those decisions form part of my Department&#039;s continuing efforts to rationalise our estate. Work is continuing and I will keep the House informed of developments. Today&#039;s announcement on JCA and MRA4&nbsp;basing enables us to take work forward to begin to plan for the long-term infrastructure requirements of these key new capabilities. The choice of RAF Lossiemouth for the JCA and of RAF Kinloss for the Nimrod MRA4&nbsp;confirms the long-term future for some 4,500&nbsp;Ministry of Defence personnel and also safeguards a significant number of jobs in the Moray area. It is good news for the Moray area and underscores once again the MOD&#039;s commitment to Scotland.
</p>








<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51117-11_spnew1"><b> Dr. Julian Lewis  (New Forest, East) (Con):</b> 
 I thank the Minister for giving me advance notice of the statement. I would have thanked the BBC for the even-more-advanced notice that it would have given me had I been up at 6&nbsp;am to read its online version, but sadly I was still fast asleep and unaware that a statement would be made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_47">The central points of the statement are uncontentious. It is obviously sensible that the new Nimrods should primarily be focused on the base where the existing Nimrods have been deployed successfully for so long. It is also obviously sensible that the new JCA should be focused on one of the bases where the Tornados have similarly been based for so long. There 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1121</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>are, however, some undercurrents to this statement about which we must be concerned&#151;most importantly the resiling from the earlier, pretty firm commitment that the JCA would have two bases. What does that tell us about future orders for the JCA? Does it suggest that in fact, as with so many other defence projects, when those orders come to fruition they will be found to be quantitatively much smaller than was originally promised and intended?

</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-11_para9">
<a name="stpa_48">What does it tell us also about the thinking that is going on whereby numerous RAF bases appear to be scheduled for contraction? We heard that expression a couple of times in the statement in the context of wider estate rationalisation. I have reason to believe that St. Mawgan will not be the last base to close, by any means. It is clear from the statement that the reason that the choice was made not to put the Nimrods with the ISTAR Nimrods but to keep a separate base was not a strategic but an economic choice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-11_para10">
<a name="stpa_49">My primary question for the Minister is this: what consideration has been given to the nature of the threats that will face us in the short, the medium and the long term? In the short and medium terms, there is the prospect of a terrorist threat. What happens if a terrorist attack is successful on an RAF base in which all the facilities for one particular type of function have been concentrated?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-11_para11">
<a name="stpa_50">In the medium to long term, we have to face up to the prospect, incredible though it may seem at the moment, that we might face a major war of a more conventional nature with a more conventional power. What prospect is there of the RAF being able to survive if its bases are vulnerable to attack because each individual role carried out by each separate part of the RAF is focused on a single site that, if put out of action, could mean that the RAF lost that function completely?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-11_para12">
<a name="stpa_51">I turn briefly to some specifics. What is the future of the air sea rescue function currently operating out of St. Mawgan? What assessment has been made of the effect on the local economy?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-11_para13">
<a name="stpa_52">What are the implications for the future of RAF Leeming? Reading between the lines of the statement, I would be a little concerned if my job depended on its having a long-term future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-11_para14">
<a name="stpa_53">What discussions has the Minister had with the Home Office on the security implications of the move towards reducing the number of bases so that more and more eggs are carried in fewer and fewer baskets?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-11_para15">
<a name="stpa_54">What assessment has been made, on a strategic basis, of the long-term military threat facing this country?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-11_para16">
<a name="stpa_55">Today&#039;s announcement has some central sensible elements, but it must be seen in the context of a continued hollowing out of the Royal Air Force, with the closure of Lyneham announced less than two months after the Prime Minister had told my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) that it would have an assured future. As a result, heavy-lift equipment is now concentrated solely at a single base. Three Tornado squadrons have been scheduled for the future instead of the five called for by the strategic defence review. It has been announced that the Jaguar is to go out of service two years earlier than would be required if the Typhoon were able smoothly to take over its functions.

<p><a name="st_76"><a name="51117-12_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Let me try to deal with all the hon. Gentleman&#039;s major points.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_57">From what appeared on the BBC this morning, I had an idea, in broad terms, that the media had got hold of the information. I was not best pleased, as I do everything to ensure that I come to the House first with such information. I am not accountable for speculation&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Someone says that it was on the media last Friday&#151;I did not know that. The report suggested that Leuchars would feature in the statement, but it does not&#151;that decision was announced some time ago. I can give the House the absolute assurance that I was not responsible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_58">I have also had to deal with pressure from Members who are affected by these decisions to meet them to notify them in advance of my statement to the House. I dealt with that by not meeting them, as I have to inform the House first.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_59">The hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) said that he was asleep at 6&nbsp;o&#039;clock this morning. The Opposition should never sleep, but having been in this place for some time I am aware that they have been asleep for the past eight and a half years. Perhaps they are now waking up to certain realities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_60">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the crucial issue of the two bases. I said that that is the preferred option, but we are some considerable time away from choosing an alternative second base. We are delaying not because of numbers but because the decision on any future basing is better taken at the time on the basis of the configuration of bases that are available. I indicated that Cottesmore and Marham had come out on top in that calculation. Nothing is written out, but nothing is written in as a certainty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_61">The hon. Gentleman is right about the wider estate rationalisation. We have to take into account a range of issues, not least of which are the risk factors associated with concentrating assets on individual bases. We do not believe that we face the threat that the hon. Gentleman describes. I do not think&#151;I know that he is sensitive to this as well&#151;that we should explore the nature of possible terrorist attacks. It would take an attack of a catastrophic nature completely to disable a facility. That could apply equally to single buildings where many administrative activities are undertaken. We are aware of how to deal with those issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_62">The hon. Gentleman mentioned St. Mawgan in relation to the movement of the ISTAR activity. As far as I am aware&#151;I have not seen the press release&#151;the announcement is welcomed by people in the area, because they are seeking to build on the commercial aspect of the Newquay Cornwall airport. It is likely that that could have not easily coexisted with a military base. The announcement has been welcomed, by and large, by the local community&#151;I appreciate that it is not unanimous&#151;because it is better for the growth of the local economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-12_para6">
<a name="stpa_63">A number of work streams are in place that could have a beneficial outcome for Leeming, but it is not yet at quite a mature enough level. We shall have to wait and see how that plays out. The same applies to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1123</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Lyneham. Although we have decided to move the aircraft that were at Lyneham to Brize Norton, we have always said that Lyneham could have alternative defence uses. The hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray), who represents the area, is very active in pursuing this. I pay him that compliment, although he was pretty condemnatory of me in business questions. Lyneham need not be a solely RAF solution&#151;there could be an Army interest in the site. The same could apply to Leeming. As we rationalise the estate, we do not dispose of it willy-nilly if it may have another defence use. It would be wrong to walk away from valuable real estate in important parts of the country. There has been considerable investment in all that infrastructure, some of which needs significant upgrading none the less. We do not need as many as 50&nbsp;airfields in terms of what we now seek to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_64">The hon. Member for New Forest, East mentioned the possibility of an external threat from a hostile enemy. I shall deal with that in the debate later, but we do not envisage it as part of the immediate threat. We can debate that at another time. All the factors are being considered, but they do not weigh as heavily with the Ministry of Defence as they do with the hon. Gentleman.

<p><a name="st_77"><a name="51117-12_spnew1"><b> Alison Seabeck  (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab):</b> 
 I shall be brief because I know that several hon. Members will speak specifically about the impact of the decisions on Cornwall, and we shall probe the Minister about the basis for his decision not to deploy the JCA at RAF St. Mawgan.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_65">However, in the best interests of Cornwall and Plymouth&#151;the economic interrelationship between Plymouth and Newquay airports is incredibly close&#151;will my right hon.

<p><a name="st_78"><a name="51117-12_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 My hon. Friend&#039;s last point, which was about certainty, is valid. I came to the House to make the statement because I recognise the importance of JCA basing. When we undertook the study, we understood that we needed to be clear about what we were doing because it was proving difficult for the commercial interests on the airfield to envisage the future and, therefore, growth in the tourist trade, business and so on. I am working closely with the Department for Transport on that. Indeed, I spoke to the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#039;s Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), yesterday about this matter. Several issues must be tackled, but we shall deal with them sympathetically and constructively.

 However inelegantly the information may have got into the public domain, I am sure that all hon. Members welcome the fact that the Minister has come here today to make the statement and has brought greater clarity, at least for some. He has made welcome announcements for communities in Moray, but many in Cornwall, notwithstanding his comments about reports from there, will be disappointed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-12_para10">
<a name="stpa_67">Does the uncertainty about the need for a second base for the JCA reflect some continuing doubt about the availability of the aircraft, or simply the fact that the MOD has still to decide how many it may need? Although the Minister said that there would be support for Cornwall, what impact assessment has been made of the nature of the decision and its effect on Cornwall? What specific measures will he bring to bear to help the economy in that area?
</p>








<p><a name="st_80"><a name="51117-12_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s opening comments. Let me deal with the last point first. The MOD is not responsible for taking on all the attendant responsibilities&#151;that is what local authorities and other Departments are for. We try to minimise the adverse impact as best we can. We try to operate a good-neighbour policy whereby we work alongside the local community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-12_para11">
<a name="stpa_68">We understand the impact in number terms. Two lodger units remain at St. Mawgan and they engage many RAF personnel and some United States personnel. We are considering moving the two units elsewhere to give more coherence to what they do. One has a US input into what it wants to do about future use. Although we are involved in the care and maintenance of the airfield, two other announcements are likely to be made later. However, I am advised that conclusions will not be reached until 2010.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-12_para12">
<a name="stpa_69">There have been competing pressures on the decision about Cornwall. Some did not want us to remain on the airfield because we could not grow its commercial aspect. Others said that we could co-exist. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to ascertain what was practical, bearing in mind that the aircraft will be noisy. The last thing people who are waiting to go on holiday want to hear is a noisy aircraft taking off or landing. Our best analysis was that it was possible to co-exist but that it would not be perfect. Cornwall county council concluded that it would be better to develop the airfield commercially after we gave them our best assurances on the noise thresholds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-12_para13">
<a name="stpa_70">The noise thresholds are currently understood on the basis of prototype analysis, because we do not have the aircraft. The people who give advice are good technical experts and they say that the noise will be the same or approximately the same as the prototype level. There will be no great variation. If there were, the adverse impact would be even greater. However, there will be no&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;major variations that would have altered the calculations. We now have clarity, which allows all the relevant agencies to move forward with developing that important part of the country. A developing commercial airfield there is desirable.

 Will the Minister confirm that the decision that Nimrod MRA4&nbsp;should remain at RAF Kinloss will not prejudice the existing deployment of aircraft or personnel at RAF Waddington, which is in my constituency, or in any way diminish operations from that base?
</p>








<p><a name="st_82"><a name="51117-13_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The right hon. and learned Gentleman should have heard me say that Waddington remains the hub for ISTAR. The preferred option was to co-locate all the aircraft on one airfield. However, the cost implications were so great that it was simply not advisable. Had I done that, at a considerable cost to defence, I am sure that the right hon. and learned Gentleman would criticise me for mis-spending money that could be better spent elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_72">I have no information that people will be moved from Waddington because of the replacement of MR2&nbsp;with MRA4. There will be fewer MRA4s in the fleet. As the JCAs come to Lossiemouth, the GR4s will move to Kinloss to take up the free space. I do not anticipate&#151;there has been no indication of it whatever&#151;that Waddington will be adversely affected.

 I should have thought that the right hon. Gentleman would know that. I appreciate that he is considering support for our current fleet of aircraft as outlined in the Select Committee on Defence. The through-life support for aircraft, whether it takes place on the base or elsewhere, will be part of the final contract arrangements. We are some way from reaching a conclusion, but we are moving increasingly towards industry support for whole-life support. However, we must take account of the crisis manpower requirement because we need the skills in the RAF to do that. There will therefore be a mix that is not dissimilar to our new approach to servicing existing aircraft.

 The Minister will understand my profound disappointment at the implications of the statement for the future of RAF Leeming. He assured me in the Corridor after his last appearance at Defence questions that we would get a full statement on a defence airfield review &quot;soon&quot;. Why is he releasing the information on a case-by-case basis? Why does not he undertake a fundamental, comprehensive, strategic, national review of all 50&nbsp;airfields and their future?

Those based at RAF Leeming, or about to be based there, are very concerned about the long-term future.

 If the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) is even interested in the subject, I am prepared to speak to him in the Corridor. The hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh), however, is only remembering part of our discussion. The other part concerned why we do not have the all-singing, all-dancing comprehensive response. I tried to explain to her that what we must do is a bit like three-dimensional chess in some ways. We are having to unpick this on a case-by-case basis, because we must release assets, determine what will happen at certain bases, what the impact of that will be elsewhere, and what the downstream impact of that is in terms of other defence use. If we have to wait for all that to take place, the necessary infrastructure and planning work for the JCA and MRA4&nbsp;would be delayed. That would delay its coming into service, which would not be desirable. That is a complex pattern, and I fully accept that the uncertainty about some airfields and airbases is not good. I meet a large number of our personnel, both at bases and operationally, and I must deal with those issues. Those personnel are mature enough, however, to understand that we must move forward on a progressive and proper analysis of what will happen.

<p>
<a name="51117-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_74">The hon. Lady asked why RAF Leeming has not been selected as a third base for the Typhoon. That decision is some way down the line. We have made orders for the first two tranches, and while we are committed to the third tranche, that is some way downstream. If that happens, it could have a beneficial impact on RAF Leeming. She also knows that other defence interests are considering the matter, and I shall not go into all the detail, as she said that her hairdresser knows more about it than I do&#151;she said that in the Chamber, I think, not in a Corridor discussion. As we begin to consider all the different future uses, someone gets to know about it, someone talks, and the rumour starts running. We must examine the matter, however, because we cannot come to the best conclusion otherwise. I am sorry that the hares start running&#151;

<br>&nbsp;<br>has also been interesting to read in the media the informed reports about today&#039;s announcements since last Friday. Considering the efforts by some in the Ministry of Defence to run down and close bases, today&#039;s announcement is a tremendous success for local campaigners and the service community in Moray. They have resolutely made the military and economic case for the retention of both RAF Lossiemouth and RAF Kinloss. The decision is a victory for common sense. Can he confirm, however, whether the Ministry of Defence will continue with the nearly 1,000&nbsp;job losses announced earlier this year, which will cost the Moray economy &#163;20&nbsp;million a year?

 I knew that the hon. Gentleman would introduce a sour note. We have discussed the reasons for the change, which is part of a better utilisation of personnel, and ensures that we get maximum benefit from our investment in defence. The aircraft that will be based there will be a very important part of NATO&#039;s capability. He represents a party that is opposed to NATO. I should have thought that he would say, &quot;We don&#039;t want anything flying in support of NATO in my area.&quot; He also represents a party that only too recently called the Union flag the &quot;butcher&#039;s apron&quot;. I have asked him to repudiate that time and again, and he has not done so.

This is not, as he said, a victory for common sense, but a victory for what is right for defence. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, he is talking about it on the basis that it has been designed to suit the needs of the local community, but it has been designed to suit the needs of defence.

 I would like to give the hon. Gentleman a better answer, and I am grateful for his compliments, but a number of options are available, and we must balance what is right for defence. A decision might develop that is right for the RAF, but the Army might come up with a different solution, so we must then consider which will provide the best efficiency gain and the best delivery of what we seek. We are not yet at a mature enough stage to say what is happening. He might find that hairdressers in his constituency are picking up rumours about what is happening.

 The Minister&#039;s announcement in relation to concentrating certain operations on certain airfields applies to my constituents, because the decision on RAF Lyneham, to which my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) has referred, will mean a concentration of flying at RAF Brize Norton and consequent knock-on effects at RAF Fairford. All the other announcements today have the same effect in terms of aircraft noise, however. Will the Minister consider two things? First, wherever possible, ought not the maximum amount of training be done on simulators to reduce aircraft noise? Secondly, with all the changes, will he undertake to do the maximum amount of liaison with local democratically elected bodies&#151;district councils, borough councils and parish councils?
</p>








<p><a name="st_98"><a name="51117-14_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman will be only too well aware that a lot of simulation takes place, and as the technology for that advances, the capacity and quality of output also increases. People cannot be trained to fly on simulators alone, however, especially if they are training to fly fast jets. I am not an expert, but I know that the people who need to get those planes into the sky need to be familiar with all their characteristics and to put the physical machine under test as well as themselves as flyers. We try to marry all that up.

<a name="51117-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_77">On local interests in relation to environmental issues such as noise pollution, we deal with that. We have a very good relationship with the communities around our airfields. If a community suddenly became very negative about an airfield, however, and no one wanted it, that would also have to be taken into account. Those who make the comments have to be clear about what they want, rather than just nipping away on the sidelines about it. Do they want an airfield there; are they going to be good neighbours? They have been and I pay tribute to them for all the support that they have given us in the past.

<a name="stpa_78">The JCA is a noisy aircraft and will not be without impact on RAF Lossiemouth and the community.

 I cannot say how important this announcement is for my constituency and, indeed, for the whole of Cornwall. The Minister is aware that I have sought a meeting with him for some time&#151;in fact, since the general election. I was promised a meeting this morning and three representatives of civilian employees at St. Mawgan came to the Ministry of Defence to attend at 9.30&nbsp;this morning, only to be told that the meeting was not taking place. I thus seek the Minister&#039;s assurance that he will work in close consultation with service personnel and especially civilian personnel at St. Mawgan whose jobs are now at stake. About 500&nbsp;jobs are involved.

<a name="stpa_79">Will the Minister also assure the House that he will work with other Departments, local government and other partners to ensure that, if the station is to close in future, any transfer to civilian use has maximum support from the Ministry of Defence?

 I apologise for the mix-up about this morning&#039;s meeting. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that, in any case, I could not have spoken to him about the detail of what was happening in his area in advance of my statement today. It was truly a mix-up for which I apologise, particularly to those who travelled, but it was for good and sensible reasons. If the hon. Gentleman had risen in his place to say that he had had a meeting with me this morning, I can only imagine what would have happened.
</p>

<a name="51117-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_80">I am too well aware of the impact of the closure. That is why I announced that changes would be likely up to 2010&nbsp;in respect of the other two lodger units there. It is a significant development for St. Mawgan airfield and the wider area. I give the hon. Gentleman my absolute assurance that, within the limits of what we can do, we will work with all agencies. I hope that he will not ask in future for the MOD to spend money when it is not for defence purposes. We cannot do that. If developments have to take place elsewhere, other Government agencies, local authority interests and perhaps commercial interests will be involved.

<a name="stpa_81">As to the disposal of the airfield, I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands&#151;I would have told him this morning&#151;that we have to look at alternative defence uses. That is our first priority. That is what we have done at RAF Lyneham, RAF Leeming and elsewhere. The indications are that such use is unlikely, but we still have to go through the process. Defence Estates will get ownership and then offer it round to see whether others are interested. It will have to take a quick decision; disposal through the appropriate mechanisms will then have to take place. That is where we will work sensitively with local interests to ensure that it is best handled. We can then make a transition to a commercial airfield, if that is what is to happen, and help the local economy in that part of the country.

 The joint combat aircraft is obviously fundamental to our country&#039;s defence future.

Given that I represent west Norfolk and

<br>&nbsp;<br>that RAF Marham is a huge employer in the region, I would like the second base to go there. Whether it is indeed located there or at RAF Cottesmore, it is vital that we have a decision on that second base. The Minister said in his statement that we are still a number of years away from taking that decision, but why? Why cannot he tell us much sooner where that second base will be?
</p>








<p><a name="st_102"><a name="51117-14_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Because I do not have the information that would allow me to take that decision. There will be a phased introduction of the new aircraft, but we are a considerable number of years away from the first tranche&#151;if that is how it is to be defined&#151;perhaps in 2013&#150;14. Whenever that first tranche is introduced, it will then take time for it to build up to full strength. If I were to take a decision now, in 2005, on something that will happen 15&nbsp;years away, it would not serve any useful purpose, because so many things could change over that period. We may have more or fewer of those aircraft; there may be a new aircraft type, for example. I cannot look that far ahead.

I will never tire of paying tribute to their dedication, commitment and bravery, and I do so again today. However, we owe it to our armed forces to do more than simply pay tribute to them.

 I have been intervened on, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I do not know whether you are going to allow me to continue this debate. There is a simple way of proceeding. I do not want to raise the temperature, but we are talking about our armed forces and how we best serve them. The hon. Gentleman could simply say that he was sorry that he made those intemperate remarks, which were inappropriate and a terrible slur on one of the finest soldiers of his generation. The hon. Gentleman may well look forward to the meeting but, if I know General Sir Mike Jackson, he should do so with some trepidation. He can be very robust when it comes to saying what he thinks, but an apology in a public forum such as this would not go amiss. I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman if he wants to apologise now. The hon. Gentleman remains in his seat, so it is clear that he

<a name="stpa_90">The role of defence in the UK is to ensure that the armed forces are structured, trained and equipped to meet the challenges that they face today and will face tomorrow. We need to ensure that every penny that we spend is spent wisely, in support of the front line. At the same time, we must provide support to our personnel and their families to enable them to focus on the job at hand.That is no small task. Our annual budget is about &#163;28&nbsp;billion and we employ more than 270,000&nbsp;people. Indirectly, we support a further 400,000&nbsp;jobs in the defence industry. Against that background, I want to take the opportunity provided by today&#039;s debate to describe the progress we are making in delivering on our commitment to the armed forces. I also want to talk about the role that the armed forces play within the UK.

<a name="stpa_91">The pace of change across the globe is remorseless, and with change comes new challenges for our armed forces. We must ensure that they are properly structured to meet those challenges, and that is precisely what we are doing&#151;no more so than in respect of the Army.In December last year, the then Secretary of State announced that we would rebalance the Army to develop a more deployable, agile and flexible force&#151;a force better able to meet the challenges and threats of the 21st century. This is known as the future army structure. We are now moving ahead to implement those changes, which will make the Army a more balanced, robust and resilient force.

<a name="51117-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_92">On 1&nbsp;August, we announced the start of full security normalisation in Northern Ireland. That will allow the reinvestment of posts back into the Army, to make it better suited to meet the enduring expeditionary operations that have characterised our deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan in recent years. As a result of the progress in Northern Ireland, the Army can reinvest more than 2,500&nbsp;posts into specialist capabilities, including communications, engineering, logistics and intelligence, while making the infantry more robust. Continued progress in Northern Ireland, coupled with the end of the infantry arms plot&#151;the process by which infantry battalions used to re-role, retrain and relocate every few years&#151;is allowing the Army to reduce the number of infantry battalions by four. Under the existing system, up to 20&nbsp;per cent. of the Army is unavailable for deployment. With the end of the arms plot, we will have more battalions available at any one time.

On Monday, you said that the 2nd battalion would have to be augmented with troops from the 1st battalion.

<p><a name="st_135"><a name="51117-16_spnew8"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I do not think that I said quite that at Defence questions the other day, but we would need to check the record. What I suggested was that there are willing horses in battalions who sometimes put themselves forward. I also said that we must be very careful not to put under too much strain people who choose to make that decision. We are sensitive to the difficulties involved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_93">I do not envisage the sort of augmentation suggested by the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning), but I need to be cautious. Certain individuals or specialists may be required to strengthen the battalion posted to Afghanistan. Such things happen, and that is what makes my remarks about reconfiguration and restructuring so important. The reduction in size of the four battalions has led to the creation of 2,500&nbsp;more posts. Those posts will be taken up by key enablers, who will deal with the problems that arise at the real pinch points. Over time, that will achieve the improvement that we seek in personnel harmony. The picture is not perfect and there is a lot of strain in some areas, but we are actively addressing the problem.

<a name="stpa_94">Although I do not envisage that what the hon.

I am very conscious of that and I am sure that the message has been heard outside the House that it is wrong to move people backwards and forwards too quickly. That is what I said on Monday, and I repeat the point now.

<p><a name="st_136"><a name="51117-17_spnew0"><b> Bob Russell  (Colchester) (LD):</b> 
 Will the Minister confirm that about 9&nbsp;per cent. of the soldiers in the British Army are not British citizens? Clearly, we welcome anyone who wants to serve in the Army, but is that proportion the result of a deliberate policy decision, or is it because too few British citizens apply to join?
</p>








<p><a name="st_137"><a name="51117-17_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The reason for the proportion of non-British citizens is probably a mixture of those alternatives. A conscious decision was taken to encourage what are known as Foreign and Commonwealth personnel into the armed forces, and the proportion that the hon. Gentleman quotes is about right. All the people to whom he refers serve with distinction, and I draw his attention to the bravery of Fusilier Beharry from Grenada, who won a VC. Others among that element in the armed forces have served with considerable distinction as well, and they bring much strength and support. Another example might be the Gurkhas, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that their presence in our armed forces is undesirable. I am also sure that he is not suggesting that we should not encourage South Africans, New Zealanders, Australians and others into the British armed forces. However, we are always aware that a balance needs to be struck in these matters. We must maintain the pressure on recruitment, and I shall say more about that later.

 I mentioned at Defence questions on Monday that I had the opportunity last week to spend time with the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment in Afghanistan. It is doing a splendid job there, under very difficult circumstances. I undertook the visit with some trepidation, as I expected a lot of flak about the further reorganisation of the regiment. In the main, however, the regiment has accepted the proposed merger with the Devon and Dorset Regiment, although there are some misgivings. The one assurance that the regiment seeks has to do with the continuation of the back badge. Will my right hon. Friend say something more about how the situation can be clarified, so that the memory of the Gloucesters can continue, even in the new, merged regiment?

<p><a name="st_139"><a name="51117-17_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for those remarks, and he is right. Change is always difficult, but there is an appreciation among our armed forces that what we propose will be for the greater good of the British Army in the longer term. I am always struck that sergeant-majors&#151;and, sometimes, the regimental sergeant-majors&#151;are the most forceful when it comes to putting that view across. One talks to such people with some trepidation, as in one sense they speak on behalf of everyone. I have never met one who has said that what we are doing is wrong. They understand the difficulties that we face. Although they say that they wish that no reform was necessary, they are keen to move forward rather than move backward or stand still. They know that we need to change.

<a name="stpa_95">My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) raises the whole question of accoutrements and the golden thread. I must explain that that really is not a matter for Ministers. It is a minefield into which we tread very warily. The Army must decide what is acceptable and deliverable in that regard. The executive committee of the Army Board is looking at these questions, and announcements will be made in due course. It is possible that decisions have been made that have not been passed on to Ministers but, once the information is available, the House will be notified in the appropriate manner. It is right that we notify those who serve about such matters first. We are conscious of the golden thread and the whole question of accoutrements. Difficult decisions will have to be taken, but I take note of my hon. Friend&#039;s point.

<a name="51117-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_96">I was talking about the end of the arms plot and the fact that 20&nbsp;per cent. of the Army is unavailable for deployment under the existing system. As we move forward with the restructure, there will be fewer battalions&#151;36&nbsp;instead of 40&#151;but we will have greater usability. Capability will no longer be lost due to the need for battalions to move location or re-role. That will also mean that the infantry will be able to offer much greater stability for soldiers and their families, so they will be able to plan their lives and careers with confidence. That is what our soldiers want. Given the benefits to families, that should help with the retention of our highly trained people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_97">When making changes to modernise the infantry, it has been important not to throw away their history and heritage. I have explained the background to why we are determined to maintain the golden thread. As well as considering history and heritage as part of our approach 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1139</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>on recruitment and retention, we must keep it in mind that in the 21st century our armed forces must be truly representative of the society that they serve. We must review barriers to equality of opportunity whenever that can be done without compromising operational effectiveness. Let me cite several examples of the way in which we are addressing the matter. We are considering what flexibility might be possible to help those serving in the armed forces with child care and other family responsibilities. We carry out a wide range of outreach and recruitment activities that are specifically designed to build links with ethnic minority, gay and lesbian communities. We have recently recruited our first Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and Sikh chaplains, and we are continuing to work in partnership with the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Commission for Racial Equality.

<p><a name="st_140"><a name="51117-17_spnew4"><b> Mr. James Gray  (North Wiltshire) (Con):</b> 
 Will the Minister pay particular attention to a detailed matter regarding our Commonwealth soldiers? The time that they spend overseas&#151;often they are deployed overseas for the entire duration of their service&#151;does not count towards their application for British citizenship after they have left the Army. Surely it is only right that if they serve the nation in the Army, even if they do that in Germany or the Falklands, the time spent should count towards their applications to become a British citizen.
</p>








<p><a name="st_141"><a name="51117-17_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman hits on another point that we must address. I do not know whether the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig), will be able to say more about that in his winding-up speech. We are aware of the issue. We must be sensitive to the fact that if people who are serving are seen to be disadvantaged, we must take account of that. The situation is a bit more complex than that simple explanation of the problem because we must work through the Home Office and deal with layers of regulations.

<a name="stpa_99">The Navy, Army and RAF continue to make strenuous efforts to recruit and retain the right number of people. The Army&#039;s substantial investment in marketing over the past 12&nbsp;months is bearing fruit, with applications now up to the required level. Indeed, in Scotland, where it is sometime argued that the changes that we are making are having a detrimental effect, the recruitment figures make salutary reading. Numbers for the Black Watch, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and the Royal Highland Fusiliers are up compared with the same time last year. That is hardly an indication that the new Royal Regiment of Scotland is proving to be the problem that some claim&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> That information shows that those who try to run the scare that the Royal Regiment of Scotland will be a deterrent are not proven by the raw facts of the matter.

<br>&nbsp;<br>The deterrent factor is not uniform. The extent to which numbers are up for the Royal Highland Fusiliers is significant, but the situation is more difficult in other areas. I am conscious of something that the regimental sergeant- major of the King&#039;s Own Scottish Borderers said to me not too long ago. I will not go into all the graphic details of it, but he said that the change had to be made, even though he wished that that was not the case. He is a proud member of the King&#039;s Own Scottish Borderers, but when he goes back to his village, he finds it almost impossible to encourage young people to join up.

They include improved financial support for reservists and employers, greater access to training courses, intelligent selection for mobilisation, improved redeployment training, improved welfare support and a new reserve forces pensions and compensation scheme.

I could ask Opposition Members why those packages were not already in place. If they were so valuable, why were they viewed as secondary? The reality is that we are using the TA and the reserves to a considerable extent. As I said on Monday, one cannot tell the difference in the field: they are thoroughly professional members of Her Majesty&#039;s armed forces and we are trying to make sure that we increase their number.

The ships and submarines that will be built are much more than steel hulls. They will be complex weapons systems full of cutting-edge technology.

It will set out the key capabilities that must be fostered and sustained in the UK to meet our future requirements. If there are industrial capabilities and technologies that we need to retain in the UK but that are at risk, we must act now to preserve them. However, we cannot sustain all the defence capabilities that currently exist within UK industry.

It is why we have embarked on a programme of transformation in logistics. Again, that is no small task. The Defence Logistics Organisation alone has a budget of some &#163;5.5&nbsp;billion and employs more than 28,000&nbsp;people.

I would welcome clarification as to how those figures were arrived at, as the Secretary of State and his colleagues are very keen to point out in written answers that following the introduction of resource accounting in 2001&#150;02, direct comparisons with previous years are not possible, so how the Secretary of State can now pretend that they are possible is something that I find very difficult to understand.

 I have heard this argument on a number of occasions: that because the Conservative Government made cuts when commitments were coming down, this Government can continue to make cuts when commitments are going up. It is rather like saying, &quot;Because you cut off a toe, I am entitled to cut off your leg.&quot; The situation is different, and the sooner the Secretary of State understands that, the better. The cold war ended; the commitments changed; we made reductions. Now the commitments are increasing again. Even his own report recently made that clear, yet we are seeing the commitment of resources going down.
</p>








<p><a name="st_182"><a name="51117-21_spnew2"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 I am willing to engage in this discussion with the right hon. and learned Gentleman, who like me has always wanted as many resources as we can get. There are two differences between the two Administrations. First, his Administration cut the budget in absolute terms as well as in proportional terms: there was a 29&nbsp;per cent. cut in absolute terms; and there was a 50&nbsp;per cent. cut in proportional terms. In our

 The Secretary of State always makes these figures sound as if there is an increase. I seem to remember that he was responsible for the strategic defence review, in which certain expenditure and commitment levels were set out. I think that he would agree that the commitment levels have risen beyond those projected in the review and that the resource commitments have gone down from what they were predicted to be in the review. For the first time, we have a Minister who, perhaps unfortunately for him, is having to defend the cuts that he has made in the face of what he said was necessary some time ago.

 In terms of the absolute amount in real terms, the money allocated has gone up by 1.4&nbsp;per cent. per annum over the three years.

I hope that that clarifies both those matters.

<p><a name="st_190"><a name="51117-21_spnew10"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I think that I will go back to the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s earlier comments. I indicated in an earlier contribution that defence budgets are always under pressure. They always have been and probably always will be, because our aspirations outstrip our resources at all times. Can he tell us, since he is criticising what we are seeking to do through a &#163;2.8&nbsp;billion efficiency programme, where he would have got the other &#163;1.6&nbsp;billion efficiency savings that he was campaigning on at the last general election? The Conservatives were seeking to take out &#163;4.4&nbsp;billion and I am telling him that it is very difficult to take out &#163;2.8&nbsp;billion.

 We made it clear that we were going to find savings of &#163;2.7&nbsp;billion, which we were going to transfer to front-line capability, but this debate is about the armed forces as they are today. I want to make it clear that the Minister of State&#039;s description of the armed forces as buoyant does not match the reality. Let us look at the effects of what has happened. Since 1997, the Army has lost 9,000&nbsp;personnel, the Royal Navy has lost 10,000&nbsp;and the RAF has lost 16,000. The MOD&#039;s own &quot;Key Defence Messages&quot; state that by April 2008&nbsp;Army strength will be cut to 101,800, Royal Navy strength to 36,250, and RAF strength to 40,800.

Was not it the Conservative Government who virtually gave away military housing to the Nomura bank for a knock-down price, a deal that the incoming Government could do nothing about?

Can the Minister confirm reports that an average of 500&nbsp;men and women a month have left the TA since October 2003? The TA&#039;s current strength is 35,500, the lowest since it was founded in 1907, whereas the required strength is 41,610.

As for his remarks about the asymmetric nature of warfare, in which our soldiers are asked to play by civilised rules compared with the enemy, who is unconstrained by morality or rules, I agree entirely. However, where his remarks concern those further up the chain of command&#151;remarks that will only be seen in the context of the accusation of his hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) of a lack of moral courage by the Chief of the General Staff&#151;I appeal to him, urge him to distance himself from that imputation. I hope that he will urge his hon. Friend to withdraw his remark, as its implications are unnecessary and it gets in the way of a frank, candid and supportive discussion for our soldiers. I want to do that as well, but I cannot do so when cases are under way, because the judicial system prevents my doing so. I hope, however, that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will distance himself from any criticism of the chiefs of staff, which is entirely separate from accusations against politicians who make those decisions.

 The Secretary of State will note that my words today are largely not my own&#151;they are the words of former Chiefs of the Defence Staff. Those men are speaking out in that way, because they realise that the general events surrounding those particular cases have created an environment, atmosphere and psychology in the armed forces that is unhelpful to their operations, and could be very damaging indeed in future. The right hon. Gentleman must understand that this is not rhetoric&#151;this is a reality that is understood by the former Chiefs of the Defence Staff. I hope that he will take it on board and address it.

<p><a name="st_206"><a name="51117-23_spnew1"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 Not only do I take that seriously but I met the Chiefs of the Defence Staff a considerable time ago to discuss this precise issue. I did not announce that publicly until today, because I did not intend to make capital out of it. I hope, however, that that reassures the right hon. and learned Gentleman that I take that issue and the support of our troops seriously. Whoever made the original remark, I ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman to dissociate himself from implications that there are criticisms to be levelled, particularly about a lack of moral courage or otherwise, at the Chiefs of the Defence Staff. They do a very difficult job, and they are very brave people, both morally and physically. They have shown that in the past, and they are as concerned as I am to support morale. In a democracy with a separation between the legal process and political decisions, they cannot intervene. The right hon. and learned Gentleman knows that they are prevented from so doing, so to try to criticise them for not intervening is unfair. That is all that I am asking. He can attack me as much as he likes, but I urge him to withdraw from attacks on the chiefs of staff.

 I do not think that in anything I have said&#151;or, indeed, in what was said by the former Chiefs of the Defence Staff&#151;I have attacked any serving soldier. What I am saying to the Secretary of State is that there is a genuine problem on the ground. I am glad that he acknowledges that. For the well-being of our troops, particularly those who are engaged in dangerous missions overseas on our behalf, that cannot be allowed to continue. Far from the buoyant Army that was described by the Minister of State, the armed forces have problems. Having said that I know the Secretary of State has their interests at heart, I hope that he will address the problems not just with rhetoric, but by finding a way to give the armed forces the moral support that they deserve.

<a name="stpa_153">I turn to some of the tasks undertaken by our armed forces. Those tasks may be overseas, but they are undertaken because they are part of the way that we defend ourselves. I said earlier that our involvement in Afghanistan was based on article 51, which is about self-defence. I would argue that even in Iraq, given the dangers of Islamic fundamentalism, what we are doing relates not only to that country but to our security in the United Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_154">The issues arising in these areas are complex. In Afghanistan, the broadening of ISAF control over the areas where new provincial reconstruction teams are deployed may lead to merging the command structures of Operation Enduring Freedom and the NATO/ISAF operation. We are led to believe&#151;the Secretary of State may know more about this than I do, but I saw a report this morning&#151;that not only France but now Belgium could yet veto any integration of US-led forces and NATO-led forces under one command. What is the Government&#039;s position on this?

If it is a combination, is it seriously suggested that the British contingent could operate under a number of different commands? How will that affect the rules of engagement? The idea that UK forces could be asked to operate under two rules of engagement, with the sort of confusion that arose in Kosovo, is unthinkable. Harmonisation of the rules of engagement of each of the participating countries is essential.

 On 10&nbsp;November, at column 35, the Secretary of State spelled out in answer to me the high stakes in Iraq. He used terms that were very similar to the language of a speech by Senator John McCain on that very day. Senator McCain&#039;s conclusion was that we may have to ramp up our troops in Iraq. I am worried about the mood music and all the talk of withdrawal and troops coming home next year, when in fact the requirement may be the opposite.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend who, as the House knows, has had experience on the ground in Iraq. I listened carefully to what he said, and he is right. We must be very careful not to persuade ourselves, possibly for trans-Atlantic political reasons, that we are getting to a stage where a draw-down can take place.

<a name="stpa_157">On Monday the Secretary of State admitted, in answer to a question from me, that the proportion of violent contacts between our troops and the insurgents initiated by the insurgents rather than by our troops in the past 12&nbsp;months has gone up. That is a significant measure. It hardly suggests progress in the fight against insurgency. It rather suggests, as my hon. Friend said, that recent reports of drawing down the numbers of troops in Iraq are over-optimistic.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_158">I want to mention strategy. I shall not enlarge on this, as I have spoken for a long time already. When I was in Washington recently, I was told about the concern over tactics and strategy in Iraq. It was described to me, perhaps infelicitously, in terms of the game called Whack-a-mole. In the game, little moles appear out of a board, and one tries to hit them in order to score. If one does not hit them, one does not score. It was put to me that a lot of the counter-insurgency work in Iraq is a matter of reacting to where the insurgent appears. I have been told that the Pentagon is examining the oil-spot concept, which we should examine too, in order to begin to establish stability on the ground. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The man who introduced it into current thinking described the concept as an oil spot, because it has the ability to spread. I hope that we are examining that concept, because there are lessons to be learned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_159">When we discuss defence in the United Kingdom, any consideration of our military commitments in Iraq or Afghanistan must encompass the general time scale within which our troops will come home. As the Secretary of State knows, I have never sought a firm date, which apart from its impracticability would send a dangerous signal to the insurgents. However, I continue to seek benchmarks against which to assess when the job is done. The time scale was once described to me as the length of a piece of string, but that is no longer good enough, and the string must have knots in it to serve as points of reference as we move along.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_160">I hope that it has become apparent that defence in the United Kingdom is now indivisible from our wider commitments overseas. They are different elements of a single narrative, and the common thread is the dedicated, committed, courageous and selfless men and women who put themselves and their lives on the line for our country. I despair of this Government, who ask so much of the armed forces and give so little, and I despair of the resolve of the MOD to fight its corner in the corridors of Whitehall and the inner sanctums of the Treasury. We know that we have a Chancellor of the Exchequer who neither values nor understands our armed forces, and a Prime Minister who talks big but walks small on the welfare of our servicemen and women.

 In support of the hon.

 A future risk assessment was carried out in March 2003&nbsp;to consider our changing circumstances, but unfortunately it was not taken up politically. We are in a different world. The Government have to show us what enemy, real or potential, Trident would be aimed at, and how that fits in with the emphasis on asymmetrical warfare that was mentioned in the future risk assessment. The stuff that Kitson predicted many years ago about the sort of warfare that would be endemic&#151;I would argue, throughout the 21st century&#151;has come to pass.

It will deal with streamlining the different systems in the three services into one, while seeking to harmonise military law more closely with civilian law. The core principle of service discipline is that the military is not above the law and must operate within it.

Will he also make it clear whether there is any intention to use the quasi-Select Committee approach to the Bill&#039;s consideration, as used in the past?

<a name="51117-24_para17">
<a name="stpa_187">Military law underpins the services and is vital to our credibility in the wider world, but it also matters to people here in Britain, not least to the parents of young servicemen and women&#151;the gatekeepers, as the Secretary of State put it in the House a few weeks ago. Confidence in the disciplinary system is absolutely necessary, not least to root out the bullying that breaks out from time to time, and which is a scar on our armed forces&#039; reputation. The latest available Army version of the armed forces continuous attitude survey to April of this year makes for grim reading in that respect. One key set of findings highlights the fact that 25&nbsp;per cent. of soldiers had cause to complain about unfair treatment, discrimination, harassment and/or bullying. More than half were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the objectivity and fairness with which their complaint was handled. I accept that that is a snapshot, but it is a worrying signal at a time when the tragic events at Deepcut remain firmly in the public eye. Ministers are well aware of the dissatisfaction of parents and families with the investigation so far and their anger at the limited publication of the Devon and Cornwall police report. Many also have long-standing fears about restrictions to the scope of the Blake review.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-24_para18">
<a name="stpa_188">Ministers know better than any of us the damage that such things can do to recruitment, and will want to limit it. I understand that we can expect no commitments from Ministers at least until the Blake review has been completed. However, I hope that they will recognise parents&#039; fears that this review will not necessarily succeed in answering their questions, and that they will be ready to push such issues further if the outcome is unsatisfactory to them. In an earlier intervention, my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) raised concerns about publication of the full report of the Devon and Cornwall police review of the Surrey police investigation. We welcome the Minister&#039;s sensitive comments and hope that that will lead to some progress.

<p>
<a name="51117-24_para19">
<a name="stpa_189">If I may, I want to change the focus and turn to what is potentially one of the MOD&#039;s great success stories: Qinetiq, which, according to its own blurb:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;is one of the world&#039;s leading defence technology and security companies&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-24_para20">
<a name="stpa_190">It does indeed have an impressive track record that stretches back to its original MOD days. It was involved in the development of liquid crystal displays, carbon fibre, microwave radar and much else besides. Today, it is at the forefront in many fields, including defence interests such as unmanned aerial vehicles and robotic bomb disposal, and other developments such as runway radar, which is used to identify dangerous debris. It has a breathtaking range of capabilities, fantastic employees, great management and wonderful potential.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-24_para21">
<a name="stpa_191">As guardian of our national security, and as a shareholder and customer, the MOD clearly has a significant interest in the future of Qinetiq. This is surely an issue for Parliament, given the intention to proceed to flotation. All the signs for a flotation are there. Last

<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1165</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>year&#039;s readiness study by Morgan Stanley apparently concluded that flotation was appropriate. This year, Credit Suisse First Boston, JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch were appointed as financial advisers, with the ubiquitous Rothschild as consultants. Acquisitions continue apace, particularly in the important United States market, but also in Belgium with the acquisition of a satellite maker. At the very least, that will challenge a few long-held stereotypes about Belgium.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-24_para22">
<a name="stpa_192">Press reports over the summer indicated that we are heading toward a &#163;1&nbsp;billion flotation by the end of the year. However, according to recent reports such as that in <i>The Daily Telegraph,</i>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;it is understood to be gearing up for a . . . flotation in the first half of next year&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-24_para23">
<a name="stpa_193">It is hard to find any clues from official sources so far. The MOD properly refers to the company in its annual reports and financial statements, but there is no mention of the flotation. Qinetiq&#039;s own annual report&#151;admittedly, it is six months old&#151;talks about it only &quot;in principle&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an interesting recent development, the company&#039;s website commented on an article that appeared in the <i>Guardian</i> late last summer and spoke about the &quot;purported&quot; flotation, rather than an actual flotation. There is much coyness about the matter, but quite a lot of information has slipped into the public domain. Perhaps this debate offers a chance for Parliament to begin to share in that information, as there are serious issues to be considered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-24_para24">
<a name="stpa_194">Ministers may say that flotation is a matter for the company, but Qinetiq&#039;s executive chairman, Sir John Chisholm, said, when asked after last year&#039;s positive readiness review why no flotation was in prospect, that it was


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;a matter for the shareholders.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-24_para25">
<a name="stpa_195">It is important to remember that after the part-privatisation of a few years ago, the MOD retains a 56&nbsp;per cent. shareholding. Employees have 13&nbsp;per cent. and the private Carlyle group has 31&nbsp;per cent. Therefore, the question of flotation is very much one for the Government and Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-24_para26">
<a name="stpa_196">Important questions need to be addressed. For example, who is driving the demands of the flotation? Clearly, the company&#039;s management is incentivised and therefore has an interest in the matter. The Carlyle group has made it clear that it wants an exit from its strategic investment, but is the drive coming from the Treasury, whose instinct is to sell things off and raise money, or is it coming from the Shareholder Executive, which is responsible for the most commercial parts of Government and has some challenging targets to meet?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-24_para27">
<a name="stpa_197">It would be helpful if some suggestions in the press could be put to rest. For instance, there has been talk that the financial imperatives of the flotation are leading Qinetiq to bulk up by acquisition and to focus less on pure research. How are we to ensure that the taxpayer will get a fair return? That is important, not least because it appears that the Carlyle group has some very interesting tax shelter arrangements in Guernsey, which most outside observers consider to be highly unusual in this context.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-24_para28">
<a name="stpa_198">Will the MOD receive receipts for its already tight budget? So far, the company&#039;s profitability has depended on its contracts with the Ministry. Some reports say that Qinetiq will receive &#163;250&nbsp;million from 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1166</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>any flotation and that the rest will go to the Treasury. The veracity of that is hard to assess when we do not have the full picture or know whether the MOD will retain a direct stake in the company.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-24_para29">
<a name="stpa_199">There is also a very important national security angle to the matter. As I have mentioned already, Qinetiq is a significant supplier to the MOD, so its ownership will be of crucial national interest. A special share is mooted, and its creation might indicate that the company will not be listed abroad or that it will not move into foreign ownership. Where might Thales or even BAE Systems fit within those requirements? After the flotation, how will potential conflicts be handled and will there be a new basis for Government funding to the company?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-24_para30">
<a name="stpa_200">There is no doubt that other issues merit consideration and I have given the House just a sample. My understanding is that the flotation does not require primary legislation, and I should be grateful if the Minister who winds up the debate will confirm that much at least. If no such legislation is needed, how will Parliament be involved in the legitimate scrutiny of what would be a very significant development?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-24_para31">
<a name="stpa_201">I emphasise that I believe that Qinetiq is an excellent company and that my party has no objection in principle to its flotation. However, many unanswered questions remain, to which Parliament really should receive an answer before the flotation proceeds much further.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-24_para32">
<a name="stpa_202">Qinetiq is a major part of the early development of future capabilities for the military. The MOD properly expends a great deal of effort in that area&#151;the future of provision of equipment to the military has already figured strongly in this debate, as has the related defence-industrial strategy that will underpin it. It is understood that Lord Drayson will make an announcement soon, and I hope that we will then be able to have a serious and informed debate on the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-24_para33">
<a name="stpa_203">One final matter in respect of future capabilities has to do with the regiments. This is well-trodden ground: I respect the fact that recent presentations to Members of Parliament have set out what is planned, and that the game will soon be up. However, I hope that Ministers do not lose sight of the fact that there is still a great deal of anger and resentment in communities throughout many parts of the country, not least in my constituency. We will not only lose our local regiments&#151;the King&#039;s Own Scottish Borderers and the Royal Scots&#151;but those regiments will be merged into a single battalion of the new Royal Regiment of Scotland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-24_para34">
<a name="stpa_204">I have never been persuaded that the modernisation, which we support, requires abandoning the historical regiments and all that goes with them. Will the Minister at least give us assurances today about the future of the museums and regimental headquarter offices, which act as a focal point for communities in different parts of the country?

We had some interesting times, especially in northern Norway when we slept out in a tent in temperatures between minus 32&#176; and 34&#176; C. We got a rounded view of how the Royal Marines operate.

We should pay tribute to them wholeheartedly this afternoon for the work that they do on our behalf.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_210">I am worried about several of the changes that the Government are proposing to the civilian structures that service and serve the Ministry of Defence. I want to raise three particular concerns. The first relates to the Donnington site, which is in the constituency of the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard), who is in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1168</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Chamber today. The site is large and significant; it is affectionately known locally as the depot and has provided a large number of jobs over many years for people across Telford, the Wrekin and the wider Shropshire area. We received some difficult news earlier this year when the Government announced that they were planning to review and indeed lay off members of staff in the Army Base Repair Organisation at Donnington. They also announced a further phase of reviews. Last week, the Minister of State announced a further 628&nbsp;job losses at the ABRO site up to 2010. I, other Members and the local community were devastated at that news.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_211">The future for Donnington is not all dark, however. The future defence supply chain initiative has been rescued for Donnington. We shall still have a Ministry of Defence presence at the site and there may be some scope for jobs growth in the FDSCI structure. Of course, that is at the expense of the closure of the base at Stafford and I hope that some posts may move from there to the Donnington site. However, the news about ABRO is devastating for local communities and I am pleased that the Minister has agreed to meet us to talk about the issues.
</p>








<p><a name="st_219"><a name="51117-25_spnew3"><b> Mark Pritchard: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman mentioned jobs growth at Donnington. Can he clarify which Minister confirmed, and when, that new jobs will be created at Donnington? That news would come as a surprise to the work force.
</p>








<p><a name="st_220"><a name="51117-25_spnew4"><b> David Wright: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right. The FDSCI announcement was about job losses at Donnington, but I hope that as we debate the future structure of the site there may be growth in some areas of the supply chain. That would be positive. No announcement has yet been made, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will join me in wanting to debate the issues over the coming months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_212">I am delighted that the Minister has agreed to meet the trade unions and the leader of the new council taskforce to discuss the situation at Donnington, and I hope that my hon. Friend&#151;if I may call him that&#151;the Member for The Wrekin will join us at that meeting. It is important to show a united front in our efforts to ensure that jobs at ABRO are protected. If they are to go, however, we must prepare the local community as best we can. We need to ensure that people are offered opportunities for retraining and reskilling, and the taskforce idea could enable us to do that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_221"><a name="51117-25_spnew5"><b> Jeremy Corbyn: </b> 
 As someone who grew up near the Donnington depot&#151;which we used to refer to as the dump, but that is the way it was in those days&#151;I obviously hope that my hon. Friend is successful in his meetings with the Minister. Are any of the proposed job losses at Donnington due to the contracting-out culture that is rife in the MOD, and the possible privatisation of some services? There is a committed and skilled long-term, loyal work force at Donnington who should be looked after.
</p>








<p><a name="st_222"><a name="51117-25_spnew6"><b> David Wright: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. We may be taking a step too far with some of the proposals for privatisation and the business structures relating to the supply chain, maintenance structures and services that

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Donnington work force perform so well. We shall be debating those issues with the Minister over the coming months. There is an opportunity for us to discuss the outline business case that has been drawn up. My understanding from the trade unions, whose representatives have seen the outline case document, is that it does not discuss in detail the advantages of retaining jobs and services at Donnington. We shall certainly want to focus on that issue when we talk to the Minister in the coming weeks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_213">One of the best apprenticeship schemes is run from the ABRO site at Donnington. It is a shame that we may lose an extremely good scheme that not only serves the MOD but provides skills for people who go into the private sector. Those are high-value, high-quality jobs and we need to try to work together to defend them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_214">It would also help if the Minister could say something, perhaps in his winding-up speech, about possible Government support for the proposed rail freight terminal in the north Telford area, which straddles my constituency and that of the hon. Member for The Wrekin. It would be particularly positive if the Government could help us to ensure that that terminal is built in Telford, using a mix of MOD land and land owned by the public. That could bring several hundred jobs into the local economy. I hope that Ministers will look closely at the options and the proposals made by the local authority to develop a rail freight terminal on that site, which, I repeat, is fondly known as the depot.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_215">The second sort of work that goes on in the wider Telford and Wrekin area is that of the Equipment Support Procurement and Provision Agency, which is located in my constituency at Stafford Park. Constituents of the hon. Member for The Wrekin also work at that facility and we are both extremely concerned about its future and ongoing activities. ESPPA was formed in 1995&nbsp;from the technical equipment division at Donnington, the procurement branch at Andover and the vehicle spares division at Chilwell. More than 400&nbsp;employees work at Sapphire House, where ESPPA is located.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_216">Proposals are being considered to collocate that facility at Abbey Wood in Bristol. That is extremely alarming to local employees and local trade unions. I have met the trade unions who represent members at that facility, and they are finding it difficult to determine exactly what the Government&#039;s proposals are. There is great concern that Ministers are getting to a point where they almost have a fait accompli and that the facilities offered at Sapphire House will almost automatically move to Abbey Wood. I should like to raise that incredibly important issue again with the Minister at our meeting on 29&nbsp;November.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-25_para12">
<a name="stpa_217">It is important that the jobs at ESPPA stay in Telford for a number of reasons. I do not think that the 400-plus people will redeploy to Bristol. They will probably have to find jobs in the wider economy. I do not want that to happen; I want those jobs to stay in Telford. The MOD will find it incredibility difficult to recruit staff in Bristol, certainly skilled staff. These are skilled jobs. Those people procure products for the armed forces. It will be difficult to replace them when most of them will not want to move from the Telford area. Of course, it is also more expensive to live in Bristol and I am sure that many people will not want to move because the costs of living are greater there.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-25_para13">
<a name="stpa_218">Salaries will be greater for the MOD in the Bristol area. One of Telford&#039;s great advantages is that it represents excellent value for money in terms of costs to the MOD. Such a move would run counter to the principles of the Lyons review. That is also the case for ABRO. We should ensure that defence has a footprint right across the UK, including the midlands and the north. Moving jobs to the south of England is symptomatic of our not having a footprint right across the UK. That is somewhat alarming. I want to raise issues that relate to ABRO as well as ESPPA with the Minister on 29&nbsp;November, and I hope that we will be joined by trade union colleagues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-25_para14">
<a name="stpa_219">The third issue that I want to talk about is the defence training review at Cosford, which is in the constituency of the hon. Member for The Wrekin. We obviously share the fact that many of our constituents are employed there. I do not want to say too much about Cosford&#151;the hon. Gentleman will probably have quite a lot to say about it&#151;but it is important to note that there are 1,038&nbsp;military jobs at Cosford and 942&nbsp;civilian and contractor posts, as far as I am aware, and it is a jobs engine for our local economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-25_para15">
<a name="stpa_220">The defence training review is being examined at the moment. My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (John Smith) will also be interested in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outcome of that review. Cosford presents the opportunity to provide an excellent location for defence training in the UK. The site could expand by up to 300&nbsp;per cent. in a number of scenarios. That would give us a real opportunity to provide new jobs, which are so important in the Shropshire economy, and which will service not just Telford and Wrekin residents, but the black country and the wider west midlands area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-25_para16">
<a name="stpa_221">I hope that the Minister will look carefully at the proposals relating to Cosford and the defence training review. It is an incredibly important site for us. In some ways, we are an RAF county, with the RAF presence at Shawbury and Cosford, and the RAF has a long tradition of being in Shropshire. I hope that we will continue to have that presence in the county and see it expanded over time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-25_para17">
<a name="stpa_222">This is a big contract. I understand that two competitors, with two separate sites, have emerged to be examined by Government, and I understand that that decision may be some time away, but it is important that the Minister should once again engage more generally with regard to the importance of defence training jobs within the wider Shropshire economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-25_para18">
<a name="stpa_223">I close by looking at two broader policy issues that have already been raised in the debate. The first relates to our independent nuclear deterrent and the second to community ownership of the armed forces. Clearly, we will have to make some decision in the coming months and years about whether we retain an independent nuclear deterrent. The manifesto on which I stood understandably commits us to retention of that independent deterrent, but I hope that we will have a wide-ranging debate about how appropriate that is, in the sense that the world has changed somewhat. Certainly, a replacement for Trident would be extremely expensive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-25_para19">
<a name="stpa_224">I put it clearly on the record that I would support the Government and vote for the replacement of the independent nuclear deterrent. I am not suggesting that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1171</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>we abandon it, but I am not sure that we need to go for an extremely expensive deterrent option. We must look at a raft of options. We may have to consider nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, which may be deployed from different platforms. We need a wide-ranging debate on that and to think about the money that we are spending. Certainly the concern of members of the armed forces is that, if we are to deploy troops effectively in a modern environment and meet the challenges that now face us as a country, we need to invest significantly in flexible response conventional forces.

There must be cheaper options that we can use and divert resources into conventional forces.

<a name="stpa_226">I want to finish by talking about community ownership of the armed forces. We have moved away from that in the changes that have been made to the regiments with their identities based on counties, and that is a shame. Over the years, my relatives have served in the King&#039;s Shropshire Light Infantry and the Royal Artillery, although that is a distinct regiment, obviously not based upon a country structure. I wish that we could do more to keep a community connection with our armed forces. We do not seem to name our ships any more after counties or towns. We seem to give them more general names. Let us start to think about connecting our communities again with our armed forces. Let us have an HMS Shropshire or an HMS Wrekin&#151;

A lot of people who would have liked to be on it are not. We are working very hard, as the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore) kindly said. We have a full programme. We have started investigating the carriers and the joint combat aircraft. We have already had some interesting evidence sessions on that. We have also started an inquiry into delivering future capability for the Royal Air Force.

The Committee will play its part in making sure that there is a debate on that matter, but we will need to encourage the MOD to be open, as it was when Trident was first introduced. Perhaps we will need to encourage the MOD to an openness that it has previously resisted, but which would greatly strengthen its hand.

<a name="stpa_232">We have not yet found the right formula for these debates on defence in the UK. Defence always used to be debated in relation to what we did overseas, because of the expeditionary strategy that this country always used to follow. However, it is good to remember our history. Trafalgar was an overseas event, despite the fact that the name now sounds English to our ears. I wish to draw attention to the outstanding celebrations this year of the 200th anniversary of Trafalgar and, unusually perhaps, to pay particular tribute to my great-great-great-great-grandfather, a captain at Trafalgar who sadly had his head blown off on the day. His memorial is next to Nelson&#039;s in St. Paul&#039;s cathedral.

It was a mistake that we all made, but we have discovered since the 1990s that the world did not become safer or more secure after the cold war; it needed more troops, not fewer.

A good demonstration of that, if I may make a suggestion to the Minister who will reply to the debate, would be made by implementing the Committee&#039;s strong recommendation for an independent tribunal to look into complaints against the armed forces. The independence of that tribunal is essential. It would require a very deep change in mindset in the MOD, but it would be good for the MOD, good for our armed forces and very good indeed for the country.

 I am pleased to able to take part in the debate. Unfortunately, the Minister of State would not give way to me earlier when I tried to intervene about human resources. I wanted to make the point that when there are media stories and court cases concerning appalling harassment of certain individuals&#151;women and gay and lesbian officers&#151;in the armed forces, there has at the very least to be the most rigorous examination of the facts, but there also has to be action to ensure that the culture does not continue. It would be helpful if the entire report on Deepcut were made available, so that we could all be assured that no residual culture of harassment remained in the armed forces. Such reports and stories must have an effect on recruitment, and therefore have to be dealt with.

<a name="stpa_239">The right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) raised several issues about recruitment; clearly there is an enormous problem. Part of that problem is the question of rights within the service, but the disenchantment of many members of the public with the policies in Iraq is part of it, too. I have met the families of some of the soldiers who laid down their life in Iraq. Some feel very angry, some feel very bitter and some feel that the soldiers were misled into going to war. The atmosphere surrounding the question of Iraq has had a huge effect on recruitment. Clearly, many people do not want to face up to that, but they will have to face up to the sense of disillusionment with the policies in Iraq.

It is perfectly reasonable to ask how much longer troops will be there, and whether the mere presence of British and American forces has not become part of the problem, rather than part of the solution.

 I have no intention of turning it into a debate on Iraq, but Iraq is an important factor in British military expenditure and the approach taken by the Ministry of Defence. It is clearly central to the Ministry&#039;s policy making. When the Secretary of State replies to the debate, as I am sure he will, I hope that he will tell us when those 8,000&nbsp;troops will come home. At the moment, it appears that it will be December 2006&nbsp;at the earliest. In view of the disturbing news earlier this week about the use of phosphorus by United States and British forces, we want an assurance that chemical weapons will not be used in any form, even as an incendiary device to guide others into an attack, because of the danger of their use against civilians, which is illegal under the 1925&nbsp;convention on chemical warfare.

I repeat what I said in my intervention, when he kindly gave way to me. The Defence Committee ought to be joined by the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs. The Defence Committee has responsibility for defence matters, but it does not have responsibility for disarmament policy nor, indeed, for the operation of the non-proliferation treaty, which is clearly relevant.

<a name="51117-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_242">The hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) talked about US strategy, which includes full-spectrum dominance and thus the development of a new generation of nuclear weapons. Indeed, there are many signs that the US is already spending very large sums on preparing for a post-Trident world, but that does not mean that the UK should do so. We must consider two things: first, our existing expenditure; and, secondly, what happens afterwards. I recently asked the Secretary of State about the cost of running AWE Aldermaston and capital investment in the base. I was astonished to learn that over the past five years, AWE Aldermaston has cost &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion of the defence budget, of which almost &#163;100&nbsp;million has been spent on capital investment in the past year. I would be interested to know what that capital investment was. I hope the money was not spent on preparation for, or manufacture of, a new generation of nuclear weapons to succeed Trident. We have been told, and I accept that we were told in good faith, that no decision has been made on a post-Trident world through the refurbishment of Trident or some new nuclear weapons system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_243">It is worth thinking for a moment about the costs involved. They are huge, as my hon. Friend the Member for Telford (David Wright) pointed out. The original cost of Trident was &#163;12.52&nbsp;billion and the annual running costs are about &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion. Trident&#039;s lifespan was predicted to be 30&nbsp;years. The Trident refit that is taking place at Devonport docks in Plymouth was estimated in 1997&nbsp;to cost &#163;650&nbsp;million, but it is already running at almost &#163;1&nbsp;billion&#151;about a third more than the original estimate. It is not a cheap system, even with the current refit. A replacement of Trident would cost around &#163;25&nbsp;billion. There is a great deal else that one could spend such a sum on&#151;not least, it would allow us to meet the UN millennium development goals every year for the next six years. It is important that in the debate we throw all these factors into the equation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_244">The wider question is how secure the world is with nuclear weapons or with Trident. If we replace Trident nuclear missiles, we will be running contrary to the rule and expectation of the non-proliferation treaty. Although it puts the five declared nuclear weapons states in a special position, it does not allow them to develop new generations of nuclear weapons while at the same time saying that the signatory nations to the non-proliferation treaty cannot develop their own nuclear weapons. If we do not want proliferation, a good example must be set by the five declared nuclear weapons states. I hope the UK does not develop a new generation of nuclear weapons. I do not believe them to bring security. I believe them to be immoral and dangerous, and to encourage others to develop nuclear weapons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_245">The Secretary of State said that there must be a public debate on the matter. We all welcome that. It would be helpful if, in his reply, he could set out the options, the cost of the existing system, the cost of replacement and the legal opinion with respect to the non-proliferation treaty, so that there can be a serious, informed public

</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_246">We are debating defence. The world is obviously not a simple or a stable place. We must ask ourselves whether such fantastic levels of expenditure on defence make the world a safer place, or whether we would be better off spending a little more energy addressing issues of inequality, poverty and instability around the world, rather than assuming that there is a military solution to every problem. I say that because I want to see a more peaceful world, as does the entire House, I am sure. The possession or development of nuclear weapons does not bring that about.

<a name="stpa_249">In view of the unsatisfactory nature of the replies given by the Minister at Defence questions on Monday to two of my hon. Friends who asked about TA recruitment, I want briefly to pursue the issue. It is all very well stating that reserve forces will carry out certain tasks and specialist activities to supplement the regular forces, but that surely depends on available manpower. It will be interesting to learn the actual size of TA that the MOD is seeking. At present, the TA is 15&nbsp;per cent. under strength and overall numbers are falling. As has been said, the current requirement for TA personnel is 41,610, but the actual figure is 35,560, which is the lowest since the TA was founded in 1907.

<a name="51117-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_250">The Minister asserted on Monday that the fall in TA manning has already been reversed. However, I understand that the number of resignations exceeds the number of people who have passed basic training and are fit for deployment, which is a direct consequence of the Iraq war. For the first six months of the war, resignations stood at an average of 162&nbsp;people a month. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1178</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>From September 2003&nbsp;until August this year, the average jumped up to 540&nbsp;resignations a month. That point was highlighted in <i>The Guardian</i> this week&#151;I hasten to add that I do not read that newspaper regularly&#151;in an article based on parliamentary questions entitled, &quot;Civilians who signed up to serve in the TA speak for the first time about why they have handed in their kit for good&quot;, which is a matter of great concern for everyone.

<p>
<a name="51117-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_251">A tremendous physical and financial effort has gone into recruitment, which has fallen by 35&nbsp;per cent. in the past eight financial years. In 1997&#150;98, there were 10,400&nbsp;recruits; in 2004&#150;05, that figure decreased to 6,900&nbsp;recruits, with the costs of recruitment doubling. In 2001&#150;02, expenditure on recruitment was &#163;5&nbsp;million, increasing to &#163;10.5&nbsp;million in 2004&#150;05. Those recruitment figures require further study because from 1&nbsp;March 2003&nbsp;to 30&nbsp;June 2005, some 3,800&nbsp;people were recruited as infantry TA privates, yet only 1,300&nbsp;of them completed phases 1&nbsp;and 2&nbsp;of basic training, and 1,960&nbsp;privates left the TA in the same period.

At present, however&#151;especially in the infantry, where the number of regulars is being cut&#151;as soon as a private has completed basic training he will be called up in the next Operation Telic. The Ministry says that 2,000&nbsp;TA infantry privates were available for Operation Telic 7&nbsp;and some 1,500&nbsp;were available for Operation Telic 8. I do not know where it gets those figures from, especially given that the 4th Battalion the Parachute Regiment was not even able to form a company for Operation Telic 7. A third of the numbers were supplied by the Tyne and Tees Regiment and the East and West Riding Regiment. I suspect that, as information on the ground suggests, new recruits finish their basic training and are deployed virtually immediately when the brown envelope drops on their doormat. Is it any wonder that so many leave when they see what is happening?

Although the number of TA medical personnel who have been deployed since the start of Operation Telic may seem small at 754, most if not all of them are employed in the national health service and need to be replaced in order to continue to provide the services required. The effect on small businesses can be devastating. Although the financial package for replacement of staff is good, it does not replace the expertise and experience of a key individual who is absent for such a long period. Those left behind can cope for a month or two&#151;possibly for up to three&#151;but 10&nbsp;months is expecting too much.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_256">Some 1,350&nbsp;members of the TA have volunteered for a second or subsequent tour. One sometimes wonders why they do not join the regulars. Part of the answer might be that they are far better off financially if they do not do so because they receive their normal civilian wage. A person who is on a salary of &#163;25,000-plus may&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be in the same unit as a regular on a salary of &#163;16,000.

<p><a name="st_240"><a name="51117-28_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gray </b> 
: I want to pick up on a small and technical but important detail. If a member of the Territorial Army volunteers for a second deployment to a theatre of war, he does not have the advantage of the pay and conditions that he gets if he is compulsorily mobilised. That means that people will not go for a second time to Iraq, for example, unless there is some change to their pay and conditions.
</p>








<p><a name="st_241"><a name="51117-28_spnew3"><b> Ann Winterton: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for clarifying that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_257">One can imagine a tight-knit unit with a medic on a large salary and someone on a much smaller salary. Men and women are aware of what is going on and there is a slight resentment among regulars who are not on the same remuneration package. The Minister said that one cannot tell the difference in the field between regular servicemen and members of the TA. The men on the ground know the difference&#151;there may not be a difference in performance, but they know who is a regular and who is a member of the TA.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_258">The Ministry must make up its mind about what it expects from the TA, because it may find that it simply cannot attract personnel in sufficient numbers to give the required commitment in future. I want to stress the importance of maintaining the existing network of TA centres. If there are fewer in future and they are located in the larger conurbations, that will inevitably result in fewer recruits. The Ministry and the defence chiefs are sailing close to the wind and must realise that simply throwing money at recruitment is not producing the right results.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_259">Although I welcome the announcement of the improved package of measures for the reserve forces&#151;we are waiting to hear exactly what they are&#151;the result of current policy is putting the future of the reserve defence forces of the United Kingdom in jeopardy.

<p><a name="st_242"><a name="51117-28_spnew4"><b> John Smith  (Vale of Glamorgan) (Lab):</b> 
 It is always a privilege to take part in defence debates for the important reason that it gives us an opportunity to pay tribute to our brave servicemen and women in this country and throughout the world who do such an excellent job.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_260">I had the privilege of accompanying the right hon. Member for North-East Hampshire (Mr. Arbuthnot) on a visit to RAF Marham yesterday, and I would like to place on record my thanks to Group Captain Bagwell and the team at Marham for showing members of the Select Committee on Defence the superb job that they do and their commitment and professionalism in carrying out duties on our behalf. When we left, every member of the Select Committee felt the same. However, there is a difference between being able to undertake duties with professionalism and commitment and being given duties and responsibilities that people should not have to accept. I intend to discuss that this afternoon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_261">I agreed almost entirely with the opening speech from the Government Front Bench. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I said &quot;almost&quot; entirely. I am a great supporter and extremely proud of the Government&#039;s defence policy. Our strategic defence review is one of the best reviews of any military in NATO and much of the rest of the world. The new chapter and White Paper followed as a result of the changing threats worldwide. The White Paper was a courageous document and a rational response to the threats. It called for a radical reorganisation of our assets, people and structures to create a more flexible, agile and responsive force that could have an increasingly further reach, with smaller packages carrying a bigger and better punch.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_262">That model is emulated in other NATO countries. Last week, as part of the EU presidency, I had the privilege of attending a dinner with leading people in the defence community throughout Europe. I sat next to a person who paid tribute to the British Government&#039;s role in restructuring our armed forces. She told me that her country&#151;a leading European country&#151;modelled its reform proposals on the British strategic defence review. She had been an adviser to the Minister of Defence in her country and had drawn directly on the British review in shifting from a cold war scenario to one that, as the right hon. Member for North-East Hampshire said, presents far greater and more invidious threats in many respects. It is much harder to tackle because it is so much less predictable, demanding greater responsibility, better equipment and better force structures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_263">However, when I outlined to the same person the Government&#039;s proposals for providing depth support for the RAF fast jets as yet another outcome of the review and rationalisation, she listened to me in absolute disbelief. She could not believe that the British Government, who have been taking a leading role throughout NATO in reorganising their armed forces and, just as importantly, the support for their armed forces, as has been mentioned quite a lot today, had now decided to place the depth support for their elite fast jet fleets back in-house with the RAF, after taking it away from the RAF just four years ago, on the sound military grounds that since the end of the cold war there has been no military case whatever for military personnel to carry 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1181</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>out the factory maintenance and repair of fast jets. That can be done much more successfully by civilian workers working in a commercial environment, or by outsourcing that work to the private sector, if appropriate safeguards are put in place. Giving that work back to the RAF, however, makes no sense whatever.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_264">We do not object to reducing the scale of logistical support. Every Member in the Chamber knows that following the force configuration, the over-capacity and huge duplication could not be justified. Also, as I think the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) said in response to the statement, nobody disagrees with a rationalisation of logistical support, which was necessary. We agree with collapsing four lines of logistics for our front-line jets to two. In layman&#039;s terms, if we think of the example of a car, it is like moving from three at depot, industry and factory level and one on the front line, to a service station on the front line and a garage to take the car to for repairs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_265">It is a fundamental mistake, however, to mix the two on a front-line base, as proposed by the Government. It will put unfair pressures on our front-line airmen and women to meet operational targets on a base such as Marham, which we visited yesterday, and to carry out scheduled, planned, long-term maintenance upgrades and deep repairs. If we ask the same people to do the same job with limited resources, the danger is that we will put operational capability at risk. The bottom line is that, when push comes to shove, brave servicemen such as Group Captain Bagwell will meet his operational requirements to defend this nation every time. That is why it was proposed that the two functions should be separated in the first place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_266">I note with interest that, once again, our distinguished Defence Committee Chairman, the right hon. Member for North-East Hampshire, expressed dismay that when he questioned the Minister following his statement, and asked what strategy was being adopted, or what plans there were for providing deep support for the joint combat aircraft and the joint strike fighter, the Minister was not able to reply. The right hon. Member for North-East Hampshire expressed his disappointment because it revealed that there was no principle underlying the Government&#039;s strategy of supporting their front-line aircraft. Let us bear in mind the fact that all the scenarios that we propose&#151;or the overwhelming majority of them in terms of security threats and entering battle zones&#151;require absolute dependence on the reliability and availability of our fast jets, particularly the Tornado GR4&nbsp;and Harrier GR9, for many years to come. We must therefore get this right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para14">
<a name="stpa_267">It was revealed not only that there is no principle underlying the Government&#039;s strategy, but that there is no strategy. The argument has been that we should centralise the second line of logistics&#151;depth support&#151;on a military operational basis. Let me tell the House that we are centralising some at Marham with the Tornado and some at Cottesmore with the Harrier, but despite today&#039;s announcement we do not know where we are going to centralise the depth support for the joint combat aircraft or the joint strike fighter. In his statement last week on the modernisation of logistics, the Minister failed to say where the Hawk training jets were going, but he did say that half or perhaps more than half of the RAF&#039;s rotary wing fleet is rolling back 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1182</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>into one centralised unit&#151;with the exception, I believe, of the Merlin and the Puma which are going, quite frankly, God knows where.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para15">
<a name="stpa_268">The point that I am making is that there is no rationale running through the policy on depth support. If there were a clear and transparent rationale, many hon. Members would have no difficulty in supporting it. I am afraid that statements that this jet is going forward and that jet is going back, or that this aircraft is going forward and that aircraft is going back, or that this helicopter is going forward and that helicopter is going back, smack of cuts for cuts&#039; sake rather than a rationalisation. As I said, I would have no trouble supporting a proper rationalisation. There is a huge difference between saving money for defence by cutting costs and saving money for the front line by introducing genuine efficiency gains. Quite frankly, this stinks of cutting costs. In my opinion, it is even worse than that, because there is serious danger of undermining front-line capability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para16">
<a name="stpa_269">The House will know that in March 2004&nbsp;the Harrier was rolled forward to Cottesmore. In a speech in July this year, I explained to the House that it has been a costly mistake. Indeed, the cost of carrying out the work is escalating out of control. It was originally intended to be carried out by military personnel, but they cannot cope with the work, so an increasing number of civilians&#151;almost 100&nbsp;at present, employed by BAE Systems&#151;are supporting it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para17">
<a name="stpa_270">I have to apologise, because I told the House in July that it was taking an average of 200&nbsp;days to turn round a Harrier&#151;GR9, if upgraded, or GR7&nbsp;if not&#151;as compared with 100&nbsp;days under the old depth support arrangements at DARA St. Athan, where civilians carried out the work in a commercial and centralised environment as they should. One of the biggest military aviation hangars in the world had only just been constructed. It opened only earlier this year and had 47&nbsp;purpose-built bays to provide depth support for the entire fleet of fast jets in the RAF. It was the size of six football pitches and cost &#163;80&nbsp;million&#151;but, no, that is not going ahead and it is being broken up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para18">
<a name="stpa_271">I told the House in July, as I said, that it was taking 200&nbsp;days at Cottesmore compared with 100&nbsp;days at St. Athan under the older arrangements. In the contract bid for that work, it would have taken 60&nbsp;days to turn those aircraft round. I was wrong, because it takes 232&nbsp;days to turn round those aircraft&#151;four times longer than it would have done if the aircraft had remained at St. Athan. That is only a small part of the fleet, yet we are now proposing to put the lion&#039;s share and major part of our front-line fleet&#151;the Tornado aircraft&#151;on these military operational bases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para19">
<a name="stpa_272">I am deeply concerned about the effect on the future availability of our aircraft. In ministerial replies to questions, I have been told that Harrier availability has increased dramatically since the roll forward to Cottesmore and that turn-round times are quicker. That is not true&#151;and the evidence that shows that is available and has been presented to the Minister. Instead of openly and transparently challenging the evidence, the MOD has shut down the computer logistics information technology system that makes the information available, to ensure that no one finds out either the true cost or the amount of time spent on the work.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1183</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para20">
<a name="stpa_273">I ask the Government for what must be the third or fourth time to think very carefully about this issue. Even if they are sticking to their principle&#151;if it is a principle&#151;of rolling forward the Tornado to Marham, for goodness&#039; sake, they should look very carefully at and evaluate the effects of rolling forward the Harrier. We must find ways to retain this capability&#151;doing so in-house is one option&#151;that do not involve a sole monopoly supplier such as BAE Systems. I cannot see how we could incentivise a sole supplier of a service, given that there would be no alternative competitor or in-house provision to turn to in order to reduce costs. I predict that costs will escalate out of control. We must look at other options, such as slowing this process down or retaining, as I said, in-house capability one way or another, be it through the private sector or through the Defence Aviation Repair Agency in St. Athan. We must do so for the future of the British military.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-28_para21">
<a name="stpa_274">In the few seconds remaining to me, I finish by saying that I hope that defence training rationalisation will come to St. Athan.

<p><a name="st_243"><a name="51117-29_spnew0"><b> Mr. James Gray  (North Wiltshire) (Con):</b> 
 The hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (John Smith) and I have three things in common, the first of which is our ability to watch the clock; I greatly admire the tremendous precision with which he did so. Our second thing in common is our less than slavish support for Government defence policy; despite what he said at the outset, he proved to be rather critical of it. Our third common factor is that we are very strong supporters of the armed forces parliamentary scheme. I fear that I am something of an &quot;anorak&quot; on this subject, having completed undergraduate and postgraduate study on it. Most recently, I graduated from the Royal College of Defence Studies, having enjoyed the careful tending of Sir Neil Thorne, to whom we all pay tribute.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_275">That experience from last year has been combined with two or three other, more recent experiences. I am a visiting parliamentary fellow of St. Antony&#039;s College, Oxford, which discusses issues such as those before us. I am also chairman of the all-party group on the Army, and a member of the Court of Assistants of the Honourable Artillery Company, my former Territorial Army regiment. All those experiences have enabled me to put together a number of thoughts in recent months. A debate such as this is an occasion not only to talk about the detailed issues to which Members have referred, but to reflect a little more widely on what we are seeking to do in our defence policy, and how we intend to do it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_276">We have reached a very significant point in world history and defence history. We must consider not only the challenges that our defence forces face and the tasks that they must carry out, but the resources that they are given to enable them do so. It used to be easy: it was plain what our defence forces had to do. We had to defeat communism; to remove the Argentines from the Falkland Islands; to sort things out in Sierra Leone. Even as recently as the conflict in Afghanistan, it was perfectly plain that, post-9/11, we had to do something, and sorting out al-Qaeda in Afghanistan seemed like the right thing to do. I have to say, however, that I am one 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1184</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of those who are by no means convinced that we achieved that task. Equally, I was one of few voices in my party who were by no means convinced that we had justification under international law to do what we eventually did in Iraq. Again, I am by no means convinced that we achieved our aims.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_277">Leaving those issues to one side, the reality is that we no longer have clear tasks, because we do not have such an enemy any more. The enemy of peace in the world today is not a person invading somewhere else; it is not Saddam Hussein invading Kuwait. Today&#039;s enemy is invisible, diverse and unknown. He is ready to sacrifice his own life in a way that we have never seen before in terrorist activities. It was reasonably easy to defeat the IRA. On pointing a weapon at an IRA soldier&#039;s head&#151;I use the word &quot;soldier&quot; loosely&#151;he laid down his weapons. On pointing a weapon at an al-Qaeda terrorist&#039;s head, the likelihood is that he will blow himself up, taking a lot of other people with him. That is an enemy very different from any that we have seen before.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_278">Much fundamental thought needs to be given to how to defeat such a terrorist. Do we do so by shooting him? Can we defeat him through direct, conventional operations? To some degree, of course, we can. If we can shoot Saddam Hussein&#151;sorry, I meant to say the terrorist&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I should point out, incidentally, in response to a sedentary observation from the Liberal Democrat Benches, that many people would have liked Saddam Hussein to be shot.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_279">How do we fight terrorism? Terrorism is a many-headed Hydra: taking out a terrorist carries the risk that 10,000&nbsp;more will be created. Sorting out international terrorism is a much more complicated business than our beloved Prime Minister and the President of the US have led us to believe in recent years. They have tended to say that the war against terrorism is a matter of fighting the bad guys, and that our forces will ride in like the sheriff on his horse and take them out. Not so long ago, I heard Richard Perle saying that people could join the President&#039;s posse if they wanted to. The notion is that we are the good guys, and thus entitled to take out the bad guys.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_280">I, for one, do not believe that defence today is anything like so simple. It is a great deal more complicated, but I still have great faith in my former regiment&#039;s motto&#151;&quot;Arma pacis fulcra&quot;. It means, &quot;Arms are the Balance of Peace&quot;, and I am sure that that is right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_281">The cold war demonstrated as much. Our independent nuclear deterrent won the cold war for us. For some 20&nbsp;years, the Labour party wanted to get rid of it. If that had happened, the Russians and communism would have won. We would not be where we are today if we had done what Labour wanted and disarmed, and the same is true now. We cannot defeat al-Qaeda or international terrorism by laying down our arms, so we need a sensible military deterrence to sort out the terrorist threat.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_282">How do we deploy our conventional military assets so that they deter terrorists? That is a key question, and we must be careful about how we answer it. The tragedy of the South American person killed in error by the police on the underground is a good demonstration of that. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1185</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Should we have been using dum-dum bullets against someone who turned out to be perfectly innocent? What weapons should we use to deter terrorist activity?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_283">I want to contemplate for a moment what we have done in Iraq. Is it right to build up our conventional forces and deploy them as we have in Iraq, given what might happen elsewhere in the world? Next year, we will seek to deploy a second Army group in Afghanistan, which will mean that we have two such groups deployed in the world. That exceeds what was foreseen in the strategic defence review, so what will happen to overstretch? I shudder to think of the consequences in that regard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_284">I have watched our armed forces at work over many years, and I know that service personnel will brace up, salute, turn to the right and march off and do whatever we ask of them. The people who talk incessantly about overstretch demean the capabilities and determination of our very professional armed services. There is no question but that they are up to any job they are given.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-29_para10">
<a name="stpa_285">However, the more we ask our armed forces to do, the harder the task will be if we do not give them the appropriate resources. Our deployment in Afghanistan is due to be increased next year, but who knows what else might happen around the world. What will happen if there is another Sierra Leone or&#151;God forbid!&#151;an increase in violence in Northern Ireland? If anything like that arose, the elastic would be stretched to its maximum.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_286">In that respect, I am more critical of the Government even than the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (John Smith). Our Army is close to being the smallest since the battle of Waterloo. A force with 100,000&nbsp;people or fewer does not deserve the name &quot;Army&quot;. At such a size, we are talking about a home defence force.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_287">In that context, I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton), who spoke with great knowledge and expertise about the Territorial Army. The commanding officer of the Honourable Artillery Company, my own regiment, said only the other day that the Government were using the TA as cheap labour to bridge the gap in their defence budgets. The Government have made deep cuts in the Army and have used the TA to plaster over the gaps, but that cannot go on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-29_para13">
<a name="stpa_288">I have some experience of the TA, and can tell the House that its personnel will accept a deployment of six months or 12&nbsp;months. However, if the law were to be changed to allow them to be required to accept another compulsory deployment, the boys would not do so. They are professional people, with jobs and families to think about. They are prepared to serve the nation once, but the possibility that they might do so more than once is remote.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-29_para14">
<a name="stpa_289">I suspect that the crisis involving recruitment and retention in the TA is worse than it appears, because an awful lot of the people who have come back have not yet handed in their uniforms. They are not necessarily turning up at the drill halls, but are waiting to collect their bounties. If there were a huge crisis that demanded a substantial deployment of the Territorial Army, I suspect that the people would not be there. If that were the case, the regular Army would be left high and dry. The same situation arises in other areas owing to what 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p>
<a name="51117-29_para15">
<a name="stpa_290">The strategic defence review did not foresee the situation that we are in, and nor did the Government. They will not tell us in any detail how they would handle a significant increase in military threat throughout the world. They seem to be sitting on their hands and hoping like heck that that does not happen. There are significant signs that suggest that the elastic that is our highly professional armed forces is being stretched to its maximum. If there were a crisis&#151;I hope that there will not be one&#151;who knows what would happen to that elastic.

 I echo the tributes that my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (John Smith) paid to our men and women in the armed forces. We often take them for granted. They make difficult decisions and find themselves in difficult situations, so it is right to start a speech in such a debate by paying tribute to them.

<a name="stpa_292">I want to talk about the importance of the UK defence industry to defence in the UK and the deployments that we ask our men and women to undertake around the world. I shall do that by concentrating on two issues: first, the future rapid effect system; and, secondly, the future shipbuilding strategy for UK yards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_293">The international situation these days is setting new challenges for the armed forces. The need for lighter and more manoeuvrable forces is clearly evident. The tasks that we will ask our armed forces to undertake in the future are likely to be smaller in scale than in the past, conducted at short notice, and carried out some distance from the UK. That explains why it is important to develop a medium-weight land capability that could be deployable by air and effective in acute and dangerous situations.

<a name="stpa_296">The generally quoted in-service date for FRES was 2009. In late 2004, the then Minister for Defence Procurement, Lord Bach, said that the date would definitely be 2009. He said that

<a name="51117-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_299">To try to obtain some answers, I tabled a written question to the Secretary of State. I was grateful but intrigued by the answer from the Minister of State, who said:

<a name="stpa_300">We have gone from Ministers openly talking about an in-service date of 2009&nbsp;to a position where the Minister will not be pinned down on what the date will be. That makes me wonder what, if anything in FRES, will be delivered on time.

<a name="stpa_303">That is the challenge that faces the British Army. I am increasingly sceptical about whether FRES will be introduced anywhere near the end of the decade.

<a name="stpa_305">I welcomed the appointment of Lord Drayson as the Minister with responsibility for defence procurement. This month, when he appeared before the Select Committee he showed his understanding of industrial processes, and I await his defence industrial strategy with eager anticipation. We need to do two things: first, we must deliver equipment on time and on budget to our armed forces; and, secondly, we need to realise that if we are to maintain a viable and vibrant defence manufacturing industry we must plan our procurement. Clearly the Defence Procurement Agency had an atrocious record on that in the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-30_para15">
<a name="stpa_306">I want to deal with the shipbuilding strategy. I welcome the commitment given by my right hon. Friend the Minister of State in his opening address that &#163;14&nbsp;billion will be spent on procuring new ships for the Royal Navy over the next 10&nbsp;years. However, I am sceptical about whether they will actually be built in the UK. There will be a glut of work, with the CVF, the future carrier, and the military afloat reach and sustainability&#151;MARS&#151;programme, but there are worrying signs that unless a clear strategy underpins development in the yards we shall not have the capacity to build those ships in the UK. The idea of building our warships abroad, possibly in eastern Europe, would be a complete tragedy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-30_para16">
<a name="stpa_307">There is a notion&#151;there certainly was when the Conservatives were in power&#151;that shipbuilding is an old smokestack industry. I would challenge anyone who thought that to visit a modern shipyard. Not only do they use cutting-edge technology in fabrication, but electronics and so on. It is far from a smokestack industry. We need a clear strategy to ensure that the industry in this country has the necessary capacity and we should encourage apprenticeships and expertise in those areas. If we fail to do that, I fear that, when we finally come round to procuring ships in the future, we will not have the necessary capacity or skills base, which is vital.In the next 12&nbsp;months the Government need to lay out that strategy, not just for shipbuilding but for other parts of defence manufacturing. I hope that we do not go down the road of thinking that purchasing our equipment from abroad would be cheaper somehow. Clearly, if work is not forthcoming there will be knock-on social effects on many of those communities throughout country.

<a name="stpa_308">I want to refer to the ongoing saga of the alternative landing ship logistics, which has a lot of credence locally in the north-east, given the involvement of Swan Hunter. I am concerned about that programme. Clearly, extra money is rightly being spent to finish it. I visited Scotstoun yard in Glasgow a couple of weeks ago to see the two BAE Systems vessels being procured. There are serious problems with that programme. We now need a clear audit of what is going wrong and what needs to be put right to get those ships delivered on time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-30_para18">
<a name="stpa_309">I am not here to apportion blame, but some grave questions must be asked about the way in which the winning bid used an off-the-shelf Dutch design. Clearly, unrealistic estimates for the cost of those ships were included. I am also concerned that, as the ships are being delivered, possibly up to 40&nbsp;variations are being made each week. I understand that Lloyd&#039;s Register will not 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1189</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>even certificate some of the ships until some of those modifications are put right. Unless that is done, the saga will carry on. Will it cost more for the taxpayer? No doubt, it will, and I wonder why some of those things were not questioned when an off-the-shelf Dutch design was proposed as a cheap alternative by someone at Swan Hunter who may have expertise in the oil industry, but none at all in designing and building a modern warship, even logistics ships such as those in that programme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-30_para19">
<a name="stpa_310">Shipyards must work together, but if we have no commitment to sharing work around the industry yards such as Swan Hunter will face a number of years without work. The way to ensure that that does not happen is to plan the work over the next 10&nbsp;years. However, I would certainly question whether any work should go to the yard under the current management. I have nothing against the work force&#151;I have the highest regard for the good work that they do&#151;but there are clearly serious problems not just with the way the work is managed, but with whether they can find the investment that is needed for a modern shipyard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-30_para20">
<a name="stpa_311">We should not underestimate the importance of the defence industry in this country, not just in procuring the best equipment that our armed forces need, but in ensuring that we protect this country&#039;s skills base. If that is not done, we could become a country of assembly workers for other international arms manufacturers. That would be a tragedy, not just for parts of the north-east, but for many communities throughout the country.

There are great changes afoot at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, for example, with expansion and relocation from Farnborough and Malvern to Porton Down in my constituency.

That is why we have all been so proud of the Royal British Legion in the past few weeks, centring on poppy day, on Remembrance Sunday.

<a name="stpa_315">The problems of forces families continue&#151;little problems that they bring to their Members of Parliament. One matter that came to me again recently, as it did a decade ago, was the problem of service families obtaining commercial credit in shops because their lifestyle leads them to two-year postings, which means that they do not qualify for ordinary hire purchase agreements. I thought that we had knocked that on the head in the last Armed Forces Act, but apparently not. That matter will no doubt come up again. I served on the Committees considering the last two Armed Forces Bills, and I hope very much that I might be able to serve on the forthcoming Bill, which will be extremely important.

<a name="stpa_316">On Tuesday in Westminster abbey, we had the inauguration of the Church of England General Synod. I am a member of the General Synod and it gave me enormous pride to see the forces synodical council represented in Westminster abbey, because it is part of the Church of England&#039;s synodical system, and the chaplain general&#039;s department is very important to Her Majesty&#039;s forces. I was delighted to see the recent announcement of representation for other faiths, including the Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs. But the synodical council is important. I found the summary of the minutes of its last recorded meeting at Amport house on the Ministry of Defence website, but I regret to say that although it was an hilarious account of a synodical meeting, it was dated 22&nbsp;and 23&nbsp;April 2002.

<a name="stpa_319">and urged us as a nation always to look for the moral high ground. We heard from a former distinguished soldier, who argued that, whenever the British were tempted to use torture or internment, we lost the moral high ground. He believed that we let ourselves down many years ago in Cyprus and should have learned from our experience of internment in Northern Ireland before considering locking up people without charge for the famous 90&nbsp;days. He described Guantanamo Bay as a concentration camp. There was little sympathy in the Church of England General Synod for 90-day detainment without charge and less sympathy still for the religious hatred legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_320">We need to remember in these defence debates that the expectation of many of our citizens is that the Government will take the moral high ground in controlling carefully, for example, our arms exports, especially considering the worldwide trade in small arms. We can do precious little about that. There are issues of extraterritoriality that are difficult to address, but we should do what we can and we will never regret sticking to the moral high ground.

<a name="stpa_321">I congratulate the Army in particular on the way in which it looks after its training estate. It is a remarkable fact that the training estate, which covers about 125,000&nbsp;hectares, is some of the best managed land in the country. Relations between the Army and civilian population are crucial. I particularly commend the work of Headquarters Army Training Estate at Westdown camp on Salisbury plain, which goes to considerable lengths to ensure that all the parish councils are told exactly what is happening. In the excellent monthly newsletter that is sent to all the parishes and to me, there are accounts of when training in live firing and artillery firing will take place in Salisbury plain west, north and east, when there will be late firing, non-firing days, air activities, helicopter night flying, aircraft trials and parachuting. I always love the monthly conservation report. This month, it includes a welcome to Rachel Crees, who works as an environmental adviser for Defence Estates. She describes touchingly how the plain is one of the most amazing landscapes in the British Isles, and it is.

<p>
<a name="51117-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_322">Another aspect of that work has been the extraordinary lengths to which the military have gone with the European Union life project on Salisbury plain, which ended in September. That was a &#163;2&nbsp;million scheme to look after the extensive chalk grasslands, some of the most precious in Europe. They would not be precious if it were not for the presence of the British Army for 100&nbsp;years, which has kept the landscapes, flora and fauna in good order. Therefore, I congratulate all those who look after the Army lands in estates the length and breadth of the land.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_325">There is a huge issue of principle between the British approach to secrecy and the American approach. The United States Department of Homeland Security produces an enormous amount of material, all available on the web. It tells people exactly what the United States is doing about MANPADS, counter-MANPADS operations and what the priorities are. It gives examples of commercial responses, including from BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman. It believes that those details point out to anyone of ill intent that the United States is ahead of the game. It gives confidence to the American people and acts as a deterrent by making plain what the US Government are doing about that threat. We face real problems with MANPADS. Their proliferation is a problem, with at least 500,000&nbsp;around the world. They are lethal, highly portable, concealable and cheap&#151;some are only $500. They are easy to use, so airport perimeter security needs to be improved. Different air traffic procedures are needed, such as spiral descents. I have been in one of those and it is not something that I would like to do every day. Technical countermeasures are also available, such as infrared decoy flares, direct infrared energy and missile warning systems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-31_para14">
<a name="stpa_326">A huge effort has been made towards non-proliferation and the Government have played their part. The effort has included the Wassenaar arrangements in January 2004, the G8&nbsp;action plan agreed on 2&nbsp;June 2003&nbsp;at Evian, the Bangkok declaration in 2003&nbsp;and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe conference in July 2003. Tracing discussion of those issues in <i>Hansard</i> in both Houses has been an interesting experience. The trail goes cold after 1&nbsp;March this year, when there was a question tabled in the other place. Two years ago, the Science and Technology Committee produced a report on the scientific response to terrorism. It came at a time when a lot else was happening and did not receive much of the spotlight.

<a name="stpa_327">I was a member of the Committee at the time and we visited appropriate organisations in the United States, from the White House to the National Institutes of Health, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. The message we got wherever we went&#151;military or civilian, medical or scientific&#151;was that the more people are told, the better they are defended and the better the deterrent effect. It is time that our Government started to place more trust in the British people. The effect on those who wish to harm us would be very positive. It would mean a tremendous change in the whole tone of secrecy in this country and I invite Ministers to consider that in partnership with other Government Departments. Part of our trouble is that the lead Department is the Home Office, which has to co-ordinate our efforts. I would not wish to go as far as the United States and set up a separate Department, but I do wish to see a Minister for homeland defence.

I ask officials to consider the residential accommodation, including married and family quarters, in Colchester and throughout the country, and the consequences of the privatisation by the Conservative Government: the sell-off to Annington Homes. Are the Government satisfied that the efforts to reach the decent homes standard, or the MOD equivalent, are proceeding with sufficient speed? The information that I am getting suggests that there is a lot to be done, and the time scale is such that families are having to put up with conditions that are not conducive to people remaining in the Army.

<a name="stpa_331">Another concern is schools, which are technically part of the local education authority and are not funded by the MOD. That said, the MOD has an interest and a role. In June 2003, the then Secretary of State for Education and Skills, now the Home Secretary, visited Colchester and told the Army schools that they would get more money. I followed that up with written questions and the then Minister for School Standards, who has since been promoted, said that there would be no extra Government money for the Army schools. He said:

As I said in my maiden speech, Shropshire has a long, proud tradition of service in Her Majesty&#039;s armed forces, both on the front line and in the defence supply chain. We have the Royal Air Force at RAF Cosford, and we have the Defence Logistics Organisation, the Army Base Repair Organisation and the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency at Donnington. Since the general election&#151;perhaps it is not a coincidence&#151;480&nbsp;job losses have been announced at the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency at Donnington. Only last week, Ministers announced a further 628&nbsp;job losses, which will impact on my constituency. So there have been more than 1,000&nbsp;job losses in six months.

I hope that the Minister will either confirm or deny that the Welsh Development Agency and Welsh taxpayers&#039; money is being used to promote St. Athan in Wales over Shropshire, which is not using taxpayers&#039; money. It is unable to use such funds through the regional development agency to promote RAF Cosford as a site for the future defence training requirements of Her Majesty&#039;s armed forces.

Members on both sides of the House could perhaps have supported the Government. However, we seem to have cuts for cuts&#039; sake, and as I said in an intervention, much of that is meant to release estates and assets, thus realising value from large property holdings. That money will probably not be re-invested in the back office or in front-line military capability. Who knows, perhaps it will end up going to the failing Child Support Agency or another failing Government agency or quango. No business case has been made for the cuts, and nothing that Ministers have said can reassure my constituents or me that any savings from the reconfiguration of the armed forces will assist national security or the effectiveness and efficiency of Her Majesty&#039;s armed forces. Nor will they be of wider benefit to my constituents.

That is worrying. If there were a business case, as I said, that would be fair enough. If it were in the national interest, I would agree. A satisfactory case has not been made that the policy of privatisation will improve our national security or our armed services in aggression or in peacekeeping, and there is increased demand on them to fulfil our international aid obligations.

 It is my great privilege to represent the men and women of the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers in the town of Monmouth. We can sleep a little better in our beds knowing that those men and women will go out and do battle on our behalf, as they have been doing. The regiment has distinguished itself since 1539, most recently in Iraq in Operation Telic. I was honoured to be invited to breakfast with them on the morning of their departure for Iraq, and I was very impressed with the level of commitment that those young men and women showed as they went off.

We are in the midst of a series of prosecutions that have been brought against soldiers serving in Iraq. Nobody in the Chamber or outside could support any indication of brutal treatment on the part of our Army, but some of the cases have clearly been brought on the basis of evidence which one judge described as weak and vague. That is not good enough.

<a name="stpa_343">Something similar is happening in Northern Ireland. Yesterday at Prime Minister&#039;s Question Time, it was telling that although the Prime Minister waxed eloquent about how proud he was of our troops in the Balkans, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and Iraq, and rightly so, he failed to mention Northern Ireland. For the past 30&nbsp;years, the men and women of our armed forces have faced incredible danger in Northern Ireland. They went out there to protect civilians, Protestant and Catholic alike, and they did so against an enemy who wore no uniform, who struck without warning and whose favoured method of attack was to blow up innocent civilians with bombs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_344">It is possible that the reticence of our Prime Minister stems from the fact that his Government are announcing a policy that seems to amount to little more than a &quot;Get out of Jail Free&quot; card for IRA terrorists. That would be bad enough, but what makes matters worse is that at the same time as we grant a pardon to IRA terrorists, we are setting up an inquiry to examine the actions of every soldier who served in Northern Ireland. That is a disgrace and an insult to the 760&nbsp;or so men and women who lost their lives serving in the Province and doing an extremely difficult job. When we asked the Leader of the House about the matter last week, he said that one sometimes had to make difficult decisions. There is absolutely nothing difficult about appeasing terror. The difficult decision is to stand up to terrorists, and I am glad to say that many Ministers have done so over the past few years.

<a name="stpa_350">It is interesting to note that our military forces are the last corner of Britain that new Labour has found it hard to change. If one goes into any barracks, sergeants&#039; mess or officers&#039; mess, one will see the same levels of discipline and commitment and the same standard of training as one would have found more than 100&nbsp;years ago. One would probably also find the same numbers of tattoos in the soldiers barracks and the same war stories being told in the sergeants&#039; quarters, and as many labradors in the officers&#039; mess.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_351">It is ironic how well something can work when a Government leave it alone. The forces have been able to maintain a collective discipline and responsibility that has resisted political upheavals. All Governments should be grateful for that. The democracy that we enjoy today is thanks to the military of yesterday and the continuing capability and commitment of the forces today. That is why we are able to sit on the world&#039;s top table and to have an important place in NATO, the G8, the United Nations and the Commonwealth. The commitment that is shown by our armed forces is not necessarily matched by that shown by the Government. We are serving in more than 40&nbsp;operations in more than 20&nbsp;countries, but our forces are deeply overstretched, woefully undermanned and dangerously ill-equipped&#151;at a time when, as many hon. Members have pointed out, we are living in an increasingly dangerous world. The result is low morale and a failure to meet recruitment targets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_352">There is much that the Government can do, including on recruitment. Recruitment is harder today as a result of falling birth rates, more people going into further education, and people&#039;s lack of direct exposure to the armed forces, whether in a military family or by seeing people in uniform. Today&#039;s iPod generation, as they are being called, have very different expectations from those of previous generations. The solution is to expose people to the military environment at a much earlier age.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_353">I pay tribute to the combined cadet force and the sea cadets, among others, which are important sources of recruitment. I recently visited the sea cadets in Bournemouth, and unfortunately found that they are woefully underfunded and looking for a new location in which to house themselves. Yet they provide huge opportunities for people from deprived backgrounds and eventually help in recruiting people into the armed forces. As we heard, the university air squadron provides 56&nbsp;per cent. of our pilots. If we remove their ability to train in aeroplanes until they go to Cranwell, we are again denying ourselves a huge and important source of potential officers. I would not have joined the Army had I not gone through the officer training corps at university.

The Royal Gloucester, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment is to merge with the Devon and Dorset Regiment, which is to merge with the Light Infantry. I understand, although the Minister is yet to make the announcement, that they are all to be merged with my own regiment, the Royal Green Jackets, to form five rifle regiments. As for the loss of the Parachute Battalion, which is the biggest feeder into the special forces, I do not understand the logic of that at all.

It is a good job that we focus our energies in most of our operations on hearts and minds. If we had to do it any other way, we would not have the equipment. Every soldier, sailor and airman has the right to ask whether money is being well spent by the Government. I do not believe that the Government&#039;s words are matched by their actions.

<a name="stpa_371">What concerns me more than anything else&#151;it also concerns the armed forces&#151;is the attitude of the Labour Government to their loyal soldiers, sailors and airmen. We should not be too surprised at that attitude. We heard from my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes about the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#039;s attitude to spending money on the armed forces. I want to give the House two examples that illustrate, I regret to say, the contempt in which some members of the Government and the Labour party hold the armed forces. I do not wish to be nice to the Secretary of State, but I exempt him from these criticisms as I know that they do not apply to him. I believe that they do not apply to his Ministers either, although I have not yet heard their views in the same detail as I have heard his. I believe that the Secretary of State is a great friend of the armed forces and it is a pity that he has to implement the cuts that were announced before he took his post.

<a name="51117-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_372">While serving as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland during Christmas 1999, Peter Mandelson&#151;as I understand it, a pretty close confidant of the Prime Minister&#151;referred to members of the Household Division as &quot;chinless wonders&quot;. At the time, three of the five footguards battalions were on operations in Northern Ireland. I was in a footguards battalion and served in Northern Ireland. If I thought that &quot;Uncle Peter&quot;, as he is apparently called in the Prime Minister&#039;s household, were no longer welcome in No. 10, I would be happier, but I suspect that he remains a close friend and confidant. More recently in 2003, the Deputy Prime Minister insulted our armed forces by saying, &quot;All soldiers are boneheads.&quot; That rather contrasts with what the Minister of State said about how much he respected our forces. It was an unworthy comment, but I suggest that it is revealing of how many in the Labour party&#039;s hierarchy view the armed forces.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-34_para13">
<a name="stpa_373">My right hon. and learned Friend the shadow Secretary of State mentioned several of the real problems that are dogging the armed forces, including declining recruitment and retention, notwithstanding the fact that, as I understand it, 7&nbsp;per cent. of the Army is now recruited outside the UK from the Commonwealth. My right hon. and learned Friend and several other hon. Friends referred to the increasing haemorrhage of soldiers from the Territorial Army. Until the present Government came to office, such soldiers had never been used on operations outside general war to the extent that they have been in Iraq.

<p>
<a name="51117-34_para14">
<a name="stpa_374">I would like to highlight other issues that are making the Army, and the armed forces in general, deeply suspicious of the Government. As I said on Monday, I fear that they are undermining the loyalty and trust that should exist both ways between our armed forces personnel and their political commanders. When he sums up, will the Minister comment on the following extract from an article in Monday&#039;s <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>? I know that he probably does not read that newspaper, but if it were a quote from <i>The Guardian&#151;[Interruption.]</i> I am delighted to hear that the Secretary of State reads <i>The Daily Telegraph.</i> The article states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">&quot;A week after the trial ended, Brig. Robert Aitken, the director of Army personnel strategy and answerable directly to Gen. Jackson, wrote to selected commanders.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&#039;How did our officers perform?&#039;, he asked. &#039;Was abuse of Iraqi civilians widespread?&#039;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">The brigadier said he was not &#039;conducting a witch-hunt&#039; but added: &#039;I do need some evidence.&#039;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">In a reference to press reports, he wrote: &#039;The media at the moment is giving our military discipline system a bit of a hammering and is also asking . . . whether our officers behaved to the highest standards.&#039;&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-34_para15">
<a name="stpa_375">I do not know him and&#151;I hasten to add for the Secretary of State&#039;s benefit&#151;I am not criticising him one way or the other, but we require an answer about whether that is true. Was there a policy of investigating officers to get them to face a court martial? I have already raised earlier today the question of the Attorney-General&#039;s political involvement in decisions. Perhaps the Minister will tell me that the Government did not encourage that policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-34_para16">
<a name="stpa_376">As we have already heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth, these courts martial are harming the morale of people who, whether they be soldiers or their commanders, are operating in incredibly difficult circumstances. I can assure the House that all soldiers understand that if they wilfully abuse Iraqis or others, or if they wilfully misbehave or commit criminal acts, they should expect to be punished. I hope, however, that everyone understands that sitting in a nice office in Whitehall or, indeed, in the Chamber of the House of Commons and talking about these matters is very different from being on the streets of Iraq, where temperatures may be as high as 58oC and troops may be wearing heavy body armour, sweating like the proverbial, knowing that some people around them have weapons and are trying to kill them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-34_para17">
<a name="stpa_377">My second point leads on directly from that and relates to the Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill, which my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth mentioned. Will the Minister tell me what representations he has received from senior officers about that shameful Bill? Can he confirm that it is the case that British soldiers who served in Northern Ireland, who were obeying orders from senior officers directed by the Government at the time, may be prosecuted under the Bill on exactly the same conditions as the terrorists they were trying to deter? Would the soldiers and SAS personnel involved in the Loughgall incident in 1987&nbsp;be caught by this Bill? The Minister will recall that the European Court of Justice&#151;it might have been the European Court of Human Rights; he will put me right&#151;found 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1204</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that the terrorists involved in that incident were unlawfully killed, and that as a result, compensation was paid to their relations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-34_para18">
<a name="stpa_378">I would be very grateful if the Minister commented on those issues. I can assure him that soldiers will not wish to engage the enemy&#151;the primary purpose of infantrymen and most other soldiers&#151;if they are likely to face prosecution. It cannot be right to treat public servants acting under orders in the same way as terrorists committing crimes in this country. These are the issues that are harming the armed forces&#039; long-term morale. As I said, I do not believe that the Secretary of State is party to them, so let him stand up and say what he thinks about them. It is important that he do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-34_para19">
<a name="stpa_379">Many other issues have been raised and I shall not cover them in detail, but the cut in the number of infantry battalions as part of the Army restructuring is, to put it mildly, perverse, coming as it does when the Army is so busy around the world. It cannot make sense to reduce the number of infantry battalions by four. Perhaps the Minister will tell us where the troops for Afghanistan will come from, because it is not immediately apparent. In view of the question from the hon. Member for Colchester, he might also tell us when the disbandments and reorganisation will take place. I understand that they have been put off because our troops are so busy. On infantry reorganisation, is the Minister absolutely sure that ending the arms plot will make the infantry operate better and be more usable?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-34_para20">
<a name="stpa_380">Has the Minister considered the following important point, which several soldiers have raised with me? Currently, our battalions have experience in depth. They contain people who have served in armoured infantry in Germany and Iraq, and who have done basic foot-soldiering and peacekeeping in Northern Ireland. Such people have the gamut of experience, but given the direction in which this reorganisation is going, we risk taking away that depth of experience and the military expertise that we currently enjoy. My concern is that we will get a less flexible, less usable infantry under this reorganisation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-34_para21">
<a name="stpa_381">I come briefly to the Royal Navy. In discussing how the Government have been treating our armed forces, it needs to be pointed out that we are reducing the frigate and destroyer fleet from 32&nbsp;to 25. In fact, in a couple of years&#039; time there will be even fewer. Some ships have yet to come into fleet service. This is a dire situation. The Chief of the Naval Staff and First Sea Lord, Sir Alan West, said that he believes that 30&nbsp;is the minimum number that we can make do with.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-34_para22">
<a name="stpa_382">In many ways, today is a rather sad day. This debate has been largely interesting and well attended&#151;certainly by Conservative Members, if not by Labour Members&#151;but it has raised more questions than it has answered. I very much hope that the Minister will be able to answer some of them when he replies.

 This has been an important and valuable debate, and every Member&#039;s contribution has helped in that regard. I apologise at the outset for the absence of the Minister of State, Ministry of Defence. As he advised the Opposition parties, he has had to leave London.

<a name="51117-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_383">As a force for good across the world, our armed forces are second to none. Our service personnel do a tremendous job in often unimaginable circumstances and they deserve the very best support that we can give them. My agenda&#151;my mission as a Minister in the Ministry of Defence&#151;is simple. It is to demonstrate to the whole defence family that we value them: our cadets, reserves and serving personnel, and their families, and our veterans.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_384">This year more than ever we have shown how we value the contribution made by those who defended our freedoms in the darkest days of the previous century. Our men and women become veterans the moment that they leave the armed forces, and I believe that it is very important to remind the public of what they have done for us, while at the same time making sure that they know that we are there to give help, advice and support for the rest of their lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_385">I am delighted that the armed forces veterans badge has been so well received, and we are very pleased that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was able to announce that eligibility is being extended to cover those who served between the wars and up to 1954.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_386">I am also pleased that the Ministry of Defence makes a significant contribution to the Government&#039;s youth agenda. I should like to pay personal tribute to all the adult volunteers who give so much of their time to the cadet forces. It is a direct result of their efforts that the cadet movement is one of Britain&#039;s largest youth organisations with a membership in excess of 130,000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_387">For the commitment and personal sacrifices that our service people make, they deserve the confidence and peace of mind that comes from knowing that their families are cared for, particularly when they are away on operations. Members of the armed forces draw heavily on the support that they get from their families, supporters and loved ones. There is no question in my mind that we must continue to deliver practical improvements to the things that make people feel good about the extra mile that we often ask them to go.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_388">They expect&#151;and I agree with them&#151;that we should and will deliver good-quality accommodation, a fair allowances package and a robust and responsive welfare network. Over the past three financial years, we have upgraded 5,452&nbsp;married quarters, at a cost of &#163;120&nbsp;million. Over the next four years, we intend to upgrade a further 3,300. I pay tribute to the service families associations for the full part that they play in helping us to devise our policies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_389">It is appropriate that I say something about the reserves and the regular forces together, because together is exactly how they serve in our modern forces. On the numbers in the reserves, we have witnessed Opposition Members shed a quantity of crocodile tears&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> We should not forget that, in their years in power, they cut the reserve forces by 20,000. They do not like to be reminded, but there is an old saying, &quot;By their actions ye shall know them.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_390">Our reserves play a vital role in the success of operations. The strategic defence review envisaged more capable reserves, more closely integrated with the regular forces. I also pay tribute to the employers who give reserves time to serve. That is of tremendous value and the country owes them a great debt.

 As I think the right hon. and learned Gentleman knows, the responsibility of the Attorney-General comes into play after the Army prosecution authority believes that there is a matter to be prosecuted. That is how it happens and how it has been happening. We need a robust system of military justice through which allegations are investigated and, if appropriate, wrongdoers brought to court. That is what the Government want.

The Conservative Government cut defence spending by 15&nbsp;per cent., and that was after the cold war.

They also reduced numbers in the Navy. The number of submarines fell from 18&nbsp;to 10&nbsp;and the number of frigates from 22&nbsp;to 19. The number of Navy personnel was cut from 58,000&nbsp;to 45,000. During the Tory Government of 1992&nbsp;to 1997, the number of RAF squadrons fell from 55&nbsp;to 47, which was a reduction of 15&nbsp;per cent. The Conservatives have nothing to teach anyone about how to handle the armed forces.

<a name="stpa_402">The right hon. and learned Gentleman criticised the Government&#039;s procurement record, but in 1997&#151;the year that the Conservatives left office&#151;the National Audit Office found that the top 25&nbsp;defence procurement projects in which the Conservative Government were involved were &#163;3&nbsp;billion over the original costs and would be delivered three years late.

<a name="51117-36_time0"><h5>6&nbsp;pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_272"><a name="51117-36_spnew2"><b> Mrs. Louise Ellman  (Liverpool, Riverside) (Lab/ Co-op):</b> 
 I thank Mr. Speaker for selecting the case of my constituent, Michael Shields, for debate today. I bring Michael Shields&#039;s situation to the attention of the House because I am convinced that there is a grave danger that a gross injustice has taken place and that an innocent 19-year-old young man is languishing in a Bulgarian jail, serving a 15-year sentence for a crime that he did not commit and to which another man has confessed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_425">The solution lies in the Bulgarian judicial system, but there is a vital role for our Government to play. Michael Shields, with others, travelled to the Crystal hotel in the Golden Sands resort of Varna, Bulgaria on 23&nbsp;May 2005. From there, he moved to Istanbul to watch Liverpool beat AC Milan in the European championship final on 25&nbsp;May. He then returned to Varna. On 30&nbsp;May, at approximately 5.30&nbsp;am, in the vicinity of the Big Ben fast food caf&#233;, barman Martin Georgiev was seriously assaulted. He was punched to the ground and then kicked. His assailant proceeded to drop a large rock-like stone on to his head. Only immediate surgery saved Martin Georgiev&#039;s life.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_426">Michael Shields was taken from his hotel room, where he was sleeping. After an investigation, he was later arrested and charged with attempted murder. He received a 15-year sentence in the Varna court on 26&nbsp;July 2005, and was ordered to pay compensation of 200,000&nbsp;Bulgarian leva in addition. Two others received non-custodial sentences. Michael has always been adamant that he was asleep in his hotel room at the time the attack took place, and produced witnesses to testify to that fact.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_427">On 28&nbsp;July, Graham Sankey, who had been questioned but then released by the Bulgarian police before he returned to Liverpool, confessed to the crime. In a statement issued through his solicitor he stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">&quot;an innocent man has received blame for what I did.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_428">To this day, Graham Sankey has not been questioned about his confession. The case is under Bulgarian jurisdiction and only the Bulgarians can initiate such a process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_429">I have discussed the matter with Merseyside police, who are willing to investigate. They can do so, however, only at the request of the Bulgarian authorities. No such request has been made. Michael&#039;s appeal, which was heard on 14&nbsp;October, confirmed both the guilty verdict and the 15-year sentence. Michael&#039;s legal team is now considering an appeal to the Sofia court. If that does not succeed, Michael&#039;s case may be taken to the European Court of Human Rights, which could order a retrial.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_430">Today, I ask our Ministers to urge the Bulgarian authorities to order an inquiry or a retrial into this highly disturbing case, and I do so for three major reasons: first because of serious concerns about the initial trial, including the pre-trial phase; secondly, because of the failure to question Graham Sankey following his confession to the crime; and, thirdly, because of the significant evidence submitted by a new 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1212</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>witness. I should like to indicate the major areas of concern in those three spheres, although I stress that this is not an exhaustive list.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para11">
<a name="stpa_431">First, I refer to the trial and pre-trial phase. Stephen Jacobi, the eminent international human rights lawyer who is director of Fair Trials Abroad, witnessed part of the initial trial. He reports serious shortcomings, stating that the way in which identification was authenticated was &quot;quite appalling&quot;. In the absence of forensic evidence&#151;a major deficiency in itself&#151;this is greatly disturbing. Guilt was determined solely on the basis of witness identification. Witnesses were able to resile from their police statements that they could not remember details of the defendants&#039; faces. Dock identification was permitted, as though it was of real evidential worth, a practice that Stephen Jacobi reports was abandoned in the United Kingdom 50&nbsp;years ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para12">
<a name="stpa_432">Evidence on how the blow to Martin Georgiev was struck was divided. All those in the bar&#151;close colleagues of the victim&#151;admitted that they did not see the beginning of the action, but stated that the stone was clutched to the assailant&#039;s chest and dropped from there. Those who saw the whole of the attack from outside could identify Michael Shields only from seeing him in the dock, and they said that the stone was brought down from above the assailant&#039;s head.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para13">
<a name="stpa_433">The court considered a highly judgmental document from the prison governor, who gave a prejudicial interpretation of Michael&#039;s motives in wishing to have his hair cut. The defence could not cross-examine the governor on that. Even before the trial began, prejudiced pre-trial publicity and the flawed identity parade gave cause for concern.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para14">
<a name="stpa_434">The second reason I seek an inquiry or a retrial is the bizarre situation of Graham Sankey. The Bulgarians have not questioned Graham Sankey since his confession to the crime, and neither have they asked the British police to do so, although it is within their remit to make that request. This raises major questions. The Bulgarian Ministry of Justice issued a summons for Graham Sankey and four others to attend court before the confession was made. So before the confession was made the Bulgarians did want Graham Sankey to come to court for questioning. After the confession was made, they did not want to talk to him, nor did they want anyone else to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para15">
<a name="stpa_435">The request that the Bulgarian authorities made for Graham Sankey to attend court before he made any confession was received by the Home Office on 11&nbsp;July, but was not served by the UK central authority because insufficient time was given before the court hearing on 21&nbsp;and 22&nbsp;July. The normal period of notice required is six weeks. Yet, inconsistently, the Bulgarian courts rejected Michael Shield&#039;s defence request for an adjournment of the appeal hearing in October so that Graham Sankey could be questioned after he had made his confession. I understand that that refusal, and indeed inconsistency, could be material to a successful hearing in the European Court of Human Rights.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para16">
<a name="stpa_436">The third reason for an inquiry or retrial is because a new witness, Mr. A, has recently come forward and submitted a notarised and legalised statement. He was an eye witness to the incident. He does not know either Michael Shields or Graham Sankey. He reports that the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1213</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>man who dropped the stone on Martin Georgiev&#039;s head was short and dark. He is certain that it was not the fair-haired Michael Shields.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para17">
<a name="stpa_437">When Mr. A returned to the Big Ben bar the morning after the incident, he spoke to a bar worker who had witnessed the attack. The bar worker referred to the assailant as


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">&quot;a fat lad with black hair&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para18">
<a name="stpa_438">and stated that this could be corroborated by around 10&nbsp;people. Mr. A assumed that those witnesses would point out that Michael Shields, who is fair, was the wrong man. That is why he did not come forward as a witness at that time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para19">
<a name="stpa_439">However, those in the bar who witnessed who carried out this offence did not speak out. At the time of the attack, they saw a dark-haired man commit the offence. In court, they identified the fair-haired Michael Shields. Was this indeed a change of testimony, or was it about selecting witnesses to bolster the prosecution&#039;s case? When Mr. A later read about Graham Sankey&#039;s confession, he assumed that it would be accepted. That did not happen, which is why he has now come forward. Mr. A is ready to travel to Bulgaria to testify.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para20">
<a name="stpa_440">At this stage, neither Graham Sankey nor the new witness has been questioned about their statements. That means that no Bulgarian court has considered all the available evidence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para21">
<a name="stpa_441">This is a critical time for Bulgaria. On 25&nbsp;October, the European Commission published its enhanced monitoring assessment on whether Bulgaria should be permitted to join the European Union as planned in January 2007. I note that two of the five areas of concern identified by the Commission are &quot;justice&quot; and &quot;home affairs&quot;, with specific reference to the pre-trial phase. That is highly relevant to Michael Shields&#039;s situation for the reasons that I have set out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para22">
<a name="stpa_442">I ask the Government to object to Bulgaria&#039;s accession to the European Union. There are good grounds for doing so. The deep disquiet over the way Michael Shields&#039;s trial has been conducted relates to the very areas of concern identified by the Commission.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-36_para23">
<a name="stpa_443">This case concerns the life of a young man and that of his devastated family. It is about a potential gross injustice. The Shields family are strong and united. They have firm support in Liverpool, in the country and in Europe, where Arlene McCarthy, the Member of the European Parliament for the North West, is campaigning on Michael&#039;s behalf. The Shields family&#039;s campaign will continue until justice is done and I shall stand with them. I thank my right hon. Friend the Minister and the Foreign Secretary for meeting the Shields family when I brought them to the Foreign Office in September.

<a name="stpa_444">I thank the Minister and the Foreign Secretary for the assistance that they and their staff have given following the meeting in the Foreign Office and, indeed, before that. It has taken many forms and it is much appreciated, but more needs to be done as we address the complexities of a potential miscarriage of justice involving a British citizen imprisoned under another jurisdiction. I recognise that Ministers cannot interfere in the Bulgarian judicial process, but I ask them to exert their influence on the Bulgarian authorities and to urge them to conduct an inquiry, or to order a retrial, into what happened to Michael Shields. That influence is considerable and I have suggested how it might be exerted. It is a matter of justice.

<p><a name="st_275"><a name="51117-37_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Europe  (Mr. Douglas Alexander): </b> 
 I congratulate my hon.

I welcome the opportunity to set out our position clearly in relation to that case. I pay tribute to the tireless efforts that she has made and continues to make on behalf of Michael and the Shields family.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-37_para1">
<a name="stpa_445">Before concentrating on the specifics of the case, it is worth noting the close ties that the United Kingdom has with Bulgaria, which is soon to be a fellow member of the European Union. Every year, 200,000&nbsp;British visitors visit Bulgaria, enjoying the Black sea coastal resorts and the country&#039;s rich cultural heritage. The majority of those visits are trouble free for British visitors and it is important to recognise that the arrest of British nationals remains, I am thankful to say, a rare occurrence. The number of visitors is also set to rise with the increasing popularity of package holidays to the Bulgarian coastal resorts in summer and to the ski resorts in winter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_446">My hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_447">Our consular staff were informed on 30&nbsp;May of the arrest of Michael Shields and three other British nationals, Graham Sankey, Bradley Thompson and Anthony Wilson, following a stone-throwing incident in the Golden Sands resort in Varna, Bulgaria, in which a Bulgarian national was seriously injured. Our consular staff visited the detainees at the arrest ward of the investigation centre in Varna on 31&nbsp;May. None of the detainees complained about their treatment by the Bulgarian authorities. If they had done so, we would have raised those concerns immediately with the local authorities. Since their arrest, our staff have been present at key subsequent court appearances.

<a name="51117-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_448">As my hon. Friend is aware, the result of Mr. Shields&#039;s appeal was released on 9&nbsp;November. The judges ruled that Mr. Shields&#039;s conviction and sentence for attempted murder and hooliganism should stand, but agreed to a reduction of the civil claim amount to 120,000&nbsp;leva. I understand how disappointing this must be for Mr. Shields and his family. There remains the possibility of appeal to the Cassation Court and I understand that Mr. Shields, his family and his legal team are discussing appealing to that court. My hon. Friend will understand&#151;indeed, she confirmed as much this evening&#151;that Ministers cannot interfere in the legal process of another sovereign country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51117-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_449">My hon. Friend asked what the Foreign Office can do to persuade the Bulgarian authorities to interview Mr. Sankey and to examine the evidence of a new witness. I understand that, prior to his appeal, Mr. Shields&#039;s legal team lodged a separate application to the court that requested that the court call Graham Sankey as a witness. The Appeal Court judge dismissed that request, stating that Mr. Sankey had already been removed from the list of witnesses, with the agreement of the defence. Mr. Sankey&#039;s confession was raised at the original trial, but was considered insufficient to create doubts with the court about Mr. Shields&#039;s guilt. I understand that the court questioned the confession&#039;s relevance and credibility. As my hon. Friend is aware, we are unable to interfere in the judicial processes of other countries, just as other countries are unable to interfere in our judicial processes. We have been advised by the Bulgarian authorities that new evidence will be examined only if the Cassation Court rules that the case should be returned to the Court of First Instance. That is a matter for Mr. Shields&#039;s legal team to pursue.
