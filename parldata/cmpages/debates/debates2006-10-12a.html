Minister for Children and Families (Beverley Hughes):</b>
Ministerial colleagues and I have held a number of regular meetings
with representatives of the early-years and child care sector over the
past six months. They have enabled us to highlight the progress that we
are making, with the help of the sector, in delivering our commitments
in the 10-year child care strategy. Those commitments include
establishing, ahead of schedule, the 1,000th Sure Start
children&#146;s centre, as the Prime Minister announced last
week.</p><p><a name="06101241000033"><b><a name="_spnew2"><a name="06101241000790">Mr.

the Government does not meet their true
costs?</p><p><a name="06101241000034"><b><a name="06101241000791">Beverley
Hughes:</b> No, I do not share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
view about that. In fact, the unprecedented funding that the Government
have committed to our youngest children&#151;to early-years education
and child care&#151;has enabled the substantial growth in the private
and voluntary sector, which is contributing not only to full day care,
but to sessional care. Indeed, in his own area, in the 12 months up to
the end of 2005, the private and voluntary sector contribution to that
market share has risen from 74 to 78 per cent. for provision for
three-year-olds. As we continue to extend the free offer to all
families, I am sure that we will see that proportion grow, and that is
important to us because diversity in the sector is giving parents
choice and driving up
quality.</p><p><a name="06101241000035"><b><a name="_spnew3"><a name="06101241000792">Mr.

is also important, however, to view the issue in the context of the
much wider reforms that the Government are making in children&#146;s
services, particularly in children&#146;s centres and
children&#146;s trusts, as they are requiring all services to work to
together to identify at a much earlier stage the problems that children
have and to bring those services to bear around the child and the
family in an integrated way, so that their problems are addressed
comprehensively and early. That early intervention is very important
for children with special educational
needs.</p><p><a name="06101241000040"><b><a name="_spnew5"><a name="06101241000796">Richard
Ottaway (Croydon, South) (Con):</b> Can the Minister explain
why popular and high-quality nurseries are not allowed to charge top-up

south-east, where my constituency is located. The principle is
established in higher education; why not in nursery
education?</p><p><a name="06101241000041"><b><a name="06101241000797">Beverley
Hughes:</b> Because what we are
providing&#151;this is a real dividing line between the Government
and the Opposition&#151;is a free entitlement to all three and
four-year-olds for 12 and a half hours&#146; provision at the moment,
increasing, we hope, to 15 hours and beyond. The hon. Gentleman is
asking for that free entitlement to become a subsidy for better-off
parents. The private sector could then make higher charges and
better-off parents would be simply allowed to use that subsidy. We will
not entertain the prospect of discriminating against poorer families.
We will not allow the generation of a two-tier system, in which some
families can afford a better quality of care, but poorer families
cannot. This will remain a free entitlement for all
families&#151;</p><p><a name="06101241000042"><b><a name="_spnew6"><a name="06101241000798">Mr.

means.</p><p><a name="06101241000044"><b><a name="06101241000800">Beverley

it not only gives parents choice, but it also drives up quality
throughout the sector. I welcome the opportunity that my hon. Friend
has given me to correct some of the myths that are flying around. It is
still the case that private and voluntary settings provide 81 per cent.
of full day-care places. They provide 90 per cent. of sessional places.

sessional places. That is good; it is what we want to see. Public
sector provision is not driving private and voluntary sector providers
into the ground&#151;quite the opposite is true. The money that we
have put in has allowed that sector to grow, and that is very
important.</p><p><a name="06101241000045"><b><a name="_spnew8"><a name="06101241000801">Mrs.
Maria Miller (Basingstoke) (Con):</b> We have heard my hon.
Friends&#146; concerns about nursery funding in their constituencies
and I am sure that the Minister is aware of the facts. The dedicated
schools grant that local authorities receive to fund free nursery
places is under &#163;4 an hour. Is she aware that the National Day
Nurseries Association gives examples of where, throughout the country,
the cost of staffand overheads alone is nearer &#163;5 an
hour? Her transformation fund sets the hourly cost of child care at
almost &#163;6 an hour. Little wonder that a report from Camden

allocate the dedicated schools grant, both across the age ranges and
for early years, between the sectors. It is right that they have the
discretion to do that, because they take account of the market
situation and local circumstances. The Government have put an
unprecedented amount of money into early years: more than &#163;20

children&#146;s centre in Frankley in my constituency, which will be
a great asset to a very deprived part of the area, and also the
roll-out of the children&#146;s centre programme? However, I draw her
attention to the fact that it is important, as thereis
availability of capital, for there not to be an over-preoccupation with
the physical structures. The ethos of Sure Start&#151;bringing
together integrated services and ensuring real responsiveness to local
users&#151;is equally, if not more,
important.</p><p><a name="06101241000050"><b><a name="06101241000806">Beverley

the second phase of Sure Start children&#146;s centres
proceeds&#151;building on the 1,000 that are in place already and
moving to 2,500 over the next two years&#151;the issues that he
raises will be important. The key issue is the quality of services for
children, to improve their development, but there is also the
involvement of parents and the local community in the governance
arrangements. We know that by involving parents we are not only doing
the best for children, but we are helping those parents&#151;many in
disadvantaged situations&#151;to raise their confidence and, through
their involvement in children&#146;s centres, perhaps to acquire the
skills to get into training and work and to improve their quality of
life. That is what children&#146;s centres are doing throughout the
country. I am pleased that my hon. Friend will see further
children&#146;s centres in his area over the next two

particular, and physics has fallen. Will he assure the House that he
will attempt to address that problem, not by dumbing down the teaching
of science, as has been reported most recently, but by improving, for
example, the access to laboratories in schools and persuading young
people that there are worthwhile careers in science to be pursued? In
my area, for example, the aerospace industry finds it difficult to
recruit science graduates. Will he address that problem, rather than
trying to dumb down the

1997. In fact, UK universities produce two to three times more science
graduates than the OECD average. Our lead on that, overall, has
increased. In 2004-05, there was a higher than average increase of 10
per cent. or more in the number of students accepted to study subjects
such as maths, physics and chemistry. There is no question of our
dumbing down science. The new science GCSEs maintain the breadth, depth

engineers. If the Government were to decide to go ahead with new
nuclear power stations&#151;that will obviously be a matter for
debate in the House&#151;we would keep the need for additional
engineers under review. I might add that Cogent, which is the sector
skills council for the nuclear industry, has applied to establish a
national skills academy. We will consider that over the next few weeks
as a mechanism to ensure that there is an adequate supply of engineers
for the industry.</p><br>

instance, we can ensure that children succeed at level 4, that key
stage at which they leave primary school with the basics of English and
mathematics, everything else in their future education can be built on
that platform. All the evidence shows that that is the crucial stage.
We have moved from 63 per cent. of pupils reaching that stage in

schools, and the improvement of the quality of teaching and learning at
key stage 3, we expect more pupils to want to continue to learn
languages at GCSE and A-level. However, it will take time for the
effects of our strategy to be realised. I can announce to the House
that I have asked Lord Dearing to review our languages policy at key
stage 4 and to consider what more can be done to increase
take-up.</p><p><a name="06101241000132"><b><a name="06101241000883">Mr.
Stuart:</b> The Secretary of State may know that, in the past
year, only 2,854 pupils in the East Riding of Yorkshire took languages
at GCSE&#151;down from 3,471 in 1997. Only 98 students took an
A-level in languages in the East Riding of Yorkshire&#151;down from
181 in 1997. I sincerely hope that he will consider reviewing the
policy. Does he now regret the decision to remove languages as a
compulsory subject at GCSE three years ago? Will he do a proper
U-turn?</p><p><a name="06101241000133"><b><a name="06101241000884">Alan
Johnson:</b> No. The fundamental question is whether that
strategy was right. The hon. Gentleman is right that there has been a
drop, but there has also been an improvement in attainment by those
students who have continued to study languages. <i> [Interruption.]
</i>No, it is not marginal. In two years, pass rates are up 11 per
cent. in French and 9.7 per cent. in German.</p><p><a name="06101241000134">There is a
problem in this country: people who speak three languages are called
trilingual, people who speak two languages are called bilingual, and
those who speak one language are called English. We need to address
that problem. Our strategy to do so is for children to start learning
languages earlier&#151;at age seven&#151;and no longer to force
kids who are starting their GCSEs to study a language if they do not
wish to do so. We have no record of the Conservatives opposing that
strategy, and it could be key to solving the problem. We want languages
to flourish. Forcing 14 to 16-year-olds to learn a language will not
achieve that objective, but exciting children about languages at an
early age, and finding new and more inspiring ways of teaching
languages, will do
so.</p><p><a name="06101241000135">Lord
Dearing has been asked to look into this issue. He has a tremendous
track record and, if he says to us that this strategy is wrong and we
should go into reverse, we will listen to that advice; we will do that.
But Members in all parts of the House would have to be absolutely
convinced that that is the right thing to do, and so would Lord
Dearing, because the principles of those changes are right. I share the
deep disappointment about the drop that there has been; there has been
a decrease, not only in East Riding but across the country, of about
14.7 per cent. this year. That cannot be right, and we must do
something about it.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61012-0002.htm_wqn6"><a name="06101241000027">Primary

who are most detrimentally affected by large class sizes are those who
struggle most&#151;and, surely, they are the children whom we should
be helping. That was backed up by research in 2003 by the University of
London. There are 500,000 pupils in class sizes of more than 30. What
will the Government do to bring that figure down next year, so that the
most vulnerable pupils are cared
for?</p><p><a name="06101241000139"><b><a name="06101241000888">Jim

why we made such a priority of it back in 1997, and why we have made
such a difference by significantly reducing the numbers of those who
are taught in class sizes of more than 30. But we are not complacent.
There are circumstances in which, legally, the figure rises above
30&#151;due to a statement of special educational needs, for example,
with the stating of a school and that school being most appropriate.
But we are drafting guidance for local authorities and schools that
will help them to manage compliance with the infant class size ratio
more fully, because we want to continue the drive to ensure that the
student-teacher ratio, particularly in infant and primary schools, is
as low as
possible.</p>

The automatic granting of reflection periods and residence permits for
trafficking victims give rise to some concerns. We should remember that
trafficking victims might include not just those trafficked for the
purposes of prostitution, about whom we have heard a lot in the
newspapers recently. There are also those who come
here&#151;sometimes voluntarily&#151;for economic purposes who are
trafficked, in the sense that traffickers bring them in. A consultation

serious trafficking case to the Court of Appeal resulted in the
sentence being substantially increased, to23 years. The Court
of Appeal has thereby sent out a clear message that those caught
engaging in human trafficking need to be sentenced appropriately, which
means serious custodial sentences. We have recently seen a number of
those, following that reference to the Court of Appeal by the
Attorney-General.</p><p><a name="06101241000155">The

business of the House for the coming week. I start by congratulating
him on arranging for hon. Members to be able to table written questions
during the recess. However, may I also ask him whether he has assessed
the value of that exercise, in particular the impact on Government
accountability?</p><p><a name="06101241000177">During
the recess, the Modernisation Committee, which the Leader of the House
chairs, published a report on the legislative process. When does he
expect that any of the changes proposed might be considered by the
House and introduced? When does he expect to be able to publish the
calendar for the sittings of the House in the coming
year?</p><p><a name="06101241000178">Today is the
anniversary of the Bali bombing, where a number of British citizens
were among those who lost their lives. There is no system of
compensation for UK citizens who are the victims of terrorist attacks
abroad. Can we have a debate on that important
issue?</p><p><a name="06101241000179">Can
we also have a debate, or a statement from the Home Secretary, on the

my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire

<meta name="Date" content="12 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="12" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>12 Oct 2006 : Column 448</b><br>(Mr. Vara). He asked how many people have been arrested under
anti-terrorism legislation and how long they were kept before being
charged or released. The Leader of the House will realise that that is
crucial to the debate on the time for which people may be held without
charge and on 28 days versus 90
days.</p><p><a name="06101241000180">The
reply from the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety was
clear:</p><a name="brev_4"><a name="06101241000767"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Home Office does not collate information on the length of time an

other words, he does not have a clue. We know that the Home Office has
trouble with its figures, but surely when Ministers come to the House
to propose restrictions of our civil liberties, they ought to know the
facts.</p><p><a name="06101241000182">Talking
of Ministers knowing facts, on Tuesday the Defence Secretary made a
statement on Iraq and Afghanistan. My hon. Friend the Member for
Woodspring (Dr. Fox), referring to the Prime Minister&#146;s promise
that the troops in Afghanistan could have whatever resources they
needed, asked how many helicopters were available to go to Afghanistan.
The reply from the Defence Secretary was, again,
clear:</p><a name="brev_5"><a name="06101241000768"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;candidly, I do
not have the information to be able to

450, c. 179.]</p></ul><p><a name="06101241000183">Given that this is
a subject of much public debate, I would have thought that the Defence
Secretary would know how many helicopters we have. Can the Leader of
the House please ensure that Ministers are properly briefed before they
come to the House to make
statements?</p><p><a name="06101241000184">Today, in
figures published by the Healthcare Commission, we learn that more than
half the NHS bodies in England need to improve their quality of
service, and that nine out of 10 primary care trusts have been rated
only weak or fair. When will the Health Secretary make a statement to
the House on those
results?</p><p><a name="06101241000185">Will the
Health Secretary also come to the House and explain how much money has
been spent reorganising the NHS in the past 10 years? As Polly Toynbee,
whom I do not often quote, said of the Government in <i> The
Guardian</i>:</p><a name="brev_6"><a name="06101241000769"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;minister

new primary care groups, remade theminto primary care trusts,

health authorities, put in28 Strategic Health Authorities,
then merged them back down to the 10 original
regions&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06101241000186">Money has been
wasted on bureaucratic changes, and this House deserves an
explanation.</p><p><a name="06101241000187">On the
subject of wasting money, when will the Government put before the House
the money resolution needed to pay for the office of the Deputy Prime
Minister? Questions from my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden
(Mrs. Spelman) have shown that, while the Deputy Prime
Minister may not have ajob, he does have 18 staff and will
cost the taxpayer&#163;2 million a year. I would have said
that that was money for old rope, but I think that a piece of old rope
would be more useful than the Deputy Prime
Minister&#151;</p><br>

that the Leader of the House will have concern for the well-being of

11 weeks of the summer&#151;it was the right hon. Lady&#146;s
jokes. A serious gap was left in my enjoyment.</p><p><a name="06101241000192">I thank the
right hon. Lady for her congratulations on the introduction of recess
written questions. It seems that that was widely welcomed across the
House&#151;more than 100 Members asked 732 questions. We are
currently analysing those, including how many were, andhow
many were not, answered on time. In addition,35 written
ministerial statements were made. I am in no doubt that, if we keep to
the current recess arrangements, September questions are an important
element. I also say to my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South
(Mr. Mullin) that there will be an opportunity to debate the
issue of September sittings, and I intend that that should take place
before Prorogation in mid-November. That leads to the right hon.
Lady&#146;s second question about the Modernisation Committee
recommendations for changing the legislative process. I hope to make an
announcement about that shortly. Although I cannot absolutely guarantee
this at the moment, I hope that that will also be dealt with on the
same day before Prorogation.</p><p><a name="06101241000193">I have received many
representations about recess dates. As we have not made a decision
about September sittings, I cannot give all the recess dates. As I know
that that is causing difficulties on both sides of the House, I hope to
announce the immediate recess dates, for Christmas and the half-term
holiday in February, at business questions next Thursday.</p><p><a name="06101241000194">On the Bali bomb, I appreciate,
of course, that today is the anniversary, as I was Foreign Secretary
when I got the news of that terrible bombing. One Member of this House
had a much closer and most terrible experience of that bombing.
Consideration continues of the exact way in which we help victims of
terrorism, abroad as well as at home, but we have sought, not least in
consultation with the victims and relatives of victims of such terrible
events, to ensure that we improve the support that we give.</p><p><a name="06101241000195">On Home Office statistics, I
will look into the right hon. Lady&#146;s point, but I hope that she
does not then start going on about the problem of form-filling by
police officers, as forms are filled in by police officers to enable
statistics to be provided. I make that as a serious point. She cannot
have it both ways.</p><br>

statement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence
about the mat&#233;riel being provided in Afghanistan. He made it
clear that additional flying hours by helicopters, as well as by

that it is in the national interest for the exact number of helicopters
to be announced, but I will take that up with him.</p><p><a name="06101241000197">I am not
surprised that the right hon. Lady left the issue of the NHS until low

that it may be necessary for matters to pass between the two Houses
over the next few

the Leader of the House tell me, however, why we do not have a clear

seems to have disappeared without trace, the Charities Bill has
disappeared temporarily and nobody has yet seen the Wireless Telegraphy

Minister&#146;s questions, the hon. Member for Newport, East (Jessica
Morden) asked about maternity services, and she virtually declared her
interest at the time. In his reply, the Prime Minister mentioned
maternity pay and leave, but for some reason he omitted to mention
maternity hospitals, probably because they are being closed up and down
the country. Maternity services are being reorganised to suit the
bureaucracy rather than mothers. May we have a debate on the provision
of maternity services, because it is an important issue that affects
all
communities?</p><p><a name="06101241000207">I
welcome the statement by the Secretary of State for Defence, but we are
in the unique position of having two armies in the field at present,
one of which is facing probably the most severe fighting for a
generation. Is it not right that we should have an urgent debate on
matters relating to those servicemen who are fighting so bravely in the
field, such as military medical services, equipment, overstretch and
the position of reservists, who are often overlooked? We need more than
the routine defence debate. The debate should be targeted at the
soldiers, sailors and air personnel presently risking their lives in
the service of their
country.</p><p><a name="06101241000208">Finally,
the Leader of the House has already shown himself to be innovative, and
I hope that he will introduce another innovation. We will have the
Gracious Speech in a few weeks. Can he arrange to have ready in the
Vote Office on that day a clear and unambiguous list of the Bills that
the Government intend to introduce? The list should also present the
Bills&#146; subject matter in broad terms, and mention the
responsible Department. As things stand, armies of people have to try
to decipher what the Gracious Speech might mean, and that is nonsense.
We need a clear list of Bills on the day, so that we know what is to be
introduced. I acknowledge that other Bills may come later and that
plans may change, but such a list would be a service to the House and

Gentleman raised an important issue in respect of maternity services.
There used to be three maternity hospitals in the area that I and a
couple of colleagues represent. The two smaller ones were closed when
the Conservatives were in power, but we tried to ensure that public
concern was balanced by the promise that the services to be provided in
the main general hospital would be better. Although people had
affection for the old maternity units, we argued that it would be
better to concentrate the services. The key issue that hon. Members of
all parties must understand is that the nature of medical care has
changed, with mothers who have just delivered their babies spending
much less time in hospital. There is bound to be some reconfiguration,
but the important questions have to do with whether the services
provide effective care before, at the time of and after birth, and
whether ill babies are more likely to recover. According to those
indicators, the service is getting better and not worse.</p><p><a name="06101241000213">I shall discuss the matter of

university facilities have been expanded. The Open university&#146;s

then attract Government grant? However, since 2004, the priorities are
set on a regional basis by the East Anglia regional assembly&#151;a

successive Home Secretaries and Governments have talked about: a
balance between custodial and non-custodial sentences for non-violent
offenders, and ensuring&#151;this is necessary under any
Government&#151;that the available prison places are used sensibly
and the prisons are not full to bursting point. It certainly does not
lie in the mouth of any Opposition Member to start complaining about
the number of prison places now, because there are many, many thousands

Merron):</b> I beg to move, That this House insists on its
disagreement with the Lords in their amendments and proposes Government
amendments (a) and (b) in lieu
thereof.</p><p><a name="06101241000290">Commencing
with amendment No. 1, we simply do not believe that it would be
appropriate to impose a legal duty on all 140-odd licensed aerodromes
to impose noise-related and emissions charges. Such a move would be
disproportionate and would represent gross over-regulation. Many of the
aerodromes are relatively small in size and will cause little or no
significant disturbance or local air quality problems. Such a move
would be at odds with the Government&#146;s policy of not imposing
unnecessary regulation on business. On that we have been, and continue
to be, steadfastly
clear.</p><p><a name="06101241000291">I respectfully
point out to hon. Members that the proposal in the Lords amendments
would run contrary to guidance from the International Civil Aviation
Organisation that noise-related charges should be levied only at
airports experiencing noise problems. Airports have had a statutory
power to charge for aircraft by reference to their noise for some 25
years, but our policy on aircraft noise is that whenever possible,
local controls rather than Government diktat are the best way of
managing the local environmental impact of
aviation.</p><p><a name="06101241000292"><b><a name="_spnew91"><a name="06101241000989">Mr.
Alistair Carmichael (Orkney and Shetland) (LD):</b>
The Minister must accept that the movement of
aircraft noise over that period has been in one direction
only&#151;upwards&#151;and that that has caused many people living
around airports great inconvenience and discomfort. If we do not accept
this proposal, what should we do? It is clear that the status quo is
not
working.</p><p><a name="06101241000293"><b><a name="06101241000990">Gillian
Merron:</b> I note the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view, but the
question is whether the proposal deals with the point that he makes,
and I suggest that it does not. The Bill as a whole takes us forward.
Perhaps he will allow me to continue to outline how we can continue to
take forward aviation for all stakeholders, including local
communities.</p><p><a name="06101241000294">Such a
policy on the management of the local environmental impact of aviation
was underscored in &#147;The Future of Air Transport&#148; White
Paper. Many of our larger airports have regard to noise when setting
their charges. BAA already applies an emissions-related charge at
Heathrow and Gatwick by using the airports&#146; conditions of use.
However, it is important to put it beyond any doubt that any licensed
aerodrome has the power to set such charges if their local
circumstances make that necessary. That is the purpose of clause
1.</p><br>

Simpson (Nottingham, South) (Lab):</b> Will the Minister
explain how we get around the conundrum that was raised in another
place about the contrast between Birmingham and Coventry? She says that
an airport can raise charges when there is a problem, but if it has no
duty to monitor, how will it recognise that there is a problem? If
there is no duty to monitor and a duty to charge, how do we impose the
same constraints on an airport such as Coventry as those that apply to
the designated

uniform requirement that an airport&#146;s charges must be set by
reference to noise and emissions would undercut an airport&#146;s
ability to reflect its local circumstances. I emphasise that we are
considering not whether airports should be able to do that, but whether
we should require them all to do so in exactly the same way. Charges
are not the only lever&#151;or even, in the case of aircraft noise,
the most significant one&#151;that we will expect airport operators
to use to address the impact of their operations on local people. I
emphasise to hon. Members that clauses 3 and 4 will do far more than
that to drive improvements in the noise climate around airports. They
will enable airport operators to impose penalties for breaches of the
noise control measures that they have in place, such as noise limits on
departing aircraft and noise-preferential routes. The revenue raised
from the penalties will have to be put towards purposes that are of
benefit to the wider community around the
airport.</p><p><a name="06101241000298"><b><a name="06101241000993">David

unfortunately named&#151;designated under the Civil Aviation Act
1982. She and her predecessors have declined so to do and have fallen
back on the suggestion that local agreement will resolve the problems.
However, East Midlands airport&#146;s 10-point plan has been imposed
on local communities, and they rejected it several months ago at the
independent consulting committee by 15 votes to one. What options do
those communities have, unless we can require regional airports with a
larger number of night-time flights than Heathrow to impose charges to
reflect quota counts and noisy aircraft? Why can we not make that
compulsory? The local agreement is not
working.</p><p><a name="06101241000299"><b><a name="06101241000994">Gillian

worries about local noise that my hon. Friend and others have
expressed, it is believed that the airport is fully committed to
responding effectively. Several changes have taken place over the
years. It is not necessarily the case that designation delivers fewer
night flights or tougher controls. Additionally, NEMA has indicated
that it wishes to take advantage of the powers in the Bill by taking
tougher local action to protect the noise environment. The draft master

do the words precisely mean in the context of Nottingham East Midlands
airport, which allows aircraft to fly in and out that affect my

words. I am about to move on to the reference to the consideration of

that today&#146;s debate does not address his concern. We all know
the intention of what we are talking
about.</p><p><a name="06101241000304">A further
reason why we do not accept that a blanket duty on airports is right is
that the Secretary of State will be able to require an airport to fix
its charges in a way that takes account of its local environmental
impact. Existing section 38 of the 1982 Act gives the Secretary of
State the power to direct specified aerodromes to make use of the
charging power with regard to noise. That power, which will be extended
to include charging by reference to emissions, is detailed in
subsection (4) of proposed new section 38 of the 1982 Act. The power
would be used if the introduction of noise and emissions-related
charges at an airport seemed to be appropriate, yet the airport
operator was unwilling to do that. I hope that that addresses the point
made by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan
Simpson).</p><p><a name="06101241000305"><b><a name="_spnew94"><a name="06101241000997">Mr.

accurately said that it wishes to do so&#151;would it remain within
the Secretary of State&#146;s discretion to say that the charges
specified were inadequate and to specify other charges that met the
objectives of local residents concerned about noise intrusion? Does the
point merely relate to the principle and methodology of establishing a
charging structure, or does it go on to say whether those charges are
adequate for the
purpose?</p><p><a name="06101241000306"><b><a name="06101241000998">Gillian

intention in moving the amendment is to acknowledge the concern of some
stakeholders that the clause does not take sufficient account of the
impact of aircraft noise on people living near airports. By giving the
Secretary of State a duty to consider that when deciding whether to use
his power of direction, we are providing an additional safeguard for
the interests of the local community around an airport.</p><p><a name="06101241000308">Amendment (b)
is a minor, consequential amendment which will ensure that this new
provision, like the power of direction to which it relates, is devolved
to the Scottish Ministers. Lords amendments Nos. 2 and 4 would affect
the way in which noise and emission charges are set.</p><p><a name="06101241000309">We agree that
airport operators should set noise charges that are proportionate.
However, International Civil Aviation Organisation guidance already
states that noise-related charges should be non-discriminatory between

aircraft.</p><p><a name="06101241000310"><b><a name="06101241000999">Justine
Greening (Putney) (Con):</b> Is the Minister aware of the
extent to which noise measurement goes on? In my constituency BAA
carries out no measurement of the noise impact of Heathrow. Rather than
talking about an area that the airport needs to have regard to, the
Government may need to be a little more specific about how large that
area should be and take account of the glide path of planes as they
come in to
land.</p><p><a name="06101241000311"><b><a name="06101241001000">Gillian

contribute to internationally recognised
standards.</p><p><a name="06101241000312">As I have
already remarked, airports have been making use of the power to set
noise-related charges for almost a quarter of a century. There has been
no suggestion that the powers have been applied inappropriately or
disproportionately during that time. We can see no justification for
adding to clause 1 the requirement in the Lords amendments. Hon.
Members who have expressed concerns should be in no doubt that should
there ever appear to be a problem with the charging scheme, the
Secretary of State will have the power to direct an airport operator as
to the manner in which its charges are to be
fixed.</p><p><a name="06101241000313">I ask the House

those tonight, NEMA has for many years been charging on the basis of
noise.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_4"><a name="06101241000784">12.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06101241000318"><b><a name="_spnew96"><a name="06101241001002">Mr.
Todd:</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct: NEMA has
levied such charges for some time. I questioned the Minister because
those charges have not produced the effects that many people would
desire. The key element, therefore, is whether a Minister might
intervene and say that a particular charging structure was inadequate
for the purpose defined and set out criteria for determining
appropriate
charges.</p><p><a name="06101241000319"><b><a name="_spnew97"><a name="06101241001003">Mr.
Brazier:</b> Indeed, and as the hon. Gentleman knows, the
Government have made a very small concession in that direction. I shall
come to that in a
moment.</p><p><a name="06101241000320">All this Bill
does, in plain English, is confirm powers on noise and emissions that
airports have exercised for many
years.</p><p><a name="06101241000321"><b><a name="06101241001004">David
Taylor:</b> I do not know whether the use of the term
&#147;plain English&#148; was an attempted pun, but we will leave
that aside. When the hon. Gentleman meets airport management this
evening he will hear about noise-preferential routes and track
monitoring, and those initiatives are to be welcomed. The airport has
attempted to establish a framework whereby noise problems can be
adequately measured and penalties, wherever possible, imposed. But will
he be checking on the scale of the noise encountered by people in the
vicinity and the level of fines collected in recent years? If he does,
he will be able to set everything in
context.</p><p><a name="06101241000322"><b><a name="06101241001005">Mr.
Brazier:</b> I assured the hon. Gentleman of
that when I contacted him about my visit to his constituency, and I do
so again.</p><p><a name="06101241000323">Where has the
Government&#146;s policy, without the extra measures proposed by the
Lords amendments, got us? They have finally admitted that they are not
going to reach the target of reducing emissions by 20 per cent. by
2010, as we all knew. The Conservatives reduced CO2
emissions by 7 per cent. in their last seven years in office, but
emissions are higher now than they were in 1997. The Environmental
Audit Committee described Ministers as being &#147;superficial and
vague&#148; about the environmental damage done by the
Government&#146;s aviation policy.</p><br>

summarised the purpose of the 2003 White Paper as
follows:</p><a name="brev_15"><a name="06101241000778"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we have to
balance those benefits against the serious environmental impact of air
travel, particularly the growing contribution of aircraft emissions to
climate change, and the significant impact that airports can have on
those living nearby. That is why the Government remain committed that,
over time, aviation meets the external costs that it
imposes&#148;.&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 16 December 2003; Vol.
000, c. 1433.]</p></ul><p><a name="06101241000325">In that statement
we have a perfect example of what the Select Committee meant when it
referred to Ministers as being &#147;superficial and vague&#148;.
This Bill is a continuation of that policy&#151;it is
empty.</p><p><a name="06101241000326">The
point is that compelling airports to make charges in relation to noise
and emissions would also make compulsory the purposes for which those
changes were introduced&#151;reducing noise and emissions and
encouraging the take-up of more environmentally efficient aircraft.
That would speed up a process that is already taking
place.</p><p><a name="06101241000327">The
Government are being disingenuous with both the public and the
airlines. In suggesting that there was no need for compulsion, the
Minister&#146;s predecessor
said:</p><a name="brev_16"><a name="06101241000779"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I
am confident that airports will, again, make use of these provisions
when appropriate, with no need for compulsion from the
Government&#148;.&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 8 May 2006; Vol.
446, c. 41.]</p></ul><p><a name="06101241000328">Much the same has
been said today. Well, airports may well continue to do that. Some are
doing so&#151;after all, it is free money&#151;but some are not. As
the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) pointed
out, charging carries no obligation for airports to monitor noise or
emissions. There is no obligation to set targets, or to create and
maintain any logical sliding scale to reward airlines for success. In
fact, there is no obligation to measure, let alone report on,
progress.</p><p><a name="06101241000329">What
proof is there that those charges have delivered any benefit since they
started? We cannot tell whether they are working, as there is not even
a requirement to provide statistics. All that the Bill will do, without
amendment to beef it up&#151;and the amendments before us are all
that there is on the table&#151;is provide a bit of cover for the
airports in case lawyers from airlines make trouble for
them.</p><p><a name="06101241000330">The
Government have made what amounts to a very small concession, which the
Minister has explained. It requires the Secretary of State, should he
use his powers under subsection (4), to consider the interests of
people who live in the area of the aerodrome. If he were considering
finally getting on with it and doing something, it is difficult to
conceive of any circumstances in which he would not consider them in
that context. The phrase &#147;among other things&#148; in the
Government amendment makes a pretty worthless amendment even vaguer.
However, it does at least leave open the possibility that a future
Secretary of State might listen to the concerns of local
people&#151;and not just those living around airports; we should
remember that flight paths extend a long
way.</p><p><a name="06101241000331">The Bill has
ping-ponged between the Lords and the Commons several times. It is
difficult to know how what advice to give, because although hon.
Members on both sides of the House agree that the Lords amendment is
flawed&#151;no one wants to impose such a measure on every small
airport in the country&#151;the

conversion to light-touch regulation for small airports&#151;and,
indeed, the apparent conversion of her Department. I would have been
even more delighted if that had happened three years ago when I argued
for exactly that approach to Tingwall airport in Shetland in my
constituency, but at the time the Government argued that we could not
be given different treatment because the airport was small, and it had
to be treated exactly like every other airport in the country. If it is
a genuine conversion I am delighted to welcome it, but if, as I fear,
it is a conversion for the purposes of today&#146;s debate, I have
some difficulty accepting it at face
value.</p><p><a name="06101241000334">On
the application of the measure to small airports&#151;a subject near
and dear to my heart, as I spend most of my life sitting in them
waiting for planes to take off&#151;I would have thought that if
charges are to be set with regard to noise and emission, the charge
would be zero at a small airport where no or &#147;de minimis&#148;
noise and emissions were caused by air traffic. That would not be a
particularly difficult calculation to make. That said, the hon. Member
for Canterbury says that the amendment is less than perfect, and I
accept that there is some force to that. Knowing the electoral
arithmetic of the House, the measure will inevitably go back to the
other place. Before that takes place, there may be scope for
discussion, and I hope that that discussion takes place, because I
really do not want to revisit the matter in the Chamber in the next
four
weeks.</p><p><a name="06101241000335">The
question is whether what is proposed by the Government is better than
what is in the Bill as presented to us by the other place. I find no
suggestion that what the Government offer us is better than what the
other place has sent them, flawed though it is. The simple fact is that
in seeking to maintain the status quo, the Government do not answer any
questions about what happens in situations such as that of Coventry and
Birmingham, which has been mentioned. Coventry airport does not enforce
noise and pollution controls in the way set out in the Bill, but
Birmingham International airport does. I am told that as a result, many
of the planes landing at Coventry airport are older, noisier and more
polluting aircraft. That is not acceptable, and we ought to do
something in the Bill to sort it. The Government refuse, and frankly I
do not understand
why.</p><p><a name="06101241000336"><b><a name="06101241001007">David
Taylor:</b> Of course the amendments are flawed, and we do not
want to impose unwarranted burdens on tiny airports. Nevertheless,
certain points need to be made. The larger airports must be weaned off
their apparent insistence on unlimited or lightly restricted night
flights and their continuing acceptance of old, polluting aircraft.
Certainly, BAA&#146;s comments suggest that environmental and social
costs should be simply
dismissed:</p><a name="brev_17"><a name="06101241000780"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Like

heritage, road congestion&#151;are fully internalised within the
development and operating costs of aviation through the planning
system.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101241000337">That
demonstrates how lightly regional and national airports treat the
proposals in the legislation that the Minister has introduced today.
Such costs are not internalised in the planning system. If they were,
there would not be so much concern about making the measure before us.
The ability to create the ability to utilise noise profiles in a
charging system must be compulsory.</p><p><a name="06101241000338">It is a
recognised fact that there is damage to health from air pollution.
Nitrogen dioxide levels are a particular concern around airports, and
the Government measure acceptability against EU mandatory levels for
nitrogen dioxide and other pollutants. However, adverse health impacts
occur at well below those high levels. If Heathrow airport expanded,
the resulting extra road traffic would result in air quality standards
being breached. The Department for Transport&#146;s model shows that
very high road charges would be needed to keep traffic levels down to
protect people&#146;s health. Let us act before that, so that we can
avoid or head off that
problem.</p><p><a name="06101241000339">Noise
pollution is associated with damage to people&#146;s health and their
quality of life. Loud and persistent noise affects health, particularly
at night. It affects children&#146;s and adults&#146;
concentration, deprives people of sleep and adds to stress. A
Department for Transport consultation on night flights in 2003 found
that more than 750,000 people were exposed to an average noise level of
55 dB or more over 24 hours, and 250,000 people were exposed to an
average noise level of 48 dB or more at night. Noise levels at Heathrow
are predicted to increase, which is why, even though the Bill is
flawed, we ought to incorporate a requirement on airports.</p><p><a name="06101241000340">If we are unwilling to
designate levels under the Civil Aviation Act 1982&#151;the Minister
has stated, perfectly properly, why she agrees with her predecessors
about that&#151;and if we fall back on the mantra that local
agreement is best when there are planning or environmental problems
associated with an airport, what will happen when local agreement
breaks down? At Nottingham East Midlands airport, it has broken
down&#151;a 10-point plan imposed by the airport has been rejected by
the independent consultative committee&#151;and now we are in limbo
without an environmental framework, which is quite
unsatisfying.</p><p><a name="06101241000341"><b><a name="06101241001008">Mr.
Garnier:</b> What faith does the hon. Gentleman have in any
local agreement being arrived at in our area, when the airport in
question has neutered the independent consultative
committee?</p><p><a name="06101241000342"><b><a name="06101241001009">David

will be well aware that the independent consultative committee on NEMA
has recently been restructured in ways that have not met with approval
from three of the four groups represented in that organisation. I
wonder whether the independent consultative committee is being taken
seriously by the airport or by the Government. They argue vigorously
that local agreement is all and say, &#147;Let&#146;s not impose
anything top down. Let&#146;s not use the big stick of airport
designation. Let local people sort it out through that
mechanism,&#148; but there is not a great deal of evidence that that
is happening.</p><br>

charging for night flights above a certain volume is necessary, because
the airport seems unwilling to make much progress in tackling the
difficulties associated with its recent rapid growth&#151;300,000
tonnes of freight and dedicated freight aircraft. It is the largest
airport in the country in that
respect.</p><p><a name="06101241000344">I recognise
what the Minister says about designation, but let us have some
compulsion in the penalty system that is needed to curb night flights

behalf of the cross-party alliance of Members of Parliament from
Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire&#151;the hon. Member

different geographical perspectives, all of us have plenty to say that
is not hugely favourable to the way in which the management of
Nottingham East Midlands airport has treated its
neighbours.</p><p><a name="06101241000346">As I have
said in the House on a number of occasions, I as a Conservative Member
of Parliament am entirely satisfied that the Manchester Airport Group,
which wholly owns the airport in my county, Leicestershire, is entitled
to make a profit, to carry out its business and to do what it can to
improve the facilities and other activities that go on at its airport,
be it the reception and dispatch of aeroplanes or turning itself into a
retail park. However, if Nottingham East Midlands airport is to have
any local credibility, it should behave as a responsible
neighbour.</p><p><a name="06101241000347">That
brings me back to the question to which I did not get an answer when I
intervened on the Under-Secretary: what do we mean by neighbour? In the
language of the Bill&#151;I am sure all hon. Members agree that we
must be entitled to seek precision in the language of a Bill&#151;we
are creating a regime that will allow private enterprises to impose
penalties on commercial operators. In the making of the law, it behoves
us to be precise in what we mean. In her remarks this afternoon the
Minister used the expression &#147;locality&#148;, the original
Bill uses the expression &#147;vicinity&#148;, and the Secretary of
State&#146;s amendment in lieu uses the expression
&#147;area&#148;. I am hugely concerned that because the Government
are in thrall to the aircraft industry and the airport industry, they
will provide no more than a hollow Bill, as my hon. Friend the Member

a set of words that will achieve nothing to make sure that airports

went there in August, I was told that it was not possible to extract
air speeds from the machinery that monitors incoming aircraft. The
aircraft are delivered by the national air traffic system from the
Welwyn sector into the sector that is controlled by Nottingham East
Midlands air traffic control system. We were told that the continuous
descent method over my constituency and south-east Leicestershire would
ensure quieter descents across my constituency. We were told that
aircraft do not travel at more than 250 knots as they come into
Nottingham East Midlands air traffic system.</p><p><a name="06101241000350">I now have
the radar details, which tell me that, by and large, aircraft are
moving into the area at speeds in excess of 250 knots, and in order to
cover the distance in a safe way, land and stop travelling by the end
of the runway, they have to apply the air brakes, the full thrust and
so on. The noise over my constituency is enormous, relative to the
ambient noise in the area. The Government, the airport, its owners in
Manchester, the Civil Aviation Authority and the airline operators care
nothing about my constituents and their quiet
enjoyment.</p><p><a name="06101241000351">I
have said many times to various Ministers, various officers of
Nottingham East Midlands airport and others who were prepared to listen
that nothing is done about it. The latest amendment adds still further
imprecision to the wording of the Bill. I am becoming increasingly
frustrated about the good will of the Government to do anything to look
after the people who live in this country. The Government are concerned
only to placate the airline and the airport industries. I know that
that is probably unfair, but it is the only inference I can draw from
the evidence I have seen, from the conduct of the passage of the Bill
and the people who appear to have influence on the
Government.</p><p><a name="06101241000352">I shall
stop now, as I know that the hon. Member for South Derbyshire wishes to

residents object to the charges that an airport chooses to levy because
they regard them as inadequate for the purpose&#151;they do not, for
example, think that the charges clamp down hard enough on the huge
Antonovs that thunder out from the airport and want the charges
raised.</p><p><a name="06101241000354">Presumably,
under the amendment, the Secretary of State must find a way of
determining whether to exercise his or her powers to vary those charges
or suggest that they might be wrong. He or she will have to decide how
to consult on the &#147;interests&#148;&#151;I quote the
amendment&#151;of the local community. It is difficult to know what
those interests might be. They might be the employment interests of
local people, or their concern about noise or about environmental
pollution of other kinds. They might have a wide range of concerns
about the airport.</p><br>

whether to direct an airport over fixing its charge. We would keep the
process and the criteria under review, and we would need to pay
attention to local
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06101241000371">In
summary, I remind hon. Members that airports have had the power to
charge for aircraft by reference to their noise for some 25 years
without any need for the Government to intervene, and many larger
airports already do so. Clause 1 is important, because it extends that
power to allow charges to be related to aircraft emissions that affect
air
quality.</p><p><a name="06101241000372"><b><a name="06101241001017">Mr.
Charles Walker (Broxbourne) (Con):</b> On a point of order,
Mr. Deputy Speaker. The second set of Lords amendments,
which concerns Stansted and Heathrow airports, is hugely important to
people in the east and the south-east. Will the Minister crack on and
allow us at least 10 minutes to debate it?</p><br>

includes powers that allow the Government to require an airport to
charge aircraft by reference to noise, if they think that that will
help to deal with the airport&#146;s environmental impact. It
explicitly requires Ministers to have regard to the interests of people
who live near the airport in deciding whether and how to use those
powers. Clause 1 is not the be all and end all&#151;it is just one
tool to deal with an airport&#146;s environmental impact. As I have
noted, other provisions in the Bill&#151;in particular, clauses 3 and
4&#151;and the existing legislation are also relevant.</p><p><a name="06101241000378">In conclusion, if there is ever

Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (David
Miliband):</b> I am delighted to have the opportunity to open
this debate. Climate change is not just an environmental issue, but an
economic issue, a social issue, and a security issue. It is local,
national and international, and it will affect all of us, as well as
all of our children, so it is right that it is now high on the agenda
of all three main political
parties.</p><p><a name="06101246000327">In setting
the scene for the debate, I shall review the science, the international
position, and Britain&#146;s response. The polls show that 93 per
cent. of people are now aware of climate change. I am sure that many
people think that it is a funny old world when Al Gore is making movies
and Arnold Schwarzenegger is making policy, but both men are now making
a major contribution to a worldwide awakening on this
issue.</p><p><a name="06101246000328">The facts are
more alarming, and the need for action more urgent, than previously
thought. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are now higher than at any
time for at least the last 740,000 years. That is resulting in an
unprecedented rise in temperature at the earth&#146;s surface:
globally, 10 of the warmest years since 1850 have occurred since 1990,
and in the UK, spring is now arriving on average 10 days earlier than
it was 30 years ago. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Yes, under a Labour
Government; I know that the weather is always better under Labour, but
that was not the point I was seeking to
make.</p><p><a name="06101246000329">The rise in
temperature could push many of the great ecosystems of the world into
irreversible decline, with massive economic and social costs. Two
thirds of the world&#146;s population live within 80 km of the coast,
and up to 80 million people&#146;s homes could be flooded each year
in coastal regions by the end of the century. As the latest issue of
<i> Scientific American</i> puts it, the debate on global warming is
over. Preventing the transformation of the earth&#146;s atmosphere
from temperate greenhouse to unconstrained hothouse represents arguably
the most imposing scientific and technical challenge that humanity has
ever
faced.</p><p><a name="06101246000330"><b><a name="_spnew102"><a name="06101246000945">Mr.
John Redwood (Wokingham) (Con):</b> Even if
Britain is miraculously good at controlling its carbon emissions, the
fact is that we are not going to control the world&#146;s carbon
emissions. As that is the reality, should we not turn our prime
attention to how we protect our coastal and low-lying areas with sea
defences?</p><p><a name="06101246000331"><b><a name="06101246000946">David

our sea defences, but many people will ask why the right hon. Gentleman

years, which has happened under this Government. Secondly, his point

defences?</p><p><a name="06101246000333"><b><a name="06101246000948">David
Miliband:</b> The capital budget in respect of flooding has
been protected, despite the difficulties that the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has in respect of that budget, and
I make no apologies for protecting that capital budget. It is true that
some of the annual recurrent expenditure for the Environment Agency has
had to be cut, and I make no apology for saying that DEFRA will live
within its means: when accountancy changes or avian flu or difficulties
with the Rural Payments Agency arise, we will live within our means and
we will not duck the difficult choices. However, we have protected the
capital element of the floods budget and it was right to do
so.</p><p><a name="06101246000334"><b><a name="_spnew104"><a name="06101246000949">Chris

minutes, on fruitless votes that have got us absolutely
nowhere.</p><p><a name="06101246000336"><b><a name="06101246000951">Mr.
Charles Walker (Broxbourne) (Con):</b> This
Conservative recognises the importance of saving the global environment
for everyone, but I am also concerned about our river and stream
environments, which have been under huge stress over the past 20 years
and under successive Governments. Every year, hundreds of miles of
rivers and streams dry out. Can we act locally, as well, and try to
encourage water companies and the Environment Agency to get together to
ensure that these environments are preserved? If we cannot do that
locally, how on earth can we reduce greenhouse gases globally? It will
be an impossibility.</p><p><a name="06101246000337"><b><a name="06101246000952">David
Miliband:</b> We should certainly do what
the hon. Gentleman says, but I am surprised that he did not point out
that we have the cleanest rivers and streams since the industrial
revolution, thanks to the efforts made by some of the agencies that he
mentioned. But he is absolutely right to say that this is an important
issue.</p><p><a name="06101246000338"><b><a name="06101246000953">Justine
Greening (Putney) (Con):</b> Is the
Secretary of State aware that some 40 million to 50 million litres of
untreated sewage goes into the Thames every year? Indeed, I have just
received an answer to a parliamentary written question on that very
issue. Does he not agree that keeping our core rivers clean is
incredibly important, and that Thames Water&#146;s tideway proposal
would solve a lot of these problems?</p><p><a name="06101246000339"><b><a name="06101246000954">David

waterways, will the Secretary of State confirm that, owing to cuts in
the DEFRA budget, British Waterways is in the process of making 180
people
redundant?</p><p><a name="06101246000341"><b><a name="06101246000956">David

the figure of 180&#151;I assume that that is where the hon. Gentleman
has taken it from&#151;although I have not been able to confirm it.
British Waterways&#146; budget, which has gone up to &#163;190
million during this year, has, I think, risen three or fourfold in the
past seven or eight years. It has had to bear some of the brunt of the

Challen:</b> I am very grateful for that
little bit of praise; I hope that it is deserved. I was hoping to get
us back on to climate change because, although it is very good that
politicians keep their noses to the ground, this subject is rather
bigger than British Waterways. Is my right hon. Friend going to review
our 2050 target of a 60 per cent. cut in emissions in the light of the
Exeter conference and of the most recent report by the Tyndall centre,
which shows that, if our current transport appetite continues, we will
have to reduce emissions by 70 per cent. by 2030 and by 90 per cent. by
2050?</p><p><a name="06101246000348"><b><a name="06101246000963">David
Miliband:</b> I will deal with these issues,
but I always say that we must try to achieve at least a 60 per cent.
reduction in our carbon dioxide emissions, compared with 1990 levels,
by 2050. There is always a danger in changing an ambitious target that
has a widespread degree of buy-in and consensus. The CBI, voluntary
organisations and, I think, the Opposition parties recognise the power
of that 60 per cent. target, so I am slightly loth to start changing it
too soon. But I recognise the value of the point that my hon. Friend
makes.</p><p><a name="06101246000349">When the Prime
Minister launched the British presidency of the G8 last year and put
climate change, along with Africa, at the top of the agenda, he set out
a three-stage process: getting agreement on the science, promoting a
debate about stabilisation, and developing agreement on a long-term
international framework. Let me address stabilisation, which is an
important issue.</p><br>

<meta name="Date" content="12 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="12" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>12 Oct 2006 : Column 488</b><br><p><a name="06101246000350">The 1992 UN
framework convention on climate change was signed not just by those
Kyoto countries that are signatories to the protocol, but by 189
countries, including the United States, Australia and Canada. The
convention urges its signatories to stabilise greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent
dangerous human interference with the climate system.</p><p><a name="06101246000351">The latest science shows that
atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased by more than a
third since about 1750&#151;from about 280 to 380 parts per million.
The level of greenhouse gases, in CO2 equivalent
concentration, is about 430 parts per million. Atmospheric CO2
levels, or equivalent, are rising at more than 2 parts per
million per year. Without further action, CO2 emissions in
2050 are predicted to rise by 50 per cent. More immediately, within 10
years we will reach the 450 parts per million figure that many
scientists believe would represent a shift from the balance of
probability being against dangerous climate change toward its being in
its favour.</p><p><a name="06101246000352">In other
words, the window of opportunity for staying within a 450 to 550 parts
per million range is closing. The costs of mitigation rise sharply for
stabilisation below this range, and for adaptation the costs rise
sharply beyond the upper limit of that range. I have not read
today&#146;s report from Shell, but it speaks to this issue. The
Stern Review, which will be concluded in the next few weeks, represents
the most comprehensive work ever undertaken in the field of climate
change economics. Preliminary findings were presented in Mexico last
week to the second meeting of the Gleneagles dialogue, which I attended
along with the Minister for Energy, my hon. Friend the Member for
Croydon, North (Malcolm Wicks), and my right hon. Friend the Foreign
Secretary.</p><p><a name="06101246000353">The
evidence is clear: the cost of tackling climate change will be far less
than the cost of dealing with the consequences. We have the technology
to meet the challenge. Picking up on the point made earlier by the
right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), we must find
ways of getting investment across the globe in moving to a low carbon
economy. That means working to develop an international framework that
can secure global co-operation, plus effective domestic and European
action.</p><p><a name="06101246000354">The 1992 UN
convention used the language of &#147;common but differentiated
responsibilities&#148; for all 189 signatories. Let me dwell on this
for a moment. &#147;Common&#148; responsibilities means that all
countries have to play a part. &#147;Differentiated&#148;
responsibilities means that the greatest burden must be borne by those
with the greatest ability to lead. The danger is that developing
countries say that they will not play their part because the
industrialised world is not promising to play its part; meanwhile,
developed economies refuse to move because they suspect that developing
countries will not take the action
necessary.</p><p><a name="06101246000355">The
Government&#146;s strategy to break this logjam is as follows. First,
in Mexico last week we presented compelling new evidence on the
economics, and I think that Ministers from all the 17 countries that
attended left Mexico realising that &#147;business as usual&#148;
is not an option. Secondly, we pursue bilateral agreements with key
countries to deliver change on the ground now. On Tuesday, my right
hon. Friend the Prime Minister and

are proud to see the European Union as a big part of the answer to the

Miliband:</b> I do not want to intrude on the private grief
that has caused a divorce between the two main Opposition parties and
broken the consensus that we were told would exist between them; they
have now sundered all co-operation. But I am happy to be an
intermediary for messages from the hon. Gentleman to the Conservatives,
and to relay to them his concern that they should wake up, smell the
coffee and realise that the European Union is part of the solution, not
the problem.</p><p><a name="06101246000361">As I was
saying, the climate change problem crosses borders and requires
international action. The Government will continue to press for a
strong and integrated European response to climate change. I can report
to the House that the European Commission action plan on energy
efficiency will be launchednext week. The sustainability
pillar of the Lisbon competitiveness strategy needs to be strengthened,
and the British Government will argue for that. Common agricultural
policy reform must continue to emphasise the need to improve the net
environmental benefits of farming. The extension of the EU emissions
trading scheme needs to be taken forward later this year, and of
course, the EU needs to continue to negotiate at international level
for us, starting in Nairobi next
month.</p><p><a name="06101246000362"><b><a name="06101246000968">Mrs.

out the strategy that the Government are pursuing to ensure that the
international agenda is followed. The fourth point is that we must take
a lead in developing the clear and tangible targets from all developed
countries that are necessary to kick-start the drive towards a global
agreement on climate change. For countries such as the United Kingdom,
that means achieving at least the 60 per cent. target to which we are
committed. For the European Union, it means exploring with other
parties reduction pathways in the order of 15 to 30 per cent. by 2020,
and 60 to 80 per cent. by
2050.</p><p><a name="06101246000369"><b><a name="_spnew107"><a name="06101246000974">Dr.

to move on.</p><p><a name="06101246000371">As well
as those four measures, we need a fifth, which I believe will receive
common support across the House. We must support the most vulnerable
developing countries in adapting to the unavoidable effects of climate
change now. As the UN meeting in Nairobi sets out on the task of
developing a new global framework on climate change, we must help
developing countries, especially in Africa, to cope with climate change
today. I take heart from the comments that were made on this issue in
Mexico last week. I also commend the White Paper of my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for International Development, which has
sustainability as a theme running right through it, rather than simply
a chapter on the subject.
</p><p><a name="06101246000372">Climate change is a
global problem that requires global leadership, but our strength
internationally relies on our commitment at home. We are one of the few
countries on course to achieve its Kyoto protocol target. Our
greenhouse gas emissions could fall to around 23 per cent. below 1990
levels by 2010, which represents nearly double our target of a 12.5 per
cent. reduction. But we need to go further, not least in respect of
carbon dioxide itself.</p><br>

year, we have taken significant steps towards strengthening our
domestic programme on climate change. First, the measures set out in
our climate change programme review are projected to deliver 12 million
tonnes of carbon savings within the next four years. This includes
savings from the second phase of the European Union emissions trading
scheme. That might sound like a technical matter, but it accounts for
nearly half of all carbon emissions in this country. This summer, we
submitted our proposals for the second phase of the EU emissions
trading scheme. It will be expanded to cover additional activities at
160 installations, responsible for nearly 10 million tonnes of
carbon.</p><p><a name="06101246000374">Alongside
this, we are pressing for reforms to the EU emissions trading scheme to
extend its coverage and secure its long-term future. Representatives of
the World Business Council for Sustainable Development came to Mexico
last week. They said that what they needed above all else was long-term
certainty on the commitments of the developed countries to the carbon
market. That is what we believe that the reform and extension of the EU
emissions trading scheme should do. The scheme should also include
aviation, which would enable the industry to meet its environmental
costs through a mixture of emissions reductions within the sector and
purchase of reductions that can be produced more cheaply by other
sectors.</p><p><a name="06101246000375">The Budget

renewables obligation, which is a significant piece of subsidy for the
renewables industry. I will say a bit more about that later. The
significance of the renewables obligation is that it ensures that those

me conclude on the energy review. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The Government
are happy to talk about policy; unlike the Conservatives, we have some
coherence in ours. The energy review also set out a revolutionary
change in the basis of energy supply regulation, so that companies are
incentivised to conserve energy rather than supply more of it. It set
out a scheme to target the emissions of the 5,000 public and private
organisations, such as Tesco and the BBC, that are medium-level
emitters. That is worth 1.2 million tonnes of carbon, and it has also
set out an increase in the renewable transport fuel obligation to more
than 5 per cent. after
2011.</p><p><a name="06101246000402">I am pleased to
confirm to the House the continuing progress in the battle against
waste and for recycling. Many hon. Members will have been struck by the
extension of kerbside collection&#151;90 per cent. of the country now
has kerbside collection of recycling, which is unique in the European
Union.</p><p><a name="06101246000403">The latest
provisional figures, published today, show that households in England
recycled 27 per cent. of their waste last year, which is more than four
times as much as under the previous Government. The target was 25 per
cent. and the figure, although unaudited, is 27 per cent. That target
has been met and
exceeded.</p><p><a name="06101246000404">To pick up
the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Conwy (Mrs.
Williams), the Government need to show a lead in their own operations.
We have already introduced carbon offsetting for central Government,
ministerial and official air travel. Earlier this year, I announced a
pledge that the Government office estate will go carbon neutral by
2012, which is the equivalent of taking 150,000 cars off the
road.</p><p><a name="06101246000405">Recently,
I also announced the partnership for renewables, which will mobilise up
to &#163;500 million of investment to catalyse the expansion of the
public sector renewables, producing up to 500 MW of renewable
electricity. The Leader of the Opposition has called wind turbines
&#147;giant bird blenders&#148;. We call them a major spur to
renewable energy, and we support them.</p><br>

Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> The House
holds in high regard the hon. Gentleman&#146;s reputation and track
record on environmental issues. However, many people have doubts about
the policies of his party, not least because when renewable energy
developments are proposed in particular localities, Conservative
politicians who represent those areas tend to be the first to jump into
the breach against such proposals. How can we treat seriously his
commitments from the Conservative Front Bench? If we are not careful,
the best symbol for his party might be a disconnected wind turbine, to
show that what is on offer is just empty
spin.</p><p><a name="06101246000425"><b><a name="06101246001003">Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> First, the hon. Gentleman will know that
individual Members of Parliament have a duty to represent their
constituents&#146; interests where they are affected by
infrastructure projects of any kind. Conservative Members are perfectly
at liberty to take a view about proposals in their own constituencies,
but that does not affect Conservative party policy. Secondly, Liberal
Democrat Members also have a slight problem in this regard, and the
reason that we and the Liberal Democrats may be more affected is that
wind turbines tend to be sited in large rural areas with hills, which,
on the whole, tend to be represented by our parties than by the Labour
party. It is essential that the wind energy industry is sensitive to
landscape and does not propose developments in places where there will
be a clear impact on landscape, biodiversity or any other environmental
consideration. One of our arguments with the current support for
renewables is that it has tended to put money into large onshore wind
farms, which are naturally controversial in those areas where they are
proposed. In the long run, that is not helpful to securing renewable
energy in this country.</p><br>

less overbearing whipping system than the hon. Gentleman enjoys in the

question is: what do we need to do? First, we need to change the
mindset. We need to change the way that the Government think about
climate change. Incidentally, I welcome the establishment of the Office
of Climate Change. I query, however, whether just one office with 15
people in it will be resourced sufficiently and, more importantly, will
have the clout across Government to make the sort of changes that we
need, although I guess that it is a step in the right direction.
Famously, the Prime Minister said that he wanted the environment to be
at the heart of policy making. We must do that. It is not just about
making policy, however, but about the way in which the Government do
business. As the Sustainable Development Commission pointed out last
year, carbon emissions from the Government estate have increased by 8
per cent. since 1999.</p><p><a name="06101246000431">Were the Government to divert a
small proportion of their massive procurement budget towards
encouraging sustainable technologies and products, it would make a huge
difference to creating critical mass in such emerging markets. I urge
the Secretary of State to take that message away and make even more
effort than I know that he is making to use the mighty arm of
Government spending to lever in real improvement. I note that just one
Department&#151;it is the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs&#151;has, for example, allocated any money from its building
budget to micro-power generation.</p><p><a name="06101246000432"><b><a name="_spnew117"><a name="06101246001008">Mr.

would set statutory interim targets to ensure progress towards at least
the 60 per cent. target for 2050 on which we all agree. It would also
establish an independent body to monitor the science of climate change
and make recommendations in much the same way that the Monetary Policy
Committee of the Bank of England does. [<i> Interruption</i>]<i> </i>Indeed, as the Secretary of State notes from a sedentary position,
we need a decision-making body, not just one capable of

Parliament so that Ministers are truly accountable for their actions in
that regard. I was very interested to hear what the Secretary of State
had to say about that and it sounds as if he is giving thought to

they are taking a lead. It would help the public to make the changes

taking the matter seriously and legislating to discipline their own

much more that we could be doing. We have already heard mention of
energy efficiency, which is the no-brainer option in this debate, but
we are still building homes that fail to live up to decent standards of
energy efficiency. We need much tougher ecological building standards.
Some 43 per cent. of houses tested by the Building Research
Establishment in a recent trial failed to meet existing building
standards despite having an energy performance certificate.</p><p><a name="06101246000441">We need to do much more to make
people aware of what they can do to reduce energy use and save money at
the same time. Some 8 per cent. of all electricity consumed in our
houses is for things that we are not actually using at the time. If
every conventional light bulb in our homes were replaced by an energy
efficient light bulb, the total demand for electricity would fall by
3.5 per cent. So there is much more that we can
do.</p><p><a name="06101246000442">We
can also do more to promote decentralised and community-led solutions.
We need to rework the tax system so that it forms part of our armoury
in the fight against climate change. On that front, the Government
started well. The statement of intent on environmental taxation in 1997
committed the Government to shifting the burden of tax from goods to
bads and implementing the polluter pays principle. Figures from the
Office for National Statistics, released today, show that the shift has
gone the other way. Environmental taxes, as a percentage of total tax
and social contributions, have fallen from 8.3 per cent. in 2004 to 7.7
per cent. in 2005. The percentage was lower still in 1997. We need to
get back on track with the tax system as part of our
armoury.</p><p><a name="06101246000443"><b><a name="06101246001013">Dr.

emissions trading which, as the hon. Member for Morley and Rothwell

that the EU&#146;s scheme has gone awry&#151;mainly because of how
it was structured in the first place&#151;but that does not undermine
the principle of using emissions trading to drive down carbon
emissions. I welcomed what the Secretary of State had to say about what

month. I am also pleased that we may have representatives from the
Environmental Audit Committee at that meeting as well, to support what
is being done.</p><br>

be matched by leadership in our own country. It is important to have a
foolproof way to deliver year-on-year commitments to reduce carbon
emissions. We must turn our attention to what we can do, and how and
when we can do it. I therefore want to add my support for the pleas to
include a climate change Bill in the forthcoming Queen&#146;s Speech.
However, a climate change Act would not be the be-all and
end-all&#151;the single magic solution&#151;to reducing carbon
emissions. Quite simply, there is no single, simple
solution.</p><p><a name="06101246000479">As well as
systematically preventing CO2 emissions, we must all make
unprecedented changes to the traditional way of running our economy and
living our lives&#151;something that has been touched on in the
opening speeches. The Government are right to promote energy efficiency
seriously, to support new green technologies and to transform
procurement policy. I should like to add my support for the procurement
policy issue that was picked up by the hon. Member for East Surrey
(Mr. Ainsworth), because the Government could be doing far
more about that.</p><p><a name="06101246000480">We
need to consider revised planning guidance. We want to make the
comprehensive spending review an unapologetic driver of sustainable
development. We need to do all those things at the same time and with
urgency. But most of all, we need to have the backing of the British
public in all those changes, and we need to do far more to find out how
we can get them on board.</p><p><a name="06101246000481">I shall quickly deal with the
legislation on energy policy that is expected to be presented to the
House in the coming months. It will provide an important opportunity
for Parliament&#151;both in the House, in the Chamber and in
Committee, and in the other place&#151;to debate how we can make the
changes that we need. We have heard a lot of reference to how the UK
met its Kyoto targets early, but we did so as much by chance as by
design: we were very much able to take advantage of the dash for
gas.</p><p><a name="06101246000482">We should beware
of a false sense of security because emissions are on an upward trend,
as we have heard. That could jeopardise the medium-term target of 60
per cent. cuts by 2050. Of course, as we heard in the intervention from
my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell (Colin Challen), the
more science and understanding that we have, the more we know the scale
of the problem and the quicker we may need to go, perhaps even more
quickly than the 60 per cent. cuts. We can only do that if we all
understand the bigger picture. Once we start a journey, the more
distance we cover, step by step, the more we can see just exactly where
we need to be.</p><p><a name="06101246000483">I
should like very briefly to dwell on the role of nuclear energy. I do
not feel that the Minister for Energy, who is based at the Department
of Trade and Industry, has set out how the new nuclear build needed to
replace the generation of reactors that is being phased out can be in
place by 2010. The Sustainable Development Commission, which is the
Government&#146;s own adviser, noted that nuclear power will make
little contribution towards reducing carbon emissions before
2020.</p><br>

Trade and Industry, who appeared before our Committee, acknowledged in
his evidence and supplementary memorandum that it was likely to be
2018, at the very earliest, before nuclear capacity in a new form could
be in place. The issue for the Government is that, as things stand,
there is no institutional framework to guarantee investors secure
returns over the long term, and I hope that my right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will look at
that in the coming
months.</p><p><a name="06101246000485">Turning away
from energy policy at the DTI to other Departments, I am pleased to see
the lead that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is
taking in ensuring that other departmental policies are consistent with
our climate change policy, but the problem is that such things never
happen quickly enough. I should like to ask whether the Government can
do more to resolve the issues that have been flagged up by the
Companies Bill, which the House will debate next week, and to find out
what they can do to respond to the requests for environmental
reporting, which we need if we are to keep tabs on what is
happening.</p><p><a name="06101246000486">Looking at
the framework for sustainable development in respect of the Government
estate, which was introduced in 2002-03 and flagged up in earlier
Environmental Audit Committee reports, we can be really proud of the
aspirational target that the Government have set to become carbon
neutral by 2012. That is going to make a big difference. I would like
the Minister to put his energies into seeing what can be done to extend
that further, so that rather than excluding the NHS and the education
estate, it could extend beyond Government offices. I would
likethe greening government targets for operational management
of Departments to apply right across the board. The Lyons review is
looking at ways to relocate Departments from London and the south-east.
There are huge opportunities to integrate all
that.</p><p><a name="06101246000487">I want to flag
up the issue of private finance initiatives and how they are being
used. I am pleased that the Minister of Sport and the Government have
pledged that the 2012 Olympics are going to be the greenest ever. We
should take a leaf out of that book in respect of PFI and the design,
construction and maintenance of each and every new building around the
country. It is clear that we are embarking on a major programme of
house building, as well. High standards will be needed. As we have
already heard, we could go so much further. We could look at Treasury
rules in respect of whole-life costing so that financial appraisals
take account of the full costs&#151;capital and revenue&#151;and
the extra investment that is needed now will not be ruled out because
there is not the maintenance and the revenue money to pay for
it.</p><p><a name="06101246000488">There are also
the issues raised by the built environment professions. I want to flag
up the Royal Institute of British Architects and its &#147;Manifesto
for Architecture&#148;, which was recently published. I share its
hopes for the Government&#146;s code for sustainable homes, which I
acknowledge has been strengthened. The issue is that the code remains
voluntary, apart from houses built by English Partnerships or the
Housing Corporation. Pressure needs to be placed on the commercial
housing sector to raise building performance standards even
more.</p><br>

regulation. Businesses need certainty. They need to know what distance

into the local planning frameworks, we are likely to miss out on a
whole generation of new buildings being built with innovative practices
embedded in the planning procedure. There is also a huge amount more
that could be done to commercial buildings and public buildings, such
as schools and hospitals, to take on board all those issues. I hope
that the Cabinet Office can help with extending the new building
regulations. As we have heard, it is not just building regulations that
need to be improved. We can have all the building regulations in the
world, but if they are not properly enforced and construction workers
are not applying the standards, the energy will be going out through

real change needs to happen from not only the top down, but the ground
up. Attitudes must change at a local level, and hopefully we will be
able to encourage and support everyone in their endeavours to go green,

planning and local area agreements, or those who simply wish to extend
their homes or to move to new

Huhne (Eastleigh) (LD):</b> I congratulate the Secretary of
State on finding Government time, albeit perhaps abridged, to discuss
this absolutely crucial matter. I am delighted that it is clear that
there is consensus across the House&#151;including even the right
hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), who has left the
Chamber&#151;that climate change is accepted science. Forty-eight
Nobel prize winners writing to the Bush Administration cannot be wrong.
Indeed, the editor of <i> Science</i> was recently quoted as saying that
rarely in science is a consensus as strong as it is around the view
that there has been man-made global warming. Of course, the
intergovernmental panel on climate change has done exceptional work and
we look forward to seeing the fourth assessment report
soon.</p><p><a name="06101246000500">As I have
examined the matter over the past year, I have been struck, as I know
that the Secretary of State has, given several of his remarks, by
renewed evidence that the problems created by global warming are
accelerating, such as the movement of glaciers. For example, the
Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland is moving by 113 feet, whereas
previously it moved by only inches in a year. In Antarctica we have
seen the destruction of a substantial ice shelf the size of
Turkey&#151;or the size of Texas, as they prefer to put it in the
United States.</p><p><a name="06101246000501">At
home, we can see that the situation is worsening by considering
something as relatively mundane as the Thames barrier. The barrier has
been raised 55 times in the past five years, but was raised only 12
times in the previous five. We know about the situation
affectingthe railway line from Dawlish to Newton Abbott in the
west country, on which I travelled recently when visiting one of my
hon. Friends&#146; constituencies&#151;and my hon. Friend the

downpours lead to water running off concrete and baked soil. Insurance
claims are mounting rapidly, which is an increasing source of concern
to the Association of British Insurers.</p><p><a name="06101246000502">On that
point, I ask the Secretary of State to consider what to do about the
remaining climate change deniers, who include multinational
corporations. Although ExxonMobil, for example, no longer denies global
warming outright, it funds institutions and websites that do. Judged by
its actions, not its words, it is a climate change-denying
organisation, and it has been treating some reputable bodies pretty
badly. I said recently that the Royal Society had pointed out that
ExxonMobil was still funding climate change-denying organisations such
as the International Policy Network and the Competitive Enterprise
Institute. The IPN is the organisation whose executive director,
Mr. Morris, popped up so long ago with a poisonous and
personal attack on Sir David King, the chief scientific adviser, as
having no status in the debate because he was not a climate scientist.
I do not know how much ExxonMobil thought that nasty bit of attempted
character assassination was worth, but Mr. Morris
ludicrously described Sir David as</p><a name="brev_25"><a name="06101246000617"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;an embarrassment to himself and
an embarrassment to his
country&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06101246000503">and the Royal
Society calculates that overall ExxonMobil spent $2.9 million on such
outfits last year alone.</p><p><a name="06101246000504">The Royal Society&#146;s
letter says
that</p><a name="brev_26"><a name="06101246000618"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;ExxonMobil last
year provided more than $2.9 million to organisations in the United
States which misinformed the public about climate change through their
websites.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101246000505">Exxon&#146;s
director of corporate affairs, Mr. Nick Thomas, rang me and
said that the author of the letter to ExxonMobil had left the Royal
Society. I asked whether he had been sacked, and Mr. Thomas
said that he could not possibly comment, but it was clearly
significant. The implication was left hanging in the air. When I
checked, I found that Bob Ward, the senior manager at the Royal
Society, had been promoted into another job. The Royal Society is
standing by every word that he wrote, as it made clear in a subsequent
press release attempting to deal with internet
rumours.</p><p><a name="06101246000506">I
ask the House: should we be buying fuel from people such as ExxonMobil?
I do not want even indirectly to be helping to fund bodies such as the
International Policy Network and the Competitive Enterprise Institute.
I do not think that the Government should do so either, if only as a
tribute to the sterling work of Sir David King, so I hope that
Government procurement of fuel oil no longer uses Esso or Exxon.
ExxonMobil is surely the irresponsible and unacceptable face of
capitalism, to borrow a phrase. Perhaps Ministers could tell us what
they propose to do, if only to protect the reputations of their own
distinguished
employees.</p><p><a name="06101246000507">The climate

hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) said about the
need for independent monitoring, not, I hope, as a way of deciding
policy, but certainly as a way of informing it and making sure there
can be no doubt, among Members and policy makers, of the impartial
assessment of the scientific
community.</p><p><a name="06101246000508">We must
remember always that targets are only the first step to a solution.
They have to be credible. Frankly, if targets were the way to better
government, this country would be the best governed in the world
because one thing with which this Government cannot be reproached is
failing to multiply the number of new targets. We need also to talk
about practical policies.</p><p><a name="06101246000509">At an international level I
would like to hear more from the Secretary of State and his colleagues
about how we will press on with the agenda that they were outlining at
Monterrey. For example, was it not disappointing that, as I understand
from press reports, the Russians were not present? What can we do as a
European Union to make sure that the Russians are on board?
Nevertheless, like the Secretary of State, I firmly believe that we can
tackle the issue, if only because a mere 20 countries out of nearly 200
in the United Nations are responsible for 80 per cent. of carbon
emissions. We can gather the key people around the table, and we can
ensure that they address the
problem.</p><p><a name="06101246000510">There is a
serious difficulty with the developing world, because of the nature of
the problem. Contraction and convergence, to which our party is
committed, deals with the flow of carbon emissions into the atmosphere,
but not with the stock already there. Of course, the stock is the key
factor, as CO2 has a life of 100 years once it has been
emitted into the atmosphere. The developing world can legitimately turn
round and say that 70 per cent. of all the man-made CO2
currently in the atmosphere originates from the developed world. What
proposals do the Government have for dealing justly and equitably with
that issue? There is much merit in Jagdish Bhagwati&#146;s proposal
for a super-fund, which could help to fund a technological generation
jump in the third world and is worth considering.</p><p><a name="06101246000511">Closer to home, the Government
like to talk the talk, but they are far from being effective and
joined-up in their own policy actions. I shall give five examples of
how disjointed and dysfunctional the Government have become. First, it
is universally recognised that green taxes&#151;taxes on fossil fuels
and the machines that use fossil fuels&#151;are part of the solution
to global warming. The emissions trading scheme is crucial, but it
covers only a little under half of all emissions from the UK. Even if
we extend it to aviation, as we should&#151;I agree with the
Secretary of State, and I would like to know whether the Government are
in favour of extending it to shipping and road freight,
too&#151;substantial parts of the economy would be left outwith the
emissions trading scheme.</p><p><a name="06101246000512">That is why taxation is the way
to bring incentives to bear on people&#146;s behaviour. A Nordic
Council report, which I recommend to anyone who needs a little help
getting to sleep at night, is excellent on the subject of economic
instruments. Under this Government, we have been going backwards since
1999 on green taxes,

Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that the congestion charge is an
example of a successful tax from which income has fallen, because fewer
people are driving into central London? Why is the Liberal
party&#146;s central economic policy based on such peculiar
economics?</p><p><a name="06101246000514"><b><a name="06101246001041">Chris
Huhne:</b> I can assure the hon. Lady that it is not peculiar
economics at all. The reality is that often an ongoing tax, with an
ongoing change in price, is needed to bring about an ongoing change in
behaviour. We find that with traditional sin taxes, such as tobacco
tax, and indeed with the congestion charge. There is no real conflict
of the sort that she suggests; one can, for example, calculate what the
behaviour of car buyers will be in response to what happens on vehicle
excise duty. The Energy Saving Trust&#151;and, I believe, the
Department for Transport, but the Secretary of State will correct me if
I am wrong&#151;commissioned work from MORI that suggests that our
proposals, which we introduced during the Finance Bill, and for which
we voted for recently at the Liberal Democrat conference, would help
two thirds of new car buyers to achieve lower emissions. Clearly, that
would still leave a substantial amount of revenue, and I am grateful to
the hon. Lady for pointing that out, as it means that we can direct
that revenue towards lifting the low-paid out of income tax altogether
and cutting the income tax
burden.</p><p><a name="06101246000515"><b><a name="06101246001042">Dr.
Whitehead:</b> Does not the hon. Gentleman
accept that cap and trade taxes are used not only in Europe but, in
other circumstances, in the UK? Examples include the landfill allowance
trading scheme and packaging regulations. To some extent, renewables
obligations are a version of that tax, too. If he is making claims and
calculating figures about taxes, surely he should include the quasi-tax
represented by buy-outs from those arrangements, as against the trading
that reduces any buy-out obligation. Does he accept that the principle
of cap and trade, along with taxation, is a good domestic mechanism for
ensuring a reduction in climate change as well as an international
one?</p><p><a name="06101246000516"><b><a name="06101246001043">Chris
Huhne:</b> I strongly agree that cap and trade schemes are
superior to straightforward taxation. They provide an ongoing incentive
to companies to continue and deepen their saving of carbon emissions,
for example, in the case of climate change. If we can develop those
schemes, that is clearly a preferable option to straightforward taxes.
However, despite the Secretary of State&#146;s dalliance with the
idea of personal carbon allowances, it is recognised across the House
that we must deal with these issues extremely urgently, and the current
state of technology does not allow us to move to personal carbon
budgets or to introduce cap and trade schemes outside the areas where
such schemes operate at present. The hon. Gentleman is right in
principle, but in practice there are
difficulties.</p><br>

there will be an effect at the margin. In English, that means that some

behaviour will change to take off the growth. On aviation, one of the
key issues that we must face is that if the sort of growth that we are

Government introduced air passenger duty, they made no estimates of its

some. We are suggesting that we abolish the air passenger duty and
restructure it so that it is a duty on the emissions of flights. We
proposed a package of &#163;8 billion extra in green taxes overall. I
am happy to deal with that in more detail
later.</p><p><a name="06101246000521">The
first area that shows the lack of joined-up government is the Treasury.
The Government have been going backward on green taxes. That is a
crucial part of the explanation for the rise in carbon emissions since
1997. The second area in which policy is dysfunctional is public
spending. The DEFRA budget overruns in farming are one-offs, but the
Treasury is still insisting on cuts in DEFRA&#146;s budget&#151;for
example, in flood defences and the maintenance budget for flood
defences, as the Secretary of State admitted earlier. When we know that
one of the effects of climate change is rising sea levels and more
extreme storms and weather events, that seems little short of
irresponsible madness. There is clearly an appropriate degree of
concern from the Association of British Insurers about that, given the
understanding that the ABI reached with the Secretary of State&#146;s
predecessor about covering households that were to benefit from the

third area that demonstrates a lack of joined-up government is public
expenditure within the Department of Trade and Industry. The fact that
the Government, through the Natural Environment Research Council, are
closing the centres for ecology and hydrology&#151;in particular, the

and his colleagues in one of the leading scientific journals projected
that 18 per cent. of all species sampled would be, as the article
somewhat euphemistically put it, &#147;committed to
extinction&#148; on currently projected levels of global warming.
There is a clear need for the Government to address that issue, because
we need to maintain the expertise that has been built up at centres
such as Wool, and the long data sets of natural phenomena, if we are to
understand the impact of climate
change.</p><p><a name="06101246000524">My fourth
example concerns the Department for Communities and Local Government,
which&#151;I hope that this is contrary to the advice of the
Secretary of State&#151;is planning no fewer than 108,000 new homes
on flood plains. That is a crazy policy, given the likely impact of
climate change.</p><p><a name="06101246000525">The
hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) has mentioned
procurement, so I will not labour the point. However, I will mention
the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;s extremely high-handed
abandonment of the operating and financial reviews in the current
Companies Bill.</p><p><a name="06101246000526">There
is no evidence that there is an effective Cabinet Committee, let alone
an effective Cabinet, on global warming or climate change. Does such a
Committee meet? Who chairs it? Should the chair be the Deputy Prime
Minister? How will it be made far more effective in linking the efforts
of the Government on climate change? And is there anybody other than
the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs who is
committed to the
agenda?</p><p><a name="06101246000527"><b><a name="06101246001048">Mr.
David Heath (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b>May I give my hon.
Friend a small example of the left hand not knowing what the right hand
is doing in government? As he knows, I am enthusiastic about
microgeneration for small-scale hydroelectric plants in old water
mills. No abstraction licence for water is required at the point of
generation, which is good, but somebody has decided that an abstraction
licence is required for water to enter the mill race from the stream,
despite the fact that the water returns to the stream further down its
length, which has resulted in a huge extra charge for microgeneration
plants. Does that make sense to my hon.
Friend?</p><p><a name="06101246000528"><b><a name="06101246001049">Chris

Friend for raising that point. Perhaps Ministers will look into the
matter and remonstrate with the Environment Agency to sort out the
problem.</p><p><a name="06101246000529">Given
the situation, it is not surprising that the Government have been
missing their climate change targets and meeting others only by
accident. As I have said, carbon emissions are up, but the only reason
why we are still just meeting our Kyoto targets is the accident of the
dash for gas, which was not Government policy. Because we generated
electricity from natural gas rather than coal, greenhouse gas emissions
from the generating sector fell by one
quarter.</p><p><a name="06101246000530">If
we are to take the challenge of climate change seriously, which we
must, the lurching, lolloping policy must stop. Instead, we need a
systematic policy framework for all the areas of Government that affect
climate change: on transport, we need green taxes such as vehicle
excise duty; on aviation, we need to change air passenger duty into an
emissions charge; and on households,

Warm Front has done a few more than 1 million homes, and the pace is so

residential sector. In terms of businesses, we have already heard from
other hon. Members about commercial property.</p><p><a name="06101246000532">It is crucial that we become
much more ambitious in moving forward. I have mentioned in particular
electricity generation through renewables. Nuclear power cannot fill
the gap or stop us from becoming more dependent on natural gas on a 10
or 15-year view, so for heaven&#146;s sake let us not pretend that it
can. Let us invest in the renewables that will ensure that we are not
writing an open cheque to investors in nuclear power
plants.</p><p><a name="06101246000533">Since the
Secretary of State asked from a sedentary position whether I agree with
him rather than with the Conservatives, I have to say that Liberal
Democrats agree with neither. We do not believe that nuclear has a part
to play in the energy generation future of this country. Anyone who
thinks that that is an implausible prospect need only look at what is
happening in Germany and Sweden. I would particularly commend to the
Secretary of State Sweden&#146;s objective of not just a non-nuclear
but a non-fossil fuel future. It is time for the Government to raise
their sights and ambitions a little in tackling what they say,
rhetorically, is the most important policy challenge of our
time.</p><p><a name="06101246000534">As for joined-up
Government, the aid budget at the Department for International
Development needs to be reshaped. Adaptation is urgent, particularly as

top priority, as a world interest that is also a British interest. If
we can exercise any influence on the Administration of George
Bush&#151;which will, after all, be there for another two
years&#151;please let us do so, but first and foremost the Government
need to get their own act together. All the evidence is that we suffer
from a lack of joined-up government in this respect, and that is a

Margaret Thatcher, said three years before Rio. I will not make a habit
of quoting from her, and I know that Conservative Front Benchers cannot
do so nowadays because they have been told that they are not allowed to

from the whole world. Every country will be affected and no one can opt

true then and they are true today.</p><p><a name="06101246000543">As I said, we have experienced
a long retreat from Rio. We have engaged in a great many displacement
activities. After the conference in Monterrey in Mexico, we still talk
of a lack of consensus on how to tackle climate change. Human beings
often engage in displacement activities when they cannot deal with the
big problem that faces them. Some Members present may have involved
themselves in tidying up the house and hoovering the carpet rather than
dealing with the great issue that confronts them in their lives. To a
certain extent, that is what we have been doing these past 15 years in
terms of climate change.</p><p><a name="06101246000544">We should not be so uncritical
when we consider some of the activities in which we have been engaging.
When we consider the role of markets in tackling climate change, we
should ask ourselves a few questions about their effectiveness. I
believe that they will be effective, but only if we have a
framework-based set of markets, not a market-based set of
frameworks.</p><p><a name="06101246000545">I commend
an excellent report, &#147;Carbon Trading&#148;, by the Dag
Hammarskjold Foundation, which was recently published on the internet.
It provides a detailed analysis of markets and their role in tackling
climate change. It
states:</p><a name="brev_32"><a name="06101246000623"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;According
to Vincent de Rivaz, Chief Executive of EDF Energy in the UK,
&#145;the long-term price of tradable emissions allowances is too
uncertain to be a driver of systematic technological change in an
industry whose generating capacity investments must be planned over
30-year
periods.&#146;&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101246000546">We are
not even considering such time scales. The European Union emissions

him carefully. We have had the debate in private and in public. There
must be alternatives to markets, which can achieve only so much. I
would always argue that we must have direct intervention, and only the
state can do that. The state must be open and transparent about what it
expects from its citizens, businesses and communities. Why cannot we be
open about that? Why cannot we demand of people that this generation
should not fetter the next? That has never previously happened in the
history of
mankind.</p><p><a name="06101246000550"><b><a name="06101246001052">Colin
Challen:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. The simple
answer is that we are afraid of being booted out and replaced by a
Government who are not prepared to confront that issue. We must have
framework-based markets. I agree with the hon. Member for Eastleigh
(Chris Huhne) that capitalism is the most powerful force for change in
the world. Whether that should be the case is another matter&#151;I
shall not go down that route. We must tell capitalism how to respond
and not simply try to replace it because we do not have the capacity to
do that.</p><p><a name="06101246000551">Some of the
issues must be tackled through a global framework. Contraction and
convergence has already been mentioned and I want to dwell on that for
a little because I introduced a Bill on it last December. Contraction
and convergence form the framework in the articles of the United
Nations framework convention on climate
change&#151;UNFCCC&#151;that I mentioned earlier. There are many
objections to a single global framework for tackling climate
change.</p><p><a name="06101246000552">A recent
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs report, which
responded to the continuing Environmental Audit Committee inquiry into
the post-Kyoto frameworks, stated that we could not have a single
framework and that it was impossible to achieve. There are one or two
samples of attempts to understand the reason for that sort of
psychology. The Prime Minister said at a G8 climate change conference
in November last
year:</p><a name="brev_34"><a name="06101246000625"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is

be a straitjacket on the development of their
economies.</p><p><a name="06101246000554"><b><a name="06101246001053">Martin

imposing a greater carbon emission burden on
them?</p><br>

of the world that, when the Doha development round collapsed and pushed
back any hope of achieving the millennium development goals or a fair
trading system, it showed the great disconnect between the
liberalisation and globalisation agenda and that of climate change.
There is no connection whatever between those two parallel tracks.
There was no connection between Hong Kong last year and
Montreal&#151;no discussion, no cross-fertilisation of ideas. The EAC
conducted an inquiry into that subject, and what we have discovered so
far is rather depressing. In the WTO, the environment is sidetracked,
outflanked all the time and is treated as almost an unpleasant little
add-on that will prevent the WTO from achieving its objectives.
However, the two issues must be addressed hand in hand. That would deal
with some of the issues
raised.</p><p><a name="06101246000556">There is
another kind of objection to contraction and convergence. A World
Resources Institute report, &#147;Navigating the numbers: greenhouse

states:</p><a name="brev_35"><a name="06101246000626"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;International
agreements predicated on equal per capita emission entitlements are
unlikely to garner

partially to explain why, but ends by
stating:</p><a name="brev_36"><a name="06101246000627"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;However,
it is important to note that the implementation of virtually any
national or international climate change policies is likely to have the
effect of promoting a convergence in per capita emission levels over
time. Considering that over the long term net emissions must fall to
zero, convergence is a corollary of climate
protection.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101246000558">That is a
statement of the bleeding obvious. It is logical and rational. Why have
we been running away from that logical, rational position for the past
15 years? We as politicians ought to address that, and&#151;in the
light of an earlier intervention about how to face up to the
electorate&#151;we should take on board the radical thinking that is
now perhaps beginning to be taken up as the mainstream thinking, and
welcome proposals such as the personal carbon allowances scheme or
domestic tradable quotas, which was the subject of a Bill that I
presented two years ago. We should look into such matters very
seriously.</p><p><a name="06101246000559">We should
look into matters such as the new carbon-reducing scheme for
individuals of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts,
Manufactures and Commerce, and into the carbon rationing schemes that
people throughout the country are voluntarily starting. I recently
visited such a scheme in Oxford. Such schemes are gathering pace.
People are not waiting for us to do things; they are doing things
themselves.</p><p><a name="06101246000560">In terms
of the markets, we are putting too many eggs into one basket. If that
basket were called contraction and convergence, I for one would be very
much more confident that it would achieve some success. I am a strong
supporter of the contraction and convergence framework, and I hope that
the Bill that I presented last December will eventually be taken up by
DEFRA, in the same way that I feel that, to a certain extent, the
Secretary of State has taken up the issue of personal carbon
allowances.</p><p><a name="06101246000561">If we

years will know, the sacrifices do not hurt very much&#151;in fact,
people do not even notice some of them. We could go down that route,
but it would need support. That relates to my final point: the need for
a cross-party
consensus.</p><p><a name="06101246000562">This year,
I visited all three party conferences&#151;I might not make a habit
of doing so. I escaped as quickly as I could from the Tory and Liberal
Democrat conferences at Bournemouth and Brighton to get back to the
warmth of Manchester. However, if we are to tackle this issue
seriously, we need a cross-party consensus. I have a copy of the report
that the cross-party group produced. Three very distinguished but
totally independent people wrote it, and a great deal of evidence was
submitted. If we do not have a consensus, I do not see how we can put
in place the policies that will tackle the problem. As I have said,
that problem is now being described in much starker and harsher terms
than even the talk of 60 per cent. by
2050.</p><p><a name="06101246000563">A Tyndall centre
for climate change research report was commissioned by the Co-operative
Bank and Friends of the Earth. It talks about figures in respect of
carbon emissions: 3 per cent. per annum is a big ask, but even if that
is compounded it is insufficient to tackle the problem that we face. It
also talks about between 6 per cent. and 9 per cent. per annum, and
that is predicated on our doing the biggest part of the job
early&#151;instead of waiting until 31 December 2050 and then having
a big shutdown in carbon emissions. That means that the policies
required go far beyond a bit of taxation, a bit of regulation and a bit
of market intervention. It means that we will have to do things that
some of our voters will not thank us for. I hope that we will progress
with talks on a consensus, and build a bridge before we drive the
policies across. We should proceed on that
basis.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_12"><a name="06101246000633">3.40

approximately 20 per cent. of global emissions result from the human

around a stabilisation target that is credible and supported by robust
science, and how to engage the global community in getting on the road
map to achieving that target. Since the superpower of today and the
superpower of tomorrow are in a temporary stand-off on this issue, the
leadership function falls, in a very timid way, to the European
Union.</p><br>

entirely right for Britain to seek a leadership role. It is important
to establish that point, because one hears voices&#151;I hear them in
my constituency&#151;saying, &#147;Why are you banging on about
this subject? It is all about the United Statesand
China.&#148; It is not, and not least because of the point made by
the hon. Member for Eastleigh Chris Huhne). We are not 2 per
cent. of the problem. Given that carbon molecules stay in the
atmosphere for 100 years, we are significantly more than 2 per cent. of
the problem. There is a strong moral case to be made for British
leadership on this issue. Our society has prospered on the back of easy
access to cheap fossil fuels, and the price is being picked up by the
poor countries. That is the reality&#151;if one believes in the
theory of human impact on climate change&#151;and the moral case for
British leadership on this issue.</p><p><a name="06101246000567">The second argument for British
leadership is that we are very well placed to lead because of our
diplomatic relationships and skills base, and because of the
credibility of the climate science rooted in this country. Thirdly,
such leadership would be to our advantage. We will doubtless witness in
our lifetimes a step in the transition toward a low carbon economy. The
winners will be those at the vanguard of that movement, and Britain has
the opportunity to be there. It is in our economic interest to be a
leader in this
process.</p><p><a name="06101246000568">The Prime
Minister gets this and has taken a lead on the issue. Such leadership
has been defined to date by rhetoric. To say that is not to disparage
him, because words are important in moving this issue up the global
agenda. The other element that defines his leadership is the 60 per
cent. target, which is ambitious. The problem with it is that no one
believes that we are going to hit it, so the credibility of our
leadership is being really tested, and we need to re-examine the key
pillars of that leadership.</p><p><a name="06101246000569">As a developed economy and one
of the leading economies in the world, we have the opportunity to prove
the principle of green growth, by which I mean the principle that one
can significantly reduce emissions without sacrificing economic growth.
We were well teed up to do this because of the dash for
gas&#151;whatever the motivation for that&#151;but the awkward fact
is that carbon emissions have risen since 1997, as people are noticing.
We are in danger of squandering our opportunity. Energy efficiency and
conservation are at the heart of our response and carry with them
significant economic opportunities for this country, such as the
ability to enhance our competitiveness in an age in which fossil fuels
are likely to get more expensive, rather than less.</p><p><a name="06101246000570">If we can prove that point, we
have the opportunity to transform the international debate, which is
proceeding at the pace of the least willing. We have to prove the
principle of green growth and shift the debate from one that focuses
exclusively on risk to one that also entertains the possibility of
opportunity. That could be invaluable in triggering the gear change
that, as previous speakers have said, is needed.</p><p><a name="06101246000571">The second element must involve
broadening the coalition of the willing and changing the frame of the
debate. Until now, climate change has been spoken of

look at it, the more we see that it is absolutely interlocked with the
biggest geopolitical issues of our age. It is absolutely interlocked
with energy security, with access to water and food, and with growing
concerns for security linked to the migration of peoples fleeing the
impacts of climate change. It is also interlocked with issues of
poverty alleviation and the treatment of chronic health inequalities
around the world. The more we can stitch concerns about climate change
into these issues, the greater will be our chance of broadening the
coalition of the willing to deal with it. The British Government have a
crucial opportunity in that regard.</p><p><a name="06101246000572">The third pillar is one on
which the Secretary of State tried to make mischief&#151;the
leadership role in Europe. I take a Eurosceptic position on the value
of the euro to this country and on the process of ever-closer political
union, but I can reconcile that position very comfortably in my mind
with a strong desire to see Europe becoming much more effective in
doing what it says on the tin in relation to promoting more effective
action on issues that cross borders.</p><p><a name="06101246000573">The reality
in Europe is that, although some economies are much more advanced than
ours in promoting renewable energy&#151;I believe that the Minister
has more experience of this matter than I do&#151;we must recognise
that opinions on the European emissions trading scheme vary enormously.
That extremely important initiative, which was a result of Kyoto, is
none the less fragile, and the British Government, as a leader in
Europe, must be at the forefront of the drive to build on the
initiative and not to sacrifice it. We must take our partners with us
on that. The development of market instruments such as the emissions
trading scheme and the clean development mechanism is likely to be at
the heart of the solution, not least in regard to correcting a market
failure&#151;the inability to price carbon effectively. The lack of
an effective price for carbon underlies the apparent failure of the
first phase of the emissions trading scheme to drive innovation and
change.</p><p><a name="06101246000574">The second
opportunity for Europe will be to ensure that the single market grows
the market for new technologies and raises product standards. The more
we do that, the cheaper those technologies will become as they are
deployed. Europe has an enormous opportunity to do that and to reach
bilateral agreements with significant players in the global warming
debate and to encourage them to engage with climate change. I very much
welcome the initiatives that the Government are taking through
agreements with places such as China. We need to see the details, and
the results, of those agreements, but the initiative is the right one.
However, the European Union has much greater weight than we do as an
individual nation in helping to bring the big polluters to the table.
From my perspective as a Eurosceptic, that is what I believe Europe
should be about, and I want to encourage the Government to be at the
forefront of that process.</p><p><a name="06101246000575">Moving on
from the role of Britain, I should like to press the Government on an
issue that I mentioned earlier. It is striking that almost 20 per cent.
of our carbon emissions come from deforestation&#151;a broadly
similar proportion to that in the United States. In theory, we can
control the practice, as humans are responsible for it. In theory, too,
that should be cheaper than restructuring the way in which we produce,
distribute

well. However, the global community is slow to grasp this opportunity,
even though it ought to be pretty close to the top of the list of
cost-effective actions that we could
take.</p><p><a name="06101246000576">I am aware that the rain forest
nations have put together a proposal for conservation credits. The
implementation of such a proposal would be fraught with difficulty, but
it is an attractive theory that is entirely consistent with the EU
principle of paying farmers to maintain the environment. I have some
experience of this matter, having lived in Brazil for five years. The
harsh reality is that deforestation of the Amazon is being driven by a
very hard dollar for soya and for beef, which are exported principally
to Europe. However, there is no equivalent hard dollar for conservation
out there in the marketplace. That opportunity must be thought through
carefully as we try to get to grips with the global challenge. Will the
Government support and actively promote the creation of conservation
credits in Nairobi? I look to the ministerial response on that in the
winding-up
speech.</p><p><a name="06101246000577">Turning
to the domestic agenda, it is clearly desirable that a cross-party
consensus is achieved that includes the world of business, on which we
will rely for many of the solutions to the challenge. People have in
their in-trays documents on long-term investment decisions that will
shape our ability to meet the 2050 target to reduce the carbon
intensity of our economy, and they want some vision of what will happen
after 2012. They want some vision of the political will to grasp the
issue and take action, because that will shape their investment
decisions.</p><p><a name="06101246000578">My
understanding is that there is cross-party consensus on the target,
although the language is shifting to suggest that it is a minimum
rather than a maximum. Conservative Members at least believe that the
2050 target needs to be broken down. I put it to the Government that
the evidence I have heard from business is that the 2050 target is
simply not biting on today&#146;s decision makers, whether they sit
in Whitehall, the civic centre or the boardroom. I have not heard a
plausible or robust argument against breaking down that target into
more pressing milestones. I look forward to the ministerial response on
that.</p><p><a name="06101246000579">The issue
between us seems to be about tax, which I regret for two reasons.
First, I detect that there is increasingly common ground, at least
among Conservative Members, about the need to re-examine the tax
system. The shadow Chancellor spoke about green taxes in Tokyo, and
there is clearly a mood to shift taxation from goods towards
bads.</p><p><a name="06101246000580"><b><a name="06101246001056">Chris
Huhne:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that the shadow
Chancellor&#146;s formulation on green taxes allows for the
possibility of a decline in green tax pressure? He talks about green
taxes rising as a share of taxes. If taxes overall were falling, that
would be perfectly consistent with green taxes falling. That is why we
have been careful to express this as turning around green taxes as a
share of national
income.</p><p><a name="06101246000581"><b><a name="_spnew125"><a name="06101246001057">Mr.

need to re-examine the system.</p><br>

levers, they are not the only one. I want to pick up on a point that
was made from our Front Bench. It seems to me that there ought to be
common ground where there is silence in terms of the cross-party
debate&#151;that is, the attitude to constructive regulation and
standards that we will expect from the key products that drive our
energy consumption, such as the car, the home, the office and the light
bulb.</p><p><a name="06101246000583">We can take
people with us on a journey to revolutionise the standards of the
products that are causing the problem, so I urge the people engaged in
that cross-party consensus perhaps to focus on that in the short term
as an opportunity to send a signal that will be heard by the
manufacturers of those products and those who consume
them.</p><p><a name="06101246000584">My next point to
reinforce the opportunity for cross-party consensus relates to
procurement in the public sector. About &#163;500 billion is being
spent, and that is an enormous lever with things attached to it. The
evidence given to the Environmental Audit Committee over many years
suggests that, although the Government are making progress and making
the right noises, they are very
inconsistent.</p><p><a name="06101246000585">In my
intervention, I gave the example of the DHL contract&#151;the largest
Government contract in recent times. My understanding&#151;the
Minister might deny this&#151;is that it does nothing to reduce the
Government&#146;s carbon footprint. That opportunity has been missed,
but I hope that the opportunity that the massive investment in the
school building programme represents will not be missed. That carries
with it a great opportunity to demonstrate the technologies that will
make a difference and to connect young people in this country with the
issue. Those are levers that we can pull and they provide opportunities
to build credibility and prove to people sitting in Ruislip or Shanghai
that we can do something to manage the risk of climate instability,
which has the power to inflict huge financial and human costs on our
society.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_13"><a name="06101246000634">3.55

Government have achieved a great deal, but there will be big challenges
in the future, not just for Government but for all of us. Let me list
some of the achievements: the introduction of fiscal
measures;the renewables obligation; the climate change levy;
and the stepping up of duty on motor vehicle taxation. Those are
important, and as other Members on both sides of the House have said,
we need more. We have worked for many years to introduce a renewable
transport fuel obligation, and it is almost within our
grasp.</p><p><a name="06101246000588"><b><a name="06101246001059">Chris
Huhne:</b> If I understood the hon. Gentleman correctly, he
mentioned that there had been a rise in fuel and car taxation. He may
not be aware of this,but in fact the vehicle excise duty
proposals announced in the Budget involve a fall, even in cash terms,
of&#163;10 million in overall revenue. Once again, fuel duty
is declining in real terms. Therefore, he is not
correct.</p><br>

Tipping:</b> I watched with interest the Liberal party
conference and the proposals that came out of it. My simple point,
however, is that it is important to step up the differential rates
between cars of different capacity. As the hon. Gentleman draws me into
that area, I wish that the Chancellor had done more, and I hope that we
will continue to go in that direction. The hon. Gentleman also
minimised the warm front scheme. I do not belittle the achievement of
better insulation for 1.1 million people. Nor do I belittle the
&#163;800 million available between 2005 and 2008 for increasing and
taking forward the warm front scheme. Those are important initiatives.
If people want to build consensus, it is important to recognise what
the Government have done.</p><p><a name="06101246000590">We need to recognise the
challenges before us. A20 per cent. reduction in carbon
emissions by 2010 is a big step, which we will have to work hard to
achieve. The Government&#146;s aspiration for 20 per cent. renewables
by 2020 is regarded by many in the industry as impossible. Achieving
our medium-term target of a 60 per cent. reduction in carbon emissions
by 2050 would be an amazingly hard step, not just for Government and
domestically, but internationally, too.</p><p><a name="06101246000591">The
Government have been extremely strong in raising climate change on the
domestic agenda. Looking back to Kyoto, the role of the European Union
was important, but so was that of our Deputy Prime Minister. Who would
have thought that climate change would be one of the top two agenda
issues at Gleneagles? That would have been unthinkable a decade ago.
Keeping the discussion going to St. Petersburg in Russia was also an
important step forward, as was the Gleneagles dialogue, a sophisticated
diplomatic approach outside the United Nations framework, which,
because of its size, will prove difficult. I was excited by what was
achieved in Mexico last week, and I was disappointed at what remains to
be done. I guess that all of us look forward to Nairobi next month.
Again, it will be hard for us to make progress through the United
Nations process. But it is important that the British Government
continue to show leadership.</p><p><a name="06101246000592">The big challenge is post-Kyoto
in 2012, which is only six years away. We need to use international
discussions now to make our arguments for what comes next. I am not
entirely clear about what should come next, but I do know that there is
a false dichotomy between those who argue for targets and those who
argue for technology. The real gain will be made by introducing targets
that encourage new technologies, so that we have a target-led approach
that produces market-led solutions through
technology.</p><p><a name="06101246000593">The
big challenge is carbon pricing, as the hon. Member for
Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) rightly said. If we are serious
about making change, we have to secure a high, stable price for carbon
that can be maintained for a long period. The buzz phrase in the
industry&#151;I hear it from British electricity generators&#151;is
carbon pricing that is long, loud and legal. As a catchphrase, that has
much substance. The way to achieve that new, higher price for carbon is
to build on what we have.</p><p><a name="06101246000594">I accept that phase 1 of the
European emissions trading scheme is in its infancy, but there have
already been difficulties. I suspect that phase 2, which we are working
towards, will be much more robust. It is important that it is
transparent, open and honest, and does not lead to anti-competitive
behaviour across

calculations that have been part of phase 1, in which vested interests
and a &#147;business as usual&#148; approach have been
prevalent.</p><p><a name="06101246000595">The real
prize will be phase 3 of the European emissions trading scheme. The
discussions of that phase have to be linked to the post-Kyoto
discussions. We have to extend the European emissions trading scheme to
aviation and other transport and industries that hon. Members have
mentioned, and we must also extend it from Europe internationally. That
is an amazing
challenge.</p><p><a name="06101246000596">Unless we
can achieve a firm, stable and high price for carbon, the new
investment&#151;in new plant and equipment&#151;that we need
alongside the change in behaviour, will not happen. Let us rally the
consensus around carbon pricing. It will have real effects on the
aviation industry. Members on both sides of the House have talked
strongly about the threat of aviation, but a true trading system could
help us to make progress on that.</p><p><a name="06101246000597">I am keen to achieve consensus,
but let me strike a discordant note. It is easy to have a consensus
about not very much. The Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives have a
consensus on climate change, but it is on the headline and the
principle. When it comes to the mechanics of the necessary policies, it
is hard to build consensus. For example, where does the Conservative
party stand on wind farms? Are they giant bird blenders? Does the
Conservative party want a moratorium? It should make its position
clear.</p><p><a name="06101246000598">The
Conservatives should also make their position clear on the renewables
obligation. We have had some discussion of that this afternoon and it
has been a useful mechanism for encouraging new technologies. We do
need a more sophisticated system, and the energy review acknowledges
that. The consultation on the issue has just started. I think that
there is a place for nuclear, and a strong argument to support
replacing nuclear with nuclear. However, if we argue that nuclear is
the last resort, it is clear that that replacement will never
happen.</p><p><a name="06101246000599">It is never
easy to build consensus, but the climate change Bill that many hon.
Members have mentioned in the debate would serve as a vehicle for a
discussion and give us an opportunity to talk about consensus. There
are merits in introducing year-on-year reductions, and the discussion
about the Bill has, at the very least, raised the profile of the
argument. Even so, difficulties remain, as any such Bill would involve
domestic rather than international targets. It would introduce
year-on-year changes, rather than the lengthy planning
period&#151;15 years at least, or perhaps even
longer&#151;needed for the introduction of a trading scheme. To that
extent, it would deal in aspirations rather than
mechanisms.</p><p><a name="06101246000600">I listened
very carefully to what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said
about carbon budgeting. I hope that the Government will introduce
relevant measures in the forthcoming Queen&#146;s Speech. Even if a
Bill on carbon budgeting is not announced then, I hope that the
possibility of introducing an overarching scheme to that end will be
discussed further.</p><p><a name="06101246000601">When the

environmentally sensitive and in touch with people&#146;s aspirations
for the
future.</p><p><a name="06101246000602">My
final point is more parochial. I come from a coal mining area, and coal
has been facing a difficult time. Many people have said that we met our
Kyoto targets because of the dash for gas, although I think that our
success in that regard is due to the coal industry&#146;s decline.
However, I was pleased that the energy review spoke strongly about coal
having a place in the
future.</p><p><a name="06101246000603">Real
problems exist at the moment. As my hon. Friend the Member for Morley
and Rothwell (Colin Challen) noted, UK Coal, our biggest producer, is
arguing about price with generators such as EDF. We can sort out
difficulties like that, but the challenge for coal has to do with the
environment rather than economics.</p><p><a name="06101246000604">The question
of how we burn coal&#151;whether we use supercritical boilers or go
down the gasification route&#151;is immaterial, as the market will
decide that. More important just now is the fact that people like
Richard Budge and his company called Powerfuel, together with Powergen
and RWE, are looking to bring new, cleaner coal plants onstream. The
problem that they face is that the carbon allowance offered to new
entrants to the market is only 40 per cent. of the benchmark level for
a new gas plant. Therefore, people who want to bring in cleaner coal
technology are left at a competitive disadvantage. It cannot be
sensible policy to prohibit or restrict new entrants to the market who
will be cleaner producers of energy from coal when the comparators for
them are plants that are more polluting. The Government must look at
that problem, as a matter of
urgency.</p><p><a name="06101246000605">In
addition, we must move away from the notion of carbon capture and
sequestration, even though the concept is a good one and I am pleased
that experiments are taking place, such as at the new Powergen plant on
the north Norfolk coast and at the proposed RWE plant on the Thames.
Carbon capture has plenty of potential, and it could be used to enhance
our oilfields, but it is not a silver bullet. The technology is at a
rudimentary stage. One of the things that I want from the Stern review,
which will be published shortly, is an acknowledgement that carbon
capture and storage will be good for the UK and that investing money
now will save money in the long
run.</p><p><a name="06101246000606">We
want new coal plant in the UK, but that is as nothing compared to the
demand for coal in India and China. In this country and in Europe, we
must demonstrate that we can burn coal more cleanly and deal with the
consequences of carbon emissions. Saving a tonne of carbon in India or
China has equal consequences for us in the west; we live in a global
world.</p><p><a name="06101246000607">My message to
our Government is that although they have achieved a lot, they must
continue to hit their targets. Unless they do so, we will lose the
moral high ground&#151;the leadership that could take us to a
greener, cleaner environment in the
future.</p><p><a name="06101246000608"><b><a name="06101246001061">Several

Friends of the Earth.</p><p><a name="06101249000006">I am proud to be a member of
the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which has
been conducting a timely inquiry into various elements of climate
change. Last month, we reported on renewable energy and biofuels. We
are currently taking evidence about what individual citizens can do,
and we will shortly be looking at the longer-term policy
agenda.</p><p><a name="06101249000007">We recently
visited China, which was incredibly insightful. We went to a car
factory, where we were told of the rather worrying aspiration to give
every Chinese family a car. Several politicians spoke to us frankly
about climate change; they shared their distrust of capitalism and what
the west is saying. One of them summarised their views well when he
said, &#147;Look, you&#146;ve had your industrial revolution,
you&#146;ve had your chance to develop. Now it&#146;s our
turn.&#148; But if they develop as we have done, it will kill off the
planet.</p><p><a name="06101249000008">It is
essential that the international community works together, but the
impact of China and India does not mean that we should not act as
individual citizens. That Chinese politician said, &#147;We want to
see you suffer as well&#148;, and asked why we did not all have
photovoltaic cells and solar power. If we expect the Chinese to change,
we need to change even
more.</p><p><a name="06101249000009">We
must take climate change even more seriously than we do already. At
Cabinet level there is already a precedent for cross-cutting Ministers.
There should be a Minister solely responsible for climate change, not
with a full Department but with a team that cuts across Departments. It
is not enough just to have a climate change office, although it is a
step in the right
direction.</p><p><a name="06101249000010">Flooding
and housing are significant issues in my constituency and, more
generally, in the adaptation and mitigation debates. In my
constituency, the Environment Agency is consulting about flood defences
in the Great Wakering area, where there is an enormous risk of
flooding, as there is throughout south Essex. This morning, I met
Charles Beardall, the very good manager of the Environment
Agency&#146;s eastern region. He told me an astonishing fact&#151;I
had to make him repeat it three times because I thought he had got it
wrong: a house built this year with only a one in 1,000 chance of
flooding every year will have a one in eight chance by 2080. I have a
newborn son, and those houses could flood within his lifetime. Building
in the Thames Gateway&#151;let alone in a number of other
areas&#151;makes no sense to me when we are subject to those risks.
In fact, we are considering building more than 120,000 houses in the
Thames Gateway by 2016. That makes no sense to me
whatsoever.</p><p><a name="06101249000011">We must do
more about the standard of the houses that are built. It is quite
criminal that we let houses be built to such a low standard. I am not
one of those people who say that we should compel companies to include
solar panels, photovoltaic cells, water butts or insulation. We need to
set overall standards, and

that half the water consumed by the House must be collected locally, or
that the House must produce half the energy that it consumes, and it
does not matter whether a wind farm or photovoltaic heating is used to
do so. If we are prescriptive, we will stifle innovation, and it is
important that we do not do
that.</p><p><a name="06101249000012">Action
on new housing will also pump-prime the marketplace. The Chinese were
very entrepreneurial in many ways. They were saying, &#147;We want
you to have photovoltaic cells. In fact, we can produce them very
cheaply if you buy in volume.&#148; Joking apart, such things will be
beneficial, and high-profile environmental activities help to educate
people. Certainly, when the Select Committee went to Leicester to see
eco-houses and wind farms in schools, we could see that that was
helping to educate
children.</p><p><a name="06101249000013">We
have done an awful lot to date, but there is so much more to do. We
need a climate change Bill. I hope that the Secretary of State for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs misread his speech earlier on,
because I was diametrically opposed to what he seemed to say. I think
that he said that he believed that we would be judged not by results,
but by how we get there. I think that he probably got that the wrong
way around&#151;we will be judged by results&#151;and the Friends

that we can only tackle something like climate change if we stick to
fundamental Labour values. We have to stick to the values of
internationalism, radicalism and collectivism. I hear what the hon.

the development of Kyoto and the European emissions trading scheme.
That is fantastic, but we can continue to play a leading role only if
we have the moral authority of being able to show that we, as a
country&#151;as the first industrialised country&#151;can tackle
this issue head on and continue to grow our industries and be all
right, and be carbon neutral. We have to be able to show a lead on
that. In turn, we can get all sorts of benefits. However,
unfortunately, we are not leading in any of the 10 main green
industries. Why not? As a country, we are potentially the Saudi Arabia
of wind energy. Why do we not have a flourishing wind industry? Of
course, I could make all sorts of cheap points about the Liberal
Democrats and their planning controls and stranglehold on wind energy

The Sahara will simply expand. Will we look into the eyes of Africans

importance of changing things within them, such as insulation. Certain
sneery comments were made about the Warm Front scheme. We should
remember the decent homes standard. Half my constituents live in social

are getting new kitchens and bathrooms. That is great and that is what
they celebrate&#151;thanks to a Labour Government. However, they are
also getting new boilers and insulation. When fuel prices go up, as
they will, half my constituents will be literally insulated from those

policy reasons, but, as a Labour MP, I would say that we always have to
keep an eye on traditional Labour values and the importance of tackling
the radical problem of climate change. We should take heart, because
although we might be coming to this at the eleventh hour, we have a

in November. I welcome the opportunity to add my voice and the voices
of the residents of East Dunbartonshire to the calls for such a Bill. I
hope that Ministers will take the interest in this debate and the fact
that 380 Members have signed the early-day motion calling for such a
Bill as a clear sign that it must be a priority. I hope that such a
Bill will be taken forward in November because we must have annual
targets on reducing carbon dioxide emissions so that we can see in the
House what progress is being made every single year and so that hon.
Members can hold the Government to account. A long-term target on its
own will not help us to tackle the
problem.</p><p><a name="06101249000026">In among lots
of constituency work during the parliamentary recess&#151;it is not a

time out to go to the cinema to watch &#147;An Inconvenient
Truth&#148;. I am sure that many hon. Members will have seen the film
and I wholeheartedly recommend it to those who have not. Perhaps the
film should be essential viewing because it puts in the starkest
possible terms the scale of the problem that we face. However, the film
is not depressing because it does not say that there is nothing that we
can do about the problem. On the contrary, it encourages every single
citizen who sees it to play their part, take their responsibilities
serious and lobby their representatives. I especially liked the bit at
the end of the film when a list of actions that people can take is
shown as the credits roll. Obviously, there is a slight American bias,
because people are encouraged to contact their Member of Congress and
senator. The film suggests that if the representatives do not take the
viewers seriously, they should run for Congress themselves. I thought
that that was good advice, and we should all be aware that we will have
constituents who will expect us to take the problem incredibly
seriously.</p><p><a name="06101249000027">Many hon.
Members who have spoken have rightly highlighted the international and
European dimensions of how we will tackle the problem. However, it is
also hugely important to focus on what individuals can do. We know
about the little energy-saving measures that could lead to massive cuts
in the release of carbon dioxide if lots of people carried them out.
Such measures include changing to energy-saving light bulbs and using
public transport rather than a car, especially for shorter journeys, or
perhaps leaving the car at home and walking. They also include
increasing recycling, turning the thermostat down a few degrees and
turning appliances off, instead of on to stand-by. One would think that
all those little things would not make a huge difference, but they can
be
important.</p><p><a name="06101249000028">Obviously,
we all consume energy and are thus responsible for a certain amount of
carbon emissions. I encourage people to make themselves aware of the
ways in which they can offset their carbon emissions. Organisations
such as Climate Care and carbonneutral.com give lots of information
about how that can be done. By planting trees or investing in renewable
energies, it is possible to offset the carbon tonnes that one emits. I
recently logged on to do the calculations so that I could pay for my
carbon offset and I encourage other hon. Members to do the same,
especially because our job requires a huge amount of travelling, so we
are perhaps responsible for higher than average carbon
emissions.</p><br>

issue that I would like to raise with the Leader of the House, so
perhaps the Ministers present can communicate it to him. Something that
will need to change is our beloved institution, the House of Commons,
as it starts to address climate change issues. Heating has been
mentioned, and we have recently seen better recycling facilities
introduced, although others may agree that it is a bit strange that we
had to wait until 2005 for that. I hope that the House authorities will
take on board the fact that we need to lead by example.</p><p><a name="06101249000030">There are so many aspects of
climate change that it is impossible to cover them all, so I should
like to focus on waste and recycling, which are very important. Carbon
dioxide is the greenhouse gas that we are most concerned about, but the
second most important is methane. Landfill waste produces most of the
UK&#146;s methane at the moment. Some 648 kilotons of methane were
released from landfill in 2005. I welcome moves to reduce the amount of
our waste being sent to landfill annually; indeed, many councils are
currently grappling with how to deal with the impact of the landfill
tax, which increases year on year, and the fines that will be imposed
if we do not get to grips with how much we send to landfill and how
much we recycle.</p><p><a name="06101249000031">East
Dunbartonshire council has recently moved to fortnightly refuse
collections for residual waste but at the same time is investing hugely
in recycling facilities, with doorstep recycling happening weekly.
Garden waste, glass, plastics, cans, paper and cardboard are collected,
and the council hopes to increase the amount of materials collected.
That was not an easy step to take, and it is fair to say that the local
reaction has not been unanimously in support of the change. I am sure
that in other areas where that have happened there has been a similar
reaction. However, this bold environmental step is necessary. It is
regrettable that in my area Labour and the Conservatives opposed the
move, and I suspect that in other parts of the country they themselves
have had to implement similar schemes. It is an example of the changes
that individuals will increasingly have to make to their behaviour that
are difficult at first but in the long term will help us to tackle the
problem.</p><p><a name="06101249000032">It
is important that the Government and business play a role. Looking at
the UK plastics industry, we see that our recovery figures&#151;the
energy that we get back from plastics&#151;are awful compared with
our European counterparts. Less than a quarter of our plastic is
recovered in some way for energy, and a tiny proportion is recycled.
Our European neighbours are far better at that than us. Denmark, the
Netherlands and Switzerland manage to recover or recycle over 75 per
cent.</p><p><a name="06101249000033">Obviously, some
plastics are easier to recycle than others, and we can only take things
to be recycled if there is a market for the recycled plastic. It is
important that the Government encourage business through best practice
not only to create things out of materials that can be recycled, but to
use recycled materials to help to create that market. If encouragement
and the sharing of best practice cannot succeed in changing behaviour,
regulation will be required.</p><p><a name="06101249000034">A related
issue on which we need to take urgent action is the excess packaging
that we see every day when we go to the supermarket. One goes to buy a

checkout, but now they come in a foam tray, they have a bit of card
around them and the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.
Crucially, a lot of that material cannot be recycled, and it is
consumers, our constituents, who have to pay for it&#151;not once but
three times. They pay for the excess packaging at the checkout; they
pay the landfill tax through their council tax bills for getting rid of
rubbish; and there is the environmental cost. Business must take this
more seriously, and if it does not, the Government must make it do
so.</p><p><a name="06101249000035">That
is just one of the many issues raised in the debate that are important
to solving the problem of climate change. I hope that Ministers will
address those concerns and take them seriously. Climate change is
happening, and it is happening quickly. Action is needed now, and if we
are not successful the worst of the consequences will not be faced by
today&#146;s Ministers or even most of the MPs in this House. It is
my generation, and our children and children&#146;s children, who
will face the brunt of climate change and inherit this dreadful legacy.
Everyone in the UK has a responsibility to tackle this problem, and we
as legislators must take a lead. A climate change Bill in the
Queen&#146;s Speech is a vital first step, but only the first step on
a long and challenging
journey.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_17"><a name="06101249000254">4.34

is absolutely shocking that, as we would find if we went through

debate, about three minutes have been spent on the effects of climate
change. There is lovey-dovey consensus on the need to cut emissions and
so on, which is terribly important. The Government have a good record
on the issue, but I will not go into it, as everyone in the Chamber
knows about it. We have been discussing the need to cut emissions, the
need to achieve the 60 per cent. target by 2050, many other good
measures, and the Government&#146;s&#151;and, to some extent, the
Conservative Government&#146;s&#151;good track record in cutting
emissions. On the causes of climate change, the country and the
Government have a great record, nationally and internationally.
However, we never talk about coping with the effects of climate change
in the Chamber&#151;at least, not that I have heard, and I am here a
great deal, as hon. Members will know. For our constituents, there is a
crucial difference between the cause and the effect of climate
change.</p><p><a name="06101249000038">The United
Kingdom is responsible for 2 per cent. of emissions. If we cut that to
nil tomorrow, there would still be international climate change, and we
would still experience its effects in the United Kingdom. That is not a
counsel of despair, and it is not to say that we should give up on all
those measures. The president of the Royal Society, Frances Cairncross,
made a good speech on the subject on 4 September, in which she
said:</p><a name="brev_37"><a name="06101249000238"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Adaptation

as the causes. The hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne), who opened
for the Liberal Democrats, devoted one or two sentences to flood
damage, which, for a Hampshire MP, is understandable. He mentioned the
research undertaken by the Natural Environment Research Council into
animal habitats and extinction&#151;that was another sentence, I
think. He mentioned the Department for International Development and
the effects of climate change in the sub-Saharan region, which include
mass population movements, conflict and so on. However, those subjects
took up about a minute and a half in a speech of some 25
minutes.</p><p><a name="06101249000042"><b><a name="06101249000274">Chris
Huhne:</b> I merely point out that I also talked about the
west coast main line, the Thames barrier and what we need to do to

a lot in my speech about dealing with adaptations. The hon.

more shocking and depressing that the Government&#151;I shall come on
to their overall record later&#151;have a good record on adaptation

the effects of climate change. Earlier this year, an Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development report cited the United Kingdom
as one of the top five OECD members&#151;there are 30, and they are
of course the advanced industrial countries&#151;moving towards the
implementation adaptation. The other four were the United States of
America, Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands. The situation in
this country is, however, unacceptable, as the Government have not
adequately addressed the effects of climate change. The Opposition,
too, have barely talked about the effects, yet we are one of the top
five countries in terms of adaptation. I find that particularly

the statistics today and I could reel off a load more, but time is
short. Climate change has already started, whether, from the point of
view of the flat-earthers, human activity is a contributing factor or
not. I and probably all hon. Members present think it is, but let us
leave that on one side.</p><p><a name="06101249000048">The
statistics for the past 200 years show that climate change has already
happened and is already having adverse effects around the world,
including here in the United Kingdom. Yes, we need the technology in
order to adapt to climate change. The Thames flood barrier has been
mentioned&#151;a magnificent piece of technology which has been used
more frequently in recent years, as the hon. Member for Eastleigh
indeed said. That is a technological solution to dealing with the
effects of rising sea waters&#151;dealing with the effects of climate
change. It does not mean that we say, &#147;We&#146;ll just build
lots of those around the country&#148; and do nothing about the
causes of climate change. As a society we need to get a grip and
address the effects of climate change, which has already
started.</p><p><a name="06101249000049">On what the
Government have already done, we have the UK climate impacts programme,
about which some hon. Members know. It is a team of 15 people in Oxford
who act as a link between policy makers and the public, producing
research and so on. We have the Government&#146;s adaptation policy
framework. In November 2005 they published the consultation on phase 1.
The publication of the consultation on phase 2 is due some time this
autumn.</p><p><a name="06101249000050">That is a
consultation on an adaptation policy framework to deal with an issue
that I personally know has been around for over 30 years, because I was
taught about the greenhouse effect in university over 30 years ago.
That is one of the reasons why even before all the furore about CFCs
and so on, I never bought aerosol cans. I am probably one of the few
people in their 50s in the UK who has bought fewer than a dozen aerosol
cans in their whole life, because of climate change. Although I laud
the Government on setting up the adaptation policy framework and
holding consultations on it, that should have started&#151;it was
mentioned before&#151;under Margaret Thatcher, if not before. The
problem and the effects on the planet have been known about for at
least 30
years.</p><p><a name="06101249000051">A
third step that the Government are taking is the UK environment
facility to assist developing countries in adapting to climate change.
As has been said in the Chamber, those who will be hit hardest are the
poorest in the poorest countries, including sub-Saharan Africa, where
182 million people will be affected. There will be wars over water
resources, which will drive conflict in the middle east for the next 50
years. Wars over water resources and the problems associated with water
resources will get more acute as global warming heats up many parts of
the planet and therefore evaporation continues and so on. Those are the
effects of climate change with which we need to grapple. One of the
effects will be war

us were Members of this esteemed place&#151;but on a rough
calculation, 6 per cent. of the document, which is entitled
&#147;Climate Change: The UK Programme 2006&#148;, addresses
adaptation, which involves a 12-page section in a 193-page document
plus one or two passing references. About half of those 12 pages refers
to research into adaptation, which is very important but should not be
all that we are doing. We are far too late, and we need to step up our
response.</p><p><a name="06101249000058">Half of a
document such as &#147;Climate Change: The UK Programme 2006&#148;
should be devoted to dealing with the effects of climate change,
because we know that the effects are coming, regardless of how
successful we are in international negotiations. The effects have
already started, and there is an accelerative effect in the early years
in terms of changes produced in the environment by the stuff that is
already in there and the stuff that, realistically, we know is going to
be put in there in the next 20 years, even if everybody around the
world halves their output. The effects are only going to get worse, and
a lot more of the document should have been devoted to addressing
them.</p><p><a name="06101249000059">I am sorry to
take up so much time, but the issue of UK climate change has hardly
been addressed this afternoon, so I will be somewhat indulgent.
Paragraph 5 on page 130 of the document
states:</p><a name="brev_41"><a name="06101249000242"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Chapter
1 set out the way in which the UK&#146;s climate has changed in the

future.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101249000060">If
one examines chapter 1, however, that is not strictly true. Page 13 of

understandably, the document does not even set out what it states that
it sets out, which is where the United Kingdom climate is going in the
next century, because we do not know the answer. When people talk about
dealing with the effects of climate change, the discussion is often
predicated&#151;this is true of some of the adaptation plans in the
document&#151;on longer, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters in
most of the United Kingdom. That might not happen, however, because we
could end up with a Newfoundland climate. Those of us who have spent
time in Canada&#151;I have never been to Newfoundland, but I lived in
Canada for many years&#151;know that the climate is not nice, and the
latitude is similar to that of the UK.</p><p><a name="06101249000064">We should do a lot more on
storm damage, subsidence, health advice and research on plants,
including an each way bet&#151;will we get olives in the west
midlands, or will we get tundra plants, such as those grown in northern
Canada, because we have got a Newfoundland climate? We should consider
the built environment in terms of not only insulation, but bigger
gutters and drain pipes, because the rain will become more
torrential&#151;it has already become more torrential in parts of the
UK in recent years.</p><p><a name="06101249000065">Landslides because of heavy
rain are also an issue. Imagine if an event such as that at Boscastle
were to happen in, for example, London&#151;disaster! What are we
doing about disaster planning in looking to avoid landslides and so on
by taking prophylactic action?</p><p><a name="06101249000066">On
immigration control and ID cards, Opposition Members will not like it,
but we have to be realistic. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington,
South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry) rightly referred to the poorest
in the world being hit the hardest. They will understandably want to
move to the UK. What are we going to do about water supply? What are we
going to do about disease control when we have different diseases here?
What are we going to do about coastal erosion? What are we going to do
about polderising Norfolk to stop the flooding? What are we going to do
about the likely increased incidence of forest fires up in Scotland
with lightning strikes on dry timber, which I used to deal with for a
living?</p><p><a name="06101249000067">Those effects
of climate change are all happening in the UK. I urge the Government
seriously to address those effects as well as the wonderful work that
they have done on the causes&#151;emissions. I urge hon. Members to
wake up to the effects that we know are coming and not to continue to
have the kind of debate that we have had today, which, though
important, is almost
one-sided.</p><br>

Jeremy Hunt (South-West Surrey) (Con):</b> I am pleased to
follow the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris),
because I want to echo what he says about the dangers of cosy
consensus. We have had a lot of consensus in the Chamber this
afternoon, but that is easy to achieve when we talk only about what the
problem is and much harder if we take the difficult step of talking
about what the solutions might be.</p><p><a name="06101249000069">I do not want
to break the spirit of consensus, because it is important that parties
work together on this issue. I pay tribute to the Government for moving
it up the agenda, particularly at the Gleneagles summit last year, but
they have given us precious little detail as to how we are going to
meet the 60 per cent. reduction by 2050. That is a matter of great
concern to me. I come from a constituency that includes the town of
Godalming, which was the first town in the world to have a public
supply of electricity back in 1881. Interestingly, at that time public
transport used biomass as its fuel; now, 125 years later, we are coming
round to seeing that that might not have been such a bad
thing.</p><p><a name="06101249000070">We have
consensus in two areas but not in a third. We have consensus about the
scale of the climate change that is happening. The Secretary of State
said that there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now than there
has been for 750,000 years. I have heard scientists say that it is more
like 40 million years. Whichever it is, there is a huge amount of
CO2 in the atmosphere, on a scale as never before. NASA
scientists say that the earth is warmer than it has been for 1,000
years and within 1° of being warmer than it has been for 1
million years. That results in several of the effects that the hon.
Member for Wolverhampton, South-West talked about, such as
desertification in Africa, the melting of the ice caps and of
permafrost, and global dimming.</p><p><a name="06101249000071">There is, too, a relative
degree of scientific consensus about what will happen if we carry on as
we are: the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere will increase
from 380 parts per million towards 1,000 parts per million as a result
of the industrialisation of China, India and so on. There is a danger
that 50 million to 100 million people could be displaced, mainly in the
poor parts of the world, following the disappearance of islands and
countries.</p><p><a name="06101249000072">The difficult
question is what we should do about it. Today, Shell published a
projection that it would cost &#163;4 billion a year to deal with the
effects of climate change in a way that would meet our 2050 target of
reducing emissions by 20 per cent. That is a lot of money, but it is
less than a third of 1 per cent. of our gross domestic product. That is
a tiny price to pay for dealing with the sheer unpredictability of
messing around with our natural environment on the current scale. We
have to be brave and accept that there will be costs to pay.</p><p><a name="06101249000073">Another
significant change in this debate concerns my party. Under the
leadership of my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney
(Mr. Cameron), the Conservative party has made climate
change and the environment one of the issues that is right at the top
of our agenda. I like to think of it not as Saul having a conversion on
the road to Damascus but as a reaffirmation of our traditional beliefs
in conservation of the environment, and in not

important because the Conservative party has traditionally understood
the importance of wealth creation as an engine of change in society and
fought against over-regulation of business.</p><p><a name="06101249000074">If ever there was a
&#147;Nixon goes to China&#148; moment in the environment debate,
it is now. It means that there is now no excuse for the Government not
to introduce a climate change Bill. We need to see details of how we
will meet the 2050 target. The Government are good at long-term
targets. We had the 2050 target for reduction in CO2
emissions, a 2025 target for equality of respect for disabled
people and the 2015 millennium goals, to which we are all signed up.
They are important, but they could be described as NIMTO&#151;not in
my term of office&#151;goals. If we are to make progress, we need
targets that apply to all our terms of office. There is no excuse for
not introducing a climate change Bill and starting the national debate
about what we are going to do. I urge the Government, for the sake of
all our futures, to take that
opportunity.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_19"><a name="06101249000256">4.56

State on giving us such an excellent expos&#233; and clearly making
the case for concerted action to combat climate change.</p><p><a name="06101249000076">We can argue for ever and a day
about the role of climate change Bills and targets, but the important
thing is to devise solutions and implement them. Some solutions will be
short term, some will be medium term and others will be long term. Some
will involve more Government intervention and others will mean more
individual responsibility, and we need to get the balance
right.</p><p><a name="06101249000077">I was lucky
enough last week to have the opportunity to see a tidal turbine,
courtesy of Marine Current Turbines. It is an exciting project. We
watched the tide come in&#151;it is totally predictable&#151;and
produce enough energy for 800 homes. A few of those could obviously
fuel a town, and we all know how many towns are close to the coast.
There are therefore many opportunities, and I believe that the company
is hoping to sort something out in Northern Ireland after Christmas. It
will be its first commercial project there.</p><p><a name="06101249000078">I thank my hon. Friend the
Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) for raising the subject of clean
coal technology, which it is crucial to examine. Thirty-five per cent.
of our electricity is generated by coal in our existing power stations,
and that rose to 50 per cent. in the cold spell last winter. Clearly,
we will depend on that for a considerable time. We should do everything
possible to create a level playing field for clean coal technology. We
should also consider using more of our indigenous coal. The scales have
tipped and we are paying more for imported coal because of world coal
markets than we are giving our producers at home. That has serious
implications not only for security of supply and balance of payments
but for the local economy and transport. Why do we waste fuel
transporting coal around the world when we have it here? We need clean
coal technology and carbon capture technology. If we can get ahead of
the game, we can not only use it here but export it to countries such
as China and India, which will clearly use coal for a long
time.</p><br>

big solutions&#151;the expert solutions, such as developing
renewables and clean coal technology&#151;but what we can do in the
immediate future. We must convey the message that we cannot wait 10, 15
or 20 years, and that we have to act now. I shall make some suggestions
that may be unpopular, but I should like to open the debate on them,
and I hope that hon. Members will genuinely consider what we can
do.</p><p><a name="06101249000080">We should
seriously consider speed limits. We all want our cars and the freedom
to go to places and be flexible, and the individual opportunity that
those of us who own cars enjoy. But why could we not simply decide to
have a much reduced speed limit? There are advanced countries where 50
mph is the norm. There is a psychological effect: when someone who is
driving at 50 mph sees that everybody else is travelling at 70 mph or
80 mph, they feel that they are going very slowly. A psychological
change could easily lead to a change in behaviour. There would be cost
consequences: people would immediately save money on fuel and in other
ways. Few people realise how much of an economy they can make just by
travelling more slowly, but they cannot do that at the moment, because
unless everybody else does so, they will feel that they are slowing
everybody down. So I suggest a national speed limit of 50 mph, which
would have the obvious added effect of making our roads safer. Speed is
frequently a factor in fatal and serious
accidents.</p><p><a name="06101249000081">We could
also look at our urban speed limits. Speed is an extremely important
factor in serious urban road accidents, and many road safety campaigns
are highlighting the need for 20 mph limits in certain urban areas.
Many Members will have had constituents coming to them who are
desperate to get drivers to slow down as they pass their front doors.
But those who complain about that can the next moment be driving a
modern car themselves, not realising that they are going at a
considerable speed. We have the ability to drive at speed, but we
cannot change our human reaction speed. It would be nice if we could
achieve a sea change in mentality, so that slowing down could truly be
considered.</p><p><a name="06101249000082">I
now turn to the really controversial bit. In order to make this a cheap
change, I suggest that we interpret all our current speed signs not as
miles per hour, but as kilometres per hour. If we do that, we will not
need to change any of the national speed limit signs&#151;50 mph
would be 80 kph&#151;because we do not have 70 mph signs; instead,
because we have a national speed limit, we have &#147;end of speed
limit&#148; signs. So 30 mph signs in towns would actually mean 30
kph, which is approximately 20 mph, and 40 mph signs would mean 40 kph,
which is about 25 mph. That would also deal with the many requests that
we receive for improved traffic-calming measures and the introduction
of speed cameras.</p><p><a name="06101249000083">That
solution would cost very little, and it has the nice advantage that it
could easily be copied by many other countries. As has been mentioned
many times today, these issues affect not just our own country but our
fellow European Union member states and the rest of the world. If we
can do something, that would be a good example to others.</p><br>

has been mentioned many times before, but we must promote it in
partnership with our local government colleagues, because it is
something that we really can do. I know that people are terrified of
the idea of being tied to somebody else&#146;s routine for five days
a week, so let us introduce the idea in a more user-friendly way. If we
were to car-share three days a week, people would still have two days
when they could pop off to the shops, or whatever. The benefits in
terms of congestion in towns, for example, would be enormous. We see so
many queues of cars waiting to go through traffic lights with one
person in each car, but if there were three or four people per car, the
traffic would move three or four times more
quickly.</p><p><a name="06101249000085">There would
also be benefits in terms of pressure on parking. In many town centres,
people coming in to work clog up parking spaces, and as a result nobody
can come in to shop or to visit the town. That has a detrimental effect
on local traders and persuades people to use the big out-of-town
shopping centres. There would also be an impact on air quality in
towns, because fewer cars would lead to less pollution; andthe
impact on climate change goes without saying. There would also be
economic savings for commuters. The implementation
costs&#151;education, advertisingand promotion&#151;would
be extremely modest, and implementation could be achieved very
quickly.</p><p><a name="06101249000086">So there is
hope. As we have seen with the ozone layer, it is possible to reverse
trends, and we should grasp that hope as we address climate change. We
must make the necessary decisions, although I accept that they are very
difficult to make because they extend much further than simply the
issue of the ozone layer. It is easy to give up using spray
cans&#151;like my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West (Rob Marris), I have long since given up using
aerosols&#151;but it is important that we grasp the nettle and act
immediately to begin to halt, and then to reverse, the effects of
climate
change.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_20"><a name="06101249000257">5.4

recognise that it was he who represented Britain&#146;s position at
the Kyoto summit and played an active part in securing an agreement. At
that point, many of us thought that there was an opportunity for
Britain to show continuing international leadership as well as national
leadership. Perhaps it is part of the cycle of hope and disappointment
that is inevitable in politics that that has not really been followed

energy portfolio for the Liberal Democrats&#151;a post that I held
for a number of years. I was therefore one of our representatives on
the Standing Committee on the Energy Bill in 2000. Great efforts were
made by hon. Members on both sides of the House&#151;although
regrettably, not from either the Government or the Conservative Front
Bench&#151;to strengthen the Bill and to put into it some positive,
hard-edged proposals that would have implemented the kind of policies
that we need in this country if we are to change our behaviour and
modify the way in which we use energy.</p><p><a name="06101249000090">This is not all about taxation
policy, although that is important. Nor is it all about regulation,
although that is important, too. A lot is about changing the culture
involved in our acting out our lives. I should like to give a parallel
illustration. Long before I arrived in the House, legislation was
introduced to make it compulsory for motorists to wear seat belts. It
was not terribly popular, and for a long time it was not particularly
well observed. It is now very well observed, however, and people
believe that wearing seat belts simply goes with being in the
car.</p><p><a name="06101249000091">Another parallel
example that I have cited many times before is that of smoking on the
London underground. Smoking on the London underground was always
illegal, but it stopped when the King&#146;s Cross fire took place.
Not even the yobs smoke on the underground nowadays, because that has
become part of our culture. We need to ensure that the changes that we
introduce not only run with the grain of popular culture but encourage
it to go in the right direction.</p><p><a name="06101249000092">I was disappointed when many of
the measures proposed by hon. Members on both sides of the House for
inclusion in the Energy Bill in 2000 were not adopted. I shall give a
small practical example. At that stage, it would have been possible to
introduce a regulatory requirement that when electricity meters were
replaced, they should be replaced by intelligent two-way meters. An
attempt was made to introduce that provision, but it was
unsuccessful.</p><p><a name="06101249000093">In 2004 I was
fortunate enough to come first in the ballot for private
Members&#146; Bills. I chose to introduce the Bill that became the
Sustainable and Secure Buildings Act 2004, which amends the building
regulations set out in the Building Act 1984 and gives the Government
the opportunity to introduce building regulations relating to
sustainability, not only for new buildings but for existing ones. In
that way, we can begin to catch the 99 per cent. of buildings that have
already been built, and bring them up to an acceptable
standard.</p><p><a name="06101249000094">It was
interesting to hear what the hon. Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith)
said about traffic&#151;she is obviously absolutely right&#151;but
we need to recognise that our houses produce twice as much carbon each
year as our cars. We ought therefore to expend our political energy on
doing something about our building stock, and particularly about our
homes.</p><p><a name="06101249000095"><b><a name="_spnew129"><a name="06101249000281">Mr.

area.</p><p><a name="06101249000097">It is true that
opportunities are being missed all the time. My Bill specifically
included a provision that now allows the Government to make regulations
on the introduction of intelligent metering. Between 2000 and 2004, my
Bill received Royal Assent, I am delighted to say, but between those
dates 2 million electricity meters were installed to the old standards.
My Bill came into force in September 2004. Between then and now,
another 2 million electricity meters have been installed to the old
standards, because the provisions of my Bill have not been implemented
by the Government.</p><p><a name="06101249000098">I
simply say that, although I was delighted by what the Secretary of
State had to say&#151;he was very encouraging&#151;it is a pity
that he has only just discovered what the Deputy Prime Minister knew in
1998, which is that this is an urgent problem that needs immediate
action. The Secretary of State said that he was proud of this, that and
the other, and proud of something else. I am pleased about that as
well, but&#151;and that is the big &#147;but&#148;&#151;carbon
dioxide emissions are still going
up.</p><p><a name="06101249000099">To
take a very small example, it costs about &#163;5 to install an
intelligent meter, as opposed to the stupid meters we are installing at
present. Installing 4 million&#151;which have been put in since 2000,
when the first legislative opportunity was missed&#151;would have
cost an extra &#163;20 million, but that would have meant a
significant fraction of UK households having the capacity to install
renewable generation plant without even having to blink, and removed
one of the important barriers to
installation.</p><p><a name="06101249000100">What I
want to hear from the Secretary of State, and from the Minister when he
makes the winding-up speech, is exactly what they are planning to do.
The importance of having a Bill in the Queen&#146;s Speech lies not
in the Bill itself, or in precisely what that Bill says, but in giving
a timetable for performance that can be checked year by
year.</p><p><a name="06101249000101">I want to say
something to the Minister, and I really would like to hear the answer.
My Bill&#151;now my Act&#151;contains a requirement for the
Government to report to the House every two years what progress they
have made. It came into force in September 2004; it is now October
2006. The two years are up and the report has not been issued, and it
looks as though when it does come, it will be pretty
thin.</p><p><a name="06101249000102">Yes,
let us have another Act, and let it be Government legislation. The
Government supported my Bill, as did, I am delighted to report, the
hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth), who was one of
my sponsors. It was also supported by the hon. Member for Morley and
Rothwell and by Members all over the House. The support was apparently
unanimous, yet the Bill has not been implemented. Having a Bill in the
Queen&#146;s Speech is important, as is having the right things in
it, but let us hear from the Minister exactly what he is going to do,
and how he is going to tell us about
it.</p><p><a name="06101249000103">I suggest that the
first thing the Minister should do is talk to the Department for
Communities and Local Government. It holds my Bill in trust&#151;and
it is not delivering. Talk to the Department of Trade and Industry,
too, because it is responsible for generation

the Department for Transport, because transport is an important sector,
which has to be tackled. Talk to the Treasury, because taxation is also
a significant element of this.</p><p><a name="06101249000104">The most important thing is for
the Secretary of State to be clear in his own mind that while we can
produce press releases, and perhaps burn up political capital on
statements, declarations and conferences, as well as playing about over
what we do with our cars, what will make a difference in this country
is whether we tackle the built environment, in which 50 per cent. of
the energy we use is wasted, even though we already have on the statute
book the legislation that can deal with
it.</p><p><a name="06101249000105">Will the Minister
agree to take action where he does not need to do anything special? All
he needs to do is sign a couple of orders, get a few things going and
cut the energy waste of the built environment by 50 per cent. That,
surely, is an offer he cannot
refuse.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_21"><a name="06101249000258">5.14

Philip Dunne (Ludlow) (Con):</b> When I
became an MP, I approached this issue in relation to a concern about
peak oil, our reliance on fossil fuels and how we would provide the
energy to make our lives comfortable. However, having met former
Vice-President Al Gore at this summer&#146;s Hay-on-Wye literary
festival, and having seen extracts of his slide show, the urgency of
the global challenge was brought home to me in a way that it had not
been previously. I am especially pleased that this debate is taking
place in Government time.</p><p><a name="06101249000107">Much has been said about the
effects of global warming, illustrated by statistics, but we have not
touched on its impact on the acidification of the oceans. According to
the Royal Society, 50 per cent. of carbon dioxide emissions have been
absorbed by the world&#146;s oceans. The impact of that on fish
stocks alone is hard to predict. Joan Kleypas, a scientist from the US
National Centre for Atmospheric Research, has said
that</p><a name="brev_45"><a name="06101249000246"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;unfortunately,
this is not an environmental problem that we&#146;ve had to deal with
in the past, and so we really don&#146;t have a very good grasp of
what this means for ocean biology.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101249000108">As we speak, however, fish stocks in the
south Pacific are under threat. It is hard to predict the impact of
that, over time, on our ability to feed ourselves, but it is likely to
be adverse.</p><p><a name="06101249000109">I am pleased
that my neighbour, the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob
Marris), is back in his place, as I want to mention two effects in the
local area where we both live. Olive groves are not being planted in
Shropshire, but vineyards have been planted in the past decade that are
starting to bear fruit more rapidly than had been predicted&#151;so
there are some upsides. Activity to ameliorate the impact of flooding
has also occurred. As has been intimated, Shrewsbury, which has
suffered flooding in recent years, will have what I hope will prove to
be an effective flood barrier defence system. There are ways of
addressing some such problems locally. The problem of the constituency
of the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) falling into the
sea, which was mentioned earlier, is not

others are. It sounds like a rather more expensive challenge than
keeping Shrewsbury dry, but no doubt there is a challenge.</p><p><a name="06101249000110">What will we
do to answer those challenges? I do not have lots of natural solutions,
but I want to pick up on two or three. Clearly, this is a global
problem, and Members on both sides of the House must acknowledge the
work of the Government in seeking to lead international debate on the
issue, and I give credit to them, from the Prime Minister downwards.
However, the Government&#146;s thinking needs to be more joined up.
In a recent embarrassing example, only two Sundays ago, a Sunday
newspaper reported that the Secretary of State was in favour of a
scheme to privatise the rain forest. Within four days, he had issued a
denial saying that he was not in favour of privatising the rain forest
and that he had been misunderstood. It transpires that that was because
he had not bothered to discuss the matter with the Brazilian
Government, who took rather a dim view of the rain forest being
privatised.</p><p><a name="06101249000111">My hon.
Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) referred
appropriately to the challenge of deforestation and its contribution to
greenhouse gases. I hope that the Minister will pick up on his idea of
conservation credits.</p><p><a name="06101249000112"><b><a name="_spnew130"><a name="06101249000284">Mr.
Gummer:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that a blatant example
of the Government&#146;s double standards in international affairs
was that they joined the dirty countries in Europe to vote against
Austria and Denmark&#146;s proposal that we should put a date on the
banning of HFCs? At this moment, the Government are having four HFC
chillers installed in their refurbished former Home Office
building&#151;chillers that use a gas that is 2,000 times as bad for
global warming as
CO2.</p><p><a name="06101249000113"><b><a name="_spnew131"><a name="06101249000285">Mr.
Dunne:</b> That is a remarkably insightful intervention. I
intended to refer to a point that I came across yesterday when we were
talking about food procurement in the Public Accounts Committee. Other
hon. Members have mentioned the DHL contract, but out of the Department
of Health, the Department for Education and Skills and the Ministry of
Defence, only the latter is seriously considering the sustainability of
its food procurement and is bothering to visit other countries to
ensure that livestock is reared in accordance with UK welfare
standards. The other Departments have made no progress on that issue,
save some lip service paid to local
procurement.</p><p><a name="06101249000114">There is
a place for regulation. Other hon. Members, including the hon. Member
for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell), referred to a climate change Bill and
I am proud to have signed up to the &#147;big ask&#148;, mainly
because it will impose on the Government an obligation to report back
to this House, and to be seen to introduce measures that will start to
help to meet the targets. I am instinctively not someone who seeks to
impose undue regulation on business, but in this case the issue is so
significant that it requires a stimulus&#151;and this stimulus is
right.</p><p><a name="06101249000115">There is also a
place for taxation. There has been some discussion of party conferences
recently, and I enjoyed a debate at our party conference with members
of the Liberal Democrats, in which we discussed the

green taxation is therefore something that I have considered in some
detail. The Liberal Democrats&#146; proposals have some gaping holes,
because the behavioural changes that the taxation is designed to
introduce will reduce the revenues on which they hope to rely, should
their policies ever come into force.</p><p><a name="06101249000116"><b><a name="06101249000286">Chris
Huhne:</b> I assure the hon. Gentleman that the behavioural
changes, as far as we can estimate them from the MORI research
commissioned by the Government on the effects of the vehicle excise
duty changes, have been taken into account in the revenue
projections.</p><p><a name="06101249000117"><b><a name="06101249000287">Mr.
Dunne:</b> Luckily, we will never have to see those policies
put into
practice.</p><p><a name="06101249000118">There is
broad consensus on the polluter pays principle across the Chamber, but
the difficulty is that energy costs are a higher proportion of the
income of lower income households, whether in transport, heating or
other usages. Therefore, most such taxes are highly regressive. That is
why much thought needs to go into green taxation. It should not be
dreamed up on the back of an envelope. I urge the Government to
consider carefully, as our Front Bench team is doing, what green
taxation we should consider, especially as it impinges on individual
households, to ensure that it is introduced as sensitively as
possible.</p><p><a name="06101249000119"><b><a name="06101249000288">Chris
Huhne:</b> The hon. Gentleman is making a direct criticism of
our proposals, but we specifically did not propose any green taxes on
households for the reasons that he gives. Our proposals were for two
transport taxes&#151;aviation and vehicle excise duty. If he reads
the recent study done for the Nordic Council, he will see that those
taxes are not regressive as they have been applied in the Nordic
countries. Some 28 per cent. of British households have no access to a
car, so they will not be affected by a tax on new cars, and the average
income of a person flying out of UK airports is little short of
&#163;50,000, which is double the national average. The hon.
Gentleman is misinformed on the progressive or regressive effects of
green taxes.</p><p><a name="06101249000120"><b><a name="06101249000289">Mr.
Dunne:</b> I do not want to turn this into a slanging match
between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats on their respective
proposals for green taxation. However, I will just say that the impact
on aviation use of the significant fuel price increases of the past
five years has been negligible. How a tax on air tickets would have an
impact has yet to be explained.</p><p><a name="06101249000121">Finally, I shall deal briefly
with the role that the Government have to play in technical innovation,
leadership and pump-priming for technological solutions. There are
various examples of Government putting their toe in the water and
trying to introduce market solutions by means of pump-priming, but the
results have been disappointing. The clear skies initiative came to an
end earlier this year, and has been replaced by a scheme that provides
less funding for households to convert their energy sources to
renewables such as solar. That is very disappointing, given all the
rhetoric about what the Government are doing to encourage just
that.</p><br>

Church Stretton in my constituency next month to address a climate
change symposium organised by the Methodists. I should like to invite
him to come to see a scheme, funded by the Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs, that involves the first operating anaerobic
digester in the country, by means of which putrescible household and
green waste is turned into electricity</p><p><a name="06101249000123">The scheme has been set up by
South Shropshire district council, with full cross-party support from
Liberal Democrat, Conservative and independent councillors. I am afraid
that the council does not contain any Labour councillors, but I should
like to show the Minister the facility in action. The Department has a
pot of money to fund such projects that amounts to &#163;30 million,
and &#163;2 million has been made available to support the initiative
in my constituency. However, the disappointing thing is that it is the
only one that is up and running, and my impression is that most of the
money devoted to other initiatives across the country has been absorbed
by legal fees, research and feasibility studies. I am sure that the
Minister will be keen to see the project, given that there is very
little else to show for all the work that has been done.</p><p><a name="06101249000124">Science has a big part to play
in these matters. British companies are innovative and keen to take
advantage of whatever pump-priming the Government are prepared to put
in place. They are willing to meet the regulatory burdens placed on
them in the search for alternative solutions, and that is why I was
impressed to hear that my party is proposing a prize for innovation in
the commercial development of wave technology. That is an example of
the imagination needed to get such enterprises
going.</p><p><a name="06101249000125">For example, we
had a drought this summer. Why did no one suggest undertaking the
commercial exploitation of desalination? The world needs more water,
and I am not aware of a single commercial desalination plant that does
not rely on subsidy. It is exactly the sort of project on which leading
British universities can bring their expertise to bear in finding a
practical

important at every level. Housing and energy are absolutely critical
and my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell) made a
good case for the implementation of his measure, the Sustainable and

later.</p><p><a name="06101249000130">I am worried
about transport issues and very much liked the suggestion about speed
limits made by the hon. Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith). It is a
good idea and would be cheap to implement. The ease with which ordinary
people can do things and the cheapness of proposals is
important.</p><p><a name="06101249000131">I want
briefly to speak about travel planning, which involves a lifestyle
survey of an area to find out who could give up their car and what
public transport is available. There is no chance of change for 30 per
cent. of people, but others can make changes if they are given the
right information and support. In Perth, in southern Australia, travel
planning reduced congestion by 15 per cent., which is about the same
reduction as under the congestion charge, but without even a penny of
investment in
infrastructure.</p><p><a name="06101249000132">Many
people will not get on a bus because they do not know where it goes or
where to change buses. Travel planning is a good thing, because it
shows people what they can do. I championed it when I was chair of
transport at the London assembly. Indeed, Transport for London has just
sent me a travel planning survey form, so it has now arrived in Hornsey
and Wood Green. We are okay in London, but many areas of the country
could never undertake travel planning because they do not have the
public transport infrastructure to develop it. There is a woeful need
for investment in public
transport.</p><p><a name="06101249000133">Even in
London, where I have used public transport for six years, I was forced
back into my car by the collapse of the Northern line last November and
its ongoing problems thereafter. As I had to use my car I decided not
to use planes, so I made some strange, but enjoyable, train journeys
around Europe this summer. However, I had to catch a plane to go to
Prague.</p><p><a name="06101249000134">Ordinary
people have ordinary lives, and my experience shows that, as my hon.
Friend the Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) said, we can
carbon-offset our consciences if we have to use aeroplanes. We should
think about disseminating those means and mechanisms to the ordinary
folk. We must all do our bit. We do not have to wear hair shirts and
never use our cars, but each of us needs to do a little and there are
many ways to do
it.</p><p><a name="06101249000135">The hon. Member

groundbreaking speech, which called for action against global warming,
and was reinforced by subsequent speeches to the United Nations,
Britain has continued to play an international leadership
role.</p><p><a name="06101249000141">I
start by paying tribute to the current Prime Minister and successive
Labour Environment Ministers for keeping the issue of climate change on
the international agenda. Indeed, the appointment of the new Foreign
Secretary, who has a record of commitment to tackling carbon dioxide
emissions and a sound understanding of the issues, has undoubtedly
further reinforced Britain&#146;s international reputation in the
field. The new Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs&#151;wherever he is at the moment&#151;clearly has a very
real personal
commitment.</p><p><a name="06101249000142">We may not
have a written agreement, sadly, but there is a consensus in British
politics about the need to tackle the causes of climate change. This
afternoon&#146;s debate has demonstrated the breadth of concern right
across the Chamber. Barely a week goes by now without yet more
scientific studies reporting that climate change is not only happening,
but increasing at a faster rate than previously anticipated and that
the effects are being felt more widely and more acutely with every
passing year.</p><p><a name="06101249000143">Since
Margaret Thatcher made that famous speech at the end of the 1980s, we
have witnessed a succession of the hottest years on record. In the past
decade, we have seen not just a rise in global temperatures, but a
catastrophic increase in extreme weather across the
globe&#151;whether shown by Hurricane Katrina in the northern
hemisphere, the onset of previously unheard of hurricanes in the
southern hemisphere, flooding in south-east Asia or the relentless
onward march of drought and desertification across Africa. At the north
and south poles, the icecaps continue to shrink at an alarming
rate.</p><p><a name="06101249000144">We have gone
beyond the point at which it is sufficient simply to alert the world to
the dangers of climate change. We are now entering a crucial stage in
the battle against global warming. We are now entering what leading
scientific opinion calls the tipping point. In the most sensible part
of the Secretary of State&#146;s opening speech, he quite rightly
referred to the window

450 to 550 parts per million, but that window will close.</p><p><a name="06101249000145">As several hon. Members have so
clearly articulated this afternoon, unless we, the developed world, act
decisively in the next few years significantly to reduce our carbon
emissions, any future reduction may well be in vain because the carbon
in the atmosphere will be sufficient to ensure the onset of the most
extreme aspects of climate change. That is why this afternoon&#146;s
debate is so important and why it is so vital that the Government turn
more of their words into
action.</p><p><a name="06101249000146">I do not doubt
that the DEFRA Ministers are in earnest in their desire to tackle our
nation&#146;s carbon emissions, but the fact is that we in the UK are
still emitting more carbon in 2006 than we were in 1997. I applaud the
Government&#146;s efforts to take a global leadership position on
climate change, but that rings a little hollow when it is not matched
by successful action at home. Taken in the round, and being honest,
Labour&#146;s record on climate change has been good, but in the face
of such an enormous challenge, it is simply not good enough. We must
see far greater urgency and a willingness to take decisions
now.</p><p><a name="06101249000147">The
Conservative party, sadly, has the enforced luxury of opposition.
Despite the turbulence on the Government Benches, sadly, we are not
anticipating a general election anytime soon. So we Conservatives are
taking time to study the problem carefully, to consult widely and to
draw in Britain&#146;s greatest experts, as well as to look abroad
for inspiration, so that we are prepared and ready to hit the ground
running when we take over the reins of government. However, Ministers
are the Government; they have a very real responsibility to act now.
Already too much time has been wasted on endless iterative
consultations and short-term initiatives, some of which have merit; but
in total, they have failed to produce sufficient cuts in carbon
emissions, which we so desperately need to achieve. Such a commitment
must be shared right across the Government, not just in
DEFRA.</p><p><a name="06101249000148">Personally,
while speaking in the Committee that considered the Climate Change and
Sustainable Energy Act 2006, I frequently saw a willingness to be
progressive and ambitious in DEFRA or in the DTI, but I constantly saw
that undermined by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister or the
Treasury. Perhaps there would be less resistance right across Whitehall
if Ministers heeded the remarks of the hon. Member for Morley and
Rothwell (Colin Challen), not just his praise for Mrs.
Thatcher, but his plea for a renewed effort for a genuine cross-party
consensus on climate
change.</p><p><a name="06101249000149">As my right
hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) has said,
tackling climate change is our social responsibility to the next
generation; but, in politics, it is much easier to take the steps that
will be painful if political parties work together, instead of just
playing things for partisan advantage&#151;and I am looking
particularly at the Liberal Benches when I make those remarks.
Therefore, although Conservative Members continue to hold the
Government to account for their actions, or lack of action, with
increasing vigour, we recognise that, with the politics of climate
change, business as usual, as we understand it at Westminster, is not
appropriate. Just as this House

been a host of thoughtful, well judged and provocative contributions
from both sides of the House. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North

her knowledge and immense personal expertise. My hon. Friend the Member
for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) made a thoughtful and well
informed contribution that demonstrated his expertise. He quite clearly
stated that one does not have to be a fan of the euro, or want to sign
up to a federal constitution, to see the need for an effective EU
collective voice on the environment. My hon. Friend the Member for
Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge), who is a member of the
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, spoke with great
expertise about the impact of climate change on his constituency. The
hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) was quite right to say
that we can all take individual actions to make a difference.</p><p><a name="06101249000151">The hon. Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) spoke passionately about the
importance of adaptation. Of course we can and must do more in that
respect, but we must not lose our single most important focus on taking
action now to avert the need to take adaptation measures later. My hon.
Friend the Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt), in a
short, but pithy speech, was quite right to say that there is no excuse
for the Government not to bring in a climate change Bill. My hon.
Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne), in a speech in
which he demonstrated great vision and ambition for further innovation,
again impressed on the House the need for cross-party consensus. The
hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone) came up

it is not that the Government are moving in the wrong
direction&#151;there is much in the Government&#146;s programme
that we support&#151;but simply that they are not moving fast enough
or with sufficient urgency. Where are the big actions to back the big
thinking? They were certainly not mentioned in the energy review, which
turned out to be a rather timid and unambitious document. Where are the
steps to make decentralised energy a reality? Where are the steps to
turn energy efficiency from a small-scale incremental programme into an
urgent and demanding national roll-out? Where are the measures to
reform the remit of Ofgem to focus more directly on carbon emissions
and not just price? Where are the measures to reform the renewables
obligation, to move the share of funding for renewables beyond just
onshore wind and landfill methane gas to the whole universe of exciting
emerging technologies?</p><p><a name="06101249000153">Where are the measures to deal

local councils, which can play a key role in reducing the carbon
footprint of new UK housing and new-build commercial and industrial
premises, to go faster and further in raising eco-standards than the
Government are prepared to do nationally? Where are the measures to

deal of ground and given the Minister a great deal to respond to, but
at its heart is one clear message, which comes from Members on the
Benches all around him and which comes loud and clear from the
Conservatives: we need a climate change Bill in the Queen&#146;s
Speech. We need a climate change Bill that will require Ministers to
draw up plans to deliver the year-on-year cuts in CO2
emissions needed to prevent dangerous climate change; a climate
change Bill that will require an annual report to Parliament on
progress in meeting those targets; a climate change Bill that will keep
emissions on track by requiring any Government falling behind the
targets to improve policies and create new powers to monitor
Ministers&#146; progress; and a climate change Bill that would also
be an opportunity to make any regulatory changes required to begin
reducing carbon emissions. If the Government are prepared to bring
forth such a measure in November, they will not buy our silence, but
they will gain our active and genuine
support.</p><p><a name="06101249000155">It is vital
that we all face up to the threat of global warming with a sense of
common purpose. However, we should continue to challenge each other
across the Floor of the House to go further, faster and deeper in
finding solutions to global warming. We are at the tipping point. Time
is running out, but Conservative Members are optimistic that if we can
find the will, time still remains to face down the challenge of climate
change
together.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_24"><a name="06101249000261">5.45

ground. The Government certainly want to go further, faster and

it is happening and what are we going to do about
it.</p><p><a name="06101249000158">The 10 warmest
years in our history since records began have all occurred since 1990.
In July, most parts of the UK experienced the hottest month that they
had ever seen. Just last month was the warmest September in Birmingham
since the 18th century. In 2003, the heat wave across Europe cost about
30,000 lives. The general consensus of scientific opinion is that if we
do not tackle climate change, those temperatures will be the norm by
2050, and it might be the case that it will never get that cold during
the summer by
2080.</p><p><a name="06101249000159">The latest
assessment of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, which is
in the process of being revised, predicts that the average rise in
temperature from 1990 levels will be between 1.4 and 5.8° C by
the end of this century. Even at the bottom of that

welcome Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members&#146;
acknowledgement of the role of the Prime Minister and the Government in
trying to lead international opinion on developing a post-Kyoto
consensus on climate change. I accept that we have a moral
responsibility to lead on the matter and we are doing just that. Last
week in Monterrey, Mexico, we helped to take the debate forward. My
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made a major contribution
there that followed on from our decision to put climate change at the
top of our agenda during our presidencies of the G8 and the European
Union. Key discussions took place at
Monterrey.</p><p><a name="06101249000161">The Stern
review, which will be published shortly, will clearly show that the
costs of dealing with climate change will be far less than those of
dealing with its consequences. The International Energy Agency, with
its international energy perspectives, shows that the technologies
exist and can be developed for the future. The World Bank is showing
through its plans for an energy investment framework that, if we have
the political will globally, we can provide funding to ensure that
low-carbon technologies are adopted throughout the developing world,
which will be crucial if we are to move towards a low-carbon
world.</p><p><a name="06101249000162"><b><a name="06101249000295">Mr.

Pearson:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is very experienced in
the ways of the House, and I am sure that he will find a way to ask
that question directly of the Home Office. In July, we published new
sustainable operational targets for the Government estate. We have said
that we want the estate to be carbon-neutral by 2012&#151;a major
commitment&#151;and we will press on with measures, including
responding to the sustainable procurement taskforce, so that we lead

importance of the contraction and convergence model. The Government,

others around. What is clear is that, whatever model is chosen, we need
to secure international agreement on a post-Kyoto international

respond to the many other comments made during the
debate.</p><p><a name="06101249000168">This
Government are one of the few currently on course to meet our Kyoto
targets. In fact, we will almost double the reductions that we set
through the Kyoto process. We have, with the climate change programme
and the energy review, a range of policy measures that are setting us
on a path towards reducing CO2 emissions by 60 per cent. by
2050. We need to do more, and I want to respond directly to a number of
specific points made in the debate.</p><p><a name="06101249000169">First, on
the question of a Bill, I am sure that the House will not expect me to
divulge what is or is not in the Queen&#146;s Speech, but I can say
that we are examining carefully the case for a statutory framework. We
are having discussions about that and we are well aware of the strength
of feeling of hon. Members and many of their constituents who have
written to them on these issues.</p><p><a name="06101249000170">The hon. Member for East Surrey
(Mr. Ainsworth) referred to the climate change levy and
agreements. I know that he and his party are not in favour of the levy,
but by the end of last year that measure had saved16.5 million
tonnes of carbon and it will go on to save approximately 3.5 million
tonnes a year. It is an important part of tackling
emissions.</p><p><a name="06101249000171">In an
important contribution, my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy
Tipping) mentioned clean coal and the importance of carbon capture and
storage as a future technology. The International Energy Agency has
highlighted that, and I think that it is key to the future. It will be
vital for countries such as China and the United States, which will
continue to burn fossil fuels. Making sure that they do that in a
carbon-neutral way is
crucial.</p><p><a name="06101249000172">The shadow
junior environment Minister said from a sedentary position that he
thought the renewables obligation a waste of money. That is
emphatically not the case. It has enabled us to take a great leap
forward in renewable electricity generation, which has almost trebled
since it was introduced. There are 16 GW of applications in process,
with a further 11,500 MW in the planning system. If we reach our
targets, that will equate to about 2.5 million tonnes of carbon a year.
That is another example of the Government being serious and introducing
policy initiatives that will make a difference in reducing our CO2
emissions.</p><p><a name="06101249000173"><b><a name="06101249000301">Gregory
Barker:</b> We have not said that the renewables obligation is
a complete failure, but we are strongly critical of the fact that the
largest beneficiary of the RO, which is paid for out of every single
electricity user&#146;s bill, is not some innovative new technology,
but landfill methane gas. The second largest beneficiary is onshore
wind&#151;a technology that, in Germany, is managed without any
subsidy at all. A host of other technologies in their early stages are
being starved of
funding.</p><p><a name="06101249000174"><b><a name="06101249000302">Ian
Pearson:</b> I am concerned about that intervention, because
it does not show a commitment to the renewables obligation, or even a
reformed version. In fact, it questions its basic existence, and that
is not an acceptable or responsible policy position.</p><br>

was the subject of a typically powerful contribution by my hon. Friend
the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris). I often discuss
adaptation. In fact, I went to Kew gardens to speak about it, and about
the fact that the English lawn is under threat as a result of climate
change. He mentioned the UK climate impacts programme, which is an
important initiative, and the adaptation policy framework that the
Government are developing. We must adapt that framework more quickly. I
agree that we need to do more research, although we are doing a great
deal of research into the impacts of climate change and how we can
adapt to it.</p><p><a name="06101249000176">The role
of local government in helping to reduce our carbon footprint has not
been mentioned at all today. As some hon. Members will be aware, more
than 150 local authorities have signed the Nottingham declaration, and
are taking action on both mitigation and adaptation. My hon. Friend
might like to look at the website, which includes a range of measures
that can be undertaken on adaptation. That is an important
contribution, but we need to do more.</p><p><a name="06101249000177">Flood
defence, as well as sustainable urban drainage, which has not been
mentioned today, are important. Sustainable drainage and more effective
land management are part of the innovative solutions that we need to
develop as part of an adaptation framework. I accept that flood defence
and flood risk management are vital for the future. As my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State said, we have not cut the capital budget
in the floods programme. I stress that we are spending 35 per cent.
more in real terms on flood risk management than we were in 1996-97,
and I have no doubt that that we will need to spend more in future.
However, it is important to recognise the progress that we have
made.</p><p><a name="06101249000178">The hon. Member
for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) mentioned deforestation. I
agree that that is an important subject, albeit complex and difficult.
There are some methodological problems, but the Government think that a
market-based approach such as conservation credits is more likely to
deliver. Turning to the built environment, may I remind the hon. Member
for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell) that we improved part L of the
building regulations in 2002, 2005 and 2006? Homes are now 40 per cent.
more energy efficient than they were just four years ago, but we have
to do more, and we must progressively tighten up the regulations. The
new planning policy statement on climate change that we want to
introduce will be important in ensuring that we do more on the subject
of the built
environment.</p><p><a name="06101249000179">Lastly,
on recycling, we announced today that our annual targets had been met.
The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) mentioned
recycling, which has nearly quadrupled since 1997. However, we need to
double that rate&#151;again, that is another area in which we need to
do more.</p><p><a name="06101249000180">Tomorrow&#146;s climate is
today&#146;s challenge for Governments, the business community and
each of us as individuals, because we are all in it together. We must
work across boundaries&#151;geographical, social and
political&#151;to secure an international agreement on a future
framework to stabilise CO2 emissions which is robust and
fair to developing
countries.</p><p><a name="06101249000181"><i> It being

opportunity to highlight the important issues surrounding neonatal
care. There may not be as many speakers in this Adjournment debate as
there were in the preceding one, and it may not go on as long, but I
hope the response from the Minister on the Treasury Bench will be as
positive as that given to the preceding
debate.</p><p><a name="06101249000188">BLISS, which
is funded almost entirely through donations and grants, is the leading
national charity focusing on neonatal care and has been established for
more than 25 years. I appreciate the support that the charity has
provided to me in making me aware of the amazing work that goes on in
neonatal care, as well as some of the challenges. I understand that my
hon. Friend the Minister will be presenting an award at the inaugural
BLISS ceremony on 24 October, which confirms the Government&#146;s
respect for
BLISS.</p><p><a name="06101249000189">One
in eight babies born in the UK requires neonatal care, which represents
80,000 children, 17,000 of whom will require intensive care. About
11,000 babies in London each year need the extra care provided in
neonatal units. The majority of the babies in neonatal units are there
because they were born prematurely. However, there are a diverse range
of other causes. For example, a child born with an infection might
require antibiotics, some children need help to breathe via a
ventilator, and other children with a serious case of jaundice may need
to kept under observation in a neonatal
unit.</p><p><a name="06101249000190">The strides
taken forward in the past two decades are there for us all to see. In
the mid-1980s only one in five babies weighing less than 1 kg at birth
could survive. That proportion has increased rapidly and stands at four
in five babies. The fact that four in five babies now survive, compared
with one in five in the 1980s, is testament not only to the
technological advances achieved in this period, but to the tireless
efforts of doctors and nurses who, as I am sure hon. Members on both
sides of the House will agree, can never receive too much
praise.</p><p><a name="06101249000191">The number of
babies born prematurely has also increased significantly in recent
years. A number of social factors have contributed to the escalating
numbers of premature births. The increased prevalence of fertility
treatment has resulted in a corresponding rise in multiple births,
which are more likely to result in premature labour. When women have
children later in life there is an increased prospect of obstetric
complications, particularly if mothers are over 40 years of age at the
time of giving birth. Babies born as a result of teenage pregnancy are
also at high risk of being born premature and/or at a low birth-weight.
Unfortunately, the UK still has the highest rate of teenage pregnancies
in western Europe. Mothers from ethnic minority backgrounds are more
likely to give birth to a baby with a low
birth-weight.</p><p><a name="06101249000192">The
need for effective neonatal care is becoming ever more apparent and
growing. However, the capacity of neonatal services is not sufficient
to cope with the current demand, let alone future needs. I welcomed the

between 2003 and 2006, which among other benefits helped to establish
five neonatal networks across London, a neonatal transfer service to
transport babies to an alternative hospital when necessary, and an
increase in
capacity.</p><p><a name="06101249000193">The Greater
London authority report, &#147;Counting the Cots&#148;, which was
published in May this year, also highlighted the point that the number
of neonatal cots in London has increased by 12 per cent. in the past
four years. London has 77 more neonatal cots in 2006 than it had in
2002. The report concluded that</p><a name="brev_49"><a name="06101249000250"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;neonatal care services are
generally working
well&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06101249000194">for which the
Government deserve huge
praise.</p><p><a name="06101249000195">Notwithstanding
that encouraging progress, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister
recognises the urgent need to go even further. In July this year, I
visited the neonatal unit at St. George&#146;s hospital in my
constituency for the second time in recent months. The visit provided
me with the opportunity to meet the parents of premature babies and the
staff, who make an invaluable contribution. Visiting a neonatal unit is
a reminder of how our NHS does a fantastic job giving hope and joy to
the parents of those tiny miracles. Premature babies are some of the
most vulnerable patients, and they are looked after by skilled,
specialist caring staff, who also provide tremendous support to
understandably distressed
parents.</p><p><a name="06101249000196">St.
George&#146;s hospital plays an integral role in the provision of
neonatal care in south-west London. The Department of Health review,
which was published in April 2003, recommended that neonatal care
should be reconstructed into clinical networks with units divided into
three levels depending on the level of care that the hospital can
provide. First, there are intensive care units, where one nurse looks
after one baby. Those units are necessary for babies with particularly
complicated medical needs. Secondly, there are high-dependency units,
where a nurse should be responsible for no more than two babies. Those
units are necessary for babies weighing less than 1 kg who do not need
intensive care, but who still require treatment, such as intravenous
feeding. Finally, there are special care units, where a nurse should
not have responsibility for more than four babies. Those units are
necessary for babies who require regular
monitoring.</p><p><a name="06101249000197">The
system ensures that each region has at least one hospital that can
offer so-called level 3 intensive care support for the mothers of
premature or ill babies. I am pleased that the hospital in my
constituency where my two daughters were born not so long ago&#151;I
was also born there slightly longer ago&#151;offers the most advanced
neonatal care in south-west London. The Government recommend that 95
per cent. of premature babies should be cared for within their local
network, but too many mothers still have to travel hundreds of miles to
obtain the appropriate level of neonatal
care.</p><p><a name="06101249000198">More
than 90 per cent. of units were compelled to transfer patients last
year because of lack of capacity. The neonatal units at St.
George&#146;s hospital accepted transfer cases from areas such as
Brighton, Farnborough, Southampton and Wrexham Park, which is near
Slough. While I accept that a system of networks is the most effective
method of supporting parents, we cannot escape

<notus-date day="12" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>12 Oct 2006 : Column 558</b><br>the fact that there needs to be an increase in the number of specialist
nurses, cots and dedicated transport services to alleviate those
concerns. In that regard, many hon. Members hope that the
Minister&#146;s excellent relationship with the Treasury, as result
of his previous ministerial experience, will enable him successfully to
lobby the Treasury in the 2007 spending review for an even greater
prioritisation of funding to health services for sick and premature
babies.</p><p><a name="06101249000199">The
British Association of Perinatal Medicine believes that the average
occupancy of neonatal units should be 70 per cent. to ensure that
capacity is available in unforeseen circumstances. Recent research
undertaken by BLISS highlighted that 78 per cent. of units nationwide
have been forced to close to new admissions as a result of insufficient
capacity. Furthermore, St. George&#146;s hospital has an average
occupancy rate of 91 per cent. of its cots. In 2005, it had to turn
away 518 babies because of the lack of staffed cots. In fact, the unit
had to be closed to new admissions as recently as 3 October, which is
one of 71 days in the past six months in which that situation arose.
More alarmingly, I have been advised thatSt. George&#146;s
is currently 27 nurses short of the standard set by BAPM, if it is to
achieve the level 3 target of one nurse caring for no more than one
child.</p><p><a name="06101249000200">I realise that
resources in the NHS are finite, but it is clear that the lack of
national nursing standards and of a national focus mean that local
trusts and PCTs are not giving neonatal units the funding that they
require. When difficult choices about the allocation of resources need
to be made, neonatal units suffer. Research from BLISS found that only
3 per cent. of units in the UK can provide one-to-one nursing for
premature babies in intensive care. It estimates the nursing shortfall
to be about 2,700, including 540 in London alone. Moreover, a third of
the most highly qualified neonatal nurses currently employed in
hospitals will retire within the next three years.</p><p><a name="06101249000201">Health
professionals and specialists were keen to stress to me that the
recruitment and retention of doctors in neonatal units has markedly
improved under this Government. However, there is a problem with regard
to suitably qualified and experienced neonatal nurses. One of the main
reasons for that is the uncertainty generated by the lack of national
guidance and primary care trusts not funding staff at the appropriate
levels. I hope that my hon. Friend is in a position to reassure the
House that the Government are listening to those concerns and will
urgently investigate them.</p><p><a name="06101249000202">Many of the
health professionals to whom I spoke welcome the Government&#146;s
proposed reforms in neonatal health care. Nevertheless, they have
stressed the need for improved delivery mechanisms within neonatal
care. There is a particular problem with a commissioning system that
appears disjointed. Neonatal intensive care is deemed to be a
&#147;specialist service&#148; and is therefore commissioned by a
number of PCTs sharing the investment and associated risk of
commissioning funding to this important area. In contrast, level 1
neonatal care is commissioned by the relevant PCTs
individually.</p><p><a name="06101249000203">Another
problem that the specialists identified is that of insufficient
inducements provided by the Department of Health for PCTs to ring-fence
the necessary funding for neonatal care, which is compounded by the
lack of national standards that I mentioned. I ask my hon. Friend for
his help in persuading PCTs of the fundamental

of service provision in this area. At the same time, I ask him urgently
to look into improving the commissioning of neonatal care and the
allocation of future funding. One of the things that we have been very
good at is starting to involve patient representation and parental
involvement within neonatal care. There are now several user
involvement projects that recruit, train, and then support parents who
wish to become board members for neonatal networks as user
representatives. Parents need to be more involved with the
commissioning of local community services. I am sure that any support
that the Department of Health can provide in this area will reap
benefits for all
users.</p><p><a name="06101249000204">As
hon. Members will know, the Healthcare Commission has a statutory duty
to evaluate the performance of healthcare organisations. Unfortunately,
it still has not conducted an investigation into neonatal care.
Maternity and paediatric services have been thoroughly investigated by
the commission, and improvements made as a consequence, but that is not
the case with neonatal care. I understand that an audit of neonatal
services has just been commissioned and is currently being undertaken
by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. However, an audit
that merely monitors such variables as transfers and occupancy rates is
insufficient and does not compensate for the lack of an investigation.
I hope that my hon. Friend will provide the House with a commitment
that he will look into the Healthcare Commission&#146;s embarking on
an examination into neonatal care in the near
future.</p><p><a name="06101249000205">The national
health service has made significant progress since 1997, with waiting
lists and waiting times down significantly. Record numbers of patients
are being treated, with record numbers of lives being saved. Neonatal
care has also made huge strides, but there is concern among parents,
staff and professionals that more can and must be done in this vital
area. I am therefore pleased that I have had the opportunity to
highlight these issues in the House. I am grateful for the attention of
my hon. Friend the Minister and very much look forward to his
response.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_27"><a name="06101249000264">6.13

his generosity. I, too, pay tribute to the work of BLISS, which is a
fantastic organisation. The hon. Member for Tooting (Mr.
Khan) has done well to mention its work in the House this
evening.</p><p><a name="06101249000211">However, if
care is contracted to specialist units, it moves increasingly further
from where the mums and dads live. Many parents travel a long distance
to see their babies in special care units. I would have expected
parents from my constituency to have to travel to London to the
excellent units there, but some have ended up in Yarmouth or
Nottingham. That causes parents grave concern, at a time when anxiety
is already high. Is there any way that we can reconsider the
configurations so that parents do not have to travel so
far?</p><p><a name="06101249000212"><b><a name="06101249000307">Mr.
Lewis:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important, valid point.
We must be sensitive. Anyone who knows people who have been through
trauma and concern at such a stage in a baby&#146;s life realises how
horrendously stressful it is for parents and the wider family. The
difficulty is the concept of determining local configuration
nationally. It becomes a contradictory position in the context of
independence for operational decisions in the health service, which is
the Conservative party&#146;s new policy. However, I do not want to
bring politics into the
discussion.</p><p><a name="06101249000213">A genuine
problem is that at some times in the system, there are pressures on
beds that do not occur throughout the year. In some periods there are
many empty beds, which means that there is no problem with people
getting the sort of care that they need closer to home. Unfortunately,
at other times beds are full, and that presents major problems for the
system and the affected
families.</p><p><a name="06101249000214"><b><a name="06101249000308">Mike
Penning:</b> No easy
answers.</p><p><a name="06101249000215"><b><a name="06101249000309">Mr.
Lewis:</b> Indeed. However, we must be sensitive and I urge
all those who make the decisions to be aware that such a situation is
difficult for any family, and to take account of that when they decide
about the location, quality and nature of the health care
available.</p><p><a name="06101249000216">There will
be occasions when transfer to a more specialist unit may offer better
outcomes. Sometimes the sort of medical and other expertise available
means that it would be better, in terms of reassurance and saving
lives, for the babies and the parents to go further away from home than
would normally be desirable. However, transferring a mother or baby
must be done in a planned, informed way and for the best clinical
reasons.</p><p><a name="06101249000217">Several
challenges need to be addressed. My hon. Friend the Member for Tooting
referred to some of them. Happily, the increased capability of
technology and the development of health care expertise has led to more
very premature or very low birth weight babies being born alive and
surviving. Such babies require prolonged periods of intensive
supportive care, often

<meta name="Date" content="12 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="12" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>12 Oct 2006 : Column 561</b><br>over several weeks. It is important that there is enough capacity in the
national health service to meet that demand.</p><p><a name="06101249000218">The
Department established an expert review group on neonatal intensive
care to provide advice on the most effective ways of caring for very
sick or very premature newborn babies. It considered the views of
professionals and parents whose babies had received care from the
service. The review group published its findings in 2003. It suggested
a more structured, collaborative approach to caring for newborn babies,
and proposed that hospitals work closely together in formal, managed
networks to provide the safest and most effective service for mothers
and babies. That would include the designation of some hospitals
specially equipped to care for the sickest and smallest babies, with
other hospitals providing high dependency care and shorter periods of
intensive care as close to home as possible. Subsequent to that report,
we have been supporting the specialised services commissioners for
neonatal intensive care as they work with the NHS locally to facilitate
the development of neonatal managed clinical networks. Such networks
are incredibly important.</p><p><a name="06101249000219">It is also important to
say&#151;this is linked to a point that I made to the hon. Member for
Hemel Hempstead&#151;that it was not central Government that dictated
the nature of these local networks, their structures or which
localities they ought to cover. We have said that the system needs to
create the networks, but that it is for people at local level to
determine the most appropriate configurations and partnership
arrangements. As a consequence of that, 24 networks have now been
established across England. It is fair to say that some have developed
faster than others. That is to be expected, as it takes time to develop
them and to ensure that the right structures are in
place.</p><p><a name="06101249000220">We have put
additional funding into the system. More than &#163;70 million has
been made available to support the implementation of the report since
2003. That was divided into &#163;20 million for capital expenditure
and &#163;12 million for running costs in 2003-04, with the
additional money for running costs increasing to &#163;19 million in
2004-05 and to &#163;20 million in 2005-06. That is now in primary
care trusts&#146; baseline budgets. That funding is in addition to
the general increase in NHS funding, from which neonatal services can
of course also
benefit.</p><p><a name="06101249000221">We
recognise the importance of ensuring that capacity in neonatal
intensive care is available at all times, and that there is still
sufficient flexibility in the service to meet unforeseen demand. Weekly
situation reports indicate a national average neonatal intensive care
cot occupancy of about 75 per cent. That reinforces the point that at
any one time, 25 per cent. of the national capacity is not being used.
However, that does not always reflect what is happening in individual
localities. In that respect, noting the finding of BLISS that over 90
per cent. of units had to transfer patients last year, it is important
to recognise that there are genuine issues that we have to address.
There are also various reasons why a unit might close to new admissions
for a time&#151;a sudden outbreak of an infection, or a sudden
problem with staff availability. That can lead to the temporary closure
of units, and can cause babies to have to go further away from home
than we would want.</p><br>

<notus-date day="12" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>12 Oct 2006 : Column 562</b><br><p><a name="06101249000222">The development of the networks
has made a difference. The match between supply and demand is getting
better, and there is the full range of special care, high dependency
and intensive care in most localities. The networks are only beginning
to get to grips with case load and case mix, and with securing the
right level of care in that context. Their objective is to provide over
90 per cent. of neonatal care locally. However, in some situations that
might not be possible or
desirable.</p><p><a name="06101249000223">The
Department has also funded the development of the neonatal intensive
care unit capacity planning tool to assist in making decisions about
the configuration of neonatal intensive care units within a region.
Those decisions include the location of neonatal intensive care units,
the number of cots, staffing levels, and the levels of intensive care
each unit provides. The tool also allows consideration of different
hospitals operating together in networks, thus sharing the workloads
between
hospitals.</p><p><a name="06101249000224"><b><a name="_spnew138"><a name="06101249000310">Mr.
Khan:</b> Can my hon. Friend explain the inconsistency between
a tool giving guidance on staff numbers and the fact that the BAPM
guideline on, for example, one nurse per high dependency cot is not met
if PCTs do not fund the
staff?</p><p><a name="06101249000225"><b><a name="06101249000311">Mr.
Lewis:</b> My hon. Friend makes a reasonable point, but it is
difficult to say, &#147;We issue guidance and we identify
priorities,&#148; but then add, &#147;We instruct PCTs to deliver
in every area in a particular way.&#148; That would take away the
capacity to make flexible innovative local decisions.</p><p><a name="06101249000226">One of the difficulties in this
respect is that the definition of one-to-one support is not always
clear. There can be ambiguity about what that might mean in any given
set of circumstances. Does it mean support 24 hours a day? Does it mean
having one named person who is clearly responsible for care and is
available all the time, but who may not be physically present all the
time?</p><p><a name="06101249000227">So there are
different definitions, but we also have to be honest and point out that
PCTs are constantly making choices about priorities in the light of
finite resources. In some areas that will be reflected in staffing
levels that BLISS would regard as acceptable and desirable, but in
others, although I believe that staffing levels always meet minimum
safety standards, they do not necessarily meet the high standards that
appear in the guidance. So on these occasions, it is important that we
be frank about the consequences of finite resources and local
management decisions, because we cannot avoid them. At the same time,
it is also right that we constantly try to stretch the system to do
better, and to ensure that such families are properly supported, not
just through health interventions but from an emotional point of view
as well. We all accept that that is very important.</p><p><a name="06101249000228">It is worth focusing for a
moment on a linked issue&#151;the availability of nurses. As at
September 2005, 19,178 paediatric nurses were employed in the NHS in
total. That figure includes neonatal nurses and other nurses involved
in the care of children, and represents an increase of 25 per cent.
since 1997&#151;to pick a random date. The annual number of students
entering training to be children&#146;s nurses increased by 59 per
cent.

<notus-date day="12" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>12 Oct 2006 : Column 563</b><br>between 1996-97 and 2004-05. The national vacancy rate for paediatric
nurses has fallen from 4.4 per cent. in 2000 to 1.7 per cent. in 2005.
Interestingly, that compares with a vacancy rate of 1.9 per cent. for
all qualified nurses. So the message is that there has been a lot of
progress, and a lot of positive developments and steps forward, but
there is still a long way to go. We should be honest about that, and be
clear about the challenges ahead.</p><p><a name="06101249000229">Another challenge, to which my
hon. Friend referred, is commissioning. Specialised
services&#151;defined as services with a planning population of more
than 1 million&#151;are those with low patient numbers, which need a
critical mass of patients to make treatment centres clinically safe and
cost-effective. Under this definition, level 2 and level 3 care are
defined as specialised services. Level 1 care is not a specialised
service and is generally provided as part of each maternity service. At
the moment there are no plans to redefine level 1 as a specialised
service&#151;an issue to which my hon. Friend
referred.</p><p><a name="06101249000230">There are
currently no tariffs for neonatal intensive care. Critical care is
outside the scope of payment by results, and funding for the service
continues to be locally negotiated between commissioners and providers.
Health care resource groups, which are the underlying currency for
tariffs, are being developed for neonatal critical care by the NHS
information
centre.</p><p><a name="06101249000231">Given the
sensitivity of this issue, it is very important that in developing
services we also consider how we relate to parents as user
representatives; it is important that they have a strong voice in such
development. A review group has recommended that in future, each
network should have a supervisory structure that includes key
stakeholders in the provision of care. Those stakeholders should
include representatives of parents, providers and commissioners. So we
do envisage governance arrangements that will ensure that the voice of
users is extremely strong as we re-engineer and reshape
services.</p><br>
