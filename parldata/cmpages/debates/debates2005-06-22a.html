<br>&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="50622-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Wales  (Mr. Peter Hain): </b> 
 Last week, I published the White Paper &quot;Better Governance for Wales&quot;, which sets out the changes the Government propose to the electoral system for the National Assembly for Wales in chapter 4.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="50622-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. David </b> 
: I thank my right hon. Friend for his reply. Does he agree that in elections to the Welsh Assembly there is a democratic deficit? That is because individuals who stand in the constituency list and lose can nevertheless get elected on the regional list.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="50622-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I very much agree with my hon. Friend, as Conservative Members would be astonished to know. I have been looking at some of the figures and at what has happened: Eleanor Burnham, 7.9&nbsp;per cent. in Clwyd, West, elected as a regional Member; Owen John Thomas, 8.7&nbsp;per cent. in Cardiff, Central, elected as a regional Member; Laura Jones, 10&nbsp;per cent. in Caerphilly, elected as a regional Member; Mike German, 14&nbsp;per cent. in Torfaen, elected; and Lisa Francis, 16&nbsp;per cent. in Meirionnydd Nant Conwy elected. In all of those cases losers became winners. The system is abusing the electoral process.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="50622-01_spnew2"><b> Jessica Morden </b> 
: Will my right hon. Friend consider using a single vote rather than two to elect additional Members, as is being considered by the Arbuthnot commission in Scotland?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="50622-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises an interesting point. Like her, I have noticed that that is being argued for in respect of Scotland in some of the evidence put to the independent commission. I know from my own constituency experience that voters find it confusing having two ballot papers. It may be that it is something that we need to consider. I would be interested in further representations on the matter from her or other colleagues, or from Opposition Members.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="50622-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Elfyn Llwyd  (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</b> 
 (PC): Does this not sum it all up&#151;no discussion about the Richard commission about legislative proposals? Instead, there is a planted question from the Whips to do with a spiteful, narrow little party point. That shows new Labour as exactly what it is&#151;itself first, the people of Wales last.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="50622-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Actually, it is Plaid Cymru&#039;s policy to put itself first and the people of Wales last, which is what would happen if it got its way and Wales was dragged into independence against its will.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-01_para6">
<a name="stpa_o0">I remind the hon. Gentleman of a quote from the Electoral Reform Society, an independent non-party body. It says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_o4">&quot;A system in which candidates can lose elections but nevertheless win seats undermines respect for the electoral process. There is also a concern that list Members can cherry-pick issues, deciding to focus their activities on those issues most likely to raise their profile or create problems for their constituency opponents&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<a name="stpa_o1">I am astonished that of all the issues the hon. Gentleman could have chosen to raise with me this afternoon, he chose to defend the indefensible.

<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 783</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="50622-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Roger Williams  (Brecon and Radnorshire)</b> 
 (LD): I am pleased that the Secretary of State is answering this question because he is on record, when he was a member of another party, as supporting the single transferable vote for proportional representation. As that was the recommendation of the Richard commission, will he put on the record why he is now against STV and the reasons for that?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="50622-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Actually, the hon. Gentleman is plain wrong. More than 30&nbsp;years ago, when I was in the Young Liberals, I argued against Liberal policy on the single transferable vote. I have always advocated the alternative vote system, which retains the single Member constituency, in which electors can get rid of people who they do not want and elect people who they do want, which cannot be done under the Liberal Democrat proposals.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="50622-01_spnew8"><b> Bill Wiggin  (Leominster)</b> 
 (Con): Will the Secretary of State explain why he did not see the anomalies of that system when all Labour Assembly Members stood on both the regional and the constituency lists?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="50622-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 For the simple reason that I did not have any idea then&#151;and neither did the then Secretary of State&#151;that there would be widespread abuse of the system, which was designed to achieve greater proportionality and, for example, allow Conservatives to be elected to the Assembly. They could not possibly be elected otherwise, given the number of votes for them across Wales. The system was designed to be fairer, and it demonstrated generosity. We did not realise, however, that there would be flagrant abuse of the system whereby losing candidates, including a whole string of Conservatives, set themselves up in the very constituencies where they were defeated as rival Assembly representatives to the elected Members. The Electoral Reform Society is therefore concerned, as is the former Conservative Secretary of State, Lord Crickhowell, who said that the arrangements are &quot;pretty indefensible&quot;.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="50622-01_spnew10"><b> Bill Wiggin: </b> 
 As the Secretary of State is so anxious to be fair to the Welsh electorate, will he look at the size of Welsh constituencies and the number of Welsh MPs?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="50622-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 No, I will not. The number of Welsh MPs reflects fairly the needs of Wales. The proposals in the White Paper, not just those on the electoral system, do not alter that at all. I find it odd that the shadow Secretary of State is making all sorts of points about the Assembly&#039;s future structure when his policy is to abolish it.

<p><a name="qn_o2">2. <a name="50622-01_wqn2"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): What recent discussions he has had with the Secretary of State for Health on legislation to ban smoking in public places in Wales. [5060]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="50622-01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales  (Nick Ainger): </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has had regular discussions over the past few months with the Secretary of State for Health on this 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 784</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>matter. Earlier this week, the Government published a consultation on proposals for introducing smoke-free environments in England and Wales.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="50622-01_spnew12"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 Early-day motion 333, which was tabled in my name, welcomes the vote of the National Assembly to seek powers to restrict smoking in workplaces and public places. Does the Minister agree that whether someone works in an office or in a non-food pub, they deserve equal rights to health protection? Will he resist any attempt by his ministerial colleagues to weaken the potential for a Welsh blanket ban with exemptions that may make the English one unworkable and unsustainable?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="50622-01_spnew13"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 Perhaps it would be helpful if I clarified the situation for my hon. Friend. The consultation published on Monday includes proposals for England to provide smoke-free environments through the proposed health improvement and protection Bill. The Welsh Assembly would be given powers to deliver measures that reflect the wishes of the people of Wales. The Assembly Government are currently considering their detailed response to a report published last month by the Assembly&#039;s all-party Committee on Smoking in Public Places. Once detailed proposals have been agreed, a further round of consultation will take place in Wales. The power clearly lies with the Welsh Assembly, not with any other ministerial Department.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="50622-01_spnew14"><b> Hywel Williams  (Caernarfon)</b> 
 (PC): There is agreement across the House and in another place, as well as among a wide range of health bodies in Wales, voluntary organisations and the National Assembly, that a ban is required. Given that fact, and given the health statistics on heart disease and lung cancer, how can the Minister justify a delay of at least three or four years in implementing a ban in Wales? Yet again, we are last in the queue.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="50622-01_spnew15"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 I am surprised at that question. The consultation will be completed by 6&nbsp;September and the Government will introduce the health improvement and protection Bill shortly after. Hopefully, legislation for Wales will be delivered by the Assembly to implement bans from the end of 2006, and in 2007&nbsp;and 2008. Industry, particularly the hospitality industry, needs considerable time to carry out such measures, so I am surprised by the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="50622-01_spnew16"><b> Julie Morgan  (Cardiff, North)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my hon. Friend agree that most smokers want to give up and would welcome a ban on smoking in workplaces and enclosed public places, as it would help them to do so? Does he further agree that that is the experience in Ireland, where there has been a drop in the number of smokers.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="50622-01_spnew17"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 Yes, I agree. I congratulate my hon. Friend on her work in bringing this issue to the attention of the House through her private Member&#039;s Bill. The evidence in Ireland is very positive, and we should not forget the reason why the Government want to introduce smoking bans in public places. This year, the <i>British Medical Journal</i> produced evidence showing that 30&nbsp;people a day die from second-hand smoke. The NHS 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 785</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>is currently spending &#163;1.7&nbsp;billion every year on smoking-related diseases, which lead to more than 100,000&nbsp;deaths a year. Something has to be done, and the Government intend to take action.

<p><a name="qn_o3">4. <a name="50622-02_wqn0"><b> Daniel Kawczynski  (Shrewsbury and Atcham)</b> 
 (Con): What assessments he has made of the effects on businesses in border areas of Wales of the provision of more advantageous incentives to businesses in Wales. [5062]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="50622-02_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Wales  (Mr. Peter Hain): </b> 
 Businesses on both sides of the England/Wales border continue to prosper from the stable economic climate created by this Government. Support for business in England is excellent, as it is in Wales.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="50622-02_spnew0"><b> Daniel Kawczynski: </b> 
 In Shrewsbury and Atcham quite a few businesses are shutting up and moving across the border to take advantage of the better grants from the Welsh Development Agency. That is leading to significant concerns for me about unemployment in Shrewsbury. In Europe we are trying to get a level playing field for business, but we do not seem to have that in England and Wales. Can the Secretary of State give me an assurance that he will get the Government to create a more level playing field for business in England and Wales?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="50622-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Unemployment in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency has fallen by half under the Labour Government, and more jobs are being created all the time. Indeed, there are now 300&nbsp;new businesses starting up each week in the west midlands, compared with 1,000&nbsp;businesses that were closing each week under the Conservatives when they were in power. Wales is an attractive climate in which to invest. It has a high skills base, an attractive environment, and its economy is booming under the Government&#151;but all investors, whether they are transferring from England or coming in from outside the UK, have to abide by the same rules for grants and selective regional assistance. The European state aid rules apply equally in Wales and England, so there can be no discriminatory favouritism in Wales compared with England, because we abide by the same rules.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="50622-02_spnew2"><b> Ian Lucas  (Wrexham)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is a fiction to suggest that businesses move to Wales because of assistance? Wrexham does not have regional selective assistance, objective 1&nbsp;status or objective 2&nbsp;status, but it has an excellent co-operative work force and a background of economic stability. That is why there is 1.9&nbsp;per cent. unemployment in my constituency.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="50622-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Yes, and Wrexham has an excellent MP who works hard on his constituents&#039; behalf. My hon. Friend makes the very good point that even areas like Wrexham, which do not attract, for example, objective 1&nbsp;funding, as west Wales and the valleys do, still attract a lot of inward investment because they are great places to locate for the reasons that he explained. Whereas Wales was failing under the Conservatives, it is now 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 786</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>going from success to success under the Labour Government, right across the country&#151;north, south, east and west.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="50622-02_spnew4"><b> Lembit &#214;pik  (Montgomeryshire)</b> 
 (LD): Nevertheless, does the Secretary of State welcome the apparent recognition by the English Conservatives of the benefits of devolution and European investment in Welsh agriculture and industry? Does he recognise that those achievements are threatened by the current impasse in European negotiations, and will he give an assurance to the House that economic support for these vital Welsh sectors will not be damaged by delays in, or the outcome of, European negotiations on funding?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="50622-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point and I am happy to respond to it. There has been some mischief-making by Opposition politicians, especially in <i>The Western Mail</i> recently, suggesting that Wales&#039;s objective 1&nbsp;funding is at risk because of activity by the Government. The truth is that the impasse in the European Council is nothing to do with structural funds; it is due to the stance taken by the President of France, in particular, over the British rebate. We intend to resolve the matter and to get the best possible deal for Wales. We will resolve it as early as we can in order to achieve that deal right across Wales, particularly in respect of objective 1&nbsp;funding for west Wales and the valleys.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="50622-02_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales  (Nick Ainger): </b> 
 Earlier this month, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced a comprehensive package of measures to combat violent crime. The Violent Crime Reduction Bill will ensure that the police and local communities across the country have the necessary powers to reduce violent crime, including crime involving knives.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="50622-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Jones: </b> 
 My hon. Friend knows that a number of serious knife attacks have recently occurred in north Wales. Does he agree that the measures relating to knives in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill will help to improve the situation?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="50622-02_spnew7"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 Yes, I do. The new powers included in the Bill, which applies to both England and Wales, will make it an offence to use other people to hide or carry guns or knives, increase the age limit for purchasing a knife from 16&nbsp;to 18&nbsp;and introduce powers for head teachers and other members of school staff to search pupils for knives. The issue must be dealt with, and I am aware of the three incidents in north Wales in which young men were killed in knife attacks. We must work with the police, the community and schools to ensure that young people do not carry knives.

Does he agree with my union, the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, that teachers should commission the police to undertake searches rather than doing it themselves?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o31"><a name="50622-02_spnew9"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees that head teachers and staff should have the power to intervene to search pupils, where it is necessary to do so. The Government and the Association of Chief Police Officers will support head teachers if they judge that it is best to call the police. We want to give head teachers the maximum support and options to keep good order and protect everyone in their schools, and we will discuss those proposals with representatives of all school staff.

<p><a name="st_o33"><a name="50622-02_spnew11"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows that we have put an extra 172&nbsp;police officers on the beat in his police force area since 1997, and we have also recruited 300&nbsp;community support officers throughout Wales. If his party had won the general election, we would have seen a &#163;35&nbsp;billion cut, much of which would have come from the Home Office budget.

He had five previous convictions, including a prison sentence for beating his girlfriend so badly that she spent three days in intensive care with seven fractures to her skull. That man will serve a maximum of six and a half years in prison. Does the Minister agree that the best way to reduce such attacks is to end early release and make sure that dangerous criminals stay where they belong&#151;in prison?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o35"><a name="50622-02_spnew13"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 I cannot comment on the individual case mentioned by the hon. Gentleman. The Government have made it clear that stiff sentences for violent crime and murder are acting as a real deterrent. The hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o37"><a name="50622-02_spnew14"><b> Dr. Lewis: </b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for that uninformative reply. When he had his last such meeting, did he raise the question of prescription tourism, which already costs the Welsh Assembly &#163;3&nbsp;million a year? Did he raise the &#163;37&nbsp;million cost to the Assembly of implementing free prescriptions in Wales? Did he raise the question of the 100,000&nbsp;people who waited more than four hours for A and E treatment and the 284,000&nbsp;people who are on waiting lists? Does he think that those are proper uses for limited NHS resources?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o38"><a name="50622-02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 That was an impressive recitation of dodgy statistics that simply do not apply in Wales. The fact is that waiting times are coming down and more patients are being seen and treated. In respect of prescriptions, yes, it is the case that there is a cross-border flow between Wales and England; it is roughly equal in terms of English patients being served by Welsh GPs and Welsh patients being served by English GPs. However, it is true that Welsh patients who go to see English GPs do not get free prescriptions and the Assembly is considering that.

Will the Minister commit to discussing those differences with the Welsh Assembly Health Minister at the earliest opportunity?

<p><a name="st_o40"><a name="50622-02_spnew17"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Obviously, we want a first-class ambulance service as we develop a first-class health service, and I shall certainly bear in mind the points that that hon. Lady makes.

 The answer is no, because, just like Plaid Cymru&#039;s proposals for varying income tax for Wales, it would raise an immediate question mark as to whether the extra spending per head in Wales provided by the Treasury was still justified.

Those families were often forgotten under the old system. They did not qualify for family credit and were left to languish on the dole for long periods of time.

<br>&nbsp;<br>course, right. There is one difficulty, though. With any such system, when people change jobs, as some 3&nbsp;million people do every year, and when about 300,000&nbsp;families who are eligible for tax credits undergo substantial financial changes, there has to be some way of compensating for that and ensuring that people are neither underpaid nor overpaid.

The ombudsman makes 12&nbsp;specific recommendations in her report, and she also raises some fundamental questions about the whole system that she says need to be addressed. Will the Prime Minister now accept all those recommendations and address those fundamental questions? Will he also give an undertaking that the 800,000&nbsp;families who currently receive their tax credit through Jobcentre Plus will not be moved on to the Inland Revenue system this year, as is currently planned?

Despite the way in which the right hon. and learned Gentleman has put these questions, however, I think that we are in agreement. The tax credit system is the right system, and as a whole, it is benefiting millions of families, but it is correct to say that, at the moment, it is failing some families.

Is it not the case that Britain is becoming the dirty man of Europe, and that the Prime Minister&#039;s moral authority to persuade others to tackle climate change is being fatally compromised?

 That is a ludicrous thing to say, and no, I do not accept that at all. As I said, we will meet our Kyoto targets. We have established the target of 10&nbsp;per cent. renewable energy by 2010, and incidentally, we have also introduced the climate change levy, which is saving us literally millions of tonnes a year&#151;opposed by the Conservatives. I do not know what specific measures the right hon. and learned Gentleman has. We are investing far more in energy efficiency than his Government ever invested, and we are investing more in helping pensioners and others to make their homes more energy-efficient. If he has some specific measures to propose, let us hear them, but actually, most of the measures that we have taken to reduce emissions he has opposed.

 My hon. Friend is right in saying that we should always acknowledge the tremendous contribution made by migrants to this country over the years. It is important to recognise that, as is demonstrated by many in this House, many of us have ancestors who migrated from abroad. We recognise the strong contribution that migration makes, but it is also important to recognise that we have to take action to deal with asylum applications, which are now down by more than half, and to introduce the controls on immigration that we have indicated. This will allow us to continue to have people migrating to our country whom we need for our economy, while making sure that proper and robust rules are in place. That is the right balance for today&#039;s world.

There is a strong case for saying that African leadership needs better governance, better protection from corruption, better conflict resolution.

<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50622-04_spmin0"><b>The Paymaster General  (Dawn Primarolo): </b> 
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I want to make a statement on the reforms that we have made, and are making, in the&nbsp;operation of the tax credits system, and to answer point by point the reports from the parliamentary ombudsman and the Citizen&#039;s Advice Bureau that were published today, and the adjudicator&#039;s report that was published earlier in the week. Those reports deal mainly with the operation of the system in its first year of introduction.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-04_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">On 26&nbsp;May, I announced to this House a series of measures to build upon the reforms that we have already made to the tax credits system. Those include measures to streamline procedures for recipients to inform Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs of the changes in their income during the course of the year, and to simplify the information provided to families in award notices. I also announced a review so that we could make changes in the procedures for dealing with disputed awards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-04_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">The Department is improving the helpline so that families receiving tax credits can have all their queries dealt with in one go and all their changes processed with one call to the helpline. Where there is a dispute, I have asked HMRC to consider suspending recovery of excess payments until the dispute is resolved. Where there is hardship, I have asked it to ensure that the additional payments in the system are made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-04_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">In other words, I have already taken measures to act on each of the major administrative issues raised by the parliamentary ombudsman and the CAB. Two weeks ago, during a debate in the House on these issues, I offered&#151;and have subsequently agreed&#151;to meet a group of MPs to discuss these issues in detail. Today, I will be writing to the ombudsman and the CAB about the changes that we have already made. I will be offering to meet them to discuss the detail of the reforms now being introduced.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-04_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">I come to the issues of policy. As the CAB report states, tax credits are the best way to deal with society&#039;s responsibility to help with the costs of bringing up children and tackling child poverty. The background both to the introduction of tax credits and to the reports out today is that more people than ever before are receiving tax credits to help with the costs of bringing up their children. In total, more than 6&nbsp;million families&#151;about 20&nbsp;million people, including 10&nbsp;million children&#151;benefit from tax credits. Four in 10&nbsp;families pay no net tax as a result of tax credits, and the take-up in the first year exceeds 80&nbsp;per cent.&#151;so in each of our constituencies, nearly 10,000&nbsp;families, on average, are benefiting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-04_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">As a result of an economy where people move between jobs more often and their circumstances change more quickly, the challenge is to adjust child tax credits to changing income patterns as quickly as possible. In fact, 3&nbsp;million people now change jobs every year, and their&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;income changes are often substantial. Some 700,000&nbsp;children are born every year and receive different rates of child tax credit, according to their families&#039; circumstances.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 802</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-04_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">The fast-changing nature of the economy is such that around 300,000&nbsp;people who receive tax credits experience very large changes in their family income&#151;&#163;10,000, or more, during a year. In introducing the child tax credit, the big change that we made was to move from a fixed payment based on past income, not on actual income, which was recognised as unresponsive to families&#039; changing circumstances and therefore unfair.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-04_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">When the new system was introduced, we decided that, during the year, we would be prepared to adjust tax credits to changes in family circumstances. So the issue for the Government and, indeed, for all parties that want to comment on these issues in the House and beyond is whether we return to a fixed system, which is clearly unfair and does not adjust for changes in family income during the year; whether we operate a system whereby we compensate people when their income falls, but do not adjust credits downwards when their income rises, even when it rises substantially by &#163;10,000&nbsp;a year or more; or whether we retain the principle of getting the balance right between taxpayers and individual family circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-04_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">I have always been happy to listen to and to take note of the views of all parties on these issues, but I have to tell the House that, when we consulted widely before the implementation of the tax credit, the overwhelming consensus was that a balance should be struck between the needs of the taxpayer and those of the families who claim and that the system should adjust to any drop in income and therefore compensate the claimant in full and only respond to increases in family income during the year, when the family income increases by &#163;2,500&nbsp;or more a year. I also have to tell the House that, when these issues were voted on in the House, there was a clear majority in favour of these proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-04_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">Of course, I will continue to keep the House fully updated on recent developments in the tax credit system, as I have endeavoured to do in debates and statements in the past. The ombudsman makes reference in her report to a small part of one sentence of one written answer and suggests that it offers an incomplete picture. I have repeatedly answered questions on this issue. Indeed, in a debate on 26&nbsp;January, I told the House that there had been problems going back to the introduction of the computer system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-04_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">More recently, I issued a statement on 26&nbsp;May, setting out the situation, the action that has been taken and what more we will do to improve the system. There was an Adjournment debate on 7&nbsp;June at which I responded to many of the issues raised by hon. Members and, again, outlined the changes. And I will, of course, keep the House updated on the reforms that we are putting in place to improve the system and report back on my discussions with voluntary and community sector organisations.

 The reports today from the parliamentary ombudsman and the CAB paint a devastating picture of the administrative chaos, computer errors and political misjudgments at the heart of the tax credit system. The response of the Paymaster General today&#151;that she made a written statement a month ago and replied to an Adjournment debate in the House&#151;is not enough, as the CAB makes clear in its report today, not least because some of the changes that the right hon.

 Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I was merely quoting from the ombudsman. It would be interesting to know whether the hon. Member for Blyth Valley (Mr. Campbell), who may make a contribution later, agrees with the ombudsman and the CAB.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-04_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">The Paymaster General expresses regret for the mistakes that have been made, but she said this morning that for a huge majority of families the system is working. But will she confirm that, of the 6&nbsp;million families receiving tax credits in 2003&#150;04, 1.9&nbsp;million were overpaid almost &#163;2&nbsp;billion and that a further 713,000&nbsp;were underpaid half a billion pounds. That is more than a third of all the families claiming tax credit, so how on earth can she say that the system is working well for a huge majority of families? How can she say that when in her own constituency in Bristol almost half the 9,200&nbsp;people who claimed tax credit received an incorrect amount and the taxpayer has had to pay out &#163;3.7&nbsp;million in her constituency alone in overpayments?

</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-04_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">I have five specific questions about the future operation of the system. First, the ombudsman says that from the evidence she has seen the Revenue has yet to adopt a model for dealing with low-income families that takes full account both of the complexities of tax credits and of the vulnerabilities of their lives. Does the Paymaster General agree with that key recommendation of the report? Indeed, will she introduce a human face in the system so that judgments about clawing back overpayments are made by an individual, not a computer?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-04_para15">
<a name="stpa_15">Secondly, will the right hon. Lady accept the recommendations in the report that families should be made aware of what is happening to their credits, told how they can appeal and informed about the hardship payments available to them, not because they go to their local MP or CAB but as a matter of right, as part of the tax credit system?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-04_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">Thirdly, will the Paymaster General consider writing off all excess and overpayments caused by official error, not just in the past but as part of the system, so that Ministers do not have to come to the House announcing amnesties every year? She should make that part of the system so that low-income families do not suffer due to the Treasury&#039;s mistakes.

<a name="50622-04_para17">
<a name="stpa_17">Fourthly, will the right hon. Lady suspend with immediate effect plans to move a further 800,000&nbsp;of the lowest income families who currently receive their tax credits from Jobcentre Plus to the Treasury&#039;s chaotic systems? My right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the Opposition specifically asked the Prime Minister about that point; he did not respond, but it is of enormous interest to every MP. Will the Paymaster General respond and make it clear that she will delay the migration of those 800,000&nbsp;people to the Revenue until the problems are sorted out?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-04_para18">
<a name="stpa_18">Fifthly, I turn to the Paymaster General&#039;s accountability to the House of Commons. On 7&nbsp;February, she said of the tax credit system:

<a name="stpa_20">Is the right hon. Lady saying that the ombudsman is wrong? She did not say that in her statement but if that is so she should say it in her response to me.

He knows full well that in cases in which either an administrative or information technology error has been made by the Inland Revenue and it would be reasonable to assume that the claimants did not realise that a payment had been made in error, that money has been written off. In my statement on 26&nbsp;May, I made it clear that we needed to review the procedure and determine not only whether to suspend recovery until a dispute has been resolved, but how we communicate with claimants so that the Department can ensure that they know exactly what their entitlements are.

When he talks about the inheritance and the problems that families face, he must acknowledge that the system in place before failed to tackle child poverty, failed to respond to the needs and changing circumstances of families and failed to recognise the changing nature of the labour market. He does not realise that the income change for 300,000&nbsp;of the people who have received overpayments is in excess of &#163;10,000&nbsp;per year. Is he seriously suggesting that if an overpayment is not disputed and the claimant is prepared to pay it back, we should not collect it? That is ridiculous.

 I have not been attracted to a complete amnesty. Clearly excess payment has been made. If the claimant accepts that and is prepared to repay the money, there is no dispute. It is a question whether Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs was notified at the time of the change. It seems not to be a good deal for the taxpayer to say, &quot;No thank you. Keep that extra money.&quot; That is when the claimant thinks that they should not have had it and we know that they should not have had it. The point that is made in the ombudsman&#039;s report and the point that my hon. Friend makes&#151;it is made also by many right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House&#151;is that in circumstances where there is a dispute or where hardship would be caused, I have said repeatedly that I want HMRC to suspend recovery while the dispute is settled. I have asked it to adopt that position, and to ensure that those in hardship are paid the additional payments that are already available in the system, and that they are made aware of the fact that those payments are available to them.

 The hon. Gentleman will be aware, as will the House, not only from my statements, but from publicity elsewhere, of the difficulties experienced in the early months of the introduction of the tax credits and, in particular, with the IT system. He will also be aware that the Department&#039;s IT partner has changed and that the Department is working closely with its new IT partner to sort out the issues.

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="50622-07_spnew13"><b> Ed Balls  (Normanton) (Lab):</b> 
 Does my right hon. Friend agree that in moving from the inflexibilities and unfairnesses of the old benefits system to what is effectively the integration of tax and benefits through the new tax credits system, it is important that we balance the interests of taxpayers and poor families? 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 813</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>That is why, in the original design, if incomes fall, families are fully compensated, but if their incomes go up, they must rise above the &#163;2,500&nbsp;threshold before they have to make repayments. In looking again at whether that balance has been struck as well as it could have been and whether we need to learn from experience, can my right hon. Friend confirm that she will do nothing to go backwards on tax credit integration or on reducing the unfairnesses or the inflexibilities and that she will do nothing to put at risk a reform for which she deserves huge credit, which has taken a million families out of poverty and which was opposed consistently from the beginning by the entire Opposition?
</p>








<p><a name="st_34"><a name="50622-07_spnew14"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. As he knows, the integration of the tax and benefits system has removed stigma and enabled people to move from unemployment into work. It has supported families, helped reduce the number of children in poverty and made sure that we have a flexible system that responds to families&#039; needs. The choice is between a fixed, unresponsive, unfair system and a flexible system that responds to family changes. Within that equation, as he rightly identifies, we need to strike a balance on behalf of the taxpayer and define the limits of that flexibility. In the present system, all drops in income are automatically adjusted when we are notified, so that the family does not lose out. If there is any rise in income over &#163;2,500&nbsp;a year&#151;a sum lower than that is not notifiable&#151;the family should report an increase of income in the year. That strikes a balance of generosity on behalf of the taxpayer and recognises our partnership and the responsibility of society to support children in families, while limiting the cost of the system for the taxpayer.

 I regularly meet constituents who have benefited enormously from the tax credit system, and especially from the child care tax credit, which allows them to get off benefit and into work to advantage themselves and their families. When my right hon. Friend considers families who are in need because of decisions about their entitlement, will she examine the child care tax credit, without which many parents would not be able to stay in work?

<p><a name="st_38"><a name="50622-08_spnew3"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 I reassure my hon. Friend that the child care tax credit will be considered when we examine the need for reform on disputed excess payments. She is right that payment assistance with child care costs has liberated hundreds of thousands of families by allowing parents to choose whether to return to work. That payment did not exist until we started our tax and benefit reforms, which have provided huge improvements for parents in particular.

 Is the Paymaster General aware that her complacency does not reflect the distress and hardship that so many families have experienced?

 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s criticism that I have been complacent is not correct. This afternoon, I have provided a catalogue of actions that I have taken over some time, and I have continued to acknowledge that the system contains some problems. The hon. Gentleman should address the complacency of the previous Government in allowing child poverty to rise and the apparent complacency of the current Conservative party in not willing the means needed to tackle and eradicate child poverty.

That this House believes that special schools play a vital role in meeting the needs of children with learning difficulties, and that parents should have more choice between special and mainstream schools; further believes that the Government should hold a proper review of the provision of special educational needs to cover concerns about the statementing process, the continued closure of special schools, concerns about bias in the law and central government pressure to pursue policies of inclusion when they are not always appropriate; and calls for a moratorium on special school closures until such a review has been published and properly debated.
<br>







<p><a name="st_64">How we provide education and opportunity for those with complex needs is incredibly important. Those children include some of the most disadvantaged in the country and their families often face enormous stresses and strains in trying to bring them up and in getting what they need.</p>













<p><a name="st_65">There is much common ground on both sides of the House about what we should be trying to do. Last week, the Minister for Children and Families, who is not present today, said:

</ul>
<p>
</p>





<p><a name="st_66">I agree with that point, but it is not actually happening.</p>










<p><a name="st_67">My argument is not with what the Government say about that issue, but with what they do and with what they are allowing to happen up and down this country: special schools are closing, mainstream schools are not coping and statementing has become incredibly bureaucratic and far too much of a battle for all concerned. Inclusion has gone too far and we badly need to stop, think and get this right.</p>













<p><a name="st_68">There is concern on both sides of the House on the issue. At last week&#039;s Education and Skills questions, the hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie) warned that parents&#039; wishes are being completely ignored, saying:
</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;The private company that a past Secretary of State put in to run education is closing the &quot;special school, threatening governors and taking no notice of parents&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 16&nbsp;June 2005; Vol. 435, c. 378.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>






<p><a name="st_70">How much more serious could the situation be? I am sure that we will hear more concerns today about what is happening on the ground.</p>













<p><a name="st_71">The Conservative approach is clear. We are not saying that inclusion is wrong&#151;for many children, it is right and works well&#151;and we are not saying that the concept of statements is wrong. We need a system that recognises and meets needs. However, the Government must recognise three things. First, the inclusion agenda has gone too far. A movement that was about redressing

<br>&nbsp;<br>a balance is going beyond achieving that and is now being applied in many cases where it harms rather than helps.

Thirdly, as a result, we believe that the whole sector needs to be fundamentally reviewed.</p>

<p><a name="st_72">The Government&#039;s approach to these issues is simply inadequate and the audit of special schools that is under way is typical of that approach. The Labour election manifesto &quot;Britain forward, not back&quot;&#151;as always, no verbs, but catchy title&#151;said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;We will undertake an audit of special school provision to give better comparative information to local authorities, head teachers and school governors as they plan future&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. provision.&quot;</p>

 My hon. Friend will know that I entirely endorse the case that he is presenting.

The Park Lane special school in my constituency, which is 100&nbsp;per cent. supported by local people and by parents, is being deprived of the resources that it needs to provide the level of education that these very vulnerable young people require.
</p>








<p><a name="st_74"><a name="50622-10_spnew1"><b> Mr. Cameron: </b> 
 As I will explain, our policy is for a moratorium on the closure of special schools because we believe that the policy is biased, as is the guidance, and that is why so many schools are threatened with closure.

<p><a name="st_76"><a name="50622-10_spnew3"><b> Mr. Cameron: </b> 
 If one has a moratorium, so that one can stop and think and get the Government policy right, then one can stop the closures.

It is called &quot;Inclusive Schooling&quot;&#151;the title is a bit of a giveaway&#151;and says on the front page that it &quot;must not be ignored&quot;. On page 9, it says:

In my constituency, there is a combined special school and mainstream school. Springfield school and Madley Brook school are next door to each other. They form two horseshoes, with the special school inside the mainstream school. That is a model for others to follow. However, we must get the law and the guidance right first.

<a name="stpa_64">I want to consider why we are in the current position and why I believe that it will continue. My next point directly answers the question that the Under-Secretary asked earlier. There is a bias in the law on special educational needs as it stands. The 2001&nbsp;Act states that, if a statement is maintained, a child must be educated in a mainstream school unless that is incompatible with the wishes of his parent or the provision of efficient education for other children. However, in many cases parents are not told about the existence of special

<a name="50622-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_65">The guidance, as well as the law, is biased. I have referred to &quot;Inclusive Schooling&quot;, but the same goes for the document that the Minister for Children and Families mentioned last Thursday, &quot;Removing the Barriers to Achievement&quot;. The strategy states:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;The proportion of children educated in special schools should fall over time&quot;.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;Government thinking is set on immovable tracks. Special schools are a place of last resort, only, we are told, for children with severe and complex disabilities.

<a name="stpa_68">The Government need to be aware of what is happening. Local authorities are interpreting Government policy in a particular way because special schools are expensive.

 I shall touch on that issue in a moment. My hon. Friend has identified a fundamental problem in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Conservatives&#039; approach, which argues for decentralisation of decision making, but for centralisation when those decisions are not the ones that they want.

<p><a name="st_122"><a name="50622-12_spnew12"><b> Tom Levitt: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend will know, from when we served on the Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill together, that I passionately believe that special schools have a place, especially for those children who are best served in those schools. There are such categories of children. Is not the key to all this, however, to get the statement right in the first place, and to agree a policy whereby the right education can be provided and properly resourced for that individual child? Parents with a child with special needs want support, which they often get from parent partnerships, to help them to reach the best decision for their child, who will, after all, have to live in an inclusive world after they leave school&#151;

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. My hon. Friend makes a crucial point about the importance of parents and of an individual&#039;s needs in the system, and I shall expand on that in a moment. I should now like to make a little progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-13_para0">

<br>&nbsp;<br>principles, rather than making the maintenance of the status quo the guiding principle, which is the Conservative&#151;in all senses of the word&#151;approach. I do not believe that that will enable us to deliver for the needs of individual children. Our focus is on meeting the needs of all children, on extending parental choice, and on securing the highest possible standards and the best possible outcomes for children, young people and families.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_76">Those are ambitious goals, but rightly so. The task of achieving them is changing over time, as new challenges arise. For example, we have seen a significant increase in the number of children identified with autistic spectrum disorders over the past few years, as our health system becomes better at supporting very young children and babies. We are also seeing increasing numbers of children with profound and complex impairments and with learning difficulties. Because we are faced with that wide and evolving range of needs, it is important that we have a flexible range of provision that is able to meet those needs. That is what we are seeking to achieve.

<p><a name="st_125"><a name="50622-13_spnew1"><b> Judy Mallaber: </b> 
 Has my right hon. Friend read the response of the National Autistic Society to Baroness Warnock&#039;s report? Its conclusion is that we should not abandon the policy of inclusion, but that it needs training and resources to make it work. Local authorities such as Derbyshire are putting extra resources into specialist autism centres as well as into enhanced units in mainstream schools, which represents the way forward to allow parents the necessary choice.
</p>








<p><a name="st_126"><a name="50622-13_spnew2"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 I strongly agree with my hon. Friend, and with the National Autistic Society. Previous work by the society and by the all-party group on autism has shown that about 80&nbsp;per cent. of parents with autistic children in mainstream education felt that they were getting very good support. My hon. Friend has made precisely the point that I wanted to make, which is that the quality of education is dependent on the investment and resources that are put into the schools.

<a name="50622-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_77">Parental views on where a child should be educated and the support that they should receive are extremely important. We must remember that it was not that long ago that many parents were denied that choice by a system that prevented many children with special educational needs from being educated in a mainstream school and joining other children in that way. That is why we introduced the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001. Contrary to the claims made by the Opposition, that Act removed barriers that were placed in the way of parents who wanted their children to attend mainstream schools but were denied the opportunity.

 Does the Minister agree that even if the present system of statementing is well intentioned, it does not work in practice? Can she tell us how many children to whom statements have been issued when it has been accepted that they need a certain level of support do not receive it in practice? In practice, parental choice and statementing do not work.

<p><a name="st_132"><a name="50622-13_spnew8"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 Of course we need a process that enables us to determine where resources should be allocated to reach the children with the most severe special needs. That is the function of statements. We also need&#151;and have&#151;a robust system of appeals. In the most recent year the number of appeals to the Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal fell slightly, but it is important that such appeals are possible.

 A few moments ago the right hon. Lady was airily dismissive of buildings, but the facilities in buildings are of the essence.

That is currently happening in a mainstream school in my constituency.

 I am never dismissive, airily or otherwise, of points made by the hon. Gentleman. I do consider that situation unacceptable. The Government&#039;s schools access initiative, which includes investment of &#163;300&nbsp;million over the next three years, is making a crucial contribution to ensuring that mainstream schools really are accessible. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman supports that extra investment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_78">I was talking about parents. We must ensure that an appropriate balance is struck. When any parent of a child with special needs states a preference for a special school, there is no presumption of inclusion in a mainstream school. Instead, the local authority must recommend the placement on the basis of the usual criteria: the child&#039;s needs, the needs of other children and the issue of resources.
</p>

<a name="50622-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_79">I agree with the hon. Member for Witney: parents should, by regulation, be given information about mainstream and special schools when a statement is being considered. Through the 2001&nbsp;Act, we have ensured further support for parents with the requirement that every local authority must have a parent partnership service. What parents really want is an assurance that their children can achieve their full potential, and are supported by well trained staff with the resources that they need to make the most of the

 What is the Minister&#039;s response to the survey by Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate mentioned in the annual Ofsted report? It found that in cases of inclusion a significant number of children with special educational needs were not achieving all that they could.
</p>








<p><a name="st_136"><a name="50622-13_spnew12"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The timing of the hon. Lady&#039;s intervention is lucky, as I am coming to precisely that point. She is right: the proof of the system, the evidence of success, must lie in improving outcomes and raising attainment for children with special educational needs. We have done well in that regard. The Ofsted report shows that the proportion of pupils with special educational needs who are judged to be making good progress in mainstream primary and secondary schools has grown significantly in recent years&#151;from 54&nbsp;per cent. to 73&nbsp;per cent. in primary schools between 2000&nbsp;and 2003, and from 43&nbsp;per cent. to 71&nbsp;per cent. in secondary schools over the same period. We know that there has been progress, but we also know that there is more to be made.

 Does the Minister acknowledge the concern expressed by Conservative Members earlier about the lack of training available to teachers in mainstream schools? Grangewood school in my constituency has set itself up, on its own initiative, as a centre of excellence offering training to all schools in the borough of Hillingdon. It has been swamped with demand. The headmaster says that it has only been able to scratch the surface of that demand, while at the same time having to deal with the real challenge of a falling roll as a result of the government&#039;s policy. Should we not be supporting such centres of excellence rather than undermining them?

That is why we are investing in our children, and not simply through the additional &#163;1,300&nbsp;per pupil that will have been invested between 1997&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08. This year there has been a 7.8&nbsp;per cent. increase in local authority spending on special needs. That is why&#151;here I come to the point made by the hon.

May I ask the Minister to study it in detail? It contains excellent recommendations, particularly on special educational needs provision for children with autism.

I am sure that he will welcome the focus on autism in the national service framework for children as a particular example of how we can achieve more.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_82">I promised to respond to hon. Members about how we are investing in schools themselves, including special schools. We have made it clear that special schools continue to have a vital role in catering for children with the most complex needs and in working more closely with mainstream schools to share their expertise. The hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing), who is not in her place at the moment, made an important point in that regard. Some in the debate want to characterise special schools and mainstream schools as being poles apart&#151;as two ends of the spectrum. In fact, they should be two sides of the same coin, working in partnership. Beaumont Hill school and technology college in Darlington provides outreach services to mainstream schools for children with&nbsp;autistic spectrum disorders and severe learning difficulties, and has an advanced skills teacher working with other schools across the authority, making provision for children with behavioural, social and emotional difficulties, supporting children and providing a local alternative for mainstream schools.

There is an important role for special schools working in partnership, sharing expertise and making a base for good-quality provision. I was explaining not only how that is an aspiration but how, through our investment, we are ensuring that that happens.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_83">We are ensuring, for example, that the benefits and contribution of the specialist school programme are extended to special schools. In December, we announced the setting up of 12&nbsp;trailblazer special schools with specialist status to act as centres of excellence for just that purpose. We have also announced&#151;this relates to the point that was made by the hon.

<a name="stpa_84">That is evidence of this Government&#039;s commitment to the continuing role of special schools.

Since then, there have been 93&nbsp;closures, an average of 13&nbsp;a year.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_85">The other theme of this debate and of the approach of the hon. Member for Witney is that we need a review. In recent years, there have been major reports on special educational needs from both the Office for Standards in Education and the Audit Commission, which sought the

<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 835</b>

 Baroness Warnock has made an important contribution to the debate in this area over the years, both in her original report and in the latest one. One of the crucial points that she makes is that, in order for us to meet the individual needs of pupils, in whatever setting they are in, we need to ensure that the resources, the staff and the individual flexible provision are there for them. That is what the Government have been focusing on and will continue to focus on.
</p>

<a name="50622-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_87">The Opposition&#039;s call for a new review suggests that they are asking us to ignore all the work that has been done up until this point. What new evidence do they think that that would produce? I know that this is a period of navel gazing for the Conservative party, but surely the time is right to get on with making further improvements in what children and parents need, not to start another review.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_88">What is happening in practice is that local authorities are reorganising their provision to meet changing patterns of need. While some special schools may be closing, others are opening. Specially resourced provision is being developed within and alongside mainstream schools. Through the excellent able autism unit in Kingsley college in my constituency, students get the opportunity both to join national curriculum lessons where that is appropriate and to have the particular resources that they need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_89">A moratorium on the closure of special schools would prevent local authorities from redeveloping their special educational needs provision to provide such win-win solutions. That is perhaps one of the reasons why local authorities such as Wandsworth, Essex and Dorset are not heeding the call by the hon. Member for Witney for a moratorium. He will need to ensure that his policy proposals are more influential in his own party if he is going to be anything like a convincing leader.

<a name="stpa_95">Whatever our disagreements on policy&#151;we will doubtless have many&#151;I want to acknowledge that the hon.

He talked about the problems in the system and about the human side, on which he was right to focus. For many years, there has been a huge and unmet need for such provision, and some disturbing statistics suggest that that need is growing. The hon. Gentleman pointed to the strategy paper, which suggests that the Government think that numbers will decline as more such children go into mainstream schools. However, the demographics suggest that the need for SEN provision is increasing.

<a name="stpa_96">Of course, the existing state system does provide excellent provision for many&#151;indeed, in some cases it is superb, innovative and cutting edge&#151;but many others experience huge frustration in trying to deal with it. I shall name three such problems, the first of which is the delays that parents experience in getting the initial assessment for their child. The Government&#039;s strategy in recent years talks about early intervention, but that is a bit of joke, given that it can take months&#151;sometimes years&#151;to get an assessment. When such statements do come, increasingly, they are worded imprecisely, so that the local education authority and any other providers can wriggle out of their legal duties. That gives cause for concern, and even when there is a precise statement based on a decent assessment, parents often find it difficult to enforce those rights. So the system is not working.

 I am grateful for that intervention. I was about to explain how I have come to understand a little of how the system works, not as a parent, but as a constituency MP. I am familiar with such parent partnerships. Sometimes they work, but often, they do not. In my first few years as a Member of this House, many parents&#151;angry mothers, in the main&#151;asked me to help them with their case. Trying to help was frustrating, because we came up against the brick wall of bureaucracy, which was strengthened even by the parent partnerships. The frustration was so great that I decided to get the parents to help themselves, and we set up a support group in the constituency called the Kingston special needs project, whose website I recommend. That group helps parents to get through the minefield of the system. It provides extra support, and parents regard it as more independent than parent partnerships. I acknowledge that such partnerships suit many parents, but many others do not benefit from them. We need to look at other ways of helping them.

In fact, some authorities are minimising the problems that such children have, in the knowledge that once they are statemented at a certain level, there is nowhere for them to go.

 I am grateful to the hon. Lady for that intervention and I am coming to that issue. My experience in working with such parents and in setting up the self-help group showed me that there are two systemic problems. First, the system is adversarial. It creates hostility, and for some of the reasons that the hon. Lady alluded to, there is lack of trust. Secondly, links between education, health and social services still do not really exist. Ministers will say&#151;as the Minister did in her opening speech&#151;that the 10-year strategy, &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot;, will tackle all these problems, and that the rather narrow audit will add something to the process. But on reading that strategy and examining how the audit has been set up, I doubt whether those policies will address the system&#039;s adversarial nature and the need to link services together.

<a name="stpa_98">The adversarial system is, by and large, built around the statementing process. In law, the statement is supposed to provide the rights. Parents battle for statements, and LEAs battle against them to avoid the expenditure that they involve. Appeals are made, solicitors are engaged and experts are consulted. It is probably a familiar, if rather depressing, story for many Members, and certainly for many parents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-15_para8">
<a name="stpa_99">The strategy, it seems, is a gradual one: the Government want to create a parallel system where there are some children on statements, but many others taken off or denied statements. The Government are also trying to adopt other policies, such as early intervention, to persuade parents that their children do not need statements, so that they do not need to go through the process. If they can convince parents and win back their trust, that might be reasonable, but the policy has one basic flaw: what happens about the manifest problems of the statementing process in the interim, before new Labour has built the new Jerusalem of perfect SEN provision without a plethora of statements? There is already a problem now, as there seems to be a set of unannounced policies that are undermining the statementing system even before we reach the new Jerusalem.

Ministers are doing little or nothing to improve the statementing system because they want to see it wither on the vine.

A family moves to a particular local authority area and overnight there may be a huge increase in expenditure requirements. That is what creates the tension and that is where the hostility and frustration lie. Faced with budget pressure, we all know what LEAs will do: they will build in a culture of saying no, of creating delays and of trying to undermine parents&#039; ability to get statements.

The Government are right to do it that way round and to meet the needs of parents in that way, rather than push desperate parents through a statementing process.

 I acknowledge that it is happening, as the hon. Lady says, in some parts of the country, but in many other parts of the country it is not. In those circumstances, statementing is the only thing that parents have to look after their children now, here, today when they need special education. What the hon.

Ministers cannot ignore those problems and sit around waiting for the 10-year strategy to work&#151;if, indeed, it does work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_103">So what is the solution? Let me be honest: I have been in this job for just over four weeks, as has the hon. Member for Witney. I have just a few gut instincts about where the solutions lie; I do not have a blueprint. We put forward our policies at the election&#151;smaller class sizes, more investment in teacher training, promoting special schools as centres of excellence. Those are all in place and I believe that they would all help. Nevertheless, as I read the Government strategy and talk to parents, I become convinced that more is needed. That is why we think that a comprehensive review is required. Unlike the hon. Gentleman, I do not have a soundbite answer about a moratorium, but I shall put forward some of my first thoughts now and I hope that the Minister will respond to them in kind and with kindness as there may be quite a few flaws&#151;but here they are.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_104">First, should not the assessment process for a statement be managed by an independent organisation&#151;independent of local government, independent of national Government and independent of any of the providers? Preferably, it would be managed by a multi-discipline assessment centre with health and education professionals sitting around the table, working together and conducting the necessary tests in one or just a few days. The independence would remove the conflict of interests for the LEA and restore parents&#039; trust. The one-stop centre approach would cut the horrendous delays and facilitate the early intervention that, to be fair, is at the heart of removing barriers to achievement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_105">Parents will still want to challenge independent assessors through existing mechanisms, but there would surely be far fewer challenges, which would cut down on the bureaucracy of appeals and all the waste of time and money that goes with it. I would genuinely welcome the Minister&#039;s response to that idea and in a spirit of open debate I would be pleased to hear the downsides of the proposal.

<a name="50622-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_106">My second instinct on getting solutions is that we should look more carefully at the expensive side of special needs provision, as the Government are doing in the audit. We have heard a lot about that today and I welcome it. High costs are one of the key factors driving the hostility in the system, as local bureaucrats are worried that a statement may lead to an expensive provision. Ministers will doubtless say that the audit will look into best practice and seek ways of avoiding duplication and pooling resources. That is all well and good, but we must ensure that decisions reached by the audit can be questioned and not just taken by unaccountable quangos. The SEN partnerships want to ensure that any decisions coming from the audit are accountable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_107">My idea is that the audit could be broadened. Could it not consider the idea that the costs of the very needy and expensive cases be transferred from the local authority&#039;s budget to the Department&#039;s budget? That would be a small centralisation, I accept, but an acceptable one because it is potentially liberating for local authorities and would enable them to plan their budgets more effectively. I do not know whether that would work. We would need to ensure that it was not a recipe for the councils passing the buck, which is where my idea for an independent assessment would kick in. National funding would be triggered only by an independent assessment that judged a child&#039;s needs as being above a certain threshold. There would be a real prize in that local authorities could focus on the needs of the less severe special needs children, which they should then be able to manage because of their greater certainty about the budget. There would also be much less friction with, and distrust by, the parents. Again, I hope that the Minister will respond positively.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_108">I mentioned a second systemic problem with statementing. To be fair, the 10-year strategy begins to address, but does not solve it. I am talking about the importance of multi-agency working. I accept that it is happening on the ground. In my own constituency, Kingston council set up with other partners a joint system for children with disabilities, but I have to say that it is slow, particularly in getting health providers around the table. One of the reasons for that lies in Whitehall, because Whitehall has not told the local health providers to make the joined-up approach a priority. I am not one for too many targets&#151;I am not keen on the NHS target culture&#151;but it seems that Health Ministers are developing targets for health providers without giving them a target for this particular aspect. I believe that Education Ministers should have a word with Health Ministers to join up the approach in Whitehall.

<a name="stpa_126">The Ofsted report also found that between 2001&nbsp;and 2003&nbsp;there had been a 25&nbsp;per cent. increase in the number of pupils in referral units&#151;that is, units to which children can be removed from mainstream classes. It reported a wide variation in the quality of teaching offered to pupils with SEN, and that mainstream and special schools remained far too isolated from one another. That seems to make a pretty good case for the Select Committee considering the issue forensically. The DFES&#039;s 2004&nbsp;departmental report contained a section on SEN, but this year&#039;s report includes only two passing references&#151;so the Department needs our help, and I hope that we will be able to give it.

<p>
<a name="50622-17_para15">
<a name="stpa_127">In the short time available, I want to put such things in context. We are all guilty&#151;are we not?&#151;in education, as in any other policy area, of being victims of fashion. We get swayed by a fashion, and when a fashion is really pervasive and even pernicious, we do not even know that we are part of it. I remember naming our first daughter Lucy, without realising that the world and their wife were also choosing the same name at the same time. One year, the name &quot;Lucy&quot; did not figure at all in the &quot;most favourite&quot; list in <i>The Times</i>; the next year, the Perks in &quot;The Archers&quot; called their daughter Lucy. Hon. Members will notice that all my other children have very strange names.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-17_para16">
<a name="stpa_128">When we are part of a fashion, we are pushed this way and that by it. Every party in the House was swayed by the fashion of inclusion, of which the original Warnock view was part, and it has continued to be a very strong fashion. It is partly based on the truth that many of the people who come to me as their Member of Parliament are terrified that their children will be designated as different in any way. They want their children to go to a regular school, in a regular class, and they do not want any statement or any label to be put on their children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-17_para17">
<a name="stpa_129">Another group of people come to see us as Members of Parliament, and they desperately want special attention, desperately want a statement and desperately want their children to go to special school if that is appropriate. That is the truth of the matter, and I do not know which sort of parent will turn up when I hold a constituency surgery; but, normally, one or other of them does.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-17_para18">
<a name="stpa_130">We have got to get the balance right, and enough evidence can be found in the reports that have already been written to say that there is a real worry about special schools and a real concern about statementing. How many of us do not know that there is a long wait for statements? There is a long wait to see an educational psychologist&#151;and people do not even dream of seeing a clinical psychologist.

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman). I urge the Government Whips to set up the Select Committees as early as possible. I would certainly be very pleased if the Opposition Whips allowed me to serve on the Select Committee on Education and Skills, and I would have great pleasure in voting for the hon. Gentleman as its Chairman.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_131">I share something with the hon. Gentleman: I was not very knowledgeable about the subject until I became a candidate in the Forest of Dean, where it was a prominent local issue. We had two special schools&#151;Dean Hall and Oakdene&#151;that were closed by the former administration in Gloucestershire. There was a consultation exercise, although it appeared to be consultation in name rather than reality, and during that process I met a huge number of parents who spoke eloquently at public meetings in arguing the case for proper provision for their children. One thing that struck me was being told that there were 16,000&nbsp;children with some kind of special need in Gloucestershire, 15,000&nbsp;of whom were already being educated in mainstream schools. That seemed a pretty good record of inclusion, with 1,000&nbsp;pupils being educated in some kind of special school.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_132">The administration wanted to go further by pretty much getting rid of moderate learning difficulty provision and moving all those children into mainstream education, whether or not that suited them. To an outside observer, that process appeared to be driven by ideology, rather than by looking at the evidence. The head teachers at both the special and mainstream schools opposed the policy, as did the teachers and parents. Even some children spoke up against the policy at those meetings. The former administration in Gloucestershire refused to listen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_133">The most shameful thing was that the then portfolio holder for education took the decision to close those schools without even having the courtesy to visit them while they were in operation or to meet the teachers and pupils to see them in action. That is a lesson for politicians. If we are taking such decisions, we have an obligation to visit institutions before doing so. The same decision might still have been taken, but at least it would have been done in full possession of the facts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_134">In the Forest of Dean, the two special schools&#151;Oakdene and Dean Hall&#151;will be closed in September. A new special school&#151;the Heart of the Forest community special school&#151;is under construction and will start operating in September. It is specifically designed to cater for children with severe learning difficulties, profound multiple learning difficulties and complex needs. I am sure that it will provide an excellent education for those children, and it has my full support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_135">The problem is that there will be a gap in provision for those children who have moderate learning difficulties and who were previously supported at Dean Hall special

<br>&nbsp;<br>school. They will have no option but to go into the mainstream. Many have tried the mainstream before, and they have been failed. A lot of the children at Dean Hall special school&#151;this is one of the key points made by their parents&#151;have tried mainstream education before and it has failed them, and their parents have therefore sought special school provision. I am concerned that, come the autumn, those children will have no other option.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_136">The Minister for Schools said that Conservative Members were fixated on buildings and institutions. I do not think that that is right. I was struck very powerfully by the fact that, although both the schools to which I refer had relatively poor-quality accommodation, the essence of the school was shown by the head teacher&#039;s leadership, the quality of the staff and a lot of the voluntary work done by the parents. That is what makes the school. Clearly, it is much better if the quality of buildings and physical equipment is high; but that, in itself, cannot compensate for a lack of high-quality teaching or high-quality leadership by the head teacher.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_137">Another thing that struck me was the fact that because most children with moderate learning difficulties are already in mainstream education, as evidenced by the figures that I gave earlier&#151;15,000&nbsp;out of 16,000&nbsp;children with special needs&#151;those children with moderate learning difficulties who remain in special schools are likely to be at the more challenging end of the spectrum. They are likely to have needs that are more difficult to meet, and they are therefore unlikely to be successful in mainstream schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_138">A further point worth mentioning is that we talk about inclusion, by which we often mean inclusion in mainstream schooling. It is also worth thinking about what happens to children after they finish their education and how well they are included in society. One advantage of special schools is that, because they are much smaller, they can give much more personal attention to children in their last few years at school and to how they get those children into higher education, further education or meaningful employment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_139">I was struck at Dean Hall by how children in their last couple of years of education received personal attention from the staff, who looked for a proper route out of that school for the children, whether into local further education provision or work with a local company, or by moving to Gloucester to attend Gloscat&#151;Gloucestershire College of Arts and Technology&#151;or another education institute. Secondary schools may be much larger&#151;perhaps with 1,000&nbsp;or 1,500&nbsp;pupils&#151;and my experience of mainstream schooling suggests that that type of inclusion in society will not be as successful as specialist provision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_140">Some of Baroness Warnock&#039;s statements have been mentioned already, and I was also struck by some of them. On Monday 14&nbsp;June, she said on the &quot;Today&quot; programme that there are

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;a large number of children with special needs who will never flourish in mainstream schools.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_141">I agree. She has proposed a system of special schools that can serve a wider variety of needs than just those of pupils with severe learning difficulties. She wants to include autistic children and to ensure that those schools

<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 848</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>would be small enough to provide a reassuring and personal environment for emotionally vulnerable pupils. I support her in that case, too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-18_para11">
<a name="stpa_142">Finally, it is important that we listen to parents. They have to care for their children 24&nbsp;hours a day&#151;that is especially true for the parents of children with severe learning difficulties&#151;and they know their children best. During the consultation in my area, I realised that those parents have enough on their hands without having to fight a battle to get their child into a special school and then to keep that school open. We should fight that battle for them in the House, and that is why I commend the motion.

 The whole House welcomes the opportunity to debate this issue, and it is good that the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) has raised it. We all know that he has a deep personal interest in the issue and commitment to it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-18_para12">
<a name="stpa_143">On the other hand, it is a pity that the House will divide on the motion. I suppose that as it is an Opposition day motion, there is not much option, but it seems irrational to divide on the point about a moratorium. A blanket decision imposed on local authorities by central Government would go against the spirit of greater local independence and decision making, to which everyone in the House aspires. It is also irrational because we have no reasonable grounds for saying that there should be a moratorium. Some school closures may have to proceed for good reasons. Nor is there any reason for thinking that the Government are intent on closure per se, so that is an unfortunate point on which to divide the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-18_para13">
<a name="stpa_144">The hon. Gentleman seemed puzzled about the number of school closures. The figures for the 10&nbsp;years before 1997&nbsp;and the eight years since do not mean much in themselves, and they show no predisposition to closure. I think the figures are 27&nbsp;a year during the last 10&nbsp;years of Conservative Government and 13&nbsp;during eight years of Labour Government. They show no particular trend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-18_para14">
<a name="stpa_145">I want to refer to the situation in Coventry, the city I represent. My fellow MP for the city, my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South (Mr. Cunningham) is in the Chamber today. There are local proposals for the wholesale reorganisation of SEN arrangements in the city. When the council introduced the proposals, it pointed out that by law the guidance in the code must not be ignored. It is only guidance, however, and the important thing is how it is interpreted in practice. The guidance refers to &quot;a stronger right&quot; for children with SEN to be educated in mainstream schools. I have difficulty with the use of the word &quot;right&quot; in that statement because it suggests an overriding inclination, irrespective of anything else, to increase inclusion in mainstream schools. As a general point of principle and guidance, I do not argue against that objective but the presumption of a right makes it an obligation for local authorities to achieve it, which could override other considerations. The same pressure, allied to another to which I shall refer later, led the council to propose reorganisation. It stated that the ambition over the next few years was to replace all existing special needs schools 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 849</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>with brand new purpose-built schools collocated on the sites of neighbourhood schools. That may be a good idea, but the presumption that there is only one way to proceed implies that a blueprint will be imposed locally, irrespective of the existing organisation and provision of services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-18_para15">
<a name="stpa_146">The proposals are radical. They are out for consultation&#151;although as we all know, things are seldom if ever changed as a result. It is proposed that 11&nbsp;schools will be reduced to seven and that the capacity for children with special needs will be reduced from 850&nbsp;to 600. Those are radical shifts. When I spoke to the local director of education, he told me not to worry because there was nothing too dramatic about the proposals and that they would be introduced gradually. I replied that a 30&nbsp;per cent. reduction in capacity and in the number of schools was considerable by any standards. He then said, &quot;But three of those will go into one school&quot;. I said, &quot;Have you any idea of the problems that will cause for head teachers, teachers, and specialist staff in the schools?&quot;. He said, &quot;Don&#039;t worry, we&#039;re not going to get rid of any staff&quot;, to which I replied that that would make things even more complicated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-18_para16">
<a name="stpa_147">My appeal to the director of education is the same as my plea to the Government. Officials and the Government have become obsessed with structural reorganisation as an end in itself. That applies to foundation hospitals and primary care trusts. Every time we reorganise something we think it will be better but we never leave things in place long enough to judge the results before we move on to another reorganisation. I regret to say that that applied as much to the Conservative Government when they were in power, eons ago, as it does now. There is a continuum of obsession among the officials who administer our affairs.

<a name="stpa_149">Two things have occurred since we embarked on the reorganisation in Coventry.

Clearly, however, much good came from her first report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_150">Secondly, a national audit is under way of the situation in local government. That will provide a wealth of information about what is good and what is working. We shall then be able to consider how to improve provision in future. We need to take stock. We

We need to see what is working and to examine the work of specialist teams and how&#151;short of direct inclusion&#151;the relationship between special needs schools and mainstream schools can be improved. All that work could be brought to bear on the reorganisation on which Coventry seems hell bent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_151">When I put that point to the director of education in Coventry, he again told me not to worry because the authority had anticipated Baroness Warnock&#039;s report and had already adjusted its plans. He said that their proposals were bang in line with the views of Lady Warnock. When I asked him, &quot;What about the National Audit Office?&quot; he said that there was not even an audit for what was happening in Coventry. I assured him that I would not criticise the council but that I wanted to ensure that what was done corresponded to what was needed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_152">Another thing that drives the obsession for reorganisation is the crock of gold made available by one of the Minister&#039;s predecessors, who told us that over the next 10&nbsp;years there would be a complete rebuild of all secondary schools. Local authorities want to seize that crock of gold and build new schools, so the whole reorganisation process is about building. Building is important but it is not the only thing. We need a clear statement from the Government that refurbishment where necessary and appropriate will also qualify for the money. Like extensions and expansions, refurbishment should be part of the programme.

<a name="stpa_153">I am grateful to have had the opportunity to speak, and I urge the Government to be clear in their guidance about the form in which the money will be made available and the purposes for which it is to be used, so that there will not be misconceived presumptions in local government that the money should be spent only on new buildings.

It was especially telling that the Minister failed to acknowledge the worth of special schools that cater for pupils with moderate learning difficulties or to address their future. The main thing that came out of her speech was the fact that she would not acknowledge that those schools do a wonderful job and are relevant. Conservative Members wish to develop such schools further.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 851</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_155">Education was a major issue during the election. People in my constituency with children with special educational needs, statements or special school places were worried about where this aspect of education is going. Much of the debate on education is about aspects of education other than this one, so I welcome the fact that we are debating such an important subject today.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_156">In my years out of the House, I worked as a lecturer in a further education college. That, together with the fact that I am a governor of both St. Paulinus Church of England primary school in Crayford and Townley grammar school for girls in Bexleyheath, has kept me in touch with statements and special needs in mainstream schools. I have subsequently learned quite a lot about the special schools in my borough: Woodside school, Shenstone school and Marlborough school. All do a fantastic job for their pupils, so the teachers, governors and parents must be congratulated on the hard work that they do. My borough is fortunate to have a wide cross-section of different schools offering different provision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_157">A fact that has not been emphasised enough today, except by my hon. Friend, is that it is pupils who matter most. We have had a lot of debate about buildings and finance, but we must never lose sight of the fact that we are talking about pupils with special needs who need to be developed so that they can have rich and fulfilling lives. We should put the needs of children first. Children are all different, which is why Conservative Members say that we cannot have one size for everyone because we believe in choice and diversity. Despite the good intentions of educationists, when they produce theories they sometimes lose sight of the fact that we are talking about the needs of children and what their parents want.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_158">There has of course been a move towards inclusion for special needs children, which is right and welcome for children who can benefit from such mainstream education. If we can provide extra resources so that they can have a rich and fulfilling education in a mainstream school, that is really welcome because it is excellent news for both parents and children. However, if inclusion is just a politically motivated approach, it is not right. Including children in the mainstream when that is not in their interest is not good for parents, teachers, schools, other children in the establishments or, ultimately, the children themselves. If they do not get the advantages that they need, such as extra-curricular activities, extra provision or different provision, they will suffer.

<p><a name="st_175"><a name="50622-19_spnew3"><b> Mr. Khan: </b> 
 If the hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_176"><a name="50622-19_spnew4"><b> Mr. Evennett: </b> 
 I am interested in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, but I do not think that he is correct. If he looks at the figures, I think that he will find that there are now 6,000&nbsp;fewer places in special schools. Special schools have been closed while others are threatened with closure.

<a name="50622-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_159">The Government exert pressure to encourage inclusion by trying to get more children into mainstream schools. That is good in some cases, but we must analyse the current situation. We must determine what we think is best, where the resources can be used best and, ultimately, what is best for children. I am worried that children with severe or complex learning difficulties are being gradually moved into mainstream schools that are not appropriate for their needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-19_para12">
<a name="stpa_160">During the election campaign, parents told me that their interests were not being taken into account. They want a voice on what is going on with special educational needs, and they want a say in special schools. They raised with me on several occasions the process of statementing, which the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) highlighted earlier in an interesting part of his speech. The statementing process often takes too long. It is often too bureaucratic, and it has not achieved what parents want, which is the best for their children. We thus want the process to be examined.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-19_para13">
<a name="stpa_161">If inclusion is to be the theme of special needs provision, parents should be much more involved in the process. They deserve choice because they know what is best for their children. They should consult with the experts, rather than just being told what is happening. The Minister for Schools omitted to say that she wanted to involve parents in the process to a greater extent, look after children&#039;s interests and ensure that the best outcome is found for all, so I hope that the Under-Secretary will address that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-19_para14">
<a name="stpa_162">I hope that the Government will take on board several of the ideas put forward in the excellent speech made by my hon. Friend. They should take parents&#039; views into account and examine the law that currently restricts choice&#151;I think that it is biased against special schools. The current audit should cover all special schools; not just schools dealing with severe learning difficulties, but those dealing with moderate learning difficulties. There has been some banter about the word &quot;moratorium&quot;, but if we are going to conduct a serious study, it would be useful to stop where we are at the moment instead of carrying on and finding that the study&#039;s findings come too late. A moratorium would thus be a good thing.

<p>
<a name="50622-19_para15">
<a name="stpa_163">I am worried about this aspect of education, but I am afraid that nothing that the Minister for Schools said gave me any confidence that the Government are considering it constructively and with an open mind. Parents and choice should be the top priority, but I am worried that there is a bias against special schools. I hope that the Under-Secretary will take on board some of the genuine concerns of Conservative Members and act accordingly.

<a name="50622-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_164">It is important that we continue to provide special school education, but there has been a growing recognition among parents, teachers and society as a whole that mainstream education can deliver the same support as a special school, and that not only do the children with special needs benefit, but the mainstream school and the children who attend it also benefit, and all children learn that we are not all the same and that children with special needs should not be hidden away but are all part of an inclusive community where we can demonstrate that everyone makes a valuable contribution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_165">As more and more parents have seen the benefits of mainstream education, more and more of them are making that choice, and that is why we have seen falling rolls at special schools. Parents of special needs children are naturally very protective of them, but most of them want their children to be independent, both when they are at school and when they grow up. That is possible only in an inclusive society that recognises difference but values everyone. In my constituency, the local education authority has identified 26&nbsp;different and diverse groups that have special needs, including learning difficulties, sensory impairments and physical disabilities. The LEA is striving to ensure that special educational needs provisions meet everyone&#039;s needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_166">I want parents to be able to make informed decisions about their preferences. To make that decision, parents need to be reassured that the same level of specialist support is available in mainstream schools as in special schools. I am sure that the national audit of SEN specialist services, support and provision that is under way will be an enormous help in assessing needs and provision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_167">It is important that such decisions are made locally. LEAs, in partnerships with parents and schools, are closest to their communities and best placed to meet their educational needs. Although the number of parents opting for special schools in my constituency has declined, mainstream schools are not suitable for some children. That applies even to specialist units within mainstream schools, but with more parents opting for mainstream schooling, we have to consider the viability of smaller special schools with falling rolls.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_168">My constituency falls within the Portsmouth LEA, and there are two particular special schools with falling rolls. One of the schools is in my constituency and the other is in Portsmouth, South. One is housed in a building that has difficulty in meeting the needs of access, mobility and health and safety. The other is on a limited site that is not suitable for expansion. Both schools have their own ethos and culture and both are fiercely proud of ownership. There is a fierce pride among parents, staff and pupils, who are prepared to defend their school to the hilt.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_169">Portsmouth LEA received &#163;5&nbsp;million targeted capital fund allocation for special needs allocation, and it was decided that the best way to meet the difficulties of the two schools was to close them both and build a new school. Inevitably, when the proposal was first mooted there was fierce resistance. Parents saw only what was

<br>&nbsp;<br>happening to their school and were worried about how their children would manage. We all know that children with special educational needs need stability. The parents were worried about the effect that the change would have on the education of their children, along with the disruption that would inevitably occur.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_170">Parents want their special needs children to live as independent a life as possible. If the numbers in a school fall too far, there will be fewer teachers, so teachers have to hold responsibility for two or more subjects, as well as a similar number of whole-school aspects such as assessment. That means that they would be spending a great deal of time preparing schemes of work and moderating the work of their colleagues, which could mean little time left for out-of-school activities. Very small schools find it more difficult to offer the depth and breadth of subjects expected by Ofsted, which I think should be an entitlement of all pupils, whether in mainstream or special schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_171">As the consultation process moved forward, people began to see the benefits that would accrue from a brand-new purpose-built building housing the full range of facilities best to serve the curriculum and learning needs of children with severe and complex learning difficulties and disabilities while meeting the highest specifications of access and mobility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_172">The ethos and culture of a school do not come from its buildings, but from the staff and leadership of the school. In Portsmouth, the staff and leadership will come together in the new school. From September 2006, out of the closure of two special schools will come a better facility in a purpose-built building delivering a curriculum and out-of-school activities that are designed to give these special needs pupils the tools and experiences that they will need so that, as adults, when they leave school, they can live as independent a life as possible. Surely, that is what special needs education is all about. I am concerned that, if the Opposition had their way and there were a moratorium on the closure of special schools, those children in my constituency would be denied their brand-new school and all the opportunities that go with it.

 I do not wish to make them appear vulnerable, but a number of Members, mostly from the Government, have said that this debate should not be conducted in an atmosphere of acrimony and point scoring. I can assure the House that I do not intend to speak in that way today, although I hope to have an opportunity to do so another time. I do not have any party interest in the squabble between the Labour party, which does not stand in Northern Ireland, and the Conservative party, which does stand, even though it is hardly worth while to do so in some constituencies.

<a name="stpa_173">I shall look at a number of issues that need to be addressed.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 855</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>during the period in which the Administration has been in charge of education. To me, that seems like a policy of closure. The first thing to do is look at changing the balance. There is an undoubted bias towards mainstreaming, and thus a bias against special schools. Indeed, Baroness Warnock accepted that when she was honest about the disastrous nature of the policy. In a damning indictment, she said that &quot;a disastrous legacy&quot; had created

<p>
<a name="50622-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_174">For a number of years now, many families have come to realise that their youngsters have not received the education that they deserve. There is increasing awareness that social inclusion does not always mean educational inclusion. Sometimes, for youngsters&#039; own protection, it is important to remove them from the rough and tumble of mainstream schools and give them the opportunity to be taught in a different environment. The policy that provides the right to mainstream schooling has sent out the wrong signal. The Minister cited the report by the chief inspector of schools and said that there had been an improvement in standards, but the Ofsted report said that there remains uncertainty about what constitutes adequate progress for pupils with SEN. If Ofsted finds it difficult to know what constitutes progress, it is incredible that the Minister should say that progress has taken place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_175">The Ofsted report was less than glowing about provision in mainstream schools. It said that a minority of mainstream schools meet special needs requirements very well but that admission to mainstream schools of pupils with social and behavioural difficulties&#151;let us not forget, such difficulties constitute the biggest increase in SEN&#151;has proved to be the hardest test of the inclusion framework. Inspectors have all pointed out that even the most committed headmasters have reservations when asked to admit pupils with high levels of need, especially when those children have previously attended mainstream schools without success. The chief inspector&#039;s report suggested that mainstreaming is not always the most preferable route.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-20_para12">
<a name="stpa_176">A variety of provision is needed. The Minister announced this week an extra &#163;3.5&nbsp;million for special needs provision in education in Northern Ireland. That is very welcome, given the pressure that there was. I have spoken to a number of teachers in special needs schools in Northern Ireland. They feel devalued by the emphasis on mainstreaming. They see that as a slight on special needs schools which, as other speakers have acknowledged, often provide the expertise that mainstream schools draw on, and provide an opportunity for youngsters who are not suited to mainstream schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-20_para13">
<a name="stpa_177">We have a number of mainstream schools in Northern Ireland where special units have been introduced, sometimes because it was an easy way when there was spare capacity. In some cases that has worked out well and in some cases not so well. It is ironic that, in my constituency, where I met the Minister last week, a school that has a special unit within it, where the youngsters have separate opportunities to be educated and join the mainstream youngsters for certain activities, is to be closed. It is a model that seems to have worked well.

<a name="50622-20_para14">
<a name="stpa_178">The Minister spoke of capacity building in mainstream schools. That could have an important effect on statementing. Members have spoken about the delay in obtaining statements. A third of educational psychologists&#039; time is taken up drawing up statements, each of which costs about &#163;2,500, and still many people have to wait a long time before they get a statement. There is also an equality issue. The situation in Northern Ireland is no different from that in the rest of the United Kingdom&#151;middle-class parents seem to have more access to statements than parents from less well-off backgrounds. They have more skills and know the system better. That needs to be addressed.

<a name="50622-20_para15">
<a name="stpa_179">We would need fewer statements, though not as few as Baroness Warnock imagined&#151;2&nbsp;per cent. of youngsters statemented&#151;if there was provision and capacity building in mainstream schools, where youngsters with moderate learning difficulties could quickly be taken in and given some help, rather than parents feeling that they have to use statementing as the only way to get the extra provision. Capacity building has an important role to play in reducing the demand for statements.

 In Amber Valley, the proportion of pupils in maintained special schools is the same now as in 1997.

Parents rightly want the choice of what is right for their child.

<a name="stpa_181">I have sat in the station buffet in Derby watching young people have an animated conversation through the glass doors. They had come from the Royal School for the Deaf. I have also been in a Committee Room in the House seeing staff from Aldercar infants school in my constituency receive a national training award for their work with deaf children who are integrated into their school. Even the taxi drivers get training in sign language and parents who got involved now have national vocational qualifications in social care and special needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_182">National policies are carried out by local authorities. If Labour had an agenda to close special schools and to limit choice, we would see it in Labour Derbyshire. Labour does not have that agenda. I shall give some examples. Derbyshire county council has had excellent ratings three times running in the comprehensive performance assessments. Ofsted says it is a good LEA and it has above average performance on special needs. Derbyshire&#039;s principal educational psychologist has nearly finished an 18-month review of all special needs, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 857</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>including special schools. Derbyshire&#039;s cabinet member for education said to me yesterday, &quot;This review is not to close special schools, but to provide a mixed pattern of education to meet the needs of children and parents.&quot; Do the Opposition really want to take away Derbyshire&#039;s right to assess local needs?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_183">Let us examine the case of a special school that did close in the neighbouring constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash (Liz Blackman). Two schools amalgamated because the number of children with moderate disabilities seeking places fell, which left spare places. It made sense to close one school to ensure proper provision for those pupils who needed it, and parents were consulted and extra resources obtained. Some of the children at the school had severe physical disabilities, but their cognitive abilities required a fuller curriculum than that provided in that special school, so an enhanced resources provision unit was set up at Aldercar school.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_184">I recently visited that unit, which has excellent facilities, and met Louise, who has cerebral palsy and uses an augmentative electronic communications system, which it was amazing to see her use. I met Robert, who has severe cerebral palsy. He used to go to a residential school out of the county, but his parents became concerned because he withdrew into himself and did not enjoy the residential experience, and they asked for him to come to Aldercar school. Those children spend time in the special unit when they need special help, but they also spend a lot of time in the mainstream school, which has to amend the curriculum accordingly. That allows Louise to do PE and Carl, who wants to study the performing arts, to work on his BTEC with other pupils.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_185">Aldercar school takes pupils other than those in that unit, including the most severely autistic child in Derbyshire in mainstream education. Her parents asked for her to go to the school because they wanted her to experience mainstream education, and they are delighted by her progress. When she does funny things, such as quacking, the other children say, &quot;Oh, that is Emily&quot;&#151;she is part of the school. In September, the school will take a child with multiple problems with muscular dystrophy, and, again, his parents want him to attend the school. Those parents had a choice and asked for their child to go to that school, which is the important point. We need provision that suits children&#039;s needs and that is right for individual children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_186">The children whom I have mentioned attend a mainstream school with special provision, but other children attend special schools. Last year, I visited a special school in Alfreton in my constituency, which was very concerned about staffing and resources. Derbyshire county council has generally been underfunded in comparison with southern counties, and although the gap has been closing, it still lags behind on special school provision, resources, funding and staffing. As well as putting money into mainstream schools, the county council has halved the gap between current special needs provision in Derbyshire and average special needs provision around the country, and it hopes to close that gap completely. Does that sound like Labour closing special schools?

Please do not let us put Derbyshire into a straitjacket based on dogma or, as my hon.

It is not helpful to lurch from one view to another. As Baroness Warnock rightly reminded us, some children need to go into special schools; we need to consider her report carefully.

 This has been a very interesting debate, and I commend Members on both sides of the House for their contributions. I shall deal with some of the points made by the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber) in a moment.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_192">I want to talk about two schools in my constituency whose circumstances inform any debate on special schools or special educational needs. Mary Hare school for the deaf is a non-maintained special school with places funded by more than 100&nbsp;local education authorities from around the country. It caters for some of the 20&nbsp;per cent. of profoundly deaf children who cannot be educated in the mainstream. It is much appreciated and lauded by the Minister&#039;s Department in several ways. It has been invited to become a specialist trailblazer school; it tops the league under the Department&#039;s value-added table; and it has, in recent years, achieved training school status. Indeed, it has just had a &#163;300,000&nbsp;grant for a new performing arts centre. One can therefore tell that it is much appreciated by the Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_193">Members will be able to tell that there is a big &quot;but&quot; coming. That &quot;but&quot; relates to the way in which the school has to deal with special educational needs tribunals. Even hard-core advocates of inclusion have always accepted that extreme cases of deafness and visual impairment are exceptions to the inclusion agenda and benefit from specialist school education. But the head teacher of Mary Hare school, Tony Shaw, spends 40&nbsp;per cent. of his time preparing for and fighting special educational needs tribunals on behalf of pupils and parents. Last year, he won 17&nbsp;out of 18&nbsp;of those cases; the remaining one is being appealed at the High Court. This year, he is assisting 15&nbsp;families appealing these tribunals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_194">It is worth examining what is going on here. Unless schools take time to represent these families, in the vast majority of cases they do not have a prayer when they get to the tribunal. The tribunals follow a legal framework, which most parents cannot be qualified to fight. A tribunal requires copious details of a child&#039;s case, and the parents have to prove at length why the local education authority provision is inadequate. It requires an enormous amount of work and understanding of how the system operates.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-21_para14">
<a name="stpa_195">There is a prejudice in the educational establishment against special schools and it means that children suffer. The decision by Mary Hare school, like many others, to put its head above the parapet and take on what some hon. Members have described in the past as the inclusion police, was hard to make because it has been trying to build relationships over the years with local education authorities. However, by taking on the tribunals, it has secured a good education and the best prospects for many children. It has done that not only for the children whom it represents at the tribunals but for the other children at the school. It has managed to keep the school roll up, thus securing its future. As my hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) said earlier, the LEAs are working to an agenda of inclusion that has been pushed in recent years, and it causes great unhappiness when cases go to tribunal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-21_para15">
<a name="stpa_196">I shall briefly refer to another paradox for the Mary Hare school. The Under-Secretary cannot deal with it, but perhaps she can put some pressure on the Chancellor. In receiving the &#163;300,000&nbsp;grant for the new building&#151;for which it is very grateful&#151;the school will probably also face a VAT bill of more than &#163;400,000&nbsp;for the same project. A maintained special school would not 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 860</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>receive such a bill; it could claw back the VAT. That anomaly must be resolved. What the Government appear to give with one hand, they take away with the other.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-21_para16">
<a name="stpa_197">I want to consider another school in my constituency, the Castle school in Donnington. It is an LEA-maintained community special school, which encompasses the range of special needs. It is a uniquely wonderful place to visit. It has children with genuine problems and it faces an interesting challenge that enables me to be constructive about the future of inclusion. The school buildings are reaching the end of their natural life. It is on a site that is away from the centre of town and children have to be bussed to Newbury when they want to carry out other activities. It has successfully co-located its infants school with a mainstream school in the town. The decision that the school must make has to be sensitive to the passionate loyalty of parents, pupils, teachers and governors. However, it is moving towards deciding to co-locate the school with another secondary school in the LEA. I pay tribute to the way in which the school, the governors and the LEA have handled the matter. If it is done right, everybody wins.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-21_para17">
<a name="stpa_198">The co-location would be based on the model of Springfield school in Witney, which my hon. Friend the Member for Witney described, where inclusion can work to everybody&#039;s gain. A properly co-located school can be appropriate for different children. Some can share certain classes, whereas for others, it is not appropriate to share any classes. However, they can share facilities such as catering and sports facilities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-21_para18">
<a name="stpa_199">Children in the mainstream school also benefit. My education was divorced entirely from that of those with special needs&#151;I expect that that applies to many in my generation. I went into adult life practically never having met a child with special needs. I believe that inclusion, when done properly and limited, is right for children for whom it is appropriate. In those circumstances, co-location is a way forward. We cannot hermetically seal children with special needs away from those in the mainstream.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-21_para19">
<a name="stpa_200">In short, I hope that the Government will hear the pleas of parents who know what is best for their children, and the pleas of special schools. I hope that they will also listen to the words of Baroness Warnock. This is an important debate, involving the most vulnerable people in our society. I commend the motion to the House.

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for calling me to speak in this debate, which should have at its heart the experiences and needs of children, their parents and their carers. All too often, parents feel alienated from the very processes designed to support them. They frequently feel ignored or dismissed, or that their views are of the smallest importance when it comes to determining what support should be offered and how it should be organised. It is fair to say, however, that not every parent&#039;s experience is like that. Most children&#039;s needs are quickly identified, so that the appropriate support can be put in place.

<a name="stpa_201">When the delays start to occur, they are often accompanied by a feeling on the part of the parents that their views on their child&#039;s needs are being ignored. Indeed, it often seems as though the professionals respond to an assertive parent by digging in, by entrenching themselves in their position, and by weaving a web of dialogue around the parent. This makes things much worse for parents, who often have mixed feelings about the whole process anyway. Some parents feel uncertain about allowing their child to be labelled as different in any way. In that context, it is distressing for them to learn that the process itself is often complicated and fraught with tensions and disagreements. Time delays and cancelled appointments undermine confidence in the process, making parents feel that their child is just a name on numerous files, a faceless entity filed away somewhere for action at some future date.

<a name="50622-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_202">Only last week, I went to meet the parents of an autistic child in my constituency. They want their son to enjoy an extra year at primary school because of the failure to diagnose his autism at an early stage. They have the support of professionals such as the educational psychologist and the consultant community paediatrician. However, the local education authority&#039;s response to their request has not been particularly positive, and the matter will go before a panel meeting tomorrow. As far as Mr. and Mrs. Houghton are concerned, the whole process is tense and difficult, and it follows what they have described as a distant and bureaucratic relationship with the special educational needs service. To give an example of what that relationship has been like, I shall tell the House about an event that took place last week. When Mr. and Mrs. Houghton rang the LEA to ask about the date of the panel hearing, they were told quite categorically that it had not yet been determined. I phoned the LEA the following day to inquire about the case, and was given the date immediately. It is appalling that an MP can be given such information when it has been denied to the parents involved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_203">I acknowledge, however, that there are no easy ways to improve the services provided to parents and children with special needs, but improve them we must. The key to improvement is surely to focus not on buildings, moratoriums and so on, but on the better co-ordination of services for children, and on putting parents at the heart of the process. The introduction of integrated children&#039;s services is one of the ways in which we can improve the work between professionals, their relationships with parents, and the service. I have already told professionals in Sheffield that, for me, the test of children&#039;s services will be how much SEN services improve, and how much less parents complain about it. That is the key for children&#039;s services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_204">What provision do we need? In Sheffield, we have a spectrum of provision. We have special schools, as well as integrated resources in the mainstream. Children with a low incidence of need are fully integrated into the mainstream, and we also have an opt-out provision for children who need to be taken out of their mainstream school for a few short weeks and given intensive support. That is the way forward. There is nothing in the Government&#039;s policy about either closure or total inclusion. A spectrum of provision is the recommended way forward, and it is based on four principles.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_205">The first is collaboration between special schools and the mainstream, to ensure that expertise is there at every point in provision for all children. The second is flexible provision, which allows children to transfer from special to mainstream schools if necessary, and vice versa, with no delay. Thirdly, the system must give parents choice. Fourthly, as I have said before, it must be led by professionals working in schools who know best how to improve the service and introduce innovations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_206">I consider the proposed moratorium totally inappropriate. We need flexibility. Some closures are necessary. In Sheffield two new schools are opening in September, after three old special schools have been rebuilt. Parents welcome that, and it has led to an expansion in the number of places available. More closures are in the pipeline, agreed to by parents because the schools are being rebuilt. I appeal to Members not to vote for a moratorium that would stop Sheffield getting its new schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_207">A further programme of closure and rebuilding is not appropriate. What is appropriate is for decisions on how provision should be shaped to be made locally. A nationally imposed moratorium would be an example of centralised control that could damage SEN education rather than improving it. I suggest that if there are problems with provision across the country, local government reform is what is needed. We should not have a go at SEN provision when the problem lies with authorities&#151;sometimes Tory-controlled&#151;that do not know how to handle relationships with parents and SEN professionals.

<a name="stpa_208">This has been a fascinating afternoon. I find it interesting that there is a fair amount of agreement in the House. I am a new Member, but I would love it if someone set out his or her ideas and then said, &quot;Hands up those who agree with this.&quot; I think we would turn out to be in agreement on many issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_209">One thing on which we definitely agree is that inclusion of children with special needs in mainstream schools is a worthy ideal, and I think that for many it is the best option. Inclusion of all children, however, is not the right idea. It is generating a huge amount of fear and mistrust among teachers at the moment: they do not feel that they will be able to cope. I have seen teachers in tears because they are desperate. They say, &quot;I went into mainstream education because that is what I feel I can do. I do not feel that I have the skills to meet the requirements of children with special needs.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_210">I think that there is a problem with perception. Labour Members seem to believe that a moratorium will somehow stop everything, that we are going to go backwards, and that we think inclusion is a bad idea. That is not the case. We are saying what a Labour

</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_211">My constituency contains some brilliant schools for children with special needs. Gosden House school deals with children with moderate learning difficulties. We also have Pond Meadow, which is to co-locate with a secondary school, and Thornchace, which is a very special school for girls with emotional and behavioural disorders. Many of the girls are looked after, many have been excluded from mainstream schools, and many have already failed in pupil referral units. That school faces closure, which is devastating for staff, pupils and parents, because they know that they have something special to give to very special girls, which is to be taken away from them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-22_para11">
<a name="stpa_212">The local education authorities do not want prescriptive messages from Government. They think that they have to pursue inclusion with all their might, which is why we are seeing special schools close. Often, aspirational theory translates into poorly conceived practice and that is what we are seeing now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-22_para12">
<a name="stpa_213">We have heard lots of talk of joined-up thinking and partnership working. It makes me so angry, because it does not necessarily translate into something that works on the ground. Ministers can say all the words they want, but what parents and children want to know is: is it working on the ground? A moratorium is the right answer because we need to take stock. There is too much uncertainty out there about how to meet the needs of children with special needs for us to continue. We need to say, &quot;Hang on a minute, what do we agree on, what is right?&quot; and examine the whole sector.

 I am happy to support my hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) on this important subject, which I am delighted he has given us the opportunity to debate. It has been a very interesting debate. We nearly all agree that there is a problem&#151;I was a bit concerned that the Minister started off by saying that there is not a problem. Hon. Members on both sides of the House have said that there&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are problems&#151;even Labour Members have highlighted them.

<a name="stpa_214">The Government cannot have it both ways. They say that there is not a problem and then, when people say that there is, they say that it is not their problem, but local authorities&#039;. It would be worth while for the Government to acknowledge that there is a problem. I congratulate my hon. Friend on bringing the matter to the House&#039;s attention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-22_para14">
<a name="stpa_215">I may be able to be constructive for the Government in some respects. There are local authorities that want to improve their provision for special needs but they need the Government&#039;s help. Bradford council has some innovative and ambitious plans to improve special needs education and to increase the number of special schools in the district, but it needs the Government&#039;s help. I hope that the Minister will look favourably upon Bradford council when it requires some help to improve provision in its area.

<a name="stpa_216">The council&#039;s plans involve opening three new secondary special schools. It also has ambitious plans to introduce three new primary special schools. That is being funded from the council&#039;s own resources because it sees it as a priority. It wants to improve the available provision. I hope that the Government will help it to deliver that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-22_para16">
<a name="stpa_217">All those schools will be co-located with other schools. My hon. Friends the Members for Newbury (Mr. Benyon) and for Witney pointed out that the model of co-locating a special school with a mainstream school can work. That is what Bradford council intends to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-22_para17">
<a name="stpa_218">There are some areas where the Government could help local authorities. One is through the funding of therapies, including speech and language therapy and physiotherapy, which are grossly underfunded in the Bradford district. Demand is higher than supply and the council needs about &#163;420,000&nbsp;to meet that demand. I hope that the Government will help it with that provision, which is so needed in the Bradford district.

<a name="stpa_219">There is a gap between what is offered to people while they are at special schools and what is offered when they leave. Post-school life, little appears to be done; there is a dearth of provision and facilities both for the people leaving and for their carers or parents. Some capital and revenue funding to help with that would be worth while and meet a real need.

<p>
<a name="50622-22_para19">
<a name="stpa_220">What I have in mind is co-located living and training accommodation. People could be accommodated and trained there both while they are at school and after they finish school. That would give them the independence that they crave but currently do not possess.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-22_para20">
<a name="stpa_221">My concern is that the Government&#039;s agenda involves trying to force children into mainstream schools in cases where doing so is not appropriate. I do not know what led to that idea. My fear is that this agenda is based not on what is in the best interests of the children&#151;of the people who need these facilities&#151;but on forcing people into mainstream schools as part of a politically correct process of social engineering. The idea seems to be that, so long as everybody gets the same education, that is fine. However, what people want is diversity in education. Children should go to the school that is right for them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-22_para21">
<a name="stpa_222">It is important that people understand that where co-location takes place, the children are not necessarily educated together. Although they might be integrated socially, they are not mixed with others in a mainstream education setting. They are not totally segregated, but they are not forced into participating in lessons that would be totally inappropriate for them. Such participation would be inappropriate not only for them, but for the other children in the mainstream school.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-22_para22">
<a name="stpa_223">The Government can help by providing extra special needs places throughout the country and particularly in the Bradford district. We have heard today from Members in all parts of the House that there is a problem. I hope that the Government will acknowledge that fact, and that they do have a role to play in helping local authorities to develop the best possible strategies. Bradford council&#151;Conservative-led&#151;has some innovative and ambitious plans, and I hope that the Government will support its efforts to increase special needs provision.

<p><a name="st_191"><a name="50622-23_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mark Hoban  (Fareham) (Con):</b> 
 I begin by congratulating those Members who have taken part in this excellent debate, with Members drawing on their constituency experience of special education. In particular, I want to congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper), for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Evennett), for Newbury (Mr. Benyon), for Guildford (Anne Milton), and for Shipley (Philip Davies). My hon. Friend the Member for Shipley has perhaps presented the Government with a challenge. If they are saying that there is no bias in favour of inclusion&#151;that there is no bias against special schools&#151;they should be prepared to look at Bradford council&#039;s plan to expand the number of places in special schools at both primary and secondary level. That will be a test of their special educational needs policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_224">The hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman), the former Chairman of the Education and Skills Committee, was right to suggest that the first topic for the re-formed Committee should be special educational needs. We also heard from the hon. Members for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson), and for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry), who is my constituency neighbour, as well as from the hon. Members for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber), for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Ms Smith), and for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson). They demonstrated that the problems that we face span all parts of our nation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_225">I want to tackle three fundamental propositions that are at the heart of this debate. First, children with special educational needs require a proper assessment to establish how much additional support and help is needed to enable them to realise their full potential. Secondly, although for many children such support can come in the form of a mainstream school place, it is not the answer for every child. Parents need choice, as the hon. Member for Amber Valley said. Thirdly, if we are to give children the right support, it is vital that no options be closed to them.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_226">Let us consider first the need for a proper assessment of children&#039;s needs, and in particular the statementing process. As the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough pointed out, the statementing process is far from perfect. Many parents do not consider it fair. A recent survey by the Down&#039;s Syndrome Association pointed out that many local education authorities


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&quot;are accused by parents of cynically manipulating the statementing process to deny adequate support to all but the most vocal.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_227">The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr.&nbsp;Davey) referred to the adversarial nature of the process. Parents are pitted against LEAs and expensive advisers are employed by both sides, so that parents can argue the case for the support that their children need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_228">Many parents believe that the level of provision is not just about meeting the child&#039;s needs, but about responding to the pressures on LEA budgets. A recent report by PACE&#151;Parents Autism Campaign for Education&#151;noted:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;Parents&#039; perception of their LEA was generally negative.&quot;</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_229">Many parents expressed concerns about their LEA&#039;s competence and about the fact that LEAs were less concerned with the education of their children than with budgets. The conflict of interest within LEAs&#151;between their role as funder of special education and their role as assessor of needs&#151;has led many parents to doubt the reliability with which authorities go about the statementing process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_230">I was pleased to hear that the hon. Gentleman agrees with us that we should look further into the possibility of having independent assessment of special educational needs. When parents look around the country, they see huge variations in the proportion of children statemented in different LEAs. In Nottinghamshire, only 1&nbsp;per cent. of children are statemented, while in Halton it is 4.6&nbsp;per cent. How can parents have confidence in a system that produces such variable outcomes across the country? Despite parents&#039; frustration with statementing, they also see it as vital, for it establishes a guarantee of entitlement, without which they fear that their child&#039;s support could be taken away at a moment&#039;s notice. We need to increase parents&#039; trust in the process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_231">It is not just parents who find statementing to be an unsatisfactory process. County councillors have also expressed their concern that the statementing process is too bureaucratic. It is time consuming and frustrating for them, as well as for parents. Until trust in the statementing process is established, parents will also see it as a battle to get the best resources for their children&#151;an adversarial system that is time consuming and wasteful, yet vital if they are to get the guarantee of help that they need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_232">If we are to ensure that children achieve their full potential, we must ensure that the support that they get is tailored to their needs. There is a consensus across the House about the importance of early intervention. I have seen for myself the excellent work that the Elizabeth Foundation does with young children born with a hearing impairment. It tries to support children at an early age so that they can continue in full-time mainstream schools rather than have to go to a school for the deaf or a unit for children with hearing impairment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_233">Earlier this year, I went to the Battledown early years centre, which was faced with closure by the Lib-Lab alliance on Gloucestershire county council&#151;the same people who proposed to close two moderate learning difficulties schools in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean. Battledown did everything that we ask from such a centre: it assessed the needs of children early and provided them with the support intervention that they needed so that, where possible, they could go to a mainstream school. Without that early assessment and intervention, those children were being set up to fail in mainstream schools. Thankfully, in that case, the centre was reprieved by the adjudicator. If we believe in early intervention, we cannot afford to lose centres such as Battledown, which help to tackle special needs when children are young.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_234">Members on both sides of the House have argued that it is wrong to adopt a doctrinaire approach either that only mainstream is right or that only special schools are right. We need to get the provision right for all children. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 867</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I fear that what we have seen over recent years is a dogmatic belief in the importance of inclusion. Yet the evidence tells us that mainstream does not always benefit all children. The Ofsted report &quot;Special educational needs and disability: towards inclusive schools&quot; found:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;Few schools evaluate their provision for pupils with SEN systematically so that they establish how effective the provision is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A minority of mainstream schools meet special educational needs very well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The teaching seen of pupils with SEN was of varying quality&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-23_para11">
<a name="stpa_235">Clearly, there is an issue about the quality of educational provision for children with special educational needs in mainstream schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_236">Whenever I visit special schools, I meet children who have been written off in mainstream schools, but who are flourishing, thanks to the expertise and care available in special schools. I visited the Mary Hare grammar school for the deaf in Newbury, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury referred, earlier this year. I met a young man there who had been written off as a failure by his mainstream school. He was stuck at the back of class and could not participate in lessons, but he is now heading off to university because of the expertise and skills of the Mary Hare school. Special schools are very important. Indeed, the Mary Hare school is also a training centre for teachers seeking a post-graduate qualification in teaching the deaf. If we lose those schools, we lose that expertise, and the opportunity to share it with other schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_237">My hon. Friend the Member for Witney used two statistics in his speech to illustrate how mainstream schools do not always work. He said that a child with a statement is far more likely to be excluded from school than one without, and that many more children with statements switch from mainstream education to special schools than the other way around.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-23_para14">
<a name="stpa_238">I make those points not to argue that inclusion is invariably wrong, because it is not. Inclusion can be right and it can work, but not always. Alternative provision needs to be available, so that children can get the support that they need. We must be able to maintain choice. Parents should be able to decide, where appropriate, whether a child with special educational needs should attend a mainstream or a special school. Closing special schools removes that choice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-23_para15">
<a name="stpa_239">That choice is also constrained by the presumption in favour of mainstream in the Education Act 2001. I refer again to the Department&#039;s guidance on this matter. My hon. Friend mentioned it before, but the House needs to remember that it has an impact on what happens in LEAs and on how they respond to the needs of children with SEN.

<br>&nbsp;<br>receive mainstream education. That sets the direction of travel for LEAs, which make mainstream education the first choice for parents and often limit the information available to them about special schools. As a result, parental choice in the matter is restricted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_241">Why do parents want that choice? For some, the principle is important, but other parents&#039; experiences of mainstream education have been unsatisfactory. In its brief for today&#039;s debate, the Special Educational Consortium pointed out that the mainstream does not offer a ready welcome to a child or understand a child&#039;s impairments and educational needs. It says that parents have difficulty in securing appropriate provision in mainstream schools, and that there are problems with getting appropriate support from other sources.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_242">Parents choose special schools because they believe that they can meet their children&#039;s needs better than mainstream schools. Yet they are often under pressure to accept a place in a mainstream school because that is what the legislation and the guidance say that they should be offered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_243">Most under threat are the choices available for parents of children with moderate learning difficulties. The Government recognise that special schools have a role for children with a severe impairment, but there is a lot of concern about the fate of schools dealing with moderate learning difficulties. As my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean pointed out, two MLD schools were closed in Gloucestershire. My hon. Friend the Member for Witney challenged the Minister for Schools at the start of the debate about the role and future of MLD schools. He asked her directly for her view of what the future held for such schools, but she ducked the question and hid in generalities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_244">The Minister&#039;s response made it clear that MLD schools have little future under this Government, as the terms of reference for the audit of special schools also indicate. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State, when she responds to the debate, will correct that impression, and that she will give parents of children attending schools specialising in moderate learning difficulties an assurance that their future is safe under this Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_245">We also need to understand what help is available, and what is effective. The Opposition believe that we need a review of special educational needs provision to ensure that children&#039;s needs are met. In the meantime, we must ensure that there is a moratorium on the closure of special schools. Those schools need to remain open while the review is conducted. Until we clear up the uncertainty and understand what is happening in the sector, we cannot move forward with the closure of special schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_246">The debate presents us with a real choice. Do we listen to the concerns of parents, teachers and children in special schools that they are being denied the ability to choose between mainstream and special schools? I believe that supporting the motion will send out a clear message to parents, children and teachers that we care about the education available to children and believe that there is a proper role for special schools. In contrast, the Government are in danger of letting down children with special educational needs.

<p><a name="st_194"><a name="50622-24_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Maria Eagle): </b> 
 It is a pleasure to respond to the debate and to follow the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban). I am not sure how much else we will agree on, but I agree that this has been an excellent debate. I very much welcome the interest of all hon. Members who have participated today. I congratulate the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) on raising this important subject, which I should be happy to talk about as often as the House wishes.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_247">The Government have a commitment to improve the life chances of disabled people and to ensure that the enormous extension of disability civil rights legislation that we have implemented during the past eight years results in real improvements in outcomes for disabled people. That commitment extends to educational opportunity and to disabled children, as well as to disabled adults, as it clearly should.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_248">We all know that a good education is key to enhancing life chances, and the Government have recognised that by extending to education the operation of the right for disabled people not to be discriminated against on the grounds of their disability&#151;something that the original Disability Discrimination Act 1995&nbsp;did not do. That is the purpose of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001. It is not, and was not intended to be, some kind of lurch into political correctness&#151;a phrase to which the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) unfortunately referred in his remarks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_249">The 2001&nbsp;Act is intended to provide a way to deal with the fact that society is increasingly realising the importance of not writing people off, and ensuring that all our citizens have the opportunity to develop to their full potential and to participate in all aspects of life. For disabled children, society has come to realise&#151;it did not always do so in the past&#151;that we must aspire for them as much as we do for any children, that we must nurture their potential and ambition and that we must remove the physical and attitudinal barriers that still too often get in the way of their being the best that they can be and participating fully in all aspects of life in our society.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_250">That is the context in which we hold our debate today, and I hope that the hon. Member for Witney and I can agree about that. We are asking how, not whether, we can do the best that we can to support disabled children. I welcome this development; it is big a change in society&#039;s attitudes to disability over those displayed in previous decades. It is something that we as a nation should be proud of, and we should be trying to improve on it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_251">The hon. Gentleman raised some specific issues, particularly in relation to schools and inclusion. Before I deal with those points and do my best in the time available to deal with some points made by other hon. Members, I should reiterate the context in which we are taking such action. Progress has been made. According to Ofsted, between 2000&nbsp;and 2003, the proportion of children with special educational needs judged to be making good progress grew from 54&nbsp;to 73&nbsp;per cent. in primary schools and from 43&nbsp;to 71&nbsp;per cent. in secondary 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 870</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>schools. I doubt whether we could identify any other period when such rapid and significant improvements have been made by such children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-24_para12">
<a name="stpa_252">We should all welcome those improvements, which are the result of sustained focus, sustained action and increased resources being put into the sector in recognition of the importance of improving outcomes for those children. The Government have been responsible for some of that, but local education is organised locally, and many local education authorities and dedicated people in localities have also been responsible for making such progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_253">The hon. Gentleman accepts that progress has been made. He said so in a debate in Westminster Hall last year. Although he was not concentrating on that aspect today, I am glad that he has acknowledged it. He is nodding now, which is good. He says that the Government&#039;s policy is one of inclusion at any cost and that, as a result, special schools are being closed. The Government&#039;s policy is one not of inclusion at any cost, but of choice for parents, so that they can choose either mainstream education where they want it and where it is appropriate&#151;many of them make that choice, and it is appropriate&#151;or specialist provision where that is more suitable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-24_para14">
<a name="stpa_254">It is categorically not the Government&#039;s policy to close special schools and enforce inclusion whether or not it is right for the individual child. Indeed, since the School Standards and Framework Act 1998&nbsp;Ministers have not had the power to make decisions on school reorganisations and closures; those decisions are made locally. Nor was there any opposition from the Conservatives to devolving that responsibility to localities at the time. Furthermore, figures show that the rate of closure of special schools has halved since the change was made. Between 1986&nbsp;and 1997, some 234&nbsp;special schools closed. I gently remind the Opposition that it was their Ministers who made those decisions. Since 1997, some 93&nbsp;special schools have closed, but on the basis of local decisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-24_para15">
<a name="stpa_255">Many Members have powerfully pointed out that parents are concerned about the closure of any local school, but particularly special schools, which parents often feel they want to defend because they know and understand the quality of the provision there. I fully understand those concerns but make two points in response. First, local authorities have a duty to secure sufficient schools for the children in their area and must have particular regard to the need for SEN provision. When setting out how they will undertake that provision, they must listen to the views of parents. When closure is proposed, consultation with parents must occur. If there is a dispute, an independent adjudicator makes the decision. Some Members have pointed out that that process sometimes results in a change, and many Members will be aware of cases where plans have changed, sometimes out of all recognition, as a result of the consultation process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-24_para16">
<a name="stpa_256">That is not to argue, and I do not, that the process always results in the outcome that parents want. In Wandsworth, to refer to a recent example, many parents were dissatisfied with the outcome of the process, so I do not argue that it always results in perfection. Nor do I argue that SEN provision is perfect, but it is better than it was and we are determined to improve it.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-24_para17">
<a name="stpa_257">The hon. Gentleman asked for a moratorium on closures, as did many of his hon. Friends. That might look good in a speech or a press release but I have major doubts as to its efficacy. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State said in her opening remarks that the hon. Gentleman was from the progressive left of the Conservative party. I think I would describe him as being from the statist left because he is actually arguing for the re-nationalisation of decision making on school reorganisation. He will be going into the leadership contest with the battle cry, &quot;The civil servant in Whitehall knows best.&quot; I wish him luck in his quest. He is a brave man.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-24_para18">
<a name="stpa_258">A moratorium would require primary legislation, so it will not be a swift option. Such a move would blight many excellent reorganisations, whether or not there was local controversy, for an indeterminate length of time.
</p>

<p><a name="st_195"><a name="50622-25_spnew0"><b> Mr. Cameron: </b> 
 The hon. Lady makes me intervene. She says that I pretend that civil servants in Whitehall know best. Is not she aware that her guidance, &quot;Inclusive Schooling&quot;, which she has not mentioned, states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;This guidance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. must not be ignored&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_259">That is the man in Whitehall. The guidance also states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">&quot;The starting point is always that children who have statements will receive mainstream education.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_260">That guidance is causing the problem, so why will not she withdraw it?
</p>








<p><a name="st_196"><a name="50622-25_spnew1"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 I appear to have hit a raw nerve. I was considering the hon. Gentleman&#039;s policy of a moratorium, which would be centrally imposed and against the wishes of many local authorities. The hon. Member for Shipley talked about collocation of schools, as did the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon), but that could not be done if there were a moratorium. The House and the Government would be imposing the moratorium from the centre, so that prescription would not be as efficacious as the hon. Member for Witney appears to think.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_261">The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of the national audit of low incident SEN support services and provision. He asked in particular why the audit was not wider in scope, a point made by several Members, including the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey). There has been an exhaustive review of special schools, which reported as recently as March 2003. The findings of that independent working group were incorporated in our strategy for SEN, &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot;, published a year later, following extensive consultation. In my previous role in the Government, I was a signatory to that document. There has been extensive consultation before and since with teachers, schools, pupils, parents, local authorities, the voluntary sector and others, although my officials tell me that Conservative Members did not contribute. Perhaps they should have done, because we could then have heard some of their ideas at the time at which the review for which they now call was actually going on.

<a name="50622-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_262">The Audit Commission raised its views on statementing and the success, or otherwise, of special education in its 2002&nbsp;report. Work has been ongoing, so I am glad that the Conservative party and the Liberal Democrats have decided that it is about time that we had a review, albeit belatedly. However, work has been going on over the years and we have come up with our strategy, which we are now implementing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_263">We can all agree that it is a priority to ensure that all children reach their full potential and that the education system is a key determinant of our success in reaching such a goal. We can all agree that there is an emerging consensus that disabled children must have the same expectation of success and the same aspirations to develop to their full potential as any other children. If we do not ensure that that happens, we will be failing those people as a nation. We want them to take their rightful place in our society as the valuable citizens we all know them to be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_264">The Government are investing substantial additional resources in education&#151;some &#163;1,300&nbsp;extra per pupil, or a 45&nbsp;per cent. increase in real terms between 1998&nbsp;and 2008. We want things to work for disabled children just as much as for their non-disabled peers. We are determined to ensure that the progress identified by Ofsted continues, so I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the House will support us in that endeavour.

 The United Kingdom has traditionally held a reputation as a beacon of democracy and fair play, the mother of Parliaments. We have led the way in building foundations for democracy across the world.

As the right hon. and hon. Members who are shaking their heads will know, a MORI poll in March this year found that 54&nbsp;per cent. of the public think that postal voting has made it easier to commit election fraud, and an even higher proportion are concerned about fraud with electronic voting.

 That is the sort of point that one might wish to address in a serious way had it come from any other part of the House, but it is rich coming from the Liberal Democrats, who believe in proportional representation, which can lead to extremist parties getting elected with only 5&nbsp;per cent. of the vote.

<a name="stpa_282">Forced all-postal voting has been condemned by the Electoral Commission in two major reports and the public have no confidence in it. Is the Minister really unable to make a commitment to the effect that we have seen the end of it? Many Members of all parties are old-fashioned enough to think that there is something special about the traditional method of voting using the properly controlled polling station and the ballot box, and that if somebody wishes to use postal voting, that should be their choice, not something that is forced upon them. Even those who support it want it to be properly controlled.

 Given the hon.

 It would be surprising had we not said consistently, from the beginning, that we are not against postal voting&#151;we are against ill-regulated postal voting that is not properly controlled.

<a name="stpa_285">Let me say a few words about pilot schemes. It has got to the point where pilot schemes are becoming the norm in some elections, and greater scrutiny is required. The law needs to be amended so that secondary legislation is required to ratify a pilot scheme. It is not acceptable that powers that were originally intended to allow for trial and experimentation in very tight circumstances should now be used to make near-permanent changes to the system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_286">It is not only the postal voting system that is unsafe and inadequate. Perhaps most important, the registers on which we depend for our system are in a poor state. Last year, a <i>Daily Mail</i> investigation found that the paper could register a fictitious student called Gus Troobev, an anagram of &quot;bogus voter&quot; on 31&nbsp;electoral registers in a few hours. In Cheadle, one of the most marginal constituencies in Britain, the paper was able to obtain nine further bogus votes. The Conservative candidate and former Member of Parliament, Stephen Day, had to contact Stockport&#039;s Liberal Democrat council, after obtaining the names from the <i>Daily Mail</i>, so that they could be removed from the register.

<a name="stpa_287">A journalist from <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> was able to apply for the postal ballot papers of 36&nbsp;voters to be sent to one address. The <i>Evening Standard</i> was able to apply for postal votes diverted to bogus addresses simply by using an application form from the internet. A Sky News investigation managed falsely to obtain multiple votes in two constituencies with no proof of identity and, more than a year ago, Marion Roe, who was then a Member of Parliament, produced evidence in a debate in Westminster Hall that electoral registers were up to 10&nbsp;per cent. inaccurate, containing thousands of names of voters who were not truly entitled to vote.

 The hon. Gentleman criticises the electoral process in this country. We have recently had the biggest test of electoral opinion through a general election, yet so far he has given the House only one example, from the hon.

If the problem is so widespread, I presume that he can give us a list of other constituencies about which he has anxieties.

 I am sorry that the right hon.

Why did he believe that there were fewer people than before on the register in Northern Ireland under an individual registration system? I am glad that he has now finished his telephone call.
</p>








<p><a name="st_213"><a name="50622-27_spnew4"><b> Mr. Heald: </b>

 Does my hon. Friend accept that false entries on the electoral register are not made simply to influence membership here or on councils or to entertain tabloid journalists, since registration is a prerequisite of establishing a credit rating? The problem goes far wider than electoral fraud.
</p>








<p><a name="st_215"><a name="50622-27_spnew6"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 That is true. Examples of individuals who were not entitled to vote came up during the election campaign, but they had tried to register not in order to vote but in order to apply for credit. I do not mind if they want a platinum card, but I mind that the risk exists.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_290">Recently, <i>The People&#151;</i>that great organ&#151;conducted an analysis of the electoral roll. It uncovered names such as Donald Duck and Jesus H. Christ. Perhaps they are genuine, but I suspect that the entries at a student address in Southampton, including Hooty McBoob and Gailord Focker, while not evidence of sinister malpractice, are not. One does suspect that these people do not exist.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_291">Mainland Britain needs the Northern Ireland system of individual registration. In the Province, voters need to provide a signature, a date of birth and a national insurance number to register. The national insurance number is used to check that the elector exists. Such identifiers are then used to verify postal votes. Ministers were initially reluctant to use national insurance numbers, but there was considerable debate on the issue in the other place. I pay tribute to my noble Friend Lord Glentoran in that regard. The Minister in the other place, Lord Williams of Mostyn&#151;whom we all miss and who was a very good spokesman for Labour in the other place&#151;accepted the argument that there was no independent method of verification. He insisted that national insurance numbers should be used, which was the right thing to do.

 It is hard to tell whether the situation has got worse or whether it has always been bad, but that is not the point. The point is that, if the Government are going to introduce a system of mass postal voting and want to leave open the option of all-postal voting, as the Minister does, we must have a register on which we can rely. At the moment, we do not have one, which is why we want to implement certain changes.

<a name="stpa_292">If we adopted the Northern Ireland system in this country, we would have a much more effective control. Furthermore, non-UK voters should have to provide proof of citizenship.

 My hon. Friend touched on the subject of people who are entitled to vote in European elections finding themselves with polling cards at the general election. That caused those people great discomfort, because they felt that the Government and the local authority should not encourage them to vote in that way. My local authority conducted compulsory postal voting for the local elections, and a great number of my constituents wanted to know why there could not be ballot boxes as well. Will my hon.

<p>
<a name="50622-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_294">At the general election, the Conservative party scored more votes than Labour in England, but won 93&nbsp;fewer seats, but that is not an argument for proportional representation, as <i>The Independent</i> has claimed. The use of PR in Britain has already undermined democratic accountability, without bringing about any increase in electoral turnout. It also prevents voters from removing an Administration, since it creates perpetual coalition Government.

<a name="stpa_295">Proportional representation also leads to a highly disproportionate relationship between the number of votes cast and the share of Executive power, by making minority parties the power brokers in Government. It also destroys the constituency link between the elected representative and their voters. Under first past the post, each voter can identify the person responsible for looking after their interests. Under PR systems, either constituencies are massive, with multiple members, or there is a group of representatives selected from a party

PR systems can allow candidates to be elected with as little as 5&nbsp;to 8&nbsp;per cent. of the vote, opening the door to extremists. A ridiculous situation can arise in which the most popular local politician is not elected and no one&#039;s vote counts for anything, because every vote is simply a mandate for negotiation.

There should be more up-to-date information about the size of electorates towards the end of the boundary review process to avoid the drawing up of constituencies on the basis of data from the start of the review that subsequently becomes out-of-date. That would be a fairer system, as it would ensure that each elector had the same level of parliamentary representation.

<a name="50622-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_299">So our three objectives are getting people who are entitled to vote on to the register, establishing a voting process that is more secure, and increasing turnout. The legitimacy of our system depends on making progress in all those areas. There is a great wealth of election experience in all parts of the House. I am by no means the longest serving Member of this House, but I have been returned in seven elections, and the Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice), who will respond to this debate, has been a candidate in five general elections and in many local elections. There is a wealth of experience in this House, but also beyond it. We need to draw on the experience of our colleagues in local government, the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, the European Parliament and the political parties&#151;not just the organisers, but the vast army of volunteers who do so much to make the electoral system work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_300">I believe that we all share a commitment to a system that allows everyone the right to vote and is secure against fraud. While there should be no party difference on that point, the constituencies that we represent are very diverse&#151;a fact that affects Members&#039; approach to these issues. For example, more than a third of my constituents were not born in the United Kingdom. My constituency, which has a high population turnover and many people struggling on low incomes, is very different from that of the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire. It also differs from the constituency of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), where, the electoral system must work for a population which, although stable, is very widely scattered. In some constituencies, the issue of student voting is very important; in others, the issue is the ability of servicemen and women to vote. The essential principles of our electoral system must be applied in all constituencies, not just some.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_301">The different concerns of Members in all parts of the House arise principally from the differences in the constituencies that we represent. We must acknowledge and respect those differences. Those in whose constituencies there is proven fraud should acknowledge that that is not the case everywhere. Those in whose constituencies fraud does not exist should not deny the need for robust anti-fraud systems. Those whose constituencies have no problem with under-registration should not deny that it is a huge problem in others. As I have said, probably more than 1 million people who are entitled to vote are not registered. The point is that both security and access to voting matter. Measures to tackle both issues must be adopted, and they must be proportionate and sensible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_302">We will proceed on the basis of considering the evidence. We will respond to headlines, but only because we recognise that when they overstate the problem of fraud, we need to do what we can to reassure the public and to sustain confidence. We will not be complacent but nor will we panic, and we will proceed by way of consultation. We issued a policy paper last month and we are consulting on it. We are still considering the responses, so I have no further announcements to make today. However, I intend to listen carefully to this debate. I want to hear the speeches not only of Front Benchers, but of all Members in all parts of the House, so I will stay for the whole debate. We have also

I want to thank all those Members who have written to me and taken the time to give me their views in meetings.

<a name="50622-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_303">We will continue to consult. We must have a system that ensures that all have the right to vote, which is not currently the case. As I said, there are probably more than a million who cannot vote because they are not on the register. That not only affects individuals who lose their right to vote, but undermines the basis on which the boundary commission does its work. That is why it is so important.

I can tell him that today I have been considering an application from King&#039;s Lynn, where a parish council by-election is due to be held. In the past, the parish concerned has had some by-elections that involved all-postal voting, and some that did not. No complaints have been made about all-postal voting, which has led to turnouts of 33&nbsp;per cent. By contrast, by-elections there that have not involved all-postal voting have achieved turnouts of only 11&nbsp;per cent. Given that the parish is asking to be allowed to hold an all-postal vote, we should not tie up those responsible for holding the election with parliamentary problems.

 I welcome the debate and the contribution made by the Minister of State. I have said before, but I will say it again, that it is high time that we had in this House a Minister of her seniority from that Department and that the Department for Constitutional Affairs had repatriated to itself responsibility for these matters, rather than their being spread across other Departments. Both those things are welcome, as was the tenor of the right hon. and learned Lady&#039;s speech.

<a name="stpa_317">There is an unfortunate degree of complacency. The assumption is that because, happily, this country was the birthplace of modern democracy, our systems are necessarily robust and right. Those of us who have represented Parliament in monitoring elections abroad&#151;the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) made this point&#151;know that what we look for in an adequate electoral system are things such as a registration system that neither under-registers people who are entitled to vote nor over-registers those who are not entitled to do so and a robust and replicable identification system for voters. We look for the opportunities for fraud that the system offers. We look for abuses of the rules by political parties and others. We consider whether there is an independent electoral commission of which that country&#039;s Government take proper notice and whether the voting system properly reflects the views of the electorate. Judged on those criteria, it is hard to see how this country could pass such a test at present.

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that some of the sensationalist headlines that he has just read out do not mirror the facts? For example, the Electoral Commission&#039;s report on postal voting found little wrong with the system in terms of fraud&#151;except, obviously, in Birmingham. We should not get carried away by the headlines; we should look at the facts.

<p><a name="st_261"><a name="50622-30_spnew8"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 I agree, and had I carried on a little longer before taking the hon. Gentleman&#039;s intervention I would have said that actually&#151;miraculously, given the openness of our system to fraud and malpractice&#151;most of our electoral practice is correct and proper. People respect the rules. But we are very foolish and myopic indeed if we do not realise that we are laying ourselves open both to the charge that our system lacks integrity 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and to the reality that if people want to abuse the system they can do so with relative impunity, notwithstanding the high profile cases that have done such a great disservice to the confidence of the public in our system.

: The hon. Gentleman suggested that we should look at other countries. Perhaps we should look at Australia, which has a legal requirement that people take part in elections and where there are turnouts of well over 90&nbsp;per cent.

</p>








<p><a name="st_263"><a name="50622-30_spnew10"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 There has been a longstanding argument about whether we should have compulsory voting. I am not persuaded, and although I agree that it increases turnout because people are fined if they do not vote, it does nothing to maintain the integrity of the system unless other factors are in place.

<a name="stpa_318">Notwithstanding the contribution of the Minister&#039;s and the fact that she clearly intends to&nbsp;introduce legislation, which I hope we shall all be able to welcome, I have one major criticism of the Government&#039;s position: they did not do much for public confidence in the system, or indeed the integrity of the system, by their conduct during the passage of the European Parliamentary and Local Election (Pilots) Act 2004, on which I represented my party. The Government&#039;s attitude was characterised by the fact that they ignored the recommendations of the Electoral Commission and the clear advice of parties in this and the other place. The Government went ahead with what they had intended to do in the first place, which left them open to the charge that they had acted for partisan purposes rather than having the integrity of the system as their main objective.

: May I return to the list of factors that the hon. Gentleman suggested we look for when observing elections in another country? I am happy to say that I agree with all of them, but I noticed that he did not include intimidation, which we should almost certainly be looking at in those circumstances. Does he accept that it is important, and indeed beholden on all of us in this place, to make sure that when we are describing fraud or malpractice we do not exaggerate it? We should not distort the evidence or use newspaper headlines for political advantage. If we do, we intimidate elderly people into not taking up their legal democratic right to a postal vote, as some people fear happened during the recent election. It certainly happened in Birmingham, owing to the disproportionate attention to what happened in two local government wards.

<p><a name="st_265"><a name="50622-30_spnew12"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman should take care about using the word &quot;disproportionate&quot; to describe convictions that were properly made in Birmingham and the facts revealed in a court. It is proper that such matters should be correctly reported and described. In other senses, however, I agree with him. Intimidation is a factor that we need to deal with, and later in my remarks I shall set out what all political parties should be doing about it.

<p><a name="st_267"><a name="50622-31_spnew0"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend and shall return to that point in a moment. Three things are essential to voters when they cast their ballots in elections. First, they must know that their votes are counted properly. Secondly, they must know that their votes will count, which relates to the point made by my hon. Friend. Thirdly, they must know that the person whom they elect counts and that a proper representative democracy is able to do its job in this place&#151;although the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire perhaps elided that point.
</p>








<p><a name="st_268"><a name="50622-31_spnew1"><b> Dr. Julian Lewis: </b> 
 Before the hon. Gentleman moves on, may I refer him back to a couple of interventions that he took from Labour Members? They did not seem to dispute his point that the system is wide open to fraud, but simply tried to say that not many cases of that fraud had yet been discovered. When designing an electoral system, surely the point is that it should not be open to fraud and that it should not be incumbent on us to do the work of detectives to determine whether fraud is being committed. The point is that if fraud can take place, it might be committed without us knowing about it, so we should close the loopholes.
</p>








<p><a name="st_269"><a name="50622-31_spnew2"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman up to a point, although we live in the real world, so we would not be able to devise a system that would be wholly impossible to defraud. However, we must make it as difficult as possible to commit fraud, which is why the Electoral Commission&#039;s recommendations on individual voter identification and strictures on all-postal voting are extremely sensible. I regret those strictures because we have had a successful all-postal vote in my constituency, but clearly the system has not worked satisfactorily in all parts of the country. We should bring in additional anti-fraud measures. We all face the problem that if the system is open to malpractice, as sure as eggs is eggs, someone will attempt to abuse it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_319">We currently do not know the extent of electoral fraud because until now we have taken the fairly Pollyanna-ish view that this is Britain and such things do not happen here. There is now evidence that such things do happen here, although we do not know to what extent because we do not have the mechanisms or audit systems to find out. I hope the thrust of the legislation that the Minister of State will bring forward will be to put appropriate systems in place and that all parties will be able to support her proposals. However, when that happens, all political parties will have the further requirement to take the matter seriously. I say all political parties because there is not one single political party that is not open to such abuse. Indeed, I suspect that there is not one party in which there has not been an incident of a person abusing the system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_320">Part of a discussion that I had with the Minister of State the other day was the point that parties should have zero tolerance of such abuse. If people bend the

<br>&nbsp;<br>rules, we need to make it clear that they no longer represent our party, the Conservative party, the Labour party, or any other party for which the democratic process is important. I am not only talking about the postal vote rigging that we have heard about, because we as politicians know that all sorts of abuses are possible. Incidents of votes being farmed in old people&#039;s homes have been reported over the years and it is time that that stopped. If anyone knows that it is happening, it is time for them to report it to the appropriate officers and for appropriate action to be taken in the relevant political party. People might receive an extra polling card and have the simple temptation to run down the street with it to get an extra vote, but it is not good enough to say that on the fringes that will not make a difference to the result, because it will&#151;every single vote counts, so every single vote must be a properly registered vote.

<a name="stpa_321">We need to examine some of the rules&#151;this is the last point I shall make about constituency elections&#151;that are still very lax. It might be said that my party would say that. We have funding limits for expenditure in elections in constituencies. We all laboriously complete forms after an election declaring what we have spent. We have to register every penny. We do that while other national parties put huge expenditure into a limited number of marginal constituencies across the country. That expenditure is vastly out of proportion to anything that is spent locally. How is that anything other than an abuse of the system and of the rules that we have in place?

We have just had a general election where the turnout was 61&nbsp;per cent. The Labour party, which formed a Government, achieved a 67-seat majority on 36&nbsp;per cent. of the popular vote, representing just 22&nbsp;per cent. of the electorate. That is the lowest figure since the Great Reform Act of 1832. That is a preposterous result for anyone who considers it sensibly.

He is right to complain, but he cannot see the elephant invading his bedroom, which is that the answer is to have a system that properly reflects the weight of votes cast rather than the first-past-the-post system. There was a majority of the popular vote for the Conservatives in England yet the Conservatives have no representation in any of our great metropolises outside London.

<a name="stpa_325">Let us consider the rural shires.

There were four seats for the Labour party and one seat&#151;it was an excellent win&#151;which was gained by my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron).

That was 24.7&nbsp;per cent. of the electorate. There is no Labour representation in Cambridgeshire. In Surrey, 148,620&nbsp;people voted Liberal Democrat. That was 28.4&nbsp;per cent. of the electorate. We have not one seat in Surrey. There are 11&nbsp;Conservatives out of 11. That cannot be defended in any circumstances as a fair outcome.

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the bias in the system is mostly accounted for by variations in size between constituencies throughout the United Kingdom?

<p>
<a name="50622-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_330">In the debate on 22&nbsp;June last year, I explained to the House how the postal vote system had been abused in Birmingham and turned into political currency. I do not wish to revisit the issue, not least because matters are sub judice, but I should like to highlight the action taken by the returning officer in Birmingham to try to prevent the situation from arising at the general election. The returning officer wrote to everyone who was on the postal vote list, which resulted in a great number of people being removed from it. Indeed, in one ward where there was controversy the number went down from 8,600&nbsp;people to 3,000. Hon. Members will agree 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 897</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that that is a huge drop. The returning officer worked with the West Midlands police to investigate all multiple applications, and the police visited houses where more than five people had applied for postal votes. Together with the work to encourage all political parties to sign up to a code of conduct, that ensured that the contests that took place in Birmingham during the general election were not subject to the problems that occurred in local elections.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_331">There are three issues that I shall touch on briefly. First, how do we prevent the electoral process from being corrupted by fraudulent use of postal votes? I am not in favour of all-postal voting, particularly when that system is imposed on people against their will. I agree with the Opposition spokesperson who referred to the dangers of gimmicky e-voting. It is fraught with dangers and if it is brought in, it will cause even more problems than have occurred with postal voting. But there is no doubt that many people like the opportunity to vote by post, so we must devise a system that is as foolproof as possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_332">To go on the electoral register, a person should have to sign. Whether they sign individually or sign a form that comes to the house, there must be a signature. If that person applies for a postal vote, the signature on the application must be checked against the signature provided to go on the register. As a final safeguard, when the person fills in the postal vote and sends it back with the declaration of secrecy, that signature must also be checked. Those are positive steps that can be taken and would make a real impact. I know that it would cost money and there would be arguments against such a system, but what is the price of democracy? I strongly urge my right hon. and learned Friend to consider that seriously as part of legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_333">Secondly, we should revisit the argument about obligatory voting. Some people call it compulsory voting, but it is not. It just obliges somebody as a citizen in a democratic society to go to a polling station or to get a postal vote. What they do with the ballot paper afterwards is entirely a matter for them. All right hon. and hon. Members will have gone through the salutary experience on election night of watching the disputed votes and seeing what some of our electors think of us. I have no problem with that. People are exercising their democratic right. I would not object if there was a place on the ballot paper where a voter could write &quot;None of the above&quot; or write in the name of a candidate for whom they did want to vote.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_334">We are allowing a cop-out from the democratic system. If we want higher turnout, we should move towards the Australian system of obligatory voting. It is far better than going in for various gimmicky ways of trying to increase the turnout which are fraught with dangers, as has been found with postal votes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_335">The final point concerns a problem that occurs in an area such as mine, which I hope my right hon. and learned Friend will take on board in legislation. What happens on election day in a constituency such as mine is not how elections used to be fought. Traditionally, at the polling station there would be a representative of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 898</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>each of the parties, the number taker, and there would be a great deal of conviviality and sharing of information.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_336">That does not exist in areas such as mine. On election day groups of people congregate at the entrance to polling stations. They hand out leaflets and talk to people, particularly in areas where English is not the first language and where the number on the ballot paper is even more important than the name. They give out a great deal of misinformation. During the day the numbers at each polling station build up so that by early evening, as happened in my constituency at the recent election, there are 50&nbsp;or 60&nbsp;people at the gates.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_337">The police are there and struggle to prevent violence breaking out. In the background there is the cacophony of cars parked outside the polling station with recorded messages from the candidates on a repetitive reel, so that goes on throughout the day. All the traditional conventions that most of us may remember, whereby a loudspeaker was not allowed anywhere near a polling station and there was no campaigning on polling day, have gone by the board. Somebody who wants to vote from the early evening onwards has to go through a cacophony of sound, intimidation, harassment and misinformation, and that is only to get into the polling station. It is no good turning round and saying, &quot;Well, the police have powers to deal with that.&quot; As we have learned in the west midlands, the police do not have such powers. New legislation is needed to prevent campaigning within a certain area around a polling station, because the police do not have a hope at the moment. I have shared my views with hon.

We should not spend too long going over the past, but Ministers&#151;not only Defence Ministers, but Ministers with responsibility for electoral registration and, preferably, the Prime Minister, too&#151;must make sure that a service voter&#039;s ability to vote is maintained by their service unit and the Government.

<a name="stpa_344">A similar point applies to overseas voters in general.

Perhaps then, if the electoral registration system requires something to go out to individual potentially registered voters, they can sign up for a postal vote or any other method of voting, and that can be checked. The initial movement towards the register should come from the householder or pseudo-householder, whether they be the warden of a students&#039; hall of residence, a landlord, the manager of a residential home for the elderly, or someone like me with a household that is occasionally full of children eligible to vote.

<a name="50622-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_349">I welcome the all-postal voting pilots but, having had the chance to learn from them, we should not pursue all-postal voting in future. I say that for two reasons: first, they deny the individual the choice of whether they vote by post or go to the polling station, and secondly, we should develop, as the Electoral Commission wants to, one standard method for all elections so that voters may be certain whether they will be voting by post or at the polling station, or a mixture of the two, which is the option that I favour. Voters should be able to decide whether they want to vote by post or at the polling station and tick a box on the electoral registration form&#151;it should be as simple as that. Some authorities are already taking that route.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_350">Generally speaking, our electoral system is secure. There have been one or two high-profile cases, mostly involving postal votes&#151;not all-postal votes, but postal votes per se. Those have been much highlighted in the press and are to be deplored. However, the Electoral Commission and the Select Committee on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister undertook investigations and proposed several serious, important and welcome suggestions as to how we can make the system even safer, including the introduction of new offences surrounding postal votes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_351">The real problem with the current system is the appallingly low level of voter registration&#151;that is the challenge that we have on our hands. By and large, it is not evenly spread across the country. In areas where people are socially and economically excluded, those people are becoming politically excluded as well. That should be a serious worry for us.

<a name="stpa_352">The annexe to the report produced by the Select Committees on Constitutional Affairs and on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister contains an interview that I did with the electoral registration officer in Sheffield. It was interesting to learn that the initial canvass of voter registration in the city produced a 90&nbsp;per cent. return of electoral registration forms in the leafy suburbs of Hallam. In the poorer parts of the inner city in Sheffield, Central, it was just over 50&nbsp;per cent. That is telling.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_353">Different electoral registration officers conduct different practices. For example, some electoral registration officers will remove a household from the register if a form is not returned for two consecutive years, whereas others will leave it on. Some will leave the household on if they can find other evidence, such as council tax registration, which shows that people still live in the property. Different systems operate. Whatever system we adopt nationally, electoral registration officers locally must follow a clear code of practice, meaning that the same system and rules operate throughout the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_354">I recognise and accept that we must move towards individual registration, with a signature. That is sensible from a security point of view. However, we have to learn from what happened in Northern Ireland, where the number of people who registered fell dramatically. People may claim that that was because some people were doubly registered, but the fall went on after the first year. It continued after the so-called clean-up of the register. There is a genuine problem of not registering, and if we do nothing but introduce individual registration, it will get worse. That will apply especially to groups who are socially and economically excluded. The registration officer in Sheffield said to me, &quot;If you&#039;re going to change the system, change it fundamentally. Don&#039;t try to build bits on to the existing system, which clearly doesn&#039;t work properly.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_355">Some members of the Select Committee went to Australia. We appeared in one or two national newspapers for our pains and learned some interesting things about the system there. First, we were asked what we did. When we said that we began by writing to every household every year, we received blank looks and were asked, &quot;What? Why do you write every year to households that haven&#039;t changed? The same people live in a house for 15, 20&nbsp;or 25&nbsp;years&#151;nothing changes&#151;but you write them? If they don&#039;t write back, you write to them again, and if they don&#039;t reply for two years running, you take them off the list? Is that a way of trying to encourage people to register? Are you putting your resources into the right activities? You do that for four months of the year and nothing for the other eight? What is the point?&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_356">The Australian system is simple. There is a register, which remains in place unless people change. There are various ways of notifying changes of address or age or deaths. Of course people can write with the information, but there is also a requirement on the Post Office, the utilities, the driving licence people and local authorities to provide information. Schools and colleges get paid a bonus for giving information. Such information can also be gleaned from the register of births and deaths. That enables the registration officers and the relevant authorities to concentrate on the changes, follow them up and ensure that the information is accurate and goes on the register.

<a name="stpa_357">There is therefore no annual audit or review in Australia, although the possibility of conducting a review every three years was considered. We could conduct a three-yearly audit on a rolling basis here, so that electoral registration officers were not obliged to put all their resources into a four-month period every year. It could be spread out over a longer time to verify the accuracy of the register but concentrate on instances where change had occurred.

There would be no need for all the canvassing, verification and checking that currently occurs. Local authorities could pay the national register for the information. That would contribute towards the cost of the register. It would save central Government and local authorities money and be a comprehensive system with integrity and security. We should consider it seriously. It would be a dramatic step forward, which will give us a register that is 99&nbsp;per cent. accurate.

This was my fourth general election in Brentwood and Ongar&#151;this seems to be confession time, with me telling the House how many times I have fought an election&#151;and I think that I also fought four elections as a district councillor.

<a name="stpa_364">The document issued by the Department for Constitutional Affairs suggests allowing people to register to vote after an election has been called, up to 11&nbsp;days before the poll. Under the current law, there is a five-day period of objection. That would mean that there would be just six days before the election to check people entering the register at that point. The chances of fraud or multi-registration would be much greater. If the present March deadline allows vote factories to operate, how much greater would that problem be with an 11-day deadline? Such a deadline would provide little or no chance to check that the voter had been removed from their previous address, and in most cases, such voters would have the opportunity to vote in another electoral district.

<a name="50622-33_para16">
<a name="stpa_365">It has also been proposed to replace the serial numbers on ballot papers with barcodes. That might sound sensible because it would increase transparency, but it is probably the best example of the Government&#039;s determination to increase postal voting at the expense of the polling station and ignores the reality on the ground. The Government&#039;s argument that the measure would increase safety and improve anonymity is wrong-headed, because, at present, only a court can open ballot papers and check them against the numbers provided. The use of numbers is of immense importance because they can be used by the polling clerk and the returning officer to reconcile information, first to ensure that the right number of ballot papers have been issued in the right order and, secondly, to ensure that the same number of ballot papers that leave a polling station arrive at the other end. If barcodes replaced the numbering system, we would not know whether any ballot papers had gone missing on the route between polling station and counting station. Something that would be handy for the purposes of postal votes would undermine the whole process of voting in person.

 This has turned out to be a thoughtful debate, but unfortunately the motion does not seem to be as thoughtful as the speeches made by Members in all parts of the House. It appears to concentrate on just one aspect of what I consider to be the triple responsibility that we all have for the legitimacy of our system. Our three responsibilities are to ensure that the franchise is accessible and that people have access to it, to ensure that people can use the franchise and vote, and to ensure that when people have voted they believe they have voted fairly, safely and securely and that the result is therefore legitimate. Those three legs supporting the system&#039;s legitimacy are integral to its operation. If we pull them apart or concentrate on just one, the system itself will not have the integrity that we would wish it to have.

<a name="stpa_371">If we extrapolated that and compared the population of constituencies with the size of the population on the register, we would find that the constituencies were rather similar in size, but that our system is gradually distorting through boundary revisions to build under-registration into our system.

People said that there would be electoral officers standing outside the polling booth giving the first voter a blank piece of paper, that they would go in, put the blank piece of paper in, take the vote out, take the money for the vote, give it to a second person who was corrupted and that would continue during the day. No evidence was ever found that the Tasmanian dodge ever happened but the system of watermarking perforation on ballot papers was introduced as a result of fears of the Tasmanian dodge.

 It strikes me that one of the most significant developments in British democracy was the secret ballot, which was introduced in 1872. In the light of the various points that have been made, does my hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>election, when these issues were being discussed. It is understandable that we have postal ballots for people who might not be able to get to the ballot box. We take the risk that their privacy&#151;their right to vote in a polling booth in secret&#151;might be affected. However, we should remember that when people vote in private at a polling station, they may well vote differently from how they would vote at home, where they might come under pressure. People have often said to me on the doorstep, &quot;I will vote for you but my other half won&#039;t.&quot; How often will that be allowed to happen when people have to vote at home?

<p><a name="st_290"><a name="50622-34_spnew4"><b> John Hemming: </b> 
 Oddly enough, I had intended to raise the issue of the secret ballot myself. I represent a local government ward as well as a parliamentary constituency, and in that capacity I share part of the Birmingham, Sparkbrook and Small Heath constituency. It is true that there is substantial intimidation in the streets from time to time. The Labour party leaflet on getting out the postal vote describes everybody&#039;s house as a polling station. The big question is, where is the presiding officer?

 I pay tribute to the work that the old Liberal party and the current Liberal Democrats have done over many years on secure postal ballots and the avoidance of intimidation and fraud.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_381">Some 20&nbsp;years ago, I worked with a cross-party group of Social Democrats, Liberals, Conservatives and Labour peers to amend the Trade Union Act 1984&nbsp;to make postal ballots compulsory for trade union elections. That worked because the papers being distributed were under the control and verification of the Electoral Reform Society. Postal ballots can be a blessing when they are properly controlled; they can be a curse when, as in the electrical trade union scandals of the early 1960s, they are not properly controlled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_382">My final, more whimsical, remarks relate to the Labour party. The Labour candidate who stood against me in the general election turned out, after the event, to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be a senior figure in an organisation called tacticalvoter.net. He sabotaged his own campaign&#151;he did not even issue an electoral address&#151;in his attempt to help the Liberals beat me. It appeared later that the reason why he, rather than a local candidate wanting to fight a straightforward campaign for Labour, was nominated was that Labour selects its candidates partly by postal balloting. He went round many people in the local Labour party and got their postal votes. Did he tell them that he was going to sabotage his own campaign? I doubt it. If the Minister is to clean up postal voting for the country, she should think about cleaning up postal balloting in the Labour party.

 We have had a short, but important, debate this afternoon.

<a name="stpa_384">We have heard various examples this afternoon of the malaise that has hit our electoral system. We have heard about fraud, poor registration procedures, administrative incompetence, wildly unequal constituency sizes and over-representation in urban areas. Clearly, something must be done to remedy the situation. Indeed, the Electoral Commission has been warning since 2002 of the need for reform but the Government did not listen.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_385">There have nevertheless been some developments. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook and Small Heath (Mr. Godsiff) mentioned the priority given to counter-fraud in Birmingham during the election, which is welcome. Other Members have spoken about other developments and the Minister noted that the Government have woken up to the reality and are proposing some long-overdue reforms to our system. She supported the proposals in the Government&#039;s policy paper of May 2005, most of which were recommended by the Electoral Commission and should have been implemented long ago. Today, however, the Minister spoke as if many of these were new issues in relation to which action suddenly needs to be taken. Although the Conservative Opposition welcome the proposals, we maintain that they are too little, too late. Even if the proposals go ahead&#151;we hope they do&#151;several deficiencies in the electoral system will remain.

 I would like to focus on two key issues: postal voting and electoral quotas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_386">The number of reported instances of suspected fraud relating to postal votes is alarming. For example, following the recent general election, the police have reportedly investigated dozens of claims of vote tampering. That gives rise to the question of how much electoral fraud over postal votes has taken place without being reported. After hearing evidence of the councillors&#039; fraud in Birmingham, the judge said:

<p><a name="st_300"><a name="50622-35_spnew9"><b> Mr. Djanogly: </b> 
 All right, I shall put the hon. Gentleman out of his misery.
</p>








<p><a name="st_301"><a name="50622-35_spnew10"><b> Mr. Simon: </b> 
 Many thanks. Is it the position of the official Opposition that this country has seen widespread and serious electoral fraud in recent years? I am asking not what the judge thinks, not what the papers think, but what the Tories think.
</p>








<p><a name="st_302"><a name="50622-35_spnew11"><b> Mr. Djanogly: </b> 
 We maintain that there has been widespread fraud and that it has to be dealt with.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_387">Even where fraud did not occur, the all-postal pilots were a disaster. The Electoral Commission reported printing and production errors in the postal ballot packs, the late delivery of votes and the absence of any checks on the identity of voters. As postal voting&#151;and, even more dangerously, e-voting&#151;does not have the supervision of polling stations, we believe that safeguards are essential to ensure that personation does not occur and that the postal voting system recovers its integrity. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) made that point strongly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_388">Several hon. Members, of all parties, supported the introduction of individual registration to safeguard the secrecy and security of postal voting. The Electoral Commission has advocated that for several years. The demography of our society has changed radically. The family home is no longer the norm, and houses are often divided into flat shares or multiple occupancy residences.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_389">Individual registration is now used in Northern Ireland to prevent a person from registering several times in one constituency&#151;something that journalists have proved is all too easy to achieve in England. The Government have expressed concerns that the system may reduce participation, but is it really advantageous to have greater participation in a system littered with fraud? Can such an election truly be a fairer representation of the people?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_390">My hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) said that reduced participation could be explained by the fact that each voter could register only once, instead of making the multiple registrations that were prevalent in the past. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) expanded on that point by showing how other forms of fraud could emanate from that. My hon. Friends the Members for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies) and for Worthing, West showed that where the Government should be aiding registration&#151;for example, in the armed services&#151;they have so failed to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_391">Another innovation in Northern Ireland was the introduction of individual identifiers to guard against fraud. As we have heard, Northern Irish citizens must give their national insurance number and date of birth when they register to vote. That offers safeguards against illegitimate multiple registration by citizens, and improper registration by non-citizens.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_392">Most critically for non-supervised postal votes, national insurance numbers must be submitted with the&nbsp;ballot papers to combat the fraud that is evidently rife. The Government, and the hon. Member for

<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 910</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Birmingham, Sparkbrook and Small Heath, proposed that a person&#039;s signature and date of birth should be used as individual identifiers. However, we believe that that will not be sufficient to eradicate fraud, as dates of birth and signatures are widely available and easy to replicate. By contrast, national insurance numbers are not widely in circulation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-35_para12">
<a name="stpa_393">When secure, postal votes are clearly desirable to facilitate voting for the widest possible cross section of the community. Postal voting also ensures that people who live abroad or who are infirm, disabled or caught up in inflexible working schedules can vote. However, we strongly oppose all-postal voting. It is vital that British citizens should have a choice about the method of voting.

<a name="50622-35_para13">
<a name="stpa_394">My hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) was right to say that postal voting is too remote and uncertain for a measurable proportion of our society. The Minister of State was vague on that point. She said that she would review postal voting, but then went on to refuse to rule out the use of all-postal voting in the future. As my hon. Friends the Members for Leominster (Bill Wiggin) and for Windsor (Adam Afriyie) noted, British citizens value their right to go to a polling station and vote in person.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-35_para14">
<a name="stpa_395">Several hon. Members supported compulsory voting. I believe that that would increase turnout, but not necessarily the quality of the system. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe had some useful ideas in respect of a rolling audit process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-35_para15">
<a name="stpa_396">The second crucial area in which reform is demanded is electoral quotas. Representation will be unequal unless each constituency is made up of a comparable number of citizens, and my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) showed clearly that Parliament would offer only a distorted reflection of society as a result. That was certainly the case with the recent general election.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-35_para16">
<a name="stpa_397">Support was expressed&#151;especially by our Liberal colleagues&#151;for proportional representation to remedy the balance. The Conservative Opposition maintain that that is not the answer, and my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) made the reason for that very clear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-35_para17">
<a name="stpa_398">Turnout was abysmal in our first PR elections for the European Parliament. Many people deeply resented having to vote for a party list rather than for an individual who would be responsible and answerable to the people and not to his or her party machine.

<a name="50622-35_para18">
<a name="stpa_399">The Minister of State questioned our commitment to the first-past-the-post system, but I can reaffirm that now. That system promotes accountability and provides for a stable and effective Government. What the Minister should be considering is the boundary commission review that proposes constituencies of fantastically different sizes, varying from just over 50,000&nbsp;to 150,000&nbsp;voters. That is unacceptable and allows excessive over-representation in urban areas.

<p><a name="st_320"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That this House do now adjourn.&#151;<i>[Gillian Merron.]</i></p>








<a name="time_28">
<a name="50622-38_time0"><h5>7.27&nbsp;pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_321"><a name="50622-38_spnew0"><b> Sir John Stanley  (Tonbridge and Malling) (Con):</b> 
 I do not have any interest to declare, but I should like to state that I am chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on Nepal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-38_para0">
<a name="stpa_421">I am very glad to have the opportunity to initiate this brief but necessary debate on Nepal. It is one of the extraordinary paradoxes of the world since 9/11&nbsp;that while huge attention has justifiably been focused on the war against terrorism, first in Afghanistan, then in Iraq, and then in relation to al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda-type elements all round the world, precious little attention has been paid to the country that is most in the grip of terrorism of any country on this globe&#151;the Kingdom of Nepal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-38_para1">
<a name="stpa_422">Nepal is a country that has suffered tragically and most severely in the past nine years since the Maoist terrorism began. Indeed, the contrast between the situation nine years ago and that of today is very striking.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_423">Nine years ago, in 1996, I had the great honour of leading the last British Inter-Parliamentary Union outward delegation to Nepal. In 1996, one could travel anywhere at any time in Nepal. There was no Maoist terrorism, there was a free media and free political expression and an emerging but strong and genuine multi-party democracy, not least because of the far-sightedness of the late King Birendra in ending the Panchayat system in 1990. Prior to our visit, two general elections had been successfully held in Nepal, under universal suffrage and with international observer teams, including Members of the House of Commons, in place on both occasions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_424">The close relationship between our Parliament and the Parliament in Nepal was demonstrated symbolically and in reality when, in 1992, our Parliament gifted the Speakers&#039; Chairs for the two Houses of Parliament in Nepal. We saw those Chairs, carved in magnificent British oak, in situ in the National Assembly and the House of Representatives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_425">Today, Nepal is racked with terrorism. It is stalked by brutality, fear, appalling human rights violations, committed by the Maoists and also by Government forces. There is no Parliament in operation or in prospect, at least for the next few years. In the past nine years, the country has sunk from what was, in 1996, a democratic triumph to effective parliamentary oblivion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_426">I want to raise seven issues with the Minister. First, I want to ask about the role of the British Government&#039;s special representative to Nepal. I welcomed the appointment of Sir Jeffrey James as the special representative. The parliamentary group had beneficial contact with him throughout the time that he held the post. The need for a special representative is even greater now than when Sir Jeffrey James was appointed, especially with the assumption of autocratic power by King Gyanendra. Yet Sir Jeffrey James has retired and not been replaced. I hope that the Minister can tell the House why a successor has not been appointed and who is taking on the responsibilities that were previously 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 923</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>discharged by Sir Jeffrey James. I hope that the Minister can assure us that the fact that there has been no successor to Sir Jeffrey James in no way suggests a diminution in the priority that the British Government give Nepal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_427">Secondly, I want to ask about the British Government&#039;s policy on the provision of military equipment to Nepal. I acknowledge that the Government are in some difficulty. They obviously wish to make it clear to King Gyanendra that they, along with other Governments around the world, strongly disapprove of the King&#039;s assumption of autocratic powers. However, I am sure that the British Government are also conscious of the seriousness of Maoist terrorism and the need to try to support the royal Nepalese army with equipment that will save lives, not least those of innocent civilians.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_428">It is evident that the Government&#039;s policy has performed something of a switchback. Initially, there was the ill-fated gift of two helicopters, which rapidly became grounded. That was followed by a further gift of short take-off and landing aircraft. Then, in January this year, the Government announced a package of what was described as &quot;non-lethal military equipment&quot;. Within a matter of two or three weeks, however, that announcement had to be superseded when the King took power at the beginning of February and the Government announced that the package had had to be suspended.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-38_para8">
<a name="stpa_429">Only recently have we seen the release of one element of that package: the bomb detection and disposal equipment. I believe that the Government made the right decision in that regard, because only one function can be performed by such equipment, and that is to save lives, which is obviously the key objective. Will the Minister clarify what is now the British Government&#039;s policy? Are they going to release more items from the package that was announced in January, and are they now following a policy of releasing at least some types of equipment to help to prevent the worst eventuality of all, a complete Maoist takeover of the remainder of the country?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-38_para9">
<a name="stpa_430">Thirdly, I want to refer to the position of the Gurkha connection, which goes back some 200&nbsp;years. It is a key feature of the relationship between Britain and Nepal and, as we all know, the Gurkha soldiers in the British Army have served this country in two world wars and many other conflicts, and they continue to do so today with the utmost distinction. I hope that the Minister will be able to assure us that political developments in Nepal, particularly the assumption of power by the King, will not in any way imperil the Gurkha connection or reduce its strength. That is a key assurance that I am seeking from the Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-38_para10">
<a name="stpa_431">Fourthly, I want to find out what role the British Government see themselves playing bilaterally with Nepal in the key objective of trying to restore parliamentary democracy in that country. Are they, through our embassy in Kathmandu, engaging in dialogue with the constitutional parliamentary parties right across the political spectrum in Nepal? Are they also seeking to establish any degree of communication, directly or indirectly, with the Maoists themselves? What policy are the Government following bilaterally? 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 924</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Is it simply a passive policy of noting what is going on, or are they trying to make a contribution to bringing about an effective constitutional parliamentary settlement in Nepal?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-38_para11">
<a name="stpa_432">Fifthly, the European Union joined together and made a statement at the beginning of February, when it condemned the assumption of power by the King. It also made a strong statement on human rights and declared, as other countries and organisations round the world have done, that there should be a restoration of parliamentary democracy in Nepal. Does the Minister consider that that is the only role that the EU can play in this crisis? Perhaps it is; Nepal is far away, and many EU member states have very little involvement with it. Many, understandably, do not even have embassies in Kathmandu. Again, it would be helpful if the Minister could clarify the British Government&#039;s expectations of the EU in this regard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-38_para12">
<a name="stpa_433">Sixthly, I am disappointed at the degree of non-involvement by the United Nations in the critical situation in Nepal. There has been limited involvement through the UN Commission on Human Rights, but that is all. Nepal has not been referred to the Security Council and, perhaps even more surprisingly, no steps have been taken by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to establish a special representative in the country. Could the Minister tell me whether the British Government would welcome Nepal being taken to the Security Council, and whether they would welcome the UN Secretary-General having a special representative in Nepal? I would like to hear any comments that the Minister may wish to make about a future UN role in efforts to resolve the crisis in the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-38_para13">
<a name="stpa_434">My seventh and last question relates to the position of Nepal&#039;s all-important southern neighbour, India, with its 1,000-mile-long boundary with Nepal open. Of all Nepal&#039;s neighbours, it is undoubtedly the country with the most to gain from a satisfactory settlement in Nepal. Equally, the country that will have most to lose if Nepal dissolves into complete Maoist control is India, because India has an incipient&#151;indeed, I would say more than incipient&#151;Maoist-type problem with the Naxalites in the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-38_para14">
<a name="stpa_435">India is, of course, deeply suspicious of any form of external involvement in Nepal, being always influenced by its position on external involvement in Kashmir. Having said that, I would add that I have no doubt that India is in a position to influence events in Nepal like, perhaps, no other country. What are the British Government doing to try to maximise the Indian Government&#039;s contribution to achieving a settlement in Nepal?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-38_para15">
<a name="stpa_436">When people in this country hear mention of Nepal they understandably think of the majestic Himalayas, but Nepal is very much more than its mountains. Nepal is a country with a long and independent history. It is a country with a depth and quality of culture that is truly remarkable. And it is a country whose people are characterised by their strength, their courage and their loyalty, along with a true gift of friendship. It is the people of Nepal&#151;who face brutality on an appalling scale, who face living in a climate of fear, who face serious denials of their human rights&#151;who need their human rights and freedoms to be restored. I ask, and urge, the British Government to do all in their power to that end.

<p><a name="st_322"><a name="50622-39_spmin0"><b>The Minister for the Middle East  (Dr. Kim Howells): </b> 
 I congratulate the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley) on securing the debate, and on the structure and delivery of his speech. It was a privilege to hear it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-39_para0">
<a name="stpa_437">The United Kingdom Government are deeply concerned about the escalating conflict in Nepal. As the right hon. Gentleman made clear, they have been closely involved in efforts to restore peace and stability in the country for several years. The right hon. Gentleman was right to observe that there is a great deal more to Nepal than those beautiful mountains, although when I was a child in the 1950s Tensing and Hillary reaching the top of Everest inspired me to become a mountain climber, which I have been all my life. I have never climbed in Nepal, but now that I am the Minister responsible for the area perhaps I shall have a chance to visit it, and even to climb a small peak.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-39_para1">
<a name="stpa_438">Our historic ties with Nepal, our continuing recruitment of Gurkhas, to which the right hon. Gentleman referred, and our large bilateral aid programme underline the importance of those efforts to restore peace and stability in the country, but I am afraid that there are no easy answers or quick fixes for the problems that Nepal faces.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-39_para2">
<a name="stpa_439">I pay tribute, as the right hon. Gentleman did, to the work of Sir Jeffrey James, our special representative for Nepal. The right hon. Gentleman will not be very convinced by this answer, but the role of special representative for Nepal was never intended to be permanent. It was set up to deliver three objectives. The first was to draw together United Kingdom policy on Nepal and to provide a strong focal point for it. The second was to co-ordinate international efforts in support of the peace process and the third to provide advice in the event that negotiations got off the ground.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-39_para3">
<a name="stpa_440">Sir Jeffrey&#039;s role was initially set to last one year. In the event, his position was extended for a further year and a quarter. Thanks to his efforts, Whitehall thinking is more joined up, and there is a greater shared international consensus on how to try to resolve the conflict. Regrettably, the prospect of negotiations remains a long way off. The role that he occupied will continue to be discharged through the close Whitehall network that he built up during his tenure and through the normal diplomatic channels, particularly our ambassador in Kathmandu.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-39_para4">
<a name="stpa_441">I echo the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s tribute to the Gurkhas. They have been, as he pointed out, a great asset to this country for many years, in times of war and peace. I was privileged to see their work at first hand just two weeks ago in Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan, where they are providing security for what is widely acknowledged to be the best provincial reconstruction team in Afghanistan. The evidence of their good work is everywhere to be seen in that area. We need to continue to recruit Gurkhas. It is interesting that, as the right hon. Gentleman will know, they often come from some of the poorest areas of Nepal. I can imagine that they sometimes are torn when they think about the politics of their country, but they are a wonderful asset to this country and we aim to continue with that relationship.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Jun 2005 : Column 926</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-39_para5">
<a name="stpa_442">May I try to deal with the question that the right hon. Gentleman raised about the United Nations? The UN plays a significant role and has recently established a major human rights monitoring operation in Nepal, which was set up in part thanks to this country&#039;s efforts this year. Other UN agencies are also active under the United Nations Development Programme, including UNICEF and the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs. There have been several high-level UN visits, including by the UN working group on enforced and involuntary disappearances, which visited in December 2004, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbour, who visited in January 2005, and a UN team including the UN Secretary-General&#039;s representative on internally displaced persons, Walter Kalin, who visited in April 2005. In a statement on 1&nbsp;February, the Secretary-General registered his concern about the King&#039;s takeover of power.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-39_para6">
<a name="stpa_443">We believe that, if a peace process is to be sustainable, the Nepalese themselves must take ownership of it. There may be a role for mediation at some stage but that would need to be supported from the outset by the key parties involved. Our judgment is that we see limited prospects that all the key international partners would sign up to a contact group. At this stage, we believe that our focus should be on encouraging a process of constructive negotiation towards a democratic settlement. Any peace process would need discreet ground clearing at first to establish those bottom lines, and I know that the right hon. Gentleman, who is very experienced in this area, knows what I mean by that. It is very difficult to build that up unless we have that basis. One option might be for an independent and neutral third party, such as an international non-governmental organisation with expertise in facilitating dialogue, to play a part. However, at the moment there appears to be little appetite for genuine dialogue on either side.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-39_para7">
<a name="stpa_444">The right hon. Gentleman also asked about India&#039;s role. He rightly pointed out that India is Nepal&#039;s biggest trading partner, and that they have long shared a border. He also mentioned the difficulties that could arise if the conflict in Nepal spilled into India. There could be problems with the Naxalites, for example, and with many others. India has more influence over Nepal than does any other country, and an eventual settlement will need India&#039;s support if it is to succeed. We enjoy an increasingly close dialogue with our Indian partners on Nepal, and we are regularly in touch with our Indian counterparts, including at ministerial level. As a result, we have been able to share our analysis of the conflict and to offer suggestions on resolving it. We agree on the importance of restoring representative democracy.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_445">I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman referred to the period when there was representative democracy. All too often, we seem to assume that it has never existed in such countries, but of course, it has. India also has the most to lose from a failure to resolve the conflict, as its spilling over into India would destabilise that country&#039;s own internal politics. We maintain that a one-party Maoist state in Nepal remains an unacceptable outcome. It can best be avoided by drawing the Maoists back into the democratic fold through a negotiated political settlement.

<a name="stpa_446">I remind the House&#151;the right hon. Gentleman will need no reminding&#151;that there are a number of underlying causes of the conflict in Nepal, which is rooted in poverty, under-employment, discrimination, social exclusion and corruption. He was right to contrast it with the period when Nepal seemed to be making great progress. Our goal is to help Nepal emerge from the current conflict with a sustainable peace, based on the principles of civilian, accountable and democratic government.

<p>
<a name="50622-39_para10">
<a name="stpa_447">We have consistently argued that the conflict in Nepal cannot be resolved militarily. Instead, we advocate a negotiated political settlement as the best way to resolve it. To that end, we have been pressing for the resumption of negotiations by encouraging the King and the political parties to form a united front as the basis for dialogue with the Maoists. At the same time, we have been operating a large bilateral aid programme, run by the Department for International Development. The right hon. Gentleman will have noticed that the Under-Secretary of State for International Development listened carefully to his speech. That programme is aimed at reducing poverty and at tackling social inequality and the other underlying causes of conflict. We have provided limited assistance to the security forces to help them carry out legitimate counter-insurgency operations with greater professionalism and regard for human rights. We have also funded civil society and human rights organisations.

<p>
<a name="50622-39_para11">
<a name="stpa_448">As the right hon. Gentleman told the House, the King&#039;s actions on 1&nbsp;February have hindered our efforts to promote peace in Nepal. We consistently advised that such a move would increase the risk of instability, undermine the institutions of democracy and ultimately put the monarchy at risk. We have criticised the King&#039;s takeover of power in direct representations to the King and in public, including through the European Union. The King has lifted the state of emergency imposed on 1&nbsp;February, and most of the political party activists whom he detained under the emergency regulations have been released. However, several dozen remain in detention and others are being prevented from travelling freely. Furthermore, the Nepalese media are not able to report freely.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-39_para12">
<a name="stpa_449">The right hon. Gentleman will recall, as I can recall, a vigorous free press in Nepal, which was one of the great strengths of the country for a good period. Especially outside Kathmandu, however, many human rights organisations have been intimidated into silence, which has not helped at all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-39_para13">
<a name="stpa_450">At the same time, the Maoists have shown little sign of willingness to negotiate. After the plenum meeting of August 2004, the Maoists decided to move forward to

<br>&nbsp;<br>the &quot;strategic offensive&quot;, as they call it. It is a phase of their military campaign&#151;the third of the three stages of classic Maoist warfare. I have to say that it has more to do with rhetoric than with what I remember of classic Maoist warfare when I had to read that stuff as a student. In view of the revisionist histories of Mao that are emerging nowadays, I am not even sure that he knew what the three phases of military campaigns were.

<p>
<a name="50622-39_para14">
<a name="stpa_451">Since 1&nbsp;February, the Maoists have turned down the King&#039;s offer of negotiations and continued their economic, psychological and physical warfare, staging regular &quot;bandhs&quot; or strikes and blockades, which cut off food, medicine, fuel and other essential supplies to the civilian population. We are deeply concerned that human rights abuses continue unabated. The Maoists continue to use violence for political means, carrying out beatings and killings, extortion, forced displacement, mass abduction, forced military recruitment of child soldiers and attacks against political activists, human rights defenders and journalists.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-39_para15">
<a name="stpa_452">The Nepalese security forces, too, are involved in grave violations. We have heard of summary killings, rape, enforced disappearance, arbitrary arrests and torture. That is happening in what was once, as the right hon. Gentleman described for us, a beautiful, productive and peaceful place where people wanted to live.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-39_para16">
<a name="stpa_453">Upholding human rights remains a key element of the UK&#039;s efforts to resolve the conflict in Nepal, and we have regularly spoken out against abuses committed by the security forces and the Maoists. The UK has consistently funded human rights organisations, and we are now in the process of funding the new UN human rights monitoring operation, for which the UK successfully pressed at the recent UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50622-39_para17">
<a name="stpa_454">Bearing all that firmly in mind, we also recognise the legitimate efforts of the Government of Nepal to protect their citizens from Maoist attacks. While the overwhelming majority of our bilateral assistance has been focused on poverty reduction, civil society and human rights, part of our assistance under the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, run jointly by Department for International Development, the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, has been set aside for security assistance. As part of our conflict prevention strategy since 2001, we have donated a package of non-lethal military assistance, which has included two transport helicopters&#151;
