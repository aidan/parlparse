 Good afternoon, Mr. Speaker. The number of people killed or seriously injured on Britain&#146;s roads has fallen by 33 per cent. in the last decade and the number of children killed or seriously injured has fallen by 52 per cent. in the same period. However, there are still around 3,000 people dying, and nearly 30,000 being seriously injured, every year. Clearly, we need to continue to work hard as there is always more to be done on road safety.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that answer. May I suggest that he looks at the regulations that prevent local authorities from putting traffic-calming measures in place on classified roads, such as City road and Frog lane in Wigan? If we can put such measures in place, we can help the Government to drive down the number of terrible accidents and serious injuries throughout the country.</p>

 My hon. Friend has a strong point to make on additional speed restrictions on urban roads. A Transport Research Laboratory study showed that in 20 mph zones accidents fell by 60 per cent., child accidents by 67 per cent., and cycling accidents by 29 per cent. We have devolved the responsibility and authority to introduce the zones to local authorities, and I know that many authorities across the country are taking advantage of those regulations.</p>

 I seem to remember answering that question last year, when I was a junior Minister at the Department of Trade and Industry and responsible for time. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Somebody has to be the Minister for time, and I&#146;m your man. The evidence that was presented showed clearly that there was a strong split in the country between those in favour of the change and those against. The statistics on road accidents, compelling as they were, were not entirely convincing. I seem to remember that we tried the arrangements that the right hon.

 As my hon. Friend suggests, motorcyclists continue to be disproportionately represented in the casualty figures. We have been working closely with representatives from the motorcycling industry and with user groups. Indeed, I have met three such groups in the past three weeks. In 2005, we published the Government&#146;s motorcycling strategy, which sets out a range of actions to make motorcycling safer, but my hon. Friend is absolutely right: 600 of the 3,000 people who were killed in the last year for which figures are available were motorcyclists, and that is just entirely wrong.</p>

There is a priority system for dealing with accident blackspots, which is used by the Highways Agency and other authorities.

 As a Londoner I hate to disillusion my hon. Friend, but he is describing not a Welsh solution but a local authority solution. As I mentioned to our hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner) only a few moments ago, we have passed regulations to empower local authorities to do exactly what my hon. Friend&#146;s local authority has done, because it brings benefits to the whole community and in many instances improves traffic flow routes as well. We want 20 mph zones to be introduced where they are appropriate. They clearly are effective. They cut accident rates, which means that we can protect our communities and particularly our children. I would encourage every local authority to engage with its community and see whether they are relevant for them.</p>

 The encouraging headlines belie a grim statistical trend. One in six deaths on the roads are associated with drink driving. That has increased from 460 in 1998 to 540 last year. Does the Minister think that by presiding over a reduction in traffic police numbers and not making drink driving a key performance indicator for police forces, the Government are sending out all the wrong messages and contributing to the problem, not to the solution?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raised that very point in Westminster Hall last week and we had an interesting discussion. I was able to reassure him that after our recent efforts to campaign against drink driving, there were more breathalyser tests in recent times. We liaise closely with our colleagues in the Home Office to make sure that enforcement is as high up their agenda as it is on ours. The hon. Gentleman says that one in six fatalities are caused by drink driving. In one in three fatalities, speed is a contributory factor. I am not in any way minimising that. We must take into account all the reasons why fatalities occur. There are far too many, and we both agree that as a Parliament we want to be seen to be doing all we can to encourage better driving on our roads.</p>

 I certainly sympathise with my hon.

For example, I understand that its runways are operating at about 98.5 per cent. capacity, which reduces resilience and leads to delay.</p>

In the longer term, the Government&#146;s policy is that we need new runway capacity at Heathrow&#151;consistent, of course, with local and environmental constraints, as set out in the 2003 White Paper.

 There is a very clear answer to this: we have a more serious threat than other European countries do. The EU sets minimum standards which we have decided to exceed in order to limit the number of X-rays per passenger. That is for very serious reasons: we want to protect the public. If the hon.

Of course we need to do better, and we keep these issues under review. Earlier in the summer, I convened a summit with the airport and airline operators.

 My right hon. Friend will be aware that part of the reason for long queues at Heathrow and throughout UK airports is the personal searches that take place of passengers by security staff, which are, I have to say, particularly intimate and intrusive. Will she work with the airport authorities to find some form of technology that could also be used in other countries to make these searches less intrusive?</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right to draw attention to the potential of better and more sophisticated technology. Indeed, at Heathrow, as in Glasgow, we are trialling sophisticated security screening technology and more sophisticated X-ray technology that may reduce the need for some of the intimate hand searches and may also lead us to a situation in which we can consider changing the restrictions that are currently in place. However, as I have already said, the first priority must be preserving and maintaining the security of the travelling public. Provided that we do that, I clearly want to make progress to improve the passenger experience.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. Being a Minister with responsibility for rail at this point in the history of railway services is a privilege because the problem that I have to deal with is one of inexorably rising rail patronage. Under the last Conservative Government, however, particularly in 1982, a record low number of passengers were using the network. In the past 10 years there has been a 45 per cent. increase in patronage, which is in no small part down to the role the Government have played in investing in the rail industry, and in ensuring that our economy encourages record numbers of passengers to use the rail industry to get to jobs that did not exist under the Tories.</p>

 The hon. Lady is right that we must do all that we can to ensure that travelling by bus becomes the first choice, rather than the last resort. As I have said, the percentage of people who have been a victim of crime or antisocial behaviour is quite small. However, it is important that we continue, for example, to install CCTV. In London, every bus has around six cameras, to ensure that the police can take up issues where they are reported, while there are 360 extra police officers in London dealing with antisocial behaviour on buses. In the hon. Lady&#146;s constituency, the safer Guildford partnership is looking at a number of issues, including how to make travelling on public transport safer.

 My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. However, we should remember that the role of bus conductors was to allow passengers to buy their tickets, not to act as security guards. We should also remember that when conductors were employed in London they were the most assaulted members of staff, so reintroducing them is not the answer. However, it is important that we should continue to look at what further measures we can take, such as installing CCTV cameras, and ensuring that people report incidents to the police and that the police can follow them up. In that way, we can ensure greater safety.</p>

<p><a name="st_o106"><a name="07102334000155"><a name="71023-0004.htm_spmin0"><a name="07102334000439"><b>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Des Browne):</b>
 I would like to welcome the publication of the Electoral Commission report into the conduct of the May 2007 elections. Earlier today, Mr. Gould, the head of the commission&#146;s independent review team, launched the report at a press conference in Edinburgh. The House will appreciate that I am not in a position at present to give a definitive response to all the recommendations or options that touch on the Secretary of State for Scotland&#146;s responsibilities for the elections to the Scottish Parliament. As is standard with these reports, I will of course respond formally in writing in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07102334000156">In May, my predecessor, the Secretary of State for International Development, my right hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, South (Mr. Alexander), made a commitment that the Government would update this House in the light of the publication of Mr. Gould&#146;s report. In making this statement today, I am honouring that commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07102334000157">In the main, I believe that the report is a valuable contribution to the analysis of what went wrong in administrative terms in the period leading up to and including the night of count for the May elections. I do not agree with every aspect of Mr. Gould&#146;s analysis and I shall explain that in more detail shortly. But my one main message for the House today is that it is my principal objective to ensure that, in the interests of the voter, we will never again face the problems we saw on 3 May.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07102334000158">Mr. Gould&#146;s report offers several recommendations about how to achieve that objective. Importantly, he recommends that elections to the Scottish Parliament and to local government in Scotland be decoupled and no longer held on the same day, and it is my understanding that the Scottish Executive had signalled at an earlier stage their intention to look seriously at that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07102334000159">A positive decision on decoupling would, I think, be welcome, but none the less I am here today to tell the House that I can accept a number of the core recommendations in the report. First, Mr. Gould recommends that electronic counting should in future be restricted to local government elections, and I am happy to accept today that electronic counting will not be required for separate Scottish parliamentary polls. Secondly, on ballot paper design, Mr. Gould proposes that we should revert to two separate ballot papers: one for the regional vote and one for the constituency. Although I may not agree with all Mr. Gould&#146;s reasoning in reaching that recommendation, I see advantage in reverting to the two-page arrangements for future Scottish parliamentary polls and so I accept that recommendation. Thirdly, the report proposes a longer period between close of nominations and polling day, and I am minded to accept that proposal. Fourthly, Mr. Gould has emphasised the importance of consolidating the relevant legislation governing the administration of elections. I am minded to accept that recommendation as it relates to elections to the Scottish Parliament. Fifthly, Mr. Gould has proposed that electoral legislation is not applied to any election held within six months of a new provision  <br>

<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 166</b><br>
coming into force. Provided suitable safeguards can be found, as Mr. Gould&#146;s report encourages, I am prepared to accept that recommendation for elections to the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07102334000160">Mr. Gould has also brought forward a very substantive option, designed in his view to tackle the fragmented nature of responsibility for all the elements that go into the conduct of elections. The creation of a chief returning officer with statutory powers would be a significant alteration of our present structures. I have an open mind on that, but would wish to see a wide-ranging debate among all interested parties about the implications of our moving to such a radically different structure of accountability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07102334000161">The topic of the overnight count is clearly an issue of concern to Mr. Gould. He recognises that there are advantages and disadvantages to overnight counting, but concludes by recommending that, if polls continue to close at 10 pm, there should be no overnight count of the ballot papers. To abandon completely overnight counting for parliamentary elections would represent a major departure from well-established precedent. I am not convinced that such a change would necessarily have any great benefit for voters, but I am willing to hear the voices of those with a different view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07102334000162">Mr. Gould devotes some time in his report to what he calls</p>
<a name="71023-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="07102334000301"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the use of &#145;naming strategies&#146; by political parties to seek an advantageous position on the regional side of the Scottish parliamentary ballot sheet&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07102334000163">He refers to that practice as &#147;sloganisation&#148; of party names and recommends that legislation be amended to</p>
<a name="71023-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="07102334000302"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;minimise the possibility of confusing or misleading voters while facilitating a level playing field for all political parties&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07102334000164">We will consider that recommendation alongside the others to which I have already referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07102334000165">I wish to offer a preliminary comment on the recommendation about assigning responsibility for both elections to one jurisdictional entity. Mr. Gould concludes that the &#147;Scottish Government&#148; would be the best logical institution. I have to say that at present I am not persuaded that Mr. Gould&#146;s analysis of that point necessarily supports his conclusion. What we are surely looking for is improved planning and preparation for what in future will be two quite distinct sets of elections. The decoupling of parliamentary and local government elections should create clarity in terms of responsibility and accountability. That said, Mr.  Gould&#146;s recommendation is simply that preliminary discussions should take place, and I am willing to give that serious consideration. There are clearly lessons to be learned and changes to be made, but I do agree with Mr. Gould when he says on the final page of his report that</p>
<a name="71023-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="07102334000303"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it is important not to lose sight of the many positive aspects and good intentions of those involved in assembling and conducting the 3 May 2007 elections.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07102334000166">Mr. Gould sets out the range of interconnected interests that are essential to getting right the various elements in the election process, but he has concluded that the fragmented nature of that planning process was itself a cause for flawed decisions. I acknowledge the Scotland Office&#146;s role in the overall process and can say now that we have lessons to learn from the systemic failures that occurred. The changes that I have  <br>

announced today are the beginning of the process of correcting those failures and rebuilding trust in the electoral process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07102334000167">There have been different interpretations of what Mr. Gould means in his report by the phrase &#147;partisan political self-interest&#148;. We now have the benefit of Mr. Gould's additional comments at his press conference today, where he confirmed that</p>
<a name="71023-0004.htm_brev3"><a name="07102334000304"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;party self-interest in this context is not necessarily related to one party&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07102334000168">Mr. Gould&#146;s clarification reinforces my own reading of the report. For example, at several points&#151;specifically, on pages 17, 18, 26, 48, 107 and 113&#151;Mr. Gould advances the argument that too much of the detail prescribing the administration of the Scottish elections was set out in legislation, and was therefore the subject of excessive debate and prolonged discussion among politicians. In his view, much of that detail should be left to electoral administrators to decide, in order to reduce the role that &#147;political interests&#148; play in setting the administrative framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07102334000169">The design of the Scottish parliamentary ballot paper was one example raised by Mr. Gould. The approach taken by the Scotland Office was to consult fully on the idea of a combined paper, including with the political parties, the Electoral Commission, returning officers and accessibility groups. Subsequently, and following further statutory consultation with the Electoral Commission, the order that included the ballot paper was debated and approved by Parliament. If that consultation was too inward looking and not focused firmly enough on the voter, as Mr. Gould suggests, I apologise and commit to learning the lessons for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07102334000170">The changes announced today, and those that I have committed to consider further, should give Scottish voters confidence that the experience of 3 May will not be repeated. Specifically, the commitment to use two separate ballot papers for the Scottish parliamentary poll and the removal of the need to use electronic counting outside the Scottish local elections will make elections in Scotland simpler and ensure that future polls are not defined by administrative problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para15"><a name="07102334000171">I have decided, as part of the necessary action in respect of recommendations affecting my responsibilities, to respond positively to an approach from the Scottish Affairs Select Committee to consider the report and let me have its views. I am grateful to the Committee&#146;s Chairman, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Sarwar), for his proactive approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para16"><a name="07102334000172">In addition, I wish there to be further parliamentary debate in this House and will initiate wider discussion with ministerial colleagues and with the wide range of interests involved in electoral matters. That would include the Electoral Commission and Mr. Gould and his team, if possible. I believe that those are important steps to take before we finalise views to be set out in our final written response to the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para17"><a name="07102334000173">I commend Mr Gould&#146;s report to this House and look forward to more extended debate on its findings in due course.</p>

have. Although the inquiry was not held according to the terms that we sought, Mr. Gould is a leading world expert on the organisation and management of elections, and is a person of impeccable independence and expertise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para18"><a name="07102334000175">The Secretary of State&#146;s apparent suggestion that everybody is to blame, and that therefore no one is to blame, simply will not do. It is time for the Scotland Office to take responsibility for failing the people of Scotland. The right hon. Gentleman is also the Secretary of State for Defence, and today he has been forced to come to the House to defend his predecessor, who is, disappointingly but perhaps not surprisingly, absent. However, the right hon. Gentleman has scant chance of success, because there can be no defence to the conclusion of an independent reviewer, who says that both the Scotland Office&#151;the Scotland Office, Mr Speaker&#151;and the Scottish Executive were frequently focused on partisan political interests in carrying out their responsibilities, overlooking voter interests and operational realities. Furthermore, what was characteristic of 2007 was a notable level of party self-interest evident in ministerial decision making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para19"><a name="07102334000176">Does the Secretary of State agree that such behaviour is tantamount to attempting gerrymandering in the worst traditions of Tammany hall politics, and that it demonstrates complete contempt for the democratic process, laying bare the inner workings of the Labour establishment for all to see? Is not the position rendered even worse by the fact that the former Secretary of State was also Labour&#146;s Scottish election co-ordinator?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para20"><a name="07102334000177">The Secretary of State knows that when candidates and agents break the rules for their advantage they go to prison. What sanction does he propose for Ministers who seek to make rules for their partisan advantage? If the Government cannot be trusted with the basic democratic duty to run elections fairly and without political interference, what can they be trusted to do?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para21"><a name="07102334000178">On 23 May, the right hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, South promised to apologise if the review found fault with the actions and decisions of the Scotland Office. The review has revealed not only partisan decision making but serial incompetence: Ministers unable to pass legislation in time, unable to take decisions in time and unable to communicate with their counterparts in Scotland; decisions taken against all advice and two different elections with two different voting systems on the same day, with votes to be counted electronically through the night. The fact that the election was not an even worse shambles is due to the work of returning officers and their officials, who should never have been treated in such a cavalier manner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="71023-0004.htm_para22"><a name="07102334000179">The current Secretary of State has said that he is not in a position to give a definitive response to the report, but what is required is for his predecessor to give the apology that he promised, and the definitive response the House requires. In the light of that response, we shall judge whether his predecessor is fit to continue in public office. However, what is absolutely clear from this damning report is that in future no one should ever again hold ministerial responsibility for elections simultaneously with responsibility for the conduct of their party&#146;s campaign, and the Minister should immediately be stripped of those responsibilities in the Labour party.</p>

 My hon. Friend chairs the Scottish Affairs Committee and has suggested that the Committee consider the report in the detail that its complexity requires. He raises two important points, both of which I dealt with in the statement. I agree that overnight counts are a long-standing part of our democratic and political process. There is an expectation among the electorate that they will have the results of parliamentary elections immediately after the polls close. That necessitates overnight counts and I do not think that it is any more difficult for machines to count votes overnight than it is for them to count them during the day.

It is regrettable that the Secretary of State is not prepared to acknowledge today that the logical and sensible next move would be to give the Scottish Parliament control over its own elections.

 I welcome my right hon. Friend&#146;s contribution, and I can answer yes to all the questions that he poses.

No individual constituency is investigated in the Gould report, because the authors of the report determined that the parameters within which they would be working would not explore the outcome or validity of the election. I suspect that that is why they avoided the detailed consideration of any individual constituency.

It behoves all of us to accept the reality as far as voters in Scotland are concerned, and to ensure that we conduct elections in a way that takes account of the confusion that might be generated.

They certainly will not while I have responsibility for elections to the Scottish Parliament, so they are unlikely to happen again. There are, however, other recommendations and advice for returning officers that should be studied carefully. Those fit into the category of recommendations that I think it better to refer to my right hon. and hon. Friends in the Ministry of Justice. If there are proper lessons to learn, they are not just for Scotland but the whole of the United Kingdom.</p>

 I am glad to hear the Secretary of State emphasise that the lessons in the report go beyond Scotland, because we are not considering simply a little local Scottish difficulty. Some of the issues, especially sloganising party names, problems with postal votes and the construction of the ballots, are covered by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. If the Electoral Commission does not have the discretion to deal with those issues, especially ruling some party names and slogans out of order, we need to examine the legislation, which covers the UK and all the elections in it. It is important not to lose sight of that in our discussions.</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend. That is why we have already committed to feeding in to the Green Paper on consultation and constitutional matters some of issues that this valuable report raises. There are lessons for all of us who are involved in politics about getting, in our debates and discussions&#151;which, of necessity, as Ron Gould says, we will approach from a party political point of view&#151; the right mix between such an approach and the voters&#146; interest. The point at the heart of the report is that the political classes got that balance wrong. That may be a function of the way in which we have dealt with such issues historically. Perhaps we are now at a turning point for the way in which we should tackle them in future.</p>

 Following what my right hon. Friend the Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Mr. Kennedy) said, may I tell the Secretary of State that the problem for many people with postal ballots was not their complexity or whether the form fitted the envelope, but the fact that they never saw them, because they did not arrive in time?</p>

 Let me say two things to the right hon. Gentleman, who I think was making a party political point dressed up in another way. First, the failure to get the ballot papers printed and distributed in time for postal votes was, in my interpretation of the relevant chapter of the report, also a function of the fact that the ballot paper was a combined paper produced using a centralised print scheme, and the fact that the bulk of the numbers could not be processed. It all comes back to the combination of the two papers, in my view. The right hon. Gentleman is an experienced politician and he will have a chance to read the report at his leisure and come to his own conclusions, but that is my view, on two readings of the report. We might even have a chance to ask Mr. Gould whether that interpretation is right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="71023-0006.htm_para1"><a name="07102334000247">Secondly, when I looked at the comparative number of spoiled or rejected papers under STV as opposed to those in the Scottish Parliament elections, which uses the first-past-the-post system and the additional  <br>

member system, I came to the same conclusion as the right hon. Gentleman did. However, more careful consideration might suggest that the system of auto-adjudication under STV may have masked the number of people who did not enter their votes properly on the STV ballot paper, because it accepted votes with a cross on them, if there was only one cross. We need to be careful about coming to conclusions from a partial interpretation of the ballot papers, as there may be hidden mistakes made by people that did not come out in the rejection system.</p>

 A sequence of events normally precedes a disaster&#151;I say that from an old miner&#146;s point of view&#151;and we saw a number of sequences of events, which resulted in probably the worst debacle that we have seen for many years. It ill becomes all parties first to argue that they want an independent review&#151;many of them also questioned whether it was really going to be independent&#151;and then, now that that independent review is here, to call for one person&#146;s head. A sequence of events means that everybody has to take some blame for what happened. I look forward to the debate that we will have, because I for one will have my say on what went wrong.

It did the work, and it recommended&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><i> </i>Part of the problem for the hon. Gentleman is that the letter containing that recommendation exists. It just so happens that Mr. Gould, although he was offered it, did not come to look at it. That is not necessarily a criticism of him.

 I know that there was great concern about the fact that, on the same night and in pretty similar circumstances, one officer in charge of a poll decided to have a recount while another said that to do so was impossible. That caused a degree of concern, and I believe that all democrats should be concerned about it. Because of the constraints that Ron Gould and his team put on themselves during the review, however, they could not look at any of those constituencies individually. Perhaps it was better that they did not, because they did not want to open up the validity of the outcome of the election, and I think that most of us would want to accept that. However, this does not alter the fact that the whole thread of their recommendations on the professionalisation of returning officers ought to deal with that kind of inconsistency, and it is to be hoped that we can establish a process that professionalises them to the point at which all voters and all these kinds of decisions are treated in the same way across the country.</p>

We need to take a serious look at the packaging that fills our supermarket shelves, and ask how much of it is necessary, and how much is wasteful, needless and excessive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="71023-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07102334000273">Both economically and environmentally, packaging comes at a price. Families spend about &#163;470 a year on packaging. We see unnecessary packaging every time we visit the supermarket, in the form of shrink-wrapped cucumbers or individually packaged bananas. Often, consumers do not have the option to buy a product without the excessive packaging. Today, the Local Government Association announced that council tax payers face fines of up to &#163;3 billion if we fail to cut the amount of waste thrown into landfill. Consumers are paying three times over for excess packaging. We pay the cost of the packaging at the checkout, we pay increased council taxes and landfill taxes, and we will all pay the environmental cost of more waste going to landfill for years to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="71023-0006.htm_para7"><a name="07102334000274">The Government have taken some, albeit limited, steps to tackle excess packaging. EU regulations on producer responsibilities and the essential requirements of packaging have been adopted into UK law. WRAP&#151;the Waste and Resources Action Programme&#151;has taken positive steps on research into minimising packaging. However, the waste strategy for England, published in May, was a missed opportunity. It includes a handful of measures on packaging, such as higher recycling targets, but no real ideas on how to get to the heart of the problem; it contains new targets but no fresh thinking. We should go much further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="71023-0006.htm_para8"><a name="07102334000275">Supermarkets have taken some steps to cut back on packaging and reduce waste. Sainsbury&#146;s came top in a survey that I carried out this year of Easter egg packaging, for reducing to a minimum the often gross amount of packaging that usually accompanies Easter eggs. Waitrose has taken steps to pilot plastic-bag-free stores, requiring customers to bring their own reusable shopping bags.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="71023-0006.htm_para9"><a name="07102334000276">Across Government and industry, the movement to curb excessive and wasteful packaging has shown signs of life, but is in serious need of a growth spurt. My Bill sets out steps to be taken in five areas to cut excessive packaging and reduce waste: reform of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&#146; Courtauld commitments; augmenting the power of trading standards officers; creating a new national body on packaging;  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="71023-0006.htm_para10"><a name="07102334000277">The Courtauld commitments are voluntary agreements brokered by DEFRA to reduce packaging levels. Ninety per cent. of the UK grocery sector signed up to them, and agreed to stop the growth in packaging waste by 2008 and achieve an absolute reduction in packaging waste by 2010. That sounds promising, but if we look below the surface, problems start to appear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="71023-0006.htm_para11"><a name="07102334000278">In answer to parliamentary questions, I have been told both that each Courtauld signatory &#147;declares&#148; its total packaging use each year, and that information on the annual total packaging use of each signatory is &#147;not routinely collected&#148;. Which is it? How are we benchmarking progress towards the targets? Another parliamentary answer tells me that a draft protocol is being consulted on with a view to it being agreed and implemented &#147;in this reporting year&#148;. If packaging growth is to be stopped as soon as next year, however, surely the means of reporting progress should be well established by now. How will future success be measured if there is not already a clear benchmark?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="71023-0006.htm_para12"><a name="07102334000279">The Bill proposes that the Courtauld voluntary measures be translated into binding targets.

the 2005-06 statement of central Government priorities for the trading standards service. The current regulations need technical amendments to prioritise the reduction of excess packaging over the needs of marketing departments, and Government need to stop ignoring the issue and provide some leadership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="71023-0007.htm_para5"><a name="07102334000286">My Bill calls for the establishment of a national body on packaging to support trading standards departments. It would work with them to tackle large-scale producers of excess packaging, and would offer a more co-ordinated and systematic approach to the problem. Such a national body could also place more emphasis on proactive packaging enforcement than trading standards departments, which tend to act only on specific complaints from the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="71023-0007.htm_para6"><a name="07102334000287">If supermarkets and other retailers are to drive change and reduce packaging, the ball must be in their court. They must be given an incentive. Consumers should be empowered to take action and return unwanted packaging to the point of sale. The Bill requires large retailers to provide an in-store deposit point for the disposal of excess packaging before the customer leaves the store. Broadly speaking, packaging that can be removed by the customer before he or she leaves the shop is excessive, whereas packaging that must stay on the product if it is to arrive at the customer&#146;s home in adequate condition is necessary. Making retailers take back the excess packaging that they force on consumers will send the message, loud and clear, that if they do not want to deal with it, they should not put it on the shelf in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="71023-0007.htm_para7"><a name="07102334000288">Disposable plastic bags are a highly visible symbol of wasteful practice on the part of supermarkets. An estimated 17 billion plastic bags are given away annually by United Kingdom supermarkets&#151;enough plastic to cover an area the size of London, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and west Yorkshire combined. Some countries have attempted to tackle excessive use of disposable plastic bags by introducing bag taxes, but evidence of their effectiveness or otherwise is mixed. Supporters of the idea point to the example of Ireland, where a 15-cent bag tax resulted in a 90 per cent. reduction in plastic bag use, but critics argue that the alternatives to plastic bags are heavier, and that the additional carbon emissions from transporting them offset any gains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="71023-0007.htm_para8"><a name="07102334000289">A better alternative to a plastic bag tax would be requiring supermarkets to participate in a deposit scheme for carrier bags. It would take the form of a levy&#151;say 10p&#151;paid on a bag at the point of sale, which would be redeemed when the bag was returned to the store. The charge would encourage customers to use bags sparingly, and in practice customers bringing the bags back would reuse them until the end of their useful life, when they would redeem the deposit or receive another bag. Attaching a redeemable deposit value to the bags would also create an incentive to reduce plastic bag litter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="71023-0007.htm_para24"><a name="07102340000017">I note that this debate can continue until 10 o&#146;clock.

However, I should add that that was a failure for a predecessor Labour Government, because such a project was first mooted in 1948&#151;in order to alleviate overcrowding on the Circle and Central lines, which might prompt some participants in today&#146;s debates to say, &#147;Plus ça change.&#148; </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="71023-0007.htm_para27"><a name="07102340000020">As the Minister also said, the motion is essentially non-controversial and aims to carry the Bill over into the next Session.

In my short time in the House, we have had four debates on the Floor of the House on this and several major arguments, the first of which was over the location of stations&#151;there will now be a station at Woolwich. There have also been arguments about the route&#151;latterly, where to begin it and where to end&#151;about where to have sheds and about funding: who, how much and when. The Government, the taxpayer, the fare box and business were always going to be involved in that, and with all due respect, the Government cannot escape the criticism of dalliance. The suggestion made in the previous Session that the financing be reviewed by Sir Michael Lyons was nothing more than a blind alley.</p>

 I do not intend to detain the House for any length of time, but it is right that a few additional comments should be made in support of the carry-over motion. I agree with the Minister&#146;s proposal and his remarks about the importance of the Crossrail scheme and the good progress that is being made. I emphasise how vital it is for the future of not only London and its economy, but the whole country. There is little doubt that without Crossrail, transport and traffic in London would grind to gridlock within a short time. Crossrail is vital to the long-term success of our capital city and the economy of our whole country, so it is good news that the scheme is progressing and that a firm timetable is in place to ensure that trains will begin to run from 2017.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="71023-0007.htm_para31"><a name="07102340000025">I agree with the tribute that the Minister paid to the members of the Select Committee and to its Chairman, because they have done a magnificent job. They have had to put a great deal of time into this&#151;84 sittings and more than 18 months&#146; work, which is hard work by any standard&#151;and they have made a significant impact. As the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) mentioned, their stalwart efforts have resulted in a station at Woolwich; it is now an integral part of this scheme and that was not the case when the Bill was first presented. It is essential to Crossrail, vital for the regeneration of the Thames Gateway and will be a considerable net contributor to the scheme because, as the Committee pointed out, the cost-benefit analysis is particularly favourable in respect of Woolwich. Common sense has prevailed, and the Select Committee has done its job successfully in ensuring that this provision is incorporated in the Bill. That is warmly welcomed in south-east London. I am pleased to see that my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Clive Efford) is present, because I know that he, too, will wish to congratulate all involved in this progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="71023-0007.htm_para32"><a name="07102340000026">The final comment that I wish to make concerns the funding package. Major progress was made in the recent announcements by the Prime Minister and the Chancellor, in his pre-Budget statement, about the funding basis for Crossrail. The hon. Member for Wimbledon was a little churlish about Sir Michael Lyons, because his report came forward with the proposal for the supplementary business rate, which is an integral part of Crossrail&#146;s funding package and has made this possible. It is a big project and the funding is substantial, so it is right that the package should be robust. By seeking support from several different parties, rather than having the cost all falling on the public purse, we have a better prospect of ensuring that the scheme proceeds and is properly funded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="71023-0007.htm_para33"><a name="07102340000027">I congratulate the Government on reaching this stage, and the Committee on its magnificent work. I wish the Bill well in its progress to the statute book and the process of constructing this hugely important new rail link in London.</p>

 I echo the Minister&#146;s comments about the good work done by the Committee. Remarkably, my hon. Friend the Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh), whom I appointed to serve on the Committee on our behalf, still speaks to me. I give credit to the Committee for ensuring that its work has been relevant and suitably challenging.</p>

Suffice it to say that perhaps the most recent emergence of Crossrail was back in 1989, with the central London rail study, which was, regrettably, rejected in 1994 by the then Conservative Government. However, to give them credit, they did ensure that there were protected alignments, so that when the project re-emerged, the route was safeguarded. That was very welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="71023-0007.htm_para35"><a name="07102340000030">I agree with the Chancellor that Crossrail is essential for the competitiveness not just of the City of London, but of the whole country.

Members may have struggled to identify information that is of concern to them, especially about the financial framework that has been put in place to ensure that Crossrail proceeds. I hope that when the Minister responds, he will be able to give us some reassurance on that point. For example, the pre-Budget statement refers to the resources that were allocated in the comprehensive spending review to allow the commencement of the main construction of Crossrail. I hope that the Minister can confirm that the phrase &#147;main construction&#148; is simply used to demonstrate the phases in which the work will be done, which would start with the main construction, and is not an indication that all that will be affordable is the main construction, and other components might not be afforded. I hope that the Minister will confirm that that does not represent wriggle room for delivering only part of the project, not the totality of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="71023-0007.htm_para37"><a name="07102340000032">The pre-Budget statement also contains a reference to the Department for Transport contributing around one third of the total estimated cost of up to &#163;16 billion. Is there a defined upper limit on that contribution, given that the statement is a little vague about the Department&#146;s contribution? We need clarity on the &#163;16 billion and where the funding will come from. It is regrettable that hon. Members have had to try to piece together the financial framework from different sources&#151;principally the media&#151;as opposed to having a clear breakdown. My understanding&#151;and I hope that the Minister will confirm it&#151;is that &#163;5 billion will come from Government grants, as stated in the PBS&#151;</p>

 Thank you for that intervention, Mr. Deputy Speaker. My point is that the Minister is seeking the House&#146;s support for the motion that would enable the Bill to be carried over, but to get it he must set out Crossrail&#146;s financial framework. I shall be very brief, but we know about the &#163;5 billion from Government grants and the &#163;5 billion from the supplementary business rate, and about the &#163;5 billion that will be borrowed against Crossrail&#146;s fare takings from 2017. We understand that the Secretary of State secured an additional &#163;1 billion from the City, and that that comprises &#163;300 million extra from the City of London, &#163;400 million from Canary Wharf and a contribution from BAA.</p>

 For a project that is unlikely to cost less than &#163;16 billion, ongoing questions about the need for Crossrail are legitimate. At a time when the Government have slashed plans for large-scale tram and train-link programmes outside London and the south-east, the amount being put into London might seem perverse. As a London Member, I have always supported Crossrail, but it is important that we go through the arguments at this juncture. My constituents ask, &#147;Why on earth do we need to have a further link running across central London?&#148; There are relatively few votes in this issue for me or, I suspect, for any other London Member. Constituents who live in the firing line are perhaps rightly fearful of disruption, damage and inconvenience when the project is finally built.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="71023-0008.htm_para8"><a name="07102340000046">I believe, however, that there is a great need in central London for the project, not least because of the big problems with capacity. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) pointed out, the project has been mooted for well over half a century, and only the Bakerloo line is running at less than full capacity. To return to the point made by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake), a number of other tube lines have been extended north and south over the central area in the past 30 or so years. However, it is not practical simply to extend branch lines and bring more people into central London without the capacity-building that Crossrail will offer. It will be a proper addition to the infrastructure within the central district of the City and the zone 1 area, including the west end, which is increasingly important in commercial terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="71023-0008.htm_para9"><a name="07102340000047">The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington rightly makes the case about funding, but in previous Sessions the funding package was by no means in place. Indeed, the numbers being bandied around at that  <br>

juncture were &#163;10 billion to &#163;13 billion, which makes me all the more sceptical about whether the project will necessarily remain within the budget of &#163;16 million. That is the way of things with large-scale infrastructure projects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="71023-0008.htm_para10"><a name="07102340000048">I am sure that the Minister will have something to say about funding, but it appears that it is finally in place. The City of London corporation provided the vital piece in the jigsaw at its meeting at the beginning of October, although I appreciate that there are concerns about the precipitate decision that was required by the Treasury. However, it was always clear that a fairly substantial financial contribution would be required. My understanding is that there will be a one-off lump sum of &#163;200 million and that the City of London corporation will lead efforts to raise a further &#163;150 million from the City&#146;s financial sector.</p>

 The fact that the hon. Gentleman is using figures that are slightly different from mine reinforces the need for the Minister to provide some clarity. Members need to know that the financial package that has been put in place will be recession-proof. Until we see the figures, we do not know what we are dealing with.</p>

<p><a name="st_o180"><a name="07102340000050"><a name="71023-0008.htm_spnew5"><a name="07102340000174"><b>Mr. Field:</b>
 That is a legitimate point, but the discussion has been going on for some years without any firm funding being in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="71023-0008.htm_para11"><a name="07102340000051">I also pay tribute to Canary Wharf, which is putting up a considerable sum&#151;a rather larger sum than the City of London corporation, if rumours are to be believed. It will receive the benefit of a station in the Billingsgate market district of Canary Wharf, and that will undoubtedly make an immense difference to Canary Wharf&#146;s capacity to build to the south and on South Quay. There will be a proper transport network for all those who wish to work or, indeed, play in that part of London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="71023-0008.htm_para12"><a name="07102340000052">The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) pointed out the immense value of getting the transport infrastructure right. Although I am reasonably sceptical of the figures being bandied about, there are estimates that City businesses lose more than &#163;1 million a day because of transport delays. The net benefit of Crossrail will apparently be &#163;30 billion over the next 60 years, and that does not even include its contribution to taxation. I accept that the figures might have been plucked from the sky, but it is essential to compare them with the large costs that will be incurred. The project will also help to create great prosperity and, as others Members have pointed out, the economic success of central London is essential. All recent surveys of businesses within central London have put transport failings and, in particular, public transport failings at the top of the wish-list of problems to be overcome. Crossrail is a positive step forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="71023-0008.htm_para13"><a name="07102340000053">You, Mr. Deputy Speaker, will forgive me for touching on one last point. I have ongoing concerns, on behalf of my constituents, about the route. I have discussed my concerns on many occasions, and many petitioners have had the opportunity to put their case during previous deliberations. The process will, no doubt, continue as the Bill goes to the House of Lords  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="71023-0008.htm_para14"><a name="07102340000054">Without the funding, there was a big risk of a blight on the entire area&#151;a risk that predates our discussions on the Bill. In many ways, it goes back to 1994, when various reserved areas were put in place. That has made life difficult for people living in Mayfair, the Barbican and Bayswater in my constituency, and, I suspect, for people in many other parts of London. They felt that the prospect of those works would lessen the value of their properties, and that a great deal of disruption was likely in the districts in which they lived. I hope that the Bill will move on with great speed. Clearly, there will be great inconvenience for many people who live in central London, or in the other parts of London that will be affected, but the benefits will be terrific in the years ahead. I am glad that Members of Parliament across the House, who perhaps recognise that there will be relatively few votes in the issue come election time, accept that there will be a greater benefit to the capital, and to the commercial and economic interests of the country.</p>

Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) reminded us that the House had a Crossrail Bill before it on a previous occasion&#151;the Crossrail Bill that collapsed in 1994. Those of us who have spent the best part of two years on the Bill that we are discussing today will want it to fare better than the other Bill did, and will not want it to collapse. Of course, we are very much heartened in that hope by the fact that the Government have given such a firm commitment to the scheme, seem to have a credible funding package in place, and seem determined not to let the Bill collapse, as its predecessor did.

We picked up a wide range of other issues, some as major and significant as the way in which Liverpool Street station should be modified, and some apparently trivial but important to the people affected by them, such as how people&#146;s back gardens would be affected and whether a couple of metres of land should be taken.

In conjunction with that permission having been granted, the Government have gone to great lengths to ensure that an appropriate consortium is brought together and a funding package is made available to enable a station to be built, but it is not, as I understand it, a requirement of the Bill that such a station should be provided. That is an example of one of the issues that the Committee thought should be borne in mind both as the Bill continues its passage and more generally when we consider how hybrid Bills are dealt with in future.</p>

We could have done so in respect of ground-borne noise, the compensation code, freight&#151;we have specifically suggested that the other place might wish to consider freight&#151;or whether a floating-slab track was appropriate. Such issues could usefully have been the subject of evidence sittings at the outset. Those sittings would have enormously helped the Committee to consider the significant number of petitions, although we did do that, and to do its job consistently throughout the process. They would have enabled Members who could not attend all sittings to understand the wider picture.</p>

We were enormously helped by the promoter&#146;s counsel, who enabled us to understand some of the issues that in an ideal world we would have wished to explore independently.

channel tunnel rail link&#151;is having such a dramatic impact at St. Pancras, where the link will soon open. I speak with confidence on behalf of the majority of the Committee&#146;s members in saying that I hope that what we have produced in the past two years to take forward the Crossrail Bill will ultimately result in something that will equal the importance of the channel tunnel rail link&#151;not only to London, but to the infrastructure of the United Kingdom in general.</p>

 I am another veteran of the saga&#151;and, indeed, of the Jubilee line extension process, the saga before it, which involved a private Member&#146;s Bill and carry-over, and lasted a long time. We all owe colleagues who volunteer or are volunteered to serve on such Bills our thanks, and we do that without exception in this case. They have no direct interest, as the issues do not bring constituency benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="71023-0009.htm_para0"><a name="07102340000071">I support the motion. With this sort of measure, it is imperative that the job is done properly, which requires use of the system for carrying Bills from one Session to the next. That is what has been proposed and it has the unqualified support of all the voices that I have heard so far from around the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="71023-0009.htm_para1"><a name="07102340000072">I should like to add three things about what remains to be done in the continuing debate and about why we need to complete that debate. First, we need to follow up the questions about funding posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) and the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field). The Bill is about plans and powers to build, but it does not automatically deliver the money to build&#151;that has to come from elsewhere. The worst possible outcome would be that we carried the Bill over to the next Session, it completed its stages in Parliament and received Royal Assent, and there then remained some uncertainty about funding. There has always been Government resistance to this being a publicly funded enterprise, for reasons that I understand. It is welcome that the City of London recently announced that it is going to contribute and that the Canary Wharf company has put something into the kitty, as it did for the Jubilee line extension. Given that this is a private Bill, which is not quite the same as a Government Bill albeit that it has Government backing, I hope that the Minister will say that as well as Government support for the process he will offer his Department&#146;s support to ensure that the funding continues to come together so that by the time the Bill receives Royal Assent we will know the funding is in place.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that there is not only the potential scenario whereby the funding package is not agreed but one whereby part of the funding package is provided to enable the main construction to happen, perhaps the tunnel from Liverpool Street to Paddington, but not to complete the extremities?</p>

<p><a name="st_o188"><a name="07102340000076"><a name="71023-0009.htm_spnew4"><a name="07102340000182"><b>Simon Hughes:</b>
 That element is absolutely imperative. I see the hon. Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter) in his place. This proposal is not just for Paddington to Liverpool Street&#151;it is to link the lines west of Paddington and the places east of Liverpool Street, and it has to be a complete package.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="71023-0009.htm_para2"><a name="07102340000077">Secondly, the timing of this carry-over motion is intriguing. We might have had it as one of the last bits of business this Session with a general election coming the day after. We had an announcement by the Prime Minister and others on the Friday before the famous Saturday when Mr. Andrew Marr told the nation that we were not going to have a general election: a slightly odd ambassador for the Prime Minister, but there we are; cometh the hour, cometh the man. On that day, the Prime Minister was very clear that the funding was in place. A week later, the Mayor of London appeared to be rewriting the funding script in a press conference at City hall. Will the Minister not only give the undertaking that funding can be examined in Committee but ensure that by the time we start that process he has had all the key players round the table to ensure that the Government are satisfied that our London regional government, the private sector contributors and the UK Government have all their ducks in a row?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="71023-0009.htm_para3"><a name="07102340000078">Thirdly, this is potentially a momentous year for London Transport because we are about to see the opening of the cross-channel rail link in its new terminus. I have to say that that particularly disadvantages my constituents and those of my neighbours, because getting to Waterloo is fantastically easy and convenient, as indeed it is from here, whereas getting to St. Pancras is less easy and convenient. However, we fought that battle and the die has been cast. If that opens on schedule, as I hope it will&#151;I think that it is all teed up to happen&#151;it is important that we have not only the international connections but the national connections east, west, north and south. Some of us have always said&#151;I deduce it in the words of the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster&#151;that this cannot be done without giving thought to the communities who live along the line covered by the Bill. The Minister will know, although it is not his particular responsibility, that we have had the mother and father of battles south of the river to ensure that the Thameslink proposal&#151;a north-south access route to improve travel through London, which was originally called Thameslink 2000, and is a good proposal in principle&#151;did not have a major destructive impact on the area around Borough market in my constituency, which is a conservation area and an historic part of central London. I am still not convinced that what is proposed will satisfy the double requirement of the national interest and the local one.</p>

and the disruption that it will cause, are properly heeded. It is no good having a fantastic line under London, with great east-west links from one side to the other, while the centre of London is disrupted unrealistically and excessively in the interim. By definition, there will be huge disruption during the next few years because of the Olympics, which I support. There will be the works for the north-south Thameslink route, and there has been work on the St. Pancras line. Crossrail is a good project, but the money needs to be in place, and the communities affected should experience minimal disruption and receive some of the benefit.</p>

In fact, I was somewhat surprised to find that the Select Committee report is incorrect, and one of my reasons for speaking today is that I wish to put that fact on the record.

Actually, my evidence on 5 July did not touch on any of those subjects. My evidence resulted from a petition that I presented on behalf of the Reading <i> Evening Post</i>, and major businesses in the Reading area, including employers such as Microsoft, Foster Wheeler Energy, Yell, MCI, Reading borough council, Reading chamber of commerce, Transport 2000 and around 250 local businesses, residents and commuters. The petition was quite clear. It says:</p>

serious question mark over the assurances and undertakings given by the promoter, because there is no case for locating a western terminus for Crossrail at Maidenhead. The motto of Crossrail was, from memory, &#147;Crossing the capital, connecting the UK&#148;. I have no beef with Maidenhead, but one cannot connect anywhere with it. Reading is the second busiest station outside London, and is second only to Birmingham New Street in that regard. It is a major rail hub.</p>

Friend the Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove) is nodding, and I know that hon. Members from Bristol and Wales share our concern. If a stopping service from Maidenhead interrupts the successful high-speed service into London from the west, Crossrail will impede a major transport artery.</p>

It is also important to remind them that there is a method of getting the terminus to Reading: it can be done through an order under section 1 of the Transport and Works Act 1992. I hope that in due course the Under-Secretary will appreciate the force of the arguments that the hon. Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter) and I, and others from the Reading area, presented. Indeed, many Members of Parliament with constituencies west of London made representations, including my right hon.

Being able to make cross-party comments and secure cross-party support for such an important Bill has certainly made my job an awful lot easier. However, I take issue with him on a couple of points. It is rather unfair to blame the late Earl Attlee for any failure in previous Crossrail Bills.

Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) correctly said, it was always important that the Lyons review was put behind us and that we had its conclusions before us, so that we could see exactly what the structure of local government finance was before we set about constructing a financing package. An important part of the Lyons review was the possible introduction of the supplementary business rate. I will say something about that later, but obviously I do not want to dwell too much on the detail, rather than on why we wish to carry over the Bill.</p>

Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) talked about the importance of Crossrail to the competitiveness of our capital city. He also talked about his concern about public information, which is a valid point. The Government must learn from the experience of the past two to three years the importance of getting accurate information to the public timeously, so that they can be reassured about whatever effect the construction phase of Crossrail in particular will have on local communities.</p>

He asked about the Department for Transport&#146;s contribution to financing. The figure of &#163;16 billion is now well established. I have absolutely no reason not to believe that the figure is robust, as figures for previous capital projects arguably have not been. I would be extremely disappointed if the huge amount of work already carried out has led us to anything other than a reliable end figure for the total cost of the construction of Crossrail, of about &#163;16 billion in outturn figures.</p>

Member for Wimbledon asked about this as well&#151;the financing of the Crossrail scheme is not part of the Bill that will come before the Public Bill Committee, which will sit next month. I therefore cannot guarantee that detailed discussions can take place in Committee. That would not be a matter for me, but for the Chairman of the Public Bill Committee.</p>

Much of the detail of the agreements with third parties is covered by confidentiality agreements to protect their commercial interests, and I hope that hon.

 We were seeking to discuss those matters in Committee to obtain reassurances about the robustness of the funding package, notwithstanding what the Minister has already said. I hear what he says about those matters not being part of the Bill that will be before the Committee. Will he therefore give some thought to allowing the Committee to avail itself of its facility to take independent evidence at the start, and to seeking the Committee Chairman&#146;s approval to hear such evidence on funding?

 Those are productive, positive suggestions.

Of course, there will also be an opportunity for a Select Committee in the other place to hear any outstanding concerns from communities or businesses on the Crossrail route. The hon.

However, it is not the Government&#146;s intention to redraw the Bill as it stands at the moment.

We will make an announcement on that shortly. It is not in the interest of the Bill substantially to alter the principle behind it by extending the route westward from Maidenhead to Reading at this stage. I understand why the right hon.

It will deliver significant economic benefits, but it is simply not possible to build a major construction project in a densely populated area such as London without there being some adverse impacts, albeit mainly temporary ones, on the people living and working near the intended route. We have sought throughout this process to reduce those impacts. We have set out in detail the environmental statement deposited with the Bill. In subsequent volumes, as the Bill has progressed and changes have been made to the scheme, we have set out what we expect the significant impacts to be, as well as our strategies for minimising them. The Government intend to publish a report on the environmental impacts in advance of Third Reading, to assist in determining the desirability of the project in the light of the measures that the Government have put in place.</p>

 I will not detain the House for long on these motions and I am grateful to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for allowing us to debate them together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="71023-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07102355000007">As hon. Members will know, the House of Commons Members&#146; Fund is a benevolent fund that exists to provide support for former Members and their dependants, not least those who served before the House had any statutory pensions for MPs or their widows and dependants. Similar funds exist in most professions: what is unique about this fund is that it exists under its own rather arcane, ancient and out-of-date legislation. Two things are consequently required to be done, which explains why these measures are before us today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="71023-0010.htm_para15"><a name="07102355000008">First, we are required annually to appropriate moneys available to the fund, which come from two sources, to the purposes for which the fund is set up. That is what the first motion does. The two sources of money are the monthly contributions of Members from their own salaries, of which they may well be largely unaware, and moneys made available from the Treasury. Under this measure, the moneys are appropriate to be used for the purposes that the fund has set up, namely to provide so-called as-of-right pensions, in particular for those who are widows or dependants of Members who served before pensions existed or widows of Members who retired before the widows&#146; pension was raised on a discretionary basis. It is important to match any such increase in the widows&#146; pension. In addition, there are discretionary funds of a modest nature made to a handful of cases brought to the fund annually. The former contributions are in the order of &#163;2,000 a year&#151;a very small or, to my mind, derisory amount for elderly widows. The average of discretionary contributions, which will need to be met, is about &#163;5,000 in hardship cases of more recent retirees from the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o215"><a name="07102355000009"><a name="71023-0010.htm_spnew15"><a name="07102355000099"><b>Simon Hughes (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD):</b>

are about 100 beneficiaries and that we are appropriating the whole of the two sources of money, is it in the discretion of the trustees, if they were so minded, to make much larger payments if that were felt necessary? One could contemplate a widow or widower or a former Member who retired many years ago being in pretty dire financial circumstances. To put it bluntly, &#163;2,000 or even &#163;5,000 might be helpful, but it would not solve the problem.</p>

<p><a name="st_o216"><a name="07102355000010"><a name="71023-0010.htm_spnew16"><a name="07102355000100"><b>Mr. Lilley:</b>
 Yes, we can make larger discretionary payments. The as-of-right amount of settlement is agreed with the Treasury. I would like to see it raised, but that is not what the motion deals with or what we are debating now. A review of the whole fund is being undertaken. It may be that an agreement to increased amounts for the diminishing number of elderly widows will come out of that. However, we can, in addition, help individuals if they come to us with a specific need&#151;for example, because of disability. We look sympathetically on those cases and have discretion to help them through the appropriation of these moneys over and above the as-of-right amount that they receive semi-automatically.</p>

 Do I understand the right hon. Gentleman to be saying that the trustees can provide an additional top-up for the as-of-right beneficiaries, as well as giving a discretionary amount to people who are not as-of-right beneficiaries?</p>

<p><a name="st_o218"><a name="07102355000012"><a name="71023-0010.htm_spnew18"><a name="07102355000102"><b>Mr. Lilley:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is quite correct: we can and do act in that way in respect of specific beneficiaries who come to us with that sort of additional need. We always welcome hearing such cases where additional needs exist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="71023-0010.htm_para16"><a name="07102355000013">The second feature of the legislation, which gives rise to the second motion, is the reference to there being a &#147;custodian trustee&#148;. Up to now, the custodian trustee has been the Public Trustee office&#151;now called the Official Solicitor and Public Trustee office. It now wishes to desist from involvement in this matter and has effectively resigned. The trustees have agreed that Capita Trustee Ltd. should replace that office as custodian trustee. The Official Solicitor and Public Trustee office has itself carried out a public tendering exercise and, by happy coincidence, reached the same conclusion&#151;that Capital Trustee Ltd. should be the replacement body to carry out these functions. It may be some comfort to hon. Members to know that the trustees&#146; judgment was supported by the Official Solicitor and Public Trustee office. Its judgment, which might be thought &#147;interested&#148; in that it wanted to get shot of this responsibility, was supported independently by the trustees. That explains the second motion. I commend both motions to the House.</p>

 I will also be brief. I add my thanks to those of the Minister for the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) and his colleagues for discharging this function.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="71023-0011.htm_para0"><a name="07102355000018">I have two further questions&#151;I had hoped to intervene to make my contribution even shorter&#151;so let me deal with them in turn. First, in respect of the first motion and the fund as a whole, I understand that it currently stands at just above &#163;4 million. By definition, the 100 beneficiaries are declining in number as they age. At the end of the exercise of this set of functions, will the money go back into a fund that will be available for other potential beneficiaries, will it go back to the Treasury or will it go somewhere else? From the papers I have read, I could not work out where the money would go once the duties of the trustees to these 100 beneficiaries have been fulfilled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="71023-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07102355000019">Secondly, on the replacement custodian trustee, I have no fundamental disagreement with the judgment of the trustees, but a bell was ringing in my head when I saw who had been nominated to take over. It is a private sector company well known to many of us and this is clearly its trustee arm.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="71023-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07102355000020">Capita has not been uncontroversial in its intervention in public sector tendered activities; it does, and has done, huge amounts of work for local authorities. I think that the other arm of the company might still run London congestion charging, so it is well known across the country. It has had difficulties in the recent past: it is a matter of record that it was fined by the Financial Services Authority, and it accepted that and paid up. In addition to the tendering process done by the previous official custodian as official trustee, will the right hon. Gentleman confirm that our trustees, of whom he is an eminent chairman, satisfied themselves that the company was not only satisfactory simpliciter but the best available in the market&#151;even if they did not undertake a tender process, as I understand it&#151;and that any concerns about its past failures had been overcome, so that people could have confidence that it was entirely reputable and competent to do the job?</p>

Some actuarial assessment of costs would be sought, and the Treasury would in turn diminish or cease to make an annual contribution to the fund. The fund would therefore need to retain some moneys to ensure that it was properly financed, together with the ongoing subscriptions that it receives from serving Members to meet the needs of ad hoc cases that come before us. We will have to get the sums right in the review for that to be agreed, and for a proposal to be put before the House.</p>

I am sure that Members will think that a just reflection of the prolific output of the Committee, and of the importance of its work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="71023-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07102355000032">Our motto was spelt out some 150 years ago when the House was built and the Committee was brought into being. Above the door of Room 6A, which I have the privilege to use as Chairman of the Committee, is one word, &#147;Assiduity&#148;. That is a watchword for all members of the Committee. We are, we hope, assiduous in holding the Executive to account, and in pursuing savings and improvements in public services. That role is perhaps not taken as seriously as it should be, but it is vital to the work of the House. It is therefore important to have two occasions every year when we can put the spotlight on efficiency savings.</p>

I contend that that is what the Committee tries to do week in, week out. It can be testing, I know, for permanent secretaries to appear before the Committee, and we make no apology for that. In our last debate, I challenged those most senior of civil servants who appear before us to show without question that they understand the seriousness of their responsibilities to the Committee. I was thinking particularly of the way in which notes are often promised but their production is often subject to severe delay. Various commitments have been given, which I welcome. It is too early, however, to pass judgment on what will happen and whether the commitments will be carried out. I remind those on the Treasury Bench, however, of those commitments on behalf of permanent secretaries. I and my fellow members of the Committee remain on the watch. As we have seen in the past two or three years, it is absolutely vital that notes that are promised are delivered on time.</p>

Committee. Mr. Johnson McNeil presided over one of the greatest failures of government and caused a lot of anguish to farmers. Our hearing, however, was delayed for the better part of a year while various sick notes were put in, phone calls were not returned and so on. Finally, he appeared, and in my view he was a perfectly adequate witness who gave his side of the story.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="71023-0011.htm_para13"><a name="07102355000036">Another message that we want to pass back to Whitehall is therefore that civil servants must realise, even if they are suspended from their post or have moved on to a different Department, that there is one place that they can be held to account on behalf of the public&#151;in front of the Public Accounts Committee. Their superiors and the whole system must ensure that they turn up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="71023-0011.htm_para14"><a name="07102355000037">An appearance in front of the Committee can be testing, but at the same time we try to be fair. We are not in any way party political, and we try to give praise where it is due, and to help the Government. This is not often heard from Opposition Members, but I and my fellow members of the Committee try our best not to be partisan. We try to help the Government, as best as we are able, to learn from best practice in whatever nook or cranny it can be found.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="71023-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07102355000038">By convention, the debate looks back at matters arising from the Committee&#146;s recent work. It also looks forward, however, as important lessons arise from our reports. We look to officials to apply those lessons and that experience to new challenges in whatever area of government they arise. The new challenges are many and varied.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="71023-0011.htm_para16"><a name="07102355000040">In the previous debate, in April, I think, I referred to the comprehensive spending review, which arrived earlier this month. What can we glean from it to guide the work of the Committee, given that this is the sort of tapestry on which we draw our work? Well, the squeeze is certainly on. If the aims are translated into action, the munificent Treasury will no longer be showering spending Departments with ever-increasing pots of gold. Everyone will have to raise their game to ensure that more limited increases in Government spending translate into better public services for all. Initiatives to cut waste, slash red tape and make better use of what we already have are essential if the whole edifice is not to crumble.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="71023-0011.htm_para17"><a name="07102355000041">The Government report that they are on track to realise their efficiency target of a massive &#163;21.5 billion of savings by next March. That is really at the centre of the whole political debate&#151;at the centre of the issue of whether political parties can deliver improving public services and lower taxation. The efficiency programme is the centrepiece of the Government&#146;s efforts to get more for less. The Treasury claimed that it had already achieved an annual &#163;13.3 billion of efficiency savings, but I am afraid that, as we found in one of our recent reports, the claim does not stand up to close scrutiny. Our report cast doubt on the reliability of 74 per cent. of the savings claimed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="71023-0011.htm_para18"><a name="07102355000042">It should be crystal clear whether or not any programme has achieved its goal. Efficiency gains must be real and demonstrable, and must be deliverable year after year. Remarkably, it was possible for claims to be calculated without account being taken of associated increases in costs elsewhere. Efficiency is not genuine if,   <br>

as we have found in a number of cases, it has been achieved at the expense of the quality of service provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="71023-0011.htm_para19"><a name="07102355000043">Guarding against such&#151;let us be generous&#151;confusion is an important task for the Committee. I was therefore pleased to note the Government&#146;s announcement in the comprehensive spending review that there may be what we consider an important role for the National Audit Office in reviewing claimed savings on a Department-by-Department basis. That means an independent audit of what is now at the heart of political debate for all three political parties&#151;indeed, for every political party: I see that parties other than the three major ones are represented here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="71023-0011.htm_para20"><a name="07102355000044">If the scale of savings required is significant, the scale of projects that may cross the Committee&#146;s path in the near future is monumental. Let me list some of them. We are talking about &#163;9 billion, already, for the Olympics; &#163;19 billion to replace Trident; &#163;12.5 billion for IT in the health service; at least &#163;5.5 billion for identity cards; and &#163;16 billion for Crossrail, which we debated earlier today and which is finally emerging from its elephantine gestation period. That is more than &#163;60 billion in just one sentence, and I could go on and on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="71023-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07102355000045">It looks like boom time for the contractors and consultants, but what lessons can be taken from the work of the Public Accounts Committee to ensure that it will not be the taxpayer who goes bust? We will have published nearly 70 reports by the time the Session ends, far more than any other Select Committee. I will spare the House the details of all of them. Sometimes in the past Chairmen have gone through the whole list, but I think that that is tedious, and there is no point in it. Instead, I shall focus on some of the essential verities that Government will need to grasp in response to the challenges that I have outlined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="71023-0011.htm_para22"><a name="07102355000046">First, there is good project management. The Committee has seen a sorry succession of projects cursed by weak management and implementation. With some 100 mission-critical or high-risk IT-enabled programmes and projects, the risks are very high. Given the history of past failures, Government need structures and management processes that will secure greater success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="71023-0011.htm_para23"><a name="07102355000047">When things go wrong, everyone pays the price. The implementation of the single farm payment scheme, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne), was inept, and my Committee said so. The timetable was near-impossible. The planning was poor. The testing of IT systems was incomplete. Responsibility was confused. Management information was scant. Above all, top managers failed to face up to the crisis, and, as we heard earlier, to answer for it. Farmers, many of them in my Lincolnshire constituency, were hit emotionally and financially, and the taxpayer had to confront a potential liability approaching &#163;500 million. Let that fiasco be studied for years to come, and let the message be drummed home to senior civil servants: never again.</p>

examined relating to tax credits, is the failure to engage in adequate testing. The compression of the testing timetable featured in the Committee&#146;s report. What is it about computer systems that gives the Government such an aversion to testing them properly before they are implemented? Or is this a result of Ministers&#146; shouting from the rooftops that projects must be completed by a particular date regardless of whether they are ready?</p>

 My hon. Friend&#146;s last point illustrates a difficulty that arises in Government. We live in a political system under which Ministers understandably want to get their own projects up and running while they are in office. Projects in the public sector are often far bigger and more complex than those in the private sector. The combination of political interference&#151;if I may put it that way&#151;and the sheer scale of projects frequently causes disasters. But let me take up my hon. Friend&#146;s point immediately, and say that we do not always want to be critical.</p>

 Another problem may be the fact that civil servants are not prepared&#151;I do not know why, because they should be&#151;to stand up to Ministers. A Minister will get a bright idea and say, &#147;Let us do it this way, let us do that, let us adopt such and such an initiative&#148;&#151;and senior civil servants do not dare to say, &#147;We cannot do that with our current resources&#148; or &#147;We cannot do it while we are firing staff under the Gershon programme&#148; or &#147;We cannot do it because our computer systems will not cope with it&#148;.

 It would be great in an ideal world, but it might be rather career-limiting for a civil servant to stand up to his political master in the way that the hon. Gentleman describes. That was one of the problems with Johnson McNeil.

That showed that the public sector can successfully deliver a major scheme to time, cost and quality. It was good to see the Identity and Passport Service taking on all the recommendations made by our predecessors. Planning from the outset was for a cautious, low-risk project of which my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) would approve, featuring substantial testing and sufficient time for a progressive roll-out rather than a big bang, a switch and the job was done. There are lessons in that which could well be learned throughout Whitehall.</p>

While we are proud of the fact that 90 per cent. of our recommendations are apparently accepted by Government, when we examine the outcome we find that many of them are not adopted more widely across Whitehall, and as the right hon. Gentleman suggests, Members are often frustrated by a lack of accountability on the part of senor civil servants. That is why we are insistent that we will on occasion want not only to interview the current accounting officer, but also to summon back a previous accounting officer when it is clear that the current one is simply speaking from a brief because he or she has been in the post for only a few months and what went wrong was in fact the fault of the previous accounting officer. There is so much shuffling of chairs around Whitehall that it is often difficult for us to direct some light on who or what is responsible for faults.</p>

However, although we in this House tend always to lay the blame on their political masters, one of the virtues of the PAC is that it recognises the reality that senior civil servants play a powerful role in our system and that occasionally they must individually be held to account. They must be named and shamed, and sacked where necessary if they have been incompetent rather than merely the policy having been wrong. I am sorry to have to say this to the senior civil service&#151;I know that many senior staff read the <i> Hansard </i>reports&#151;but we will in future be prepared to do that more often.</p>

that, when the finishing line is crossed on 27 July 2012, they will be a great success&#151;I am sure they will be. The risks, however, remain. The original bid seriously underestimated the cost of the games and was far too optimistic about the extent of private sector funding. We will shortly have a hearing on that, and we will constantly point a spotlight on the Olympic games so that we do not have merely an, as it were, post hoc PAC report on the Olympics after 2012; we want to keep close track of them as we approach 2012.</p>

No single individual has overall responsibility for delivering the games and the plethora of bodies involved presents significant risks to timely decision making, among other potential problems. Strong progress monitoring and risk management arrangements are essential, but they are not yet in place. Therefore, the Committee, with the support of the National Audit Office, will continue to keep a close eye on progress. We hope that when we reach 2012 the lessons will have been learned and we can have an Olympic games that are both successful and&#151;for the first time ever&#151;delivered on budget.</p>

Its projects are every bit as complex as, and often larger than, those in the private sector. We should be optimistic, as some progress is being made. Our reports show that it is possible for the public sector to impose tight management disciplines on big projects. As Committee Chairman, I am keen to ensure that the PAC pays due recognition to public sector successes&#151;that we do not always seek to carp, but that we congratulate, praise and welcome where appropriate.</p>

The Child Support Agency did not have the in&#151;house technical expertise it needed to challenge its supplier. No one involved truly knew what they were doing in dealing with the contractors, and the IT system was a turkey from day one. It might prove to have been right to put the CSA out of its misery&#151;most Members accept that&#151;but the Government must also keep an iron grip on the new Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.

Departments need to have clarity themselves, but they need to sell the benefits to users, win wider support for change and, ultimately, assess whether the programme or project has achieved what it set out to do. Those are brave words, but when we examined the NHS IT programme we learned that there was still a great deal to do to win hearts and minds in the NHS. That is a major problem with this huge Government IT programme. Scepticism is rife throughout the NHS. With sums involved of more than &#163;12 billion and counting, this is a high stakes game, and the Committee will return to the subject. By contrast, in terms of the west coast main line the SRA successfully engaged stakeholders in support of the programme and to clear effect. If we are to make a success of the NHS IT programme&#151;as we are all committed to do&#151;there must be more engagement with people on the ground, particularly GPs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="71023-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07102355000066">Government need to adopt a more commercial approach to procurement. Central civil Government organisations spend approximately &#163;20 billion a year on goods and services. About one third&#151;almost &#163;8 billion&#151;of the Government&#146;s own efficiency savings are expected to come from more efficient procurement. Therefore, procurement is essential to their efficiency programme. There is certainly scope for such savings: in the past six months, in just four Committee reports we identified potential savings of some &#163;1.3 billion a year. Consultancy firms have been on to a good thing, and we found that there was the potential to save &#163;500 million in Departments&#146; use of consultants by making more use of in-house staff, negotiating better contracting terms and getting improved results for the money they spend. We are pleased that the Cabinet Secretary is taking action, but will that produce results? Is all of this just words in Treasury minutes, or have we now moved on from what we see as an over-reliance on external consultancy firms? There is often enough in-house expertise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="71023-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07102355000067">Another &#163;500 million a year could be realised if OGC Buying Solutions was to improve performance and increase co-ordination. I was pleased to see that OGC agreed, and it was set a target to achieve &#163;1 billion a year in savings by 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="71023-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07102355000068">Best practice would often make a genuine difference if transferred elsewhere. There could, for instance, be the following savings: more than &#163;220 million from the &#163;2 billion a year spent on food in four key areas of public services; and more than &#163;75 million a year if further education colleges adopt modern procurement practice. Opportunities exist, and even in such mundane matters as food procurement the possible savings are staggering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="71023-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07102355000069">Wherever possible, procurement must be open and competitive. I will raise one minor example; a relatively small sum was wasted, but it offers a useful lesson. The backroom deal pursued by the Department of Health with Dr. Foster Intelligence was a failure in Government&#146;s duties to Parliament and the taxpayer. The sums involved were small, but fundamental principles were at stake. The choice of company and the haste with which the deal was concluded gave the Committee cause for concern. It is important that we occasionally draw back from all the huge projects and our need to talk in terms of hundreds of millions or  <br>

billions of pounds and examine a small project, such as that involving Dr. Foster Intelligence, so that we can learn lessons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="71023-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07102355000070">I have not yet mentioned the Ministry of Defence. Suffice it to say, given the mismanagement of technical and commercial risks on the Astute submarine programme, which was highlighted in the major projects report, that we will watch progress on the massive Trident replacement programme with two eyes fully open. If hon. Members will forgive the pun, little of this is rocket science; the simple adoption of methods tried and tested in much of the public and private sectors could save the taxpayer billions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="71023-0012.htm_para11"><a name="07102355000071">I know that the Government, and Opposition parties, are wary of going back to the public and trying to make the case for efficiency savings. They believe that the public do not believe that Government, or a future Government, can deliver efficiency savings, but they can be delivered and that is happening to a certain extent. An important role of the Committee is to put a spotlight on efficiency savings, to convince the Government to carry on with their work and to convince the Opposition that efficiency savings are deliverable now and in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="71023-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07102355000072">I come to my final theme, which, again, I have emphasised before. We can only truly judge whether all the expenditure announced in the comprehensive spending review is effectively used by assessing its impact on the end user&#151;the consumer. It is all very well to talk in technical language, but we often forget that we work on behalf of the consumer, who is also usually the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="71023-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07102355000073">The Government&#146;s &#147;Transformational Government&#148; mantra calls for public services to be designed around the needs of the consumer, not the provider. Unfortunately, to take just one example, that was not the case in the introduction of the new out-of-hours care system. We found that the preparations for the switch in a system used by 9 million patients a year was shambolic. Patients&#146; needs are not best served by the ending of Saturday morning surgeries, nor by a situation where access to advice and treatment is difficult and slow, or where no one knows whether the new service is meant for urgent cases only or for any requests for help. We accept that the new service is getting better, but it is costing about &#163;70 million a year more than expected, which is the last thing that primary care trusts wanted or need in this difficult climate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="71023-0012.htm_para14"><a name="07102355000074">On a more positive note, we returned in this period to the issue of tackling pensioner poverty by encouraging the take-up of entitlements. We were pleased to note that the Department for Work and Pensions is making good progress in encouraging patients to claim the pension credit to which they are entitled; however, billions of pounds lie unclaimed in the Treasury&#146;s coffers rather than in pensioners&#146; pockets. Shared targets for the different agencies involved, allowing pensioners to claim linked benefits through a single transaction and focusing effort where we know that take-up is poorer might all help. The Committee is not afraid of new thinking&#151;we seek it and welcome it when we see it&#151;and we also welcome risk taking on the part of the Government.</p>

Members will highlight their own themes during this short debate. All members of the Committee would wish to say that we rely on our staff. I pay tribute to Mr. Mark Etherton and his colleagues for all their work, and to the National Audit Office, on which we also rely. Its dedication to enhancing scrutiny, improving delivery and support is vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="71023-0012.htm_para16"><a name="07102355000076">I thank those members who have left the Committee since the last debate: the hon.

Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas); the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright); and the hon. Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Derek Wyatt). It seems that they have all moved on to Government, and they doubtless toil night and day to implement the Committee&#146;s recommendations. All its other members continue to work hard and assiduously to hold the Government to account, and I am grateful to them for making the Committee a pleasure to chair.</p>

As the proposals are debated and fleshed out, I am sure that the example of the parliamentary audit of the public&#146;s finances has much to offer. In December, we are organising a conference&#151;I am glad to say that the Chancellor and shadow Chancellor will be attending&#151;to celebrate the decision taken in 1857 by the Select Committee on Public Moneys to create a Committee of Public Accounts. It was a brave decision to create such a Committee then, and it was braver still to entrust the honour of chairing it to an Opposition Member&#151;an example that has been followed in many Commonwealth countries. Any Government might shy away from such a decision today, but they would be wrong to do so.</p>

Since I became Chairman in 2001, we have made 2,500 recommendations, more than 90 per cent. of which have been accepted, and produced 300 unanimous reports&#151;we have never had a vote. We must not be too sanguine about this, because we must constantly work harder and ask ourselves whether these recommendations are being not only accepted, but implemented across Whitehall.</p>

On occasion, our tongues will doubtless remain sharp with senior civil servants, and they will not like it, but we shall study, with great care, progress on the massive projects that I mentioned in my opening remarks. I hope and believe that our reports will be high on the reading lists of the officials concerned. We will continue to criticise when criticism is warranted, and praise when praise is earned. That will be our ongoing contribution to ensuring that the Government are a better servant of the people. I commend the motion to the House.</p>

 I shall be brief because I want to touch on only two specific issues, but it would be remiss if, before I attended to them, I did not congratulate my colleague, the Chairman of the Committee, with whom I have had a good working relationship as a senior member. We understand each other&#146;s thinking very well. I should also say how much I value his commitment to the Committee. The same must be said for my other Committee colleagues. Not many Committees have to cope with 60 pages of briefing twice a week and it takes a great deal of dedication to put in the time that they do, with as much enthusiasm as they have.</p>

In our previous debate, in April, I raised the issue of child obesity. We were told that schools are weighing children every year and checking for signs of obesity. The local health authority, the council and Departments could be told about problems, but we were astonished to find that parents could not. It was ludicrous that the relevant advisory committee described it as unethical to tell the parents, because back-up facilities in the community might not be available. That sounded more like a cover-up than a logical explanation. When I last raised the matter, I received a friendly and understanding response from the Minister. It was followed by a letter from the Department in which it indicated that it took the same view as the Committee&#151;that parents had the right to know&#151;and that it would take steps to introduce such a requirement. Months later, however, I still do not know where we are. On the 8 o&#146;clock news the day before yesterday, it was suggested that Ministers might make some recommendations on the issue.

 Yes, and the Sharman committee was set up to examine Government agencies that were not answerable to the NAO.

The Government accepted its recommendations and said that they would bring all those organisations under the NAO. They made two exceptions to the Sharman recommendations: the civil list&#151;that was no surprise&#151;and the BBC. The Government rejected a specific recommendation from Sharman that the BBC should be covered by the NAO, which was anomalous and illogical.</p>

The claim is that auditing the BBC&#146;s finances is a danger to editorial freedom, but a Committee that has power to question policy is not. If the Government cannot see the difference, one wonders what else could demonstrate the absurdity of the situation. If it is all right for Select Committees to look at the BBC, the PAC should also have full access via the NAO. As I have said, one wonders what the BBC is afraid of; perhaps, given its financial behaviour recently, it is that the public will realise that it is not very good at management.</p>

 The right hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) asked what the BBC had to fear from giving evidence to the PAC, but the reaction of certain civil servants shows that it has quite a lot to be afraid of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07102360000023">My first observation follows from the remarks made by the right hon.

It has been announced that the National Audit Office&#146;s remit will be extended to look in more detail at how savings can be made in each Department.

their capability to deliver what is required of them. The PAC plays a very important role in that process, as is evident from the scope of the contributions made in the debate so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07102360000026">One question in particular has emerged from the PAC&#146;s work over the past six months, and the hon. Member for Gainsborough touched on it his remarks: who is affected most keenly by the capability gap in the delivery of public services? Very often, the people who are most in need of help are most let down, and that is especially obvious in the tax credits system. It seems that the people who lose out by being caught up in overpayments are those at the margins, the ones on the lowest incomes who go in and out of work at different levels of pay. Ironically, they suffer most when their circumstances improve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07102360000027">We are considering various reports today, but I draw the House&#146;s attention to the one that shows the scale of the problems in the tax credits system. The PAC is not alone in investigating the matter: the recent ombudsman&#146;s report was also pretty damning, stating that HMRC</p>
<a name="71023-0013.htm_brev1"><a name="07102360000056"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;took a very rigid approach and assumed high levels of understanding of the system in terms of whether or not it is &#145;reasonable&#146; for someone to know they were being overpaid.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07102360000028">Comments such as that contrast significantly with the Treasury minutes in respect of the PAC&#146;s conclusions, especially where they deal with the cost of some of the proposed changes to the system and their impact on expenditure. In particular, the Treasury minutes on the impact of the proposed changes to the disregard rules state that</p>
<a name="71023-0013.htm_brev2"><a name="07102360000057"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there are still some uncertainties surrounding the costing. In particular, it remains the case that while the overall cost of the package is not affected by the order with which the changes are modelled, these interactions mean that the costs of the individual elements of the package are affected by the assumed order with which the changes are modelled.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07102360000029">The irony is that, although the Treasury is open about its uncertainty about the impact of the changes, it expects a sophisticated level of understanding among the people who are supposed to use the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07102360000030">I am sure that all hon. Members have constituents who come to them for help with tax credits because they do not know where else to turn. Such people may have been thrown into debt after receiving a claim for overpayment that goes back over a number of years and runs into many thousands of pounds. One lady came to see me whose tax credit overpayment amounted to quite a few thousand pounds. She was doing everything that she could to meet the demand, and was even trying to save some money for her children. She told me that, for the first time, she was using for living expenses the money that every month she normally put towards child care and into a savings account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07102360000031">That is what tax credit overpayments can do to people even when they try to do everything right. It seems that the system has become more important than the individual. One constituent of mine completely changed his bank account, because that was the only way to get out of the tax credit system altogether. People are taking extreme measures, and it is very worrying that, in its response to reports such as the PAC&#146;s, the Treasury says only that it will &#147;take note&#148; of recommendations, rather than agree to them. I think that it should go back to first principles and agree to  <br>

look at the system again, as the question goes beyond how the system is administered and what value for money is achieved. The important question posed in many reports produced by the PAC&#151;and it is one that the Public Administration Committee looked into when I was a member&#151;has to do with how systems are structured.</p>

<p><a name="st_o244"><a name="07102360000032"><a name="71023-0013.htm_spnew1"><a name="07102360000068"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b>
 The hon. Lady mentioned tax credits, about which there have been various reports, but does she agree that one of the most extraordinary aspects is that HMRC now has a higher level of fraud and error than any other Department? The CAG has laid a qualified opinion against the accounts of the body that is supposed to collect taxpayers&#146; money&#151;a state of affairs that should not be allowed to continue.</p>

<p><a name="st_o245"><a name="07102360000033"><a name="71023-0013.htm_spnew2"><a name="07102360000069"><b>Julia Goldsworthy:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right about that, and the saddest thing is that the tax credits structure was set up with the best of intentions. On paper, it seems that the scheme should work perfectly and help everyone to the exact extent that they need support, but the reality is that it is far too complicated. People come to me all the time who say, &#147;I&#146;d rather not have any money whatsoever than be subjected to this system.&#148; That makes me wonder whether the Government should not look at tax credits again. Perhaps they should consider a fixed-payments system, as that might be fairer to the people whom they are trying to help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07102360000034">The wider theme has to do with the Prime Minister&#146;s approach to such matters. His intentions are no doubt genuine, but the structures are sometimes so complicated that they are out of control. Other reports that we are considering this evening make that clear. For instance, the report on pensioner poverty shows that millions of pensioners eligible for pension credit still do not claim it. Some pensioners find the system too complicated, while others do not want to undertake assessment on the telephone. Yet others find that the pension credit interacts with other benefits, such as those for council tax and housing, in too complex a manner. Once again, the question to be asked has to do with whether that system is more important than the person whom it is supposed to serve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07102360000035">Another problem is that the amount of bureaucracy involved will rise as more pensioners become eligible for pension credit. If 80 per cent. of pensioners become eligible for the entitlement, at what point will the Government decide that it should be universal rather than means tested? Most worryingly, the PAC report on pension credit found that certain vulnerable groups will be left behind. In theory, no pensioner living in poverty will miss out on pension credit, but the reality, especially in rural areas, is that such people are difficult to identify and to target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07102360000036">The experience with other schemes is useful in that regard. For example, Warm Front was a big, national programme that was easy to roll out to assist people living in conurbations, as the index of deprivation could be used to identify whole wards where poverty was concentrated. However, it proved very difficult to pick out people living in small pockets of poverty in neighbouring wards, even though they were in as much need as those targeted under the scheme. It is important that the same groups of people are not left behind by other Government schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07102360000037">Another theme raised in today&#146;s debate has been the poor quality of commissioning. That has further undermined the structures adopted for Government schemes such as the ones that I have described, and it has also had implications for service and for cost-effectiveness. The PAC report into the NHS IT project showed that there had been huge cost overruns, no clear idea about the overall expenditure on the project and significant delays to important aspects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07102360000038">The situation in respect of tax credits is similar. When I was a member of the Public Administration Committee, Sir David Varney talked about instituting a change in the operation of the tax credit system so that instead of payments stopping immediately when an overpayment was found there would be a three-week window to give the individual an opportunity to appeal. Sir David said that it would take a year to institute that one change in the computer programme; no doubt, since then there have been other unintended consequences that needed to be resolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para15"><a name="07102360000039">Those examples raise questions about Departments&#146; experience in commissioning such services. What are the reporting standards when problems&#151;relating to the CSA, for example&#151;are investigated by the Department? One of my constituents had a problem with the CSA; payments had been made to the agency for the best part of two years yet she had received nothing. I wrote to the CSA on her behalf and was told that the agency accepted that there was a problem with her case, caused by some of the IT changes that had been taking place. The CSA could not tell me when, or if, it would be able to resolve the problem, but as it had written to me it assumed the matter was closed and contacted my constituent to tell her so. In how many other cases do the records show that a problem has been resolved when that is patently not so and people continue to receive a poor service? Can we be sure that the lessons are being learned? The Public Accounts Committee plays an important role in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para16"><a name="07102360000040">The PAC report on consulting made a series of recommendations, which were taken up by the Government, to ensure not only that Departments know how much they are spending on consultants and that they routinely assess the value of using them, but also that they share the information so that best practice can be adopted across Departments. It is great that the recommendations have been accepted, but what is being done to ensure that lessons are learned when responsibility is pushed down to local level?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para17"><a name="07102360000041">The Committee&#146;s report on out-of-hours services made it clear that primary care trusts were not experienced enough to know what they were trying to commission. In my constituency, a PCT took on a new deliverer of out-of-hours services, claiming that it offered better value for money. The result was appalling services that were internally audited so the people commissioning them had no idea about what was being delivered. Only when the matter was raised in the House did Serco pull its finger out and start to invest considerably more in the service than it had intended. If responsibilities are to be devolved to local government, or any other local body, lessons learned at national level need to be passed on, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para18"><a name="07102360000042">The same point applies to Sure Start, where the Committee&#146;s report showed that there were capacity problems and that staff lacked financial capability. We  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para19"><a name="07102360000043">The capability gap needs to be properly identified and the PAC plays an important role in doing so. It often has a vital role, too, in helping to fill the accountability gap; for example, in its work on the Rural Payments Agency, because people had no way of channelling their frustration, and on the NHS. Similarly, there is no clear chain of accountability in the CSA or tax credit systems and the Committee satisfies that lack. Without the doggedness of the Committee, the Government and their Departments would be much slower to learn their lessons.</p>

 The hon. Lady talks about lessons learned. Does she agree that a common theme in many of the systemic failures, which, as she said, often affect the most vulnerable in our society, is that the delivery of schemes that were broadly approved in this place is made too complex? The CSA, the RPA and the miners&#146; compensation scheme are just three examples of such over-complexity. How can the message be spread across Departments that they should keep things simple? Keep it simple and the failures will not multiply and spread as they have done, especially in IT systems.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. My concern is not just how the lessons are learned in new bodies in the future, but how we deal with the results of existing schemes. It should not have taken 13 years for us to realise that the CSA was in such a state that it needed to be replaced entirely. What happens about the legacy issues? Unfortunately, we cannot start with year zero; we have to work with the legacy, which is where the eminently sensible recommendations of the PAC play a really important role. As a cross-departmental Committee, the PAC can help to unravel some of the complexity so that the impact of its recommendations is felt more widely.</p>

The Public Administration Committee comes second after the Public Accounts Committee, and it is certainly sexier, but the Public Accounts Committee is the best one to be on.

There seem to be no sanctions, and we are not getting to grips with the people who make mistakes. As the Chairman said, it would be useful if we could examine the accounting officer under whose aegis the mistake was made. We cannot do so, which is infuriating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para25"><a name="07102365000005">Equally infuriating, many of the mistakes are made by politicians and parties&#151;by us. In this era of 24-hour news coverage, there is a tendency to govern by initiative. We constantly announce new initiatives, approve them in this place, because they are obviously common sense, and rush them in. The Child Support Agency had near unanimous support in the House, as did some of the other developments that have gone so disastrously wrong. Initiatives are rushed in with a chorus of approval and pushed on to Departments by Governments&#151;Governments of both parties, although we are a fairly initiative-prone party.

 I cannot accept that accusation from my hon. Friend, although I accept most of his accusations against other organisations. We agree fairly substantially about them. In a sense, the NAO was too soft in the early stages about the private finance initiative, but it then gradually began to get tougher as it got to grips with the issue. In demanding that the savings from the selling on of PFI debt be paid back to the public sector, it has shown that it has more teeth and is able to deal with the issue. Perhaps it was a little too welcoming at first, but it now has the situation under control. This is a learning experience for all&#151;for the NAO as well as for us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para28"><a name="07102365000012">I am critical, however, of the unwillingness of civil servants to stand up and say, &#147;This won&#146;t work,&#148; or, &#147;It can only be made to work with a lot more extra spending.&#148; The rural payments were a classic instance of that. Ministers, with support from the farmers, went for the most complicated system. It was a system that nobody else used, and I do not know why we went for it. By that time I had come off the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, but my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) might be able to tell us the answer. Politicians went for the most complex system, and it was pushed through at a time when the Rural Payments Agency was getting rid of staff who had close contact with the farming industry and knew the people in their area. Those staff were being fired, but subsequently had to be brought back, because the agency could do not do the job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para29"><a name="07102365000013">Fortunately, the agency&#146;s head eventually appeared before the Committee and gave quite a good account of himself, although I still think he was wrong. He sent monthly reports to Ministers saying, &#147;We&#146;re on course and things are on line to start the payments.&#148; Then he began to put more weasel words in and said that the agency was not quite ready. Then, finally, the total disaster emerged. However, he did not, at the start, say to Ministers, &#147;We can&#146;t do it with these staffing levels; we can&#146;t do it and get rid of these people; we can&#146;t do it on the basis of the regional structure that we have.&#148; He did not say that, but he should have done. The Chairman of the Committee said that making such comments would have been career-limiting&#151;and so it would. But presiding over disaster is even more career-limiting, and it is necessary to point that out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="71023-0013.htm_para30"><a name="07102365000014">I have criticised civil servants by saying that they do not have the commercial skills to negotiate better deals on PFIs, and that is certainly true at local government and hospital level. There is a Treasury team to advise them and put backbone into them, but it cannot do everything and go all over the country.</p>

 I am interested in what evidence the hon. Gentleman has for his assertion that presiding over a disaster is career-limiting. After all, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, Sir John Gieve, presided over such a mess that its accounts were presented to Parliament unaudited. His punishment for that was to be promoted to be deputy governor of the Bank of England in charge of financial stability in the banking system, which of course was to the fore when we had the Northern Rock fiasco. That is the sort of thing that we might expect to find in Gilbert and Sullivan, but not necessarily in real life.</p>

At the time of the disaster, the permanent secretary to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Sir Brian Bender, was seamlessly moving onwards and upwards, almost without trace. That is a another classic example.</p>

enormous expense. What the second report&#151;there was an earlier one in 2002&#151;shows is the enormous fees paid to consultancies, and as we all know, consultancies are a system for telling us what we wanted to hear in the first place.</p>

 And for recommending their friends to carry through the execution of the project. That is the procedure. Our report showed that the Government were making excessive use of consultants and pointed to the need to build up expertise in the Departments rather than handing work out to consultants. It is a question of respect for the civil service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="71023-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07102365000027">I said that I would be brief, but all the interruptions have made me take a detour for what seems like the past three quarters of an hour. I shall conclude with a couple of observations about the way in which we deal with the reports. Perhaps it is the geriatric in me, but I find our procedures a bit confusing. A National Audit Office report comes out, and we have a session on it. We then write a report, and when it is finally published, we get telephone calls from people asking us about something that we have totally forgotten about. The procedure is not seamless; it is not well knit together. There is not a stage at which we can really produce a conclusive report on an issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="71023-0014.htm_para2"><a name="07102365000028">The second problem is that, as I said at the beginning, in all our proceedings we are not actually dealing with the people who made the mistake&#151;the people who took the decision. If we are to produce an effective report, we need to know what happened to them. We need to know whether any sanctions were imposed on them, or whether they took a seamless path to promotion, as my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire put it. As Virgil said,</p>

We, as a Committee, need to know what happened to them, and whether any sanctions were imposed on them.

in his intervention on the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy). The question is: what is the centre doing to make sure that when projects are spread out across Whitehall Departments and agencies, things actually happen? Obviously, there is inherent tension between avoiding a situation in which the Treasury is too involved, and tries to micro-manage matters that should be the responsibility of Departments, and avoiding sitting back and watching a Department make a mess of things with the taxpayers&#146; money given to it by the Treasury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="71023-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07102365000033">I have not had the pleasure of being a Treasury Minister and being vexed by such issues&#151;although I am sure that that is something that history will correct in the fullness of time. I am sure that Treasury Ministers worry very much about that tension between the centre and departmental responsibility. The tendency has been to let Departments sort things out. Some years ago, there was the fiasco of the individual learning accounts&#151;an adult training scheme with great intentions, which was designed to help the most vulnerable, and which failed miserably. I remember thinking, &#147;Where was the Treasury?&#148; Similarly, in the case of the Rural Payments Agency&#151;although I respect the fact that we are not talking about that issue today, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;it was for the Department to sort out the issue. The Treasury left the Department to it, and left it to bear the financial brunt, too.</p>

The ostensible purpose of the scheme was to merge the St. Mary&#146;s NHS Trust and the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust. However, as conclusion (i) of our report said,</p>
<a name="71023-0014.htm_brev1"><a name="07102365000162"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Paddington Health Campus scheme, as proposed...was based on an inadequate Outline Business Case, constructed without the benefit of input from doctors and nurses as to the required clinical content.&#148;</p>

The scheme&#146;s development was also handicapped by insufficient manpower and capability. NHS Trusts taking forward building schemes should have early external assessments...of their capacity to deliver complex schemes and firm timetables against which they can measure progress.&#148;</p>

level. Our 14th report was on delivering digital communications through the Bowman programme. That was a so-called combat infrastructure platform&#151;a battlefield communications system. The project was inherently complicated, because it sought to make sure that all the different players in a battle, whether they were battle tanks, infantry or air support, could talk to each other, and to HQ, and all that had to be delivered properly. It was an extraordinarily complex project, yet it did not have a senior responsible owner.

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="71023-0014.htm_para22"><a name="07102365000052">I was talking about the appointment of a senior responsible owner, and the presumption that the SRO would remain in post until the project was seen through. The interesting thing was the Government&#146;s answer in the Treasury minute, in which the Treasury says:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="71023-0014.htm_para23"><a name="07102365000053">That is in paragraph 11, on page 3 of the minute on the 27th report. However, the next sentence states:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="71023-0014.htm_para24"><a name="07102365000054">That is common sense, but why does the natural progression of civil servants between roles mean that a project should have more than one SRO? Why should not the SRO finish the project, deliver it and then get the natural progression to the next post in their career? Unless and until they have completed the project, they should not have a natural progression. If that means paying civil servants more in post, so be it.</p>

You&#146;re going to be transferred to the Cabinet Office&#148;&#151; or to stamping passports in Tristan da Cunha, depending on how well or badly he has done.

get Ministers out of a hole&#151;I do not blame the present Government; I think this is universal with Governments of all parties&#151;and to help Ministers explain why things that look like a disaster are &#147;the best that we can possibly have done, considering the difficult combination of circumstances with which we were faced, Minister.&#148; A civil servant who can do that will prosper.

It stated clearly that the Government were poor at identifying when consultants should be used, poor at appointing them, poor at project management during the process, poor at transferring skills to in-house staff and poor at learning lessons for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="71023-0015.htm_para14"><a name="07102365000075">None of this is new at all, which is why I asked the Exchequer Secretary about the tension between the centre and the local and the centre and the Department, and about whether, without being heavy-handed or bureaucratic, things can be done to improve that balance. I hope that she will find time to address that issue specifically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="71023-0015.htm_para15"><a name="07102365000076">I have been reading Michael Barber&#146;s book &#147;Instruction to Deliver&#148;, in which he discusses the need to improve Departments&#146; performance, in an environment in which the Treasury would not co-operate. He refers to Sir David Normington, who is now at the Home Office, telling him about the problems that he would face. The Treasury would shut him out, permanent secretaries would neither talk to him nor give him information and he would not be able to get to the Prime Minister&#151;then Mr. Blair&#151;because the policy unit would be in the way. That meant that he would probably be finished before he even started, so he had to think about how to get round the situation. He proposed a series of simple measures and behaviours to be adhered to&#151;including, by the way, abolishing the delivery unit after a few years. He thought that that would help to improve its performance, and I think that in some ways it did. The whole story illustrates a vexing and long-term problem in the nature of how we govern ourselves, and I would be interested in the Exchequer Secretary&#146;s thoughts on that.</p>

I see no good reason why it should not be subject to the same degree, quality and type of scrutiny as other bodies that undertake public expenditure. The criticism that it, an important national institution, has come in for recently may be down to the fact that it has not had enough of the right scrutiny early enough. I am sorry that the hon.

<a name="71023-0015.htm_brev10"><a name="07102365000186"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are concerned in particular that iSOFT&#146;s flagship software product, &#145;Lorenzo&#146;&#151;on which three fifths of the Programme depends&#151;is not yet available despite statements by the company in its 2005 Annual report that the product was available from early 2004.&#148;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="71023-0015.htm_para19"><a name="07102365000082">I will not dwell on the issue, because I am a bit bored with making well-researched and informed speeches on the national programme for IT in the health service, only for Ministers to say things that are manifest nonsense. I shall not encourage the Exchequer Secretary to say something that is probably not true; all I ask is that she, or one of her colleagues, will come to the House to inform us when the Lorenzo product becomes available. I do not think that paragraph 33 is true; time will tell us that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="71023-0015.htm_para20"><a name="07102365000083">I said that I would refer only to paragraph 33, but I should also refer to recommendation 4, one of the most important of our report. It stated:</p>

management failings in the public sector&#151;whether they involve value-for-money or efficiency issues. We have heard many such failings rehearsed by hon. Members this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="71023-0015.htm_para23"><a name="07102365000087">I should like to highlight one particular aspect of the Committee&#146;s effectiveness which I have noted from a number of our evidence-taking sittings. It appears that the threat of a National Audit Office investigation followed by a PAC report can have an electrifying effect on the relevant Department or agency. When the permanent secretary or chief executive of the agency come before us, they quite regularly seek to respond to our questions by pointing out what improvements they have made since the National Audit Office report was written.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="71023-0015.htm_para24"><a name="07102365000088">As the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) said, there is a considerable delay between the publication of the NAO report, our meeting to discuss it, the publication of our report and the publication of the Treasury minute. During that whole period, the Department or agency concerned is under a degree of scrutiny. In many cases, their ability to point to improvements resulting from what has been flagged up in the initial investigation is remarkable. That is clear evidence of the effectiveness of our Committee, and I doubt whether other Select Committees have such an effect; I am sure that they do on some issues, but not as frequently as ours does.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="71023-0015.htm_para25"><a name="07102365000089">The Committee also occasionally has an electrifying effect on Ministers, who, although they do not appear before us, can make policy adjustments as a result of our conclusions. Sometimes, such measures include the ultimate rectification, which may lead to the scrapping of the initiative or the agency&#151;we have even seen the scrapping of a Department in the past year or so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="71023-0015.htm_para26"><a name="07102365000090">I should like to give two specific examples of the effectiveness of our work. The first comes from the 11th report on supporting small business, published on 6 February this year. The Small Business Service was formed in 2000 as an executive agency within the Department of Trade and Industry. On 19 June 2006, a month before I joined the Committee, the PAC took evidence following a highly critical NAO report, which had identified 265 separate funding streams within the Small Business Service. They were included in a total of some 2,500 business support schemes promoted by various branches of the Government. The then Chancellor had spotted that that was a potentially inefficient way to help business, and in the 2006 Budget he announced an initiative to reduce the schemes to a mere 100.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="71023-0015.htm_para27"><a name="07102365000091">In autumn 2006, the decision was taken to reform the Small Business Service, which has now been reconfigured as a policy unit within what was then the DTI, with 50 core staff&#151;some 10 times fewer than in 2004, when it employed more than 500 people. Since the publication of our report, the Small Business Service has been rectified out of existence and ceased to have executive agency status. On Monday, I looked at the website of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to see how many schemes were still in operation. The Minister may well be on top of this, but she might be surprised to know that of the 2,500 original schemes, 2,497 were in  <br>

operation, despite the Chancellor&#146;s proposal to reduce the figure to 100. She may like to comment on that in her closing remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="71023-0015.htm_para28"><a name="07102365000092">This morning, I had a meeting with representatives of the Engineering Employers Federation for the west Midlands. During a wide-ranging discussion of support measures for business, one of the messages that came out loud and clear was that there is still considerable confusion about the provision of advice from Government to business. There is a plethora of advisers and schemes but a shortage of cash to help business with the promotion of their endeavours, whether domestically or internationally through exports. I encourage the Minister to consider the proposals in the pre-Budget report to change business taxation, because another message that came across loud and clear is that the changes to capital gains tax, supplementary business rates and increased corporation tax rates for small business are extremely unwelcome in that sector. Taking some advice from the business community on those measures, alongside work through the plethora of schemes that I mentioned, could well have much more impact on promoting small business. I hope that the Minister will consider that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="71023-0015.htm_para29"><a name="07102365000093">The second report of our Committee that clearly had an impact was our 37th report on the Child Support Agency and the implementation of the child support reforms. The failures of the CSA have been well rehearsed in this Chamber over many years. The Government have now decided to replace it, and introduced legislation to do so in June this year. They had looked at the Committee&#146;s conclusions, and I think that we can take some credit for helping to identify failings in three specific areas. The first of those concerned the identification of uncollectible debts. As we know, the CSA has some &#163;3.5 billion of debts from non-resident parents. The Committee identified, through the persistence of our questioning, that of that amount &#163;1.9 billion is deemed to be uncollectible, partly because the debts were attributed to non-resident parents as a device by the officers involved to try to frighten them into making a contribution by putting a debt on the system which could subsequently not be taken off because of IT incompetence. The system&#146;s inability to correct that anomaly was one of the fundamental reasons why it was decided to scrap it. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="71023-0015.htm_para30"><a name="07102365000094">The second area concerned the backlog of cases stuck between the different phases of the system, where progress was being made but it was painfully slow. More than 100,000 cases remain stuck, and nothing can be done. The third area concerned our pointing out the effectiveness of similar schemes in other countries, particularly Australia. In our conclusions, we identified the effectiveness of the Australian system in providing access to personal tax information on non-resident parents as being an effective way of establishing their genuine income rather than their claimed income. I believe that the Government have taken that on board in the legislation they have introduced and there will be access to information held by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. I welcome that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="71023-0015.htm_para31"><a name="07102365000095">I should like briefly to touch on a few other reports to highlight some of the areas where we have been helpful or could be helpful to the Government in looking at ways to improve delivery of public services. In March this year, our 13th report on smarter food procurement covered a whole range of aspects of  <br>

Government procurement designed to provide not only efficiency in the use of public money but other policy initiatives. We have heard about the importance of healthy eating as a means of trying to address public health among children in schools, including in relation to obesity. The public sector could play a much greater role in encouraging the health of our children and young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="71023-0015.htm_para32"><a name="07102365000096">More effective procurement can lead to direct cost savings for the agencies involved, as well as much wider social and economic benefits. That does not apply only to health. With the advent of bluetongue disease, which now covers most of southern England, a major role could be played by Government Departments, especially the Ministry of Defence and other major procurers of large quantities of meat products. If they were required to buy British meat, as opposed to importing it from other countries, that could have a significant impact on improving the lot of British farmers who are suffering all over the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="71023-0015.htm_para33"><a name="07102365000097">That brings me to our 32nd report on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, where we looked at rights of access to open countryside. As a result of persistent questioning through our Committee when we met last November, we established for the first time that DEFRA budgets had been cut across the piece as a means of paying the fine that had been imposed as a result of the Rural Payments Agency fiasco. Although the amounts of money in relation to this particular programme were quite small&#151;just over &#163;1.1 million had been cut from that year&#146;s budget&#151;it was the first time that I had been aware that the Treasury was seeking to resolve the payment of the fine by slicing budgets across its programmes. Harking back to the comment about who gets rewarded or suffers the consequences following failures within Departments, I remind hon. Members that not only civil servants get rewarded for abject failure, but Ministers too. The Secretary of State at DEFRA at the time of the RPA fiasco was subsequently promoted to Foreign Secretary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="71023-0015.htm_para34"><a name="07102365000098">Our 19th report was entitled &#147;A Foot on the Ladder: Low Cost Home Ownership Assistance&#148;. We discovered through our questioning that very little information had been available on the effectiveness of measures to encourage low-cost home ownership or on what happens after funds are deployed to help people to get their first foot on their housing ladder. That is another example of persistent questioning in our Committee encouraging officials to respond appropriately to the relevant criticisms that have been made. The Treasury minute in relation to our suggestions confirmed that it would accept most of our recommendations&#151;for example, on measuring how many households had increased their proportion of ownership after the initial purchase of an interest in a shared equity mortgage property, on how often the purchase of a property through one of these schemes helps to free up social rented housing elsewhere in the locality, and on the effectiveness of the help provided to key workers in seeking to get them housed in areas close to where they work. The Government could also learn lessons from advice from other quarters on how to encourage home ownership. My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) has made some significant proposals to abolish stamp duty, which would have a dramatic impact on encouraging first-time home ownership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para0"><a name="07102365000099">The last report I shall touch on, which was referred to by others, is the 22nd of the Session, the tax credit report published on 9 May. We have been taking evidence on tax credits from the chairman of the Inland Revenue and it is clear from what he has told us that the whole edifice was originally constructed with a significant amount of error&#151;I do not say fraud&#151;in prospect. The Revenue&#146;s accounts have not been signed off by the Comptroller and Auditor General as a direct consequence of that programme, and the extensive fraud and error that it is not able to quantify. It is the case that 2.8 million people have either been overpaid or underpaid tax credits&#151;32 per cent. of claimants as of the latest year end available, 2005-06.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07102365000100">The chairman admitted that a high proportion of errors were designed into the scheme from the outset and I do not need to remind the House that it was the then Chancellor of the Exchequer who designed it. The chairman was unable to quantify precisely how many errors were anticipated but accepted that the complexity of the scheme meant that errors were likely, with individuals having to notify the Department of changes in circumstances each time that they happened.</p>

<p><a name="st_o275"><a name="07102365000101"><a name="71023-0016.htm_spnew0"><a name="07102365000222"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b>
 On a point of clarification, or correction, the accounts were signed, but subject to a qualified opinion. What does my hon. Friend think that it says about the economy, effectiveness and efficiency of tax credits that some of the people who ought to benefit most from them have said, &#147;I want nothing more to do with this, even if it means I&#146;m financially less well off&#148;? What kind of a welfare system evokes that response?</p>

<p><a name="st_o276"><a name="07102365000102"><a name="71023-0016.htm_spnew1"><a name="07102365000223"><b>Mr. Dunne:</b>
 My hon. Friend, along with most other Members, will have had countless constituency cases where, as a result of some of the errors inherent in the system, some of the most vulnerable in our society have been encouraged to repay substantial amounts of money amounting to thousands of pounds. When such errors occur, it undoubtedly shakes the confidence of those individuals in the quality of our benefit system. It is no surprise to hear that some people would rather wash their hands of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07102365000103">Another thing that came out of inquiries into tax credits was a lack of transparency in Government when introducing the scheme. The income disregard was increased in the 2005 Budget from &#163;2,500 to &#163;25,000, and at the time I recall that very little, if any, information was provided by the Treasury on the financial consequences of that. An overall number was put into the Red Book, which was an agglomeration of different aspects of the benefit changes involving tax credits, but that particular income disregard was never specifically quantified, and it was only as a result of persistent questioning by our Committee that the Treasury were prepared to come up with the estimated cost of the disregard, two years later. That is a sorry state of affairs, because it had clearly made the calculation but was not prepared to make it public at the time, presumably for reasons of political embarrassment. Again, that demonstrates the value of the Committee in holding not just Government to account, but their officers and organs.</p>

part. Through my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, I would like to congratulate the Committee on its valuable work. Increasingly, an important part of the scrutiny function of this House falls on the shoulders of the Committee, and it discharges that role extremely well. It will become a more significant role in the future as the effective and efficient delivery of public services moves to the centre stage of the political debate. The reports of my hon. Friend&#146;s Committee are essential reading for anyone aspiring to Government and who recognises that delivery is the key measure by which this Government and future Governments are judged by the electorate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para3"><a name="07102365000105">The Committee has been instrumental in identifying billions of pounds of waste and inefficiency: &#163;6 billion of tax credits overpaid because of complexity built into the system, with &#163;500 million already written off and another &#163;1.4 billion likely to be uncollectible; &#163;500 million relating to the CSA project; &#163;500 million wasted on the misuse of consultants; and as my hon. Friend made clear earlier, the Committee&#146;s eye is very much focused on the &#163;9 billion Olympic budget, and the potential issues that may emerge there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07102365000106">My hon. Friend referred to the salutary effect that the prospect of appearing before the Committee can have on civil servants. I know from talking to civil servants in various Departments over the years that he is absolutely right. How often have any of us in conversation with a civil servant&#151;at all sorts of levels&#151;heard a reference to the possibility of having to appear before the PAC to account for something as a significant influence on the way that they conduct themselves? I hope that my hon. Friend and his Committee carry on holding civil servants and Ministers to account through that process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para5"><a name="07102365000107">Perhaps we could consider for a moment the context within which the debate takes place. My hon. Friend referred to the comprehensive spending review, which delivers a significantly tighter settlement for the funding of public services than most Departments have enjoyed for a number of years. That throws into focus the agenda of safeguarding public services in this environment, and as my hon. Friend said, it means that everyone has to raise their game to ensure that we can continue to enjoy high quality public services in the face of tough spending limits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para6"><a name="07102365000108">My hon. Friend did not actually refer to the CSR settlement as sharing the proceeds of growth, but that is exactly what it is. It comes at a time when there is an increasing awareness on all sides of the political debate that the public want increasing quantities of ever higher quality public services, but they also want tax, over time, to take a smaller proportion of our gross domestic product. That challenge goes right to the heart of the Committee&#146;s essential role in ensuring value for money and the best possible efficiency in delivering public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para7"><a name="07102365000109">However, there is another aspect to the debate to which my hon. Friend did not refer, but he could have done. As we live in an increasingly globalising economy, the need to maintain our international competitiveness will increasingly constrain the ability of Governments to go on raising an ever higher share  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="23 Oct 2007">

of GDP in tax, even if they wish to, to fund public services. We have to address the desire for ever higher quality public services through the improvement of efficiency and better outcomes, rather than simply increasing the volume of inputs. In a situation where 40 per cent. of our GDP consists of publicly delivered services, falling public sector productivity drags down the overall performance of our economy and thus our international competitiveness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07102365000110">The challenge will be to deliver ever more with a given level of resource&#151;something that may sound challenging, but the private sector has had to do it for years simply to survive, while delivering ever higher quality products and services at ever more competitive prices. This agenda puts a particular focus on the efficiency savings programme in Government. My hon. Friend rightly referred to the Committee&#146;s report on the shortcomings of the efficiency programme, in which the Committee identified bogus efficiency savings. The apparent efficiency was delivered only at the cost of a decrease in the quality of service&#151;a reduction in inputs but a corresponding reduction in outputs&#151;or, even worse, supposed efficiency was delivered only by not counting an additional input cost somewhere else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07102365000111">We welcome the possible role for the National Audit Office in reviewing Gershon savings on a Department-by-Department basis. It is clear from the Public Accounts Committee report that greater transparency in the Gershon process and independent audit of its results are needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para10"><a name="07102365000112">One or two overarching themes emerge both from the Committee&#146;s report and hon. Members&#146; comments in this evening&#146;s debate. The key theme that struck me is capacity&#151;whether the system has the capacity to deliver the complex, top-down solutions that Ministers prescribe from a political perspective. The impression that one gets from the debate is of a system that is overloaded with initiatives, which are increasingly complex and often require huge IT projects to enable their delivery. One also gets the impression that those who might say to their political masters, &#147;This is not do-able; the system doesn&#146;t have the capacity; you&#146;re asking for too much, too quickly&#148; are culturally inclined not to make such statements. I cannot say whether that reflects career judgments by individual civil servants or a deeper cultural malaise. There is also perhaps a bias towards always assuming the most favourable rather than the most likely outcome when planning ahead. That has led to a series of outright failures, some of which have been mentioned tonight, and a further series of on-going projects, which cannot be described as outright failures but suffer serious continuing problems, which, in many cases, look suspiciously like systemic problems that need resolving. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para11"><a name="07102365000113">I was encouraged by references by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough to some successful projects that the Committee had identified. It is vital that the Committee looks for the good as well as the bad and then focuses on the challenge of disseminating best practice across Government, and acquiring and disseminating best practice from the private sector. From my hon. Friend&#146;s comments and the balance in his speech between the good projects and those that have not been so successful, we might conclude that a  <br>

<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 245</b><br>
pretty big challenge remains to ensure that lessons from successful projects are learned and disseminated effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07102365000114">Several hon. Members referred to the tension between what might be termed the delivery and the policy-making parts of Government. In an interesting exchange about the development of civil servants&#146; careers, a suspicion arose that the policy-making part of Government continues to be perceived as the superior branch. Several hon. Members mentioned difficulties with leadership and accountability and the way in which sometimes nobody appears to be in charge of a project. I understand that the permanent secretary in the Department for Work and Pensions could not tell the Committee who was in charge of the CSA computer project. That echoes a comment that the Governor of the Bank of England made to the Treasury Committee a couple of weeks ago. When asked who was in charge at the time of Northern Rock, he asked whether Committee members would care to define what they meant by &#147;in charge&#148;. Again, that is symptomatic of a cultural problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para13"><a name="07102365000115">Reference was made to the tendency to move civil servants around before projects were completed. That, again, is a facet of a culture whereby generalism is encouraged and regarded as vital to career development. I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough agrees, but there is a case for saying that, although the development of individuals&#146; careers and the human resources policy of Departments are important, the overriding function of the delivery part of the civil service at senior level is safeguarding the public purse and the quality of outcomes for service consumers. There is a case for saying that the needs of career development must be subordinate to those of effective product delivery. I hope that the Committee will continue to press for that cultural shift in Government thinking.</p>

<p><a name="st_o278"><a name="07102365000116"><a name="71023-0016.htm_spnew3"><a name="07102365000225"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b>
 Does my hon. Friend agree that there should not be a conflict between career development and successfully safeguarding the interests of the public purse? Major multinationals, such as Shell and BP, are interested in bringing on their people. The top management of such businesses tend to be the lifers&#151;people who have been there for 20 or 30 years. They have experienced a huge spread of the business and successfully delivered a range of different projects, gaining different skills in the broader business.</p>

<p><a name="st_o279"><a name="07102365000117"><a name="71023-0016.htm_spnew4"><a name="07102365000226"><b>Mr. Hammond:</b>
 My hon. Friend is right. I am not an expert in civil service human resources practices, but the problem to which he alludes is that people on a fast track, who are expected to go far, are moved between delivery and policy-making functions, and often do not stay with a project long enough and do not acquire a critical mass of experience and understanding in any specific matter. However, the point has been made and Committee members have demonstrated an awareness of and alertness to the issue. I hope that it will inform their overview of the position in Departments when things go wrong and, indeed, when they go right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para14"><a name="07102365000118">My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough specifically referred to the Olympics project&#151;a large budget item, which rightly attracted the attention of the Committee because of the dramatic increase in its  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="23 Oct 2007">

<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2007" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>23 Oct 2007 : Column 246</b><br>
budget from what was originally envisaged. I encourage him to retain his Committee&#146;s close involvement with and interest in the project because there is a danger that the collective desire in the House and beyond for the London Olympics to be a great success may blind us to some of the risks in the delivery and may even discourage us from challenging and probing deeply some of the things that we are told.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07102365000119">As I understand it, notwithstanding the huge &#163;2.7 billion contingency allowance that is now built into the budget, it has not been allocated&#151;at least not publicly&#151;to different stages of the project. There is therefore no ability to determine whether the contingency fund is being used at a pace that is commensurate with delivery of the overall budget or whether it simply conceals an early stage overrun, even beyond what has been planned in the fund. I also understand that no monthly cash flow forecasts are available yet for public scrutiny to enable us to follow closely what is happening and how the budget is evolving. The whole House should be glad that my hon. Friend has fired a warning shot and that the PAC intends to keep a close eye on the project as it goes forward. We look forward to further reports from his Committee on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para16"><a name="07102365000120">The theme of getting the best out of contractors has also been mentioned by a number of hon. Members who have spoken. The concept of the intelligent client&#151;a client who has the capability to define what he wants and the capacity to monitor the ability of a contractor to deliver it&#151;is a critical part of the delivery of complex projects and will become ever more important as the model for the delivery of public services evolves and draws in ever more outside private sector suppliers. The CSA project was again cited as an example of how not to do it. Indeed, the PAC report pointed out that the Government did not rescind the contract with EDS in 2004 when they had the chance to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para17"><a name="07102365000121">The Committee has noted that fully &#163;8 billion of the savings that the Government expect to make in their efficiency programme comes from savings in the procurement of goods and services. Clearly a major initiative is required in that area, including a scheme to make the management of the private finance initiative more effective, through developing commercial skills and managing the pre-tender and tendering processes more effectively. That must be one of the major keys to delivering value for money in government in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para18"><a name="07102365000122">A clear message is coming from this review of the Public Accounts Committee&#146;s reports that we are discussing, and it is one of multiple failings and lessons unlearned. As my hon. Friend said in his opening remarks, the Government must up their game. The Committee has identified some major projects in the pipeline where there is potential for further mishap. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to my hon. Friend&#146;s helpful analysis and encourage his Committee to continue to analyse what has gone wrong with projects in the past, what is going on with them now and where there is potential for problems to be averted by applying lessons in the future. On an optimistic note, we were all pleased to hear about the good examples, but we will be even more pleased to hear that there is evidence that those good examples have been rolled out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para19"><a name="07102365000123">We were reminded in a timely way by my hon. Friend that value for money has two components&#151;he did not quite put it like that, but that is what he was telling us. When his Committee was established all those years ago, I suspect that the focus was almost exclusively on protecting the taxpayer and ensuring that money was not misspent or wasted. However, in a modern, enabling government environment, there is also the interest of the consumer to be protected. We need to ensure that the consumers of public services receive the best possible quality services with the resource available to deliver them and that the taxpayer is protected against the unnecessary use of resource. The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) also reminded us that it is so often the most vulnerable consumers who suffer the most when things go wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para20"><a name="07102365000124">I want to put one further thought to my hon. Friend, which is that we still focus far too much in our political debate on the inputs to public services and on the use of resources. We all do it; we all fall into that trap. Indeed, the Prime Minister did it last Wednesday at Prime Minister&#146;s Question Time, when instead of telling the House about the better outputs that he claimed had been achieved in the national health service, he chose to tell the House how many extra doctors and nurses had been taken on, and how many extra billions of pounds were being spent. I suggest to my hon. Friend that there is a need continually to remind politicians on all sides of the debate that outputs and outcomes matter to the public. We will never win the battle for better value for money and more efficiency in government if we fall into the trap of conducting the debate in terms of inputs. Indeed, if we conduct it in terms of inputs, improving efficiency could even appear to have a negative outcome. I hope that he and his Committee will bear that thought in mind in future reports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="71023-0016.htm_para21"><a name="07102365000125">We all wish my hon. Friend and his Committee success in the vital task that they perform and will continue to perform. He finished his speech by giving the House a commitment that his Committee would continue with its eyes open, its collective head not averted and its tongue sharp when necessary. I would encourage him, and the Committee through him, to do just that, and to continue to develop its skill set and its focus, as the process of delivering public services continues to evolve and the role of the Committee necessarily evolves with it. I know that the Committee, under my hon. Friend&#146;s guidance and leadership, will continue to be a driver for a cultural change within government that is so necessary if we are to see the improvements in the efficiency, value for money and delivery of public services that are vital to making them sustainable, so that our children and our grandchildren can enjoy the same high quality public services that we expect to receive today.</p>

It is in all our interests to ensure that the process is fully effective. I should like to offer my support by ensuring that my officials follow up and implement as far as possible the Committee&#146;s recommendations, and that we share what we have learned widely within the Government.</p>

The 48th report developed a traffic light system whereby it categorised 26 per cent. of the &#163;13.3 billion of efficiency savings as totally accurate, 51 per cent. as representing efficiency but carrying some measurement and uncertainty issues, and 23 per cent. as representing savings that were perhaps not really verifiable in a coherent manner. Only by putting the whole of the 51 per cent.&#151;what I would call the amber area&#151;into the red category can doubt be cast on 74 per cent. of the total, as the headline of the report does.</p>

The programme has moved on a long way since the NAO produced its report and the PAC took its evidence. Without the programme, the NHS could no longer function, and it is already providing essential services and significant benefits to tens of thousands of clinicians and millions of patients. It is therefore a success story that ought to be acknowledged. For example, more than 5.5 million appointments have now been made using the choose and book system, representing 44 per cent. of first referrals. In addition, 397 million diagnostic images are now stored centrally, and 42 million electronic prescriptions have been used in a service that is now available in 41 per cent. of pharmacies and 47 per cent. of GP surgeries. Nearly 400,000 users are registered to use the NHS care records spine, with 45,000 NHS staff accessing it daily. National leadership has been strengthened by the appointment of a chief clinical officer and national clinical leads, and the programme proceeds.</p>

Gentleman made a point about primary care trusts, and I acknowledge that providing out-of-hours services has cost the trusts more than the Government anticipated. However, with improved commissioning, there is significant scope for reducing those costs in the future. In fact, the NAO report on out-of-hours services confirmed that we were on the right track to provide quality, round-the-clock out-of-hours services, and recognised that patients&#146; experiences of the services were generally positive. Eight out of 10 patients were satisfied with the services, and six out of 10 rated them as excellent or good.</p>

Friend the Member for Swansea, West and Opposition Members that the NAO works very closely with the BBC Trust, and the BBC audit committee has close discussions to frame a programme of reviews, which it then undertakes.

 The consultation on whether the Government should have more power or influence over the BBC is utterly irrelevant. The National Audit Office has statutorily and deliberately been made completely independent of the Government. That is why it audits Government Departments.

Clearly, so do we all. I take issue with her view that fixed payments in respect of tax credits might be a fairer way forward. It is not particularly fair for people whose income goes down in-year&#151;they can lose out&#151;and estimates suggest that about 700,000 people who did not have their tax credits reduced would lose out under a fixed payments system if their income fell. As with all such matters, there is a tension between simplification and having too blunt an instrument on the one hand and complication and a more finely tuned instrument on the other. The hon. Lady will understand that from her experience in her own advice surgeries.</p>

 That is true, but equally the hon. Gentleman must recognise that fixed payments would make many people worse off. I do not underestimate problems with the tax credit system, but let us remember that it helps 20 million people and has lifted 600,000 children out of poverty. The figures show that 97 per cent. of those on the lowest income levels of below &#163;10,000 a year claim this tax credit. If we compare it with its predecessor, family credit, we find that it is much more effective.</p>

In my constituency surgeries, I have talked to many people who have been enabled to go back out to work and begin to earn a living by the extra help and assistance given by tax credits. As always, there are difficulties when systems go wrong, but the hon. Lady should not underestimate the amount of assistance that the tax credit system has given to many people. We must put these issues, important and difficult as they are, into perspective.</p>

Friend&#146;s comments about politicians being the problem, and civil servants not standing up to politicians, were interesting. My experience of the tension between policy and practical enforcement in government is not that civil servants do not stand up to politicians, or that politicians try to force civil servants to do things that are undeliverable. It is more subtle than that. As a Minister, I have had many a robust conversation with civil servants and much prefer to be told what is actually happening. If a measure is not seen to be practicable, any Minister worth their salt would want to know about it, and I have been involved in many discussions about the practicality of doing things. If things go wrong, however, the matter does not always come to light at an appropriate level to prevent disaster. As the hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) said, the work done by the Public Accounts Committee demonstrates what can be done to ensure that such things do not go wrong systemically.</p>

That is a good innovation, as it shows that there is a good way of doing things, which tends to reduce risks and increase the chances of major projects being delivered. If we simply take the worst cases&#151;which the Committee is right to look at&#151;we can go into a downward spiral of thinking that everything is bad, nothing works and nothing can ever be delivered on time. But we must also remember that a great deal of good change is delivered, day in, day out, by the public sector, central Government Departments and local government, without the great splurge of publicity that can happen when something goes badly wrong.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right, and it is nice to hear a contribution that celebrates our success in winning the games and is upbeat about our ability to deliver them. We already know that we are ahead of previous games in terms of preparation and planning, including in securing flows of private funding and sponsorship.

Member for Gainsborough said about preparations, there is one body, and ultimately one individual, with overall responsibility for delivery, and beneath them there are clear reporting lines, as set out in the Treasury minutes. The Olympic board is overseeing preparations for the games. That is being co-chaired by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Olympics and the Mayor of London, and the Minister for the Olympics reports directly to the Prime Minister.

On 9 October, the Chancellor announced in his comprehensive spending review plans that will release &#163;30 billion for reinvestment. The next stage will be for Departments to publish value-for-money delivery agreements by the end of the year. That will set out publicly how they will achieve their value-for-money savings. From then on, they will report biannually on their performance to ensure that the public are informed of progress towards meeting the value-for-money targets. As the hon. Member for Gainsborough has called for breakdowns of departmental performance, I anticipate that he will be keen to read them. The Government welcome the National Audit Office&#146;s continued vigorous interest in scrutinising the process to ensure that it achieves its goals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="71023-0017.htm_para22"><a name="07102367000013">A second area of great interest is the progress of the Government Department capability reviews. Fifteen Departments have already been reviewed, and the findings are published on the Cabinet Office website. We await with intense interest the results on the final two Departments: Revenue and Customs and my own Department, the Treasury. They should be published by winter 2008 at the latest. Furthermore, we are keen to ensure that this process has teeth, so once initial reviews are published, each Department has three follow-up board meetings to review progress against the findings.</p>

The Treasury is working closely with the NAO and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform&#151;the successor to the Department of Trade and Industry&#151;to ensure that the changes are implemented from April 2008, and to date 90 companies and subsidiary companies have been identified. When the powers are in place, the NAO will be able to offer Parliament a more comprehensive account of public business, so hon. Members will have a fuller picture of how public money is used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="71023-0018.htm_para1"><a name="07102367000015">Fourthly, I commend to the House a short and readable new Treasury publication &#147;Managing Public Money&#148;. It is now the Treasury&#146;s reference guide on standards and ethics in the use of public funds. Its predecessor, &#147;Government Accounting&#148;, had been around for many years and was an essential tool for all parts of the public sector, but over time it had become too lengthy and unwieldy. The new publication is much shorter, and is drafted to set out the principles that need to be applied. It is important for everyone making decisions relating to the use of public resources to appreciate the high standards expected. Of particular interest to the House will be the guidance to officials on parliamentary and Treasury controls over public expenditure and the need for legislation to enable Government spending. Copies of &#147;Managing Public Money&#148; have been sent to the Library and to the relevant parliamentary Committees&#151;and they are doubtless in fantastically high demand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="71023-0018.htm_para2"><a name="07102367000016">I hope that the fifth initiative that I wish to explain will ease all our work in monetary scrutiny. On 3 July, the Prime Minister announced his goals for constitutional change and proposed that the Executive become more accountable to the public and Parliament through 12 reforms. In addition, the Government are committed to enabling the close scrutiny of public spending, for which reliable information is a prerequisite. We have a strong track record of improving financial management and transparency over the past decade, but in one area Parliament&#146;s task has been complicated by the ways in which records of public money have been formatted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="71023-0018.htm_para3"><a name="07102367000017">Largely for historical reasons, we use different systems to set the control budgets, to present the annual estimates and to publish audited accounts. The accounts produced are all accurate and comply with their own reporting principles, but it is not easy, for instance, to compare planned expenditure with actual expenditure when using these systems. The differences between those outputs can cause confusion and inefficiency, so the task of parliamentary scrutiny of public spending is made more difficult than it need be. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="71023-0018.htm_para4"><a name="07102367000018">The Government have therefore put in place an alignment project. In practical terms that will involve substantial effort, but it will help us progress in respect of the need for clarity, coherence, consistency and transparency, and therefore better accountability. The core part of the project is a better alignment of budgets, estimates and accounts, but it has wider implications. We will also be reviewing the frequency, format and terminology of all financial documents laid before Parliament. We aim to put changes in place by the end of the CSR 2007 period, subject to legislative requirements.</p>

I hope and believe that it will be a welcome step towards making the various systems used to control and report on public spending easier to understand and more efficient to operate.</p>

I do not know what the symbol is for 150th anniversaries, but perhaps in the case of the PAC it should be a magnifying glass. I have been looking at the records of some old debates. I found one from 102 years ago, in which it emerged that the Admiralty had spent nearly &#163;500,000 without having signed a contract to do so. It seems that some things never change, despite all our best efforts. All of us who have been involved are proud of the way in which the PAC is constituted and does its job for Parliament. It provides an invaluable service to all of us, and I wish it a happy anniversary and many more years.</p>

 I thank the Exchequer Secretary for her kind words to the Committee. I thank all those who have taken part in the debate, especially the right hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams), the Father of the House, who is a stalwart member of the Committee. I also thank him for laying to rest the canard that we are somehow trying to compromise the editorial independence of the BBC. There is no question of our trying to do that.</p>

I also thank the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), who brings a lot of life to our Committee. He made a fair point about civil servants. Certainly, in my brief inglorious career as a Minister I never encountered a compliant civil servant. It was more a question of &#147;No, Minister&#148; than &#147;Yes, Minister&#148;. There is a serious point, however. We saw with the Rural Payments Agency saga that while the permanent secretary, Sir Brian Bender, had a close and continuing relationship with the Secretary of State, the project director did not. It is a question of officers and men, I think. Many project directors have a tenuous link with Ministers, and that is something that we need to address.</p>

We have gone back to the point again and again in these debates, but it needs underlining. For instance, for the Bowman project&#151;a huge Ministry of Defence project&#151;there was no senior responsible owner.</p>

As we saw with the NHS IT project, we often publish our report only for the Department to say that it has dealt with the problem. That is because we have shot ourselves in the foot, because our report has been so long delayed after the initial NAO report. I am trying to put pressure on  <br>

the otherwise excellent NAO to try to speed up the process. It is because it is so careful that the process can take so long, but I want to see clearance speeded up. I say to Ministers and civil servants who read the report of this debate that there are often long delays between the NAO team finishing its investigation and its being allowed to publish its report. I want to see the process brought right up to the PAC hearing, so that we get up-to-date information. After the hearing, the NAO should write the draft report much more quickly, so that we can publish it. The whole process should be completed within three months, if possible, so that on the day that the PAC publishes its report we do not get the response from Ministers, as we frequently do, &#147;Well, it&#146;s a very interesting report, but we&#146;ve dealt with all those points.&#148; I am grateful to my hon.

He reminded us that we are now committed to sharing the proceeds of growth. As a loyal member of the Conservative party, I accept that mantra, which has been put forward by our Front Benchers. It is not for me, as the Chairman of the PAC, to get involved in that debate now, but I am entitled to make the point that just a 2 per cent. efficiency saving every year would deliver &#163;8 billion either for tax cuts or for more spending on essential public services. Our work is, therefore, right at the centre of the debate.</p>

Mr. Alan Beith (Berwick-upon-Tweed) (LD): This debate is about school building and reorganisation in the Berwick-upon-Tweed constituency, which is a large one, covering more than 1,000 square miles, in an enormous county with a small population. Some of the schools are within a few miles of Ashington, such as Lynemouth, Ellington and Linton; others, such as Cambo, are not far from Newcastle airport and others are closer to Edinburgh than to Tyneside, including those in Berwick-upon-Tweed, and are the northernmost schools in England in the Minister&#146;s jurisdiction. I am glad that the Minister for Schools and Learners, the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight), who takes an interest in our problems in Northumberland, is in the Chamber to answer the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="71023-0018.htm_para18"><a name="07102367000036">The size of the area means that it is expensive to provide education there. A larger number of schools, including many village first schools, is needed because of the travel distances involved. Transport costs are high and statutory transport requirements take a significant slice of the budget, even though the county now charges pupils aged over 16 heavily; it costs them &#163;360 to travel to school or college&#151;an issue I have raised on other occasions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="71023-0018.htm_para19"><a name="07102367000037">However, to deal with such expensive requirements Northumberland receives less money than most other authorities; only four authorities in England have less funding per pupil. In the current year, Northumberland has &#163;3,552 per pupil against the England average of &#163;3,888. Of course, some areas are well above that average, but in Northumberland the costs and pressures are high. On the other side of the border, funding is hugely better in Scotland, which is particularly apparent to my constituents given where they live.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="71023-0018.htm_para20"><a name="07102367000038">An added problem&#151;not on the same scale but worrying none the less&#151;arises from the Government&#146;s plans, announced earlier this year, to take so-called surplus cash from schools. The amount could be as much as &#163;225 million over the whole country, some of which may already have been spent, because nowadays schools need to conserve money in their budgets for repairs and other commitments, or save money one year for a new project in the following year. The policy is based on assumptions that are not well founded and it could be damaging.</p>

built ones and when refurbished some of them are very good. Many of the schools were built just after the Education Act 1944. Some date from the 1950s and a lot from the 1960s&#151;they are generally the worst, as some were deliberately built with only a 25-year life span and have been patched together since.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="71023-0018.htm_para24"><a name="07102367000042">The then Chancellor made his promise about secondary schools, although for many purposes middle schools count as secondary schools, too. However, I shall concentrate on two high schools. Coquet school in Amble is the most recently built of our high schools and the only one that was built for the age group it serves&#151;the three-tier system to which I shall refer in more detail. Although the school has some problems, they do not compare with those at the other high schools in my constituency, at Berwick and Alnwick.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="71023-0018.htm_para25"><a name="07102367000043">Most of the buildings at Berwick community high school are old and outdated, although some are more recent. They were built for a style of teaching that is no longer practised. The teaching approach was very different 50 years ago and was based on children sitting in rows, facing the front. The school had serious, unexpected problems with its boiler, which is exactly why schools need reserves in their budget. The buildings are not compliant with the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 and some of them cannot be made so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="71023-0018.htm_para26"><a name="07102367000044">The state of the buildings is shown in sharp relief when we look just a few miles away to Duns and Eyemouth where &#163;50 million to &#163;75 million has been spent on new schools. No parent from Berwick can send their children to those schools, because they are on the other side of the border which, educationally, is something of an iron curtain. There are very few ways to cross the border educationally, but my constituents look over it and see heavy spending on the schools on the other side that their schools do not share.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="71023-0018.htm_para27"><a name="07102367000045">The worst problems for high schools are faced by the Duchess&#146;s community high school in Alnwick where the main buildings are old and declining. They have passed the end of their useful life and there is a severe capacity problem. The school was built for 900 pupils, but now has 1,150 on a split site. The dining hall seats only 200 children, but more than 1,000 children have to use it during the lunch break. That means that there are numerous sittings and that pupils have to be pushed out quickly so that the next lot can get in. That is an impossible situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="71023-0018.htm_para28"><a name="07102367000046">According to the fire certificate, the assembly hall can fit only 300 pupils, but that is not even enough to hold the sixth form for sixth-form assemblies. I am very familiar with the room, because on most of the occasions on which I have been elected to the House the votes have been counted in the high school hall. That happened in my very first election, but even the elections have now moved on. They now take place in the much more spacious, comfortable and attractive leisure centre on the other side of town. However, the school is still condemned to use its very constricted hall. There are only eight science labs for 13 science staff; 13 mobile classrooms in a state of disrepair; and heating problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="71023-0018.htm_para29"><a name="07102367000047">Then we have the problems of the Bailiffgate site, which is an old building some distance away from the main school. Getting to it involves crossing a road, and it is on four floors with narrow staircases. It is essentially an old domestic property across the road  <br>

from Alnwick castle, and it does not have sound-proofed music rooms. Despite the quality of the musical effort at the Duchess&#146;s high school, that is not always appreciated by people trying to do other work in the same building. It is impossible for the building to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act and timetables have to be rewritten to accommodate pupils with mobility problems so that they can stay on the ground floor. We certainly cannot get 21st century best practice for learning environments given the constraints of the buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="71023-0018.htm_para30"><a name="07102367000048">It is impossible to make any progress in reducing the carbon cost of the school. It still uses a coal-fired boiler and the buildings are very draughty. Because of the use of a split site, one hour per pupil teaching time is lost every week because of movement between the sites. The school has been made as safe as it can be, but there are still serious issues of safety.</p>

I expect some positive features in the report, but I will be equally surprised if the report does not contain condemnation of the school&#146;s buildings and an indication that they are just not fit for purpose. Parents are very exercised by the problem. A recent parents&#146; questionnaire attracted 400 replies and by far and away the main concern expressed was about the buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para2"><a name="07102367000052">As if those problems were not enough, Northumberland is attempting a massive schools reorganisation&#151;from a three-tier to a two-tier system. We have middle schools for nine to 13-year-olds, first schools for five to nine-year-olds, and high schools for 13 to 18-year-olds. The system dates from when the county went comprehensive in stages from the 1970s and it was chosen partly because the most modern buildings that the county had at that time were the secondary modern and technical schools that were built in the aftermath of the Education Act 1944. The reorganisation was largely designed to fit the buildings, but of course those buildings are now very old. The county wants to change things partly to address the sheer number of schools, and the surplus places problem, but the change is controversial and gives rise to a great deal of concern. Educationally, however, the county has another motive. Northumberland is in the top 5 per cent. for key stage 1, but is only average for key stage 2. Pupils transfer in the middle of key stage 2 and again in the middle of key stage 3. That is a system that very few authorities now use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para3"><a name="07102367000053">Strong arguments are advanced against the change from three to two tiers. The proposal is particular controversial in rural areas where the middle school is the only school within quite a large area. If middle schools cease to take nine to 13-year-olds, children would be completely outside their rural area from the age of 11. The issue applies to the middle schools in  <br>

Wooler, Rothbury, Belford, and Seahouses, and to other parts of Northumberland outside my constituency, such as Bellingham and Allendale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para4"><a name="07102367000054">Many parents and teachers in all kinds of areas think that middle schools have positive value. Both my children went through the system, and middle school was a particularly happy time for them. It is a time in which children acquire more responsibility, and they feel that they are taking a responsible role as they get to the top of the school. That has to be balanced against some of the problems arising from transfer at that age, and the short time that pupils then have in which to prepare for GCSE.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para5"><a name="07102367000055">Whatever view one takes of the reorganisation, it will clearly be difficult to achieve unless there is capital for school building. Indeed, we must question whether it can be done at all, even through the phased approach that the county is taking, without substantial extra resources. It will cost money, and it means a lot of school building. Obviously, it is intended that some of the school building will be funded through property deals&#151;by the release of sites. However, the reorganisation should not be shaped by the saleability of sites. That process cannot fund more than a part of what will be required, and it would be distorting if the pattern of reorganisation came to depend on which sites could be sold to release money for new schools to be built.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para6"><a name="07102367000056">Against that background, the county&#146;s hope lay in the Building Schools for the Future programme, yet at every stage Northumberland found itself at the back of the queue. It is currently in wave 13 of that programme. Why? That is what I keep asking. The Minister came to a meeting that we held in Woodhorn. There were many interesting people round the table&#151;people from the schools, including pupils, and people from the authority. They asked him a lot of questions, and the questions that we keep asking him is, how does that decision come about? What is wrong? Is the Department making the wrong assessments, or is there something wrong with the bids that Northumberland puts forward?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para7"><a name="07102367000057">If you apply for a job these days, Madam Deputy Speaker, you expect to get some feedback if you do not get the job. I am not suggesting that you are applying for any jobs yourself, but you will know of the process. When people bid for a lottery grant or something like that, best practice now is to give them feedback to tell them in what ways their bid was on the wrong lines, or how they can improve it so that they stand a better chance in future. I do not think that Northumberland has ever had that. I have asked repeatedly for that to be done, so that we can have some understanding of why an authority with such obvious needs is constantly at the back of the queue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para8"><a name="07102367000058">The result is that Northumberland has had to fund school developments without BSF help. It has committed nearly &#163;28 million to the reorganisation in the Cramlington area, and &#163;26.5 million towards the &#163;54 million programme in Blyth. Incidentally, both of those projects are outside my constituency. All of that heavy capital expenditure is going to the south-east of the county, and not to any part of the area that I have described in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para9"><a name="07102367000059">The county has looked into whether academies provide a route. It has followed that route, very controversially, in Ashington and Blyth. In both places, there are huge local arguments about whether the county should be doing that at all. The issue is not just  <br>

about the principle of academies, but about what the effect will be on schools that the authority has already provided in those areas. However, those are not the problems for tonight. Alnwick, which the county was interested in as a site for an academy, did not meet the criteria, despite having a highly deprived ward directly adjoining the current site of the Duchess&#146;s community high school. The academy project went to Ashington and not to Alnwick.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para10"><a name="07102367000060">Given the fact that the academy route has not worked and that Building Schools for the Future has not worked for Northumberland, how is the Government&#146;s declared objective and the Prime Minister&#146;s declared objective of rebuilding and refurbishing all secondary schools to be realised in my constituency? I ask the Minister to consider some of the things that he might do. The first is to be ready to support Northumberland over the replacement of the Duchess&#146;s school in Alnwick. There are many people in Alnwick who say to me, &#147;When is the Schools Minister going to come up and visit Alnwick? He said that he would do so, to come and look at the Duchess&#146;s school.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para11"><a name="07102367000061">People have pinned a great deal of hope and responsibility on the Minister, and he should do what he can to assist and support Northumberland in dealing with an urgent problem, the replacement of the Duchess&#146;s high school. A lot of negotiation has been going on, particularly with the castle estates, which are the principal landowners in the area, but it remains a difficult process for which significant capital funding will have to be found. I want the Minister to take a personal interest in that, as he has already indicated willingness to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para12"><a name="07102367000062">I pose the question, not out of particular enthusiasm for such a scheme, whether the academy route might be explored for Berwick, bearing in mind a number of special circumstances there. There are deprived wards directly adjoining the location of the school, which are among the 10 per cent. of wards with the highest degree of deprivation. Berwick is also a special case because of its rural character and the area that it serves. It is a special case because there is no parental choice in Berwick, and there is no prospect of parental choice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para13"><a name="07102367000063">The only parental choice is for those who can afford to send their children to the one private school in the area, Longridge Towers. There is no parental choice within the state sector because the nearest school to which parents are allowed to send their child is in Alnwick, 30 miles away. I have just explained what difficulties are faced there. There is no other school. The schools that are 8 miles and 12 miles away are in Scotland, and the border is an absolute barrier. The Scottish system is different, with transfer at a different age. That, too, makes Berwick a special case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para14"><a name="07102367000064">There are opportunities to involve further and higher education in Berwick, which are seriously underprovided there. Getting anyone to undertake further education in Berwick is extremely difficult. Huge travel is involved. We have had major arguments about the denial of rail travel for the long, long journey to Newcastle. Edinburgh is nearer, but that is excluded for most purposes by the border. There are real possibilities with Northumbria university and other  <br>

potential providers. There are even possibilities of co-operation with the private sector in education, which make Berwick a potential special case. It is worth considering whether the academy route is possible for Berwick, despite it not obviously fitting the criteria that have been applied in some other places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para15"><a name="07102367000065">I should like the Minister to look carefully at slippage in the Building Schools for the Future programme. We know that there has been significant slippage. Indeed, the Department&#146;s memorandum to the Education and Skills Committee in its report on sustainable schools stated:</p>
<a name="71023-0019.htm_brev1"><a name="07102367000107"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There has been significant slippage in BSF projects in waves 1-3, with the majority of projects behind the ideal project timelines.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para16"><a name="07102367000066">The memo went on to identify some of the problems that authorities encountered, many of which are problems that Northumberland knows how to deal with. Northumberland could meet many of the requirements and has already shown its ability to do so and its willingness to commit its own resources to seeing through major projects. I should like the Minister to consider a bid from Northumberland to use what I refer to as slippage money&#151;money that it is not currently possible to spend on some of the planned schemes&#151;to deliver in earlier waves of Building Schools for the Future. Northumberland could act and could deliver.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para17"><a name="07102367000067">I have repeatedly made the request that the Minister talk to his colleagues in the Department for Communities and Local Government about the funding formula. The Chancellor says that he is making more money available for education than was previously proposed. Unless something is done, all that will do is ratchet things upwards while preserving the huge inequality between Northumberland and many other parts of the country. I would like the Minister to pass on to his colleagues at the Department for Communities and Local Government, to whom we also make the same points, that the funding formula when applied to education seems to have particularly unjust effects in Northumberland and makes it difficult for the county to meet its obligations on so difficult an issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para18"><a name="07102367000068">In 2006, the Prime Minister, then Chancellor, spoke in his Budget statement about raising investment in state schools so that instead of it being &#163;5,000 per pupil, it went up to the &#163;8,000-per-pupil average of the private sector. I do not think that we are anywhere near that figure; I am not sure how the calculations are made, but I am sure that we are short of it. Again, mechanisms will have to be used to overcome the difficulties that I have described if the Prime Minister&#146;s declared objective is to be achieved in the constituency of Berwick-upon-Tweed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para19"><a name="07102367000069">I have laid out the problems that arise from Northumberland&#146;s character and size, the issues of reorganisation and the age of its schools. I have suggested things that the Minister can do to support the moves to replace the Duchess&#146;s community high school in Alnwick and to consider how to get not only a new high school but a much broader range of education provision in Berwick. I have also suggested that slippage in the Building Schools for the Future programme might present an opportunity and that the funding formula should be considered again. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

 I congratulate the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) on securing this debate and on the excellent way in which he put forward his argument&#151;not quite as excellent as Arsenal&#146;s 7-0 victory this evening at the Emirates stadium, but almost as good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para20"><a name="07102367000071">As the right hon. Gentleman said, I had the pleasure of visiting his constituency 12 months ago. I enjoyed the meeting at Woodhorn and remember hearing from his constituents&#151;those from Alnwick in particular&#151;a rehearsal of the debate around reorganisation, which I observed with interest, but in a slightly detached way given that reorganisation issues are for the local authority, not me, to determine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para21"><a name="07102367000072">I accord with the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s analysis of the two-tier and three-tier systems; there are merits in both. My daughter was educated in the middle-school system and my son largely in the two-tier system, and I am proud of both their educational achievements. Both systems can work well. On my visit, I saw some of the excellent work done in the region of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency and his great concern for the standards of education there and in the north-east in general.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para22"><a name="07102367000073">The Government have made a commitment to creating school buildings fit for 21st century teaching and learning. Given the shoddy state of schools that we inherited, that was more akin to climbing up a mountain than strolling gently up a hill. However, the scale of the challenge means that we can be rightly proud to be delivering on it. We made that bold commitment because we want to provide a genuine opportunity for every child, overcoming attainment gaps and eradicating child poverty, ensuring that outcomes are determined by talent and hard work, and building a fair society and a culture that celebrates success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para23"><a name="07102367000074">We also made the commitment because we want every pupil to get a personalised education, responsive to their individual needs and supportive of their individual talents. We want to give each child the best possible start in life by giving them the skills that they need to thrive in the modern world, to live happy and successful lives and to fulfil their potential. A good education depends on many things: teachers, parents, standards and discipline. We need to improve all of those&#151;and we are improving them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para24"><a name="07102367000075">However, well designed buildings, and good facilities where young people can learn and grow, are a vital foundation, so I understand the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s frustration as he waits. A well designed school can make a difference in simple but vital ways, as well as providing the right facilities for teaching and learning: imaginatively designed dining halls&#151;hopefully larger than those he described&#151;can encourage healthy eating; wider corridors can cut bullying; and classrooms with natural lighting and fresh air can help pupils&#146; concentration and behaviour. Dark, dingy and decrepit buildings need to be condemned to the past, where they belong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para25"><a name="07102367000076">Over the past 10 years, we have increased investment year by year, and we are seeing the fruits of that investment in the transformation of school buildings  <br>

across the country. The shoddy, make-do buildings that we inherited are now, in so many places, a thing of the past. Over the past 10 years, we have built more than 1,100 schools and a further 27,000 new or improved classrooms, as well as 6,600 new or improved laboratories. A total of 2,450 schools have better sports facilities and 2,300 have new or improved kitchens. In the Berwick-upon-Tweed area of Northumberland, about a dozen kitchens and serveries have been refurbished in recent years, and two new science labs have been built, as well as a new assembly hall and a whole new school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para26"><a name="07102367000077">However, the scale of the task has meant that we have not been able to do everything at once. This is as true for Governments as it is for local authorities. We have made a start. We have struck a balance between ensuring that every school has some investment and tackling the worst school buildings. For instance, there are now no schools that have to rely on outside toilets. In our major strategic programmes, such as &#147;Building Schools for the Future&#148;, we have concentrated on those who most need it as determined by levels of deprivation and educational attainment. I am sorry if the right hon. Gentleman does not feel that he has had proper feedback, but that was the foundation of the assessment that we made and the basis on which we asked local authorities to make applications for &#147;Building Schools for the Future&#148;. If his constituents need an explanation as to why certain areas have been allocated on a certain basis, it is the combination of our priority in respect of levels of deprivation and educational attainment and how local authorities have then responded to those priorities in their applications.</p>

 The other piece of the jigsaw that I should mention is that there needs to be sufficient scale to construct a cost-effective procurement model. Without knowing the exact detail of the situation in Northumberland, it may be that it could do it in two waves rather than one. The procurement model would have to be got right. Some of the larger authorities can do it in several stages and some of their waves have been split accordingly, with some earlier and some later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para27"><a name="07102367000080">We are now moving ahead. Over the next 15 years or so, we aim to rebuild or refurbish all secondary schools and at least half of all primary schools. Earlier this month, I announced &#163;21.9 billion of capital investment allocations to local authorities to raise standards with state-of-the-art arts, sports and information and communications technology facilities. Our capital investment will mean that by the end of this latest spending period, there will have been a sevenfold increase in investment in real terms since 1997. We will shortly make a revenue allocation announcement.</p>

retrospective nature of some of the proposals that we consulted on, and I would like to provide some certainty on that as quickly as I possibly can, because I know that it is causing concern to schools throughout the country. I have some sympathy in respect of revenue, which is not really the subject of this debate, because I represent a Dorset constituency which also does not have one of the best-funded authorities in the country. Although we will not be able to put everything right in one fell swoop, I hope that we will be able to make some progress when we make the revenue announcement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para29"><a name="07102367000082">As part of our capital funding, we are kick-starting the primary capital programme to rebuild or refurbish half the primary schools in England, with &#163;1.9 billion over the next three years, and we are putting another &#163;9.3 billion into &#147;Building Schools for the Future&#148;, including academies, to revamp secondary schools. By 2011, 200 new, rebuilt or revamped secondary schools will be opening every year. We are continuing to strike a balance to make substantial funding available for councils not yet in the &#147;Building Schools for the Future&#148; programme, such as Northumberland, for special educational needs pupils and for 14 to 19 diplomas, providing more money for school kitchens, and with &#163;3 billion devolved straight to schools and over &#163;4.5 billion devolved to councils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para30"><a name="07102367000083">We will continue to provide funding direct to every school to spend on buildings and ICT as they see fit. Schools that have not yet been modernised will receive a higher rate, with modernised schools receiving a standard rate, which means that the Berwick high school in the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency will receive funding at the higher rate. I am advised that it will get &#163;90,000 and that the Duchess&#146;s community school that he talked about will receive &#163;126,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para31"><a name="07102367000084">How the funding devolved to local authorities is invested is for each local authority to determine, not for us sitting in Whitehall. We have given local authorities centre stage with new powers and duties so that they can be the strategic leaders of education in their area and the champions of parents and pupils because they know best what is most needed in their regions and who can best deliver that service. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman is continuing to lobby his friends at county hall. We will look to local authorities to focus on the key priorities, to raise standards in the classroom and to ensure that all children have the opportunity to reach their full potential, because that is what most concerns parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="71023-0019.htm_para32"><a name="07102367000085">Northumberland will receive its share of funding, with &#163;65 million allocated for capital over the three-year period, including more than &#163;8 million for the primary capital programme. That comes on top of the &#163;41 million that Northumberland received in the last spending review period. It is worth noting the 50 per cent. increase in funding that the county has been allocated over the spending period. In 2010-11 alone, Northumberland will receive &#163;27 million, which compares to just over &#163;3 million that it received in 1996-97. How all that money is invested is a matter of local decision making to support both local and national priorities. As I have said before, even with the amount of money in question, sometimes difficult choices will still have to be made.</p>

At the moment it does not technically meet the criteria for consideration as an academy, as he said. However, given the rural nature of its catchment area, its isolation from other schools, and the points he has raised, if a scheme is put forward with a sponsor and so on, I will look as sympathetically as I can within the constraints I am under to see whether we can extend support to it.</p>

Perhaps there is a combination of capital receipts that the council can realise in the medium term that it can then invest in resolving some of the issues. I will take an interest in the matter&#151;the right hon. Gentleman consistently raises it with me. I still intend to visit Northumberland again during the next few months. I have not decided on the final programme because all sorts of people want me to visit all sorts of things, but I will not forget that I made a commitment to visit the Duchess&#146;s school, and if I possibly can, I will do so when I am in the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="71023-0020.htm_para3"><a name="07102367000089">We have already announced that all authorities with projects in wave 7 onwards will be given the opportunity to revise their expression of interest in inclusion in the programme. That may include the way in which they group their schools. Earlier, I talked about the waves and whether it is possible for regrouping to be done in four or five waves that would deal more acutely with the sorts of things that have been described. We aim shortly to consult on the process and on proposals for the management of the later stages of the programme. That will be informed by the lessons learned from the early waves to ensure that the programme delivers to plan, avoiding the sort of slippage that the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, and benefits all authorities. It will come as no surprise that the key criterion that emerges from the later waves is authorities&#146; readiness to deliver.</p>

I would certainly encourage all authorities to do so and encourage the right hon. Gentleman to continue his discussion with Northumberland. I do not doubt that Northumberland can make a strong case. Indeed, I am advised that it is keen to re-present its case on Building Schools for the Future.</p>

Indeed, I hope that the process will allow us quickly to allocate any future slippage to new areas. However, we naturally anticipate that if local authorities, contractors and the Government learn from our experience, any slippage will be minimised if not negligible.</p>
