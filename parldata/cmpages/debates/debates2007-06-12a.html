 Public expenditure in Scotland is &#163;8,414 per head, yet in the east midlands it is a quarter less at &#163;6,334. In Wellingborough, a secondary school has been demolished, there have been cuts in the police force and we do not have a local hospital. Why should the population of Wellingborough and the rest of the east midlands subsidise the population of Scotland by the massive amount of &#163;2,080 a year? What is the justification for that huge difference in public expenditure?</p>

 In every constituency, in every part of every region and nation of this country, there has been a massive increase in public services: more schools, more doctors, more nurses. As it happens, investment in public spending in Scotland has increased in the past five years by 18 per cent., but in England it increased by 21 per cent., so there are higher rates of increase in England. As the hon. Gentleman has brought it up, I should point out that in his area there are 420 more teachers than in 1998, 163 more police officers and 62 police community support officers. In his NHS area, there are 6,886 more nurses, 725 more consultants, 353 more GPs and 548 more dentists&#151;all on account of strong economic management by the Government&#151;</p>

 It is only right to point out that my right hon. Friend has done more to advance the cause of disabled children than almost any other Member of the House, and much tribute is due to him. He is right to point out that as part of the comprehensive spending review settlement for the Department for Education and Skills in England money additional to that agreed with the Barnett consequentials at the time has been made available. His point underlines the fact that because of the strong economic performance of the United Kingdom over the past 10 years significant sums of additional money are going to education and health in Scotland, as they are throughout the rest of the UK. Obviously, it is for each of the devolved Administrations to decide how to spend the money made available to them, but my right hon.

United Kingdom needs a united Parliament. The argument that Members on the Opposition Benches sometimes articulate&#151;that somehow there is a great oppression of England by Scottish MPs&#151;ignores the fact that more than 80 per cent. of the House is not composed of Scottish MPs.

 We have just heard the Secretary of State say that notwithstanding the fact that two out of three voters voted to continue the Union, we face a perverse situation in which the party in government in Scotland is determined to push for independence. The Under-Secretary of State will recently have heard many of his Labour colleagues call for a return to the first past the post system, so will he instigate a review and consider returning to a simple, clear method of electing Members of the Scottish Parliament, namely the system that we have here&#151;first past the post?</p>

 We set up an independent commission, led by Sir John Arbuthnott, to consider the consequences of having different electoral systems in Scotland. He and his commission looked into the matter and came back with the recommendation that we should not move back to first past the post, or move to the single transferable vote system right across Scotland, but that we should keep the current system as it is. It is a reflection of the fact that during the Scottish Constitutional Convention, there was an attempt to reach consensus. Perhaps if the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party had taken part in the Constitutional Convention, it might have been able to make the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comment at the time. We have a system and it has produced a result that we openly acknowledge: it has given the Scottish National party a one-seat advantage, but it should not think that it has any mandate whatever to break up the United Kingdom. That would be going against the clear wishes of the vast majority of the people of Scotland.</p>

 As the Secretary of State knows, in 1981, my right hon.

This year, under a Labour Government, the scheme has collapsed, scores of people have lost their jobs and tens of thousands of tenants have been left in the lurch, with no new homes to which to move and no scheme in place to offer support. After the incompetent introduction of home information packs and penal stamp duty, which have made it much more difficult for home owners to move, the Government have now made it much more difficult for social tenants to move.

As I have already said to the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young), far more moves took place under mutually agreed exchanges than any national mobility scheme ever produced. Clearly, the performance of the new scheme was unsatisfactory and I regret that. We must now work urgently to try to develop a choice-based lettings scheme, which is a preferable method of encouraging mobility, especially because most local authority tenants want to move in their area and fairly close to home&#151;perhaps for child care support or employment reasons&#151;and we must then work quickly to expand that scheme so that people have the opportunity to move across the country.</p>

Gentleman knows that the number of social sector homes has increased by 50 per cent. in the past two years. It is my priority and that of my Department in the comprehensive spending review to put new-build social housing at the top of our list. We must do more&#151;he is right to acknowledge that. However, as he rightly says, it is a matter of increasing the supply of new housing, affordable housing and social homes.</p>

 Is the Secretary of State aware that 80 per cent. of the population in my constituency have no chance of buying into the private sector and that the only hope of those who are in overcrowded council accommodation is mobility within the borough or nearby? Yet in London, the chronic shortage of council housing means that it is impossible for many families who live in grossly overcrowded accommodation, with teenagers growing up three or four to a room, to have any chance of getting somewhere decent to live. Will the Government please invest a lot of money quickly in building council houses for rent for people in desperate housing need?</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to a real issue.

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. An accreditation system was set up to support those who already had a lot of experience and might have needed only a little updating in order to become accredited.

We all need to recognise that we need to build more homes for the next generation. We are not building enough at the moment.

 We are currently consulting on proposed changes to permitted development rights for householders. Developments with no impact beyond the host property would be permitted, and clear limits on size and siting would set out what was allowed. It is estimated that the number of householder planning applications would be reduced by about 85,000.</p>

 This is a twofold protection. It not only strengthens the rights of other householders to object, but it strengthens the right of the individual householder to know exactly what is permitted. It is like the old volume allowance, but with clear guidelines. As I have said, we expect the number of planning applications to fall by about 85,000, and that in itself would help to speed up the planning system.</p>

 Elsewhere in Europe, local authorities have been able to speed up the planning application process while also speeding up the process of change to a renewable and sustainable energy agenda, because they are allowed to set clear terms and requirements for collection and recycling of water and the incorporation of energy-generating systems in any planning developments. Is the Minister contemplating adopting the same system across the board in the United Kingdom, so that all local authorities can be clear about the change agenda?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a valid point, and we are consulting on making microgeneration much easier for individual households on smaller scale developments. We have to get a balance between ensuring local flexibility and allowing every single local authority to do something completely different, which could then hamper progress towards developing greater take-up of new technologies. It is important, at the same time, that we have a degree of flexibility for local authorities. The key is to ensure that we move as quickly as possible to increasing microgeneration.</p>

public interest; and it will extend the range of bodies covered by freedom of information legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="70612-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07061261000185">It is, of course, true that the ministerial veto has never been exercised. Members might consider that to be a reason for maintaining it, as Ministers have shown considerable self-restraint in not exercising it. I prefer the contrary argument: if it has not been used, it is because the safeguards work and there is no need for a veto. Furthermore, the fact that the veto has not been used does not mean that Ministers are not actively considering using it. In a letter to Lord Falconer, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said he wanted to</p>
<a name="70612-0004.htm_brev3"><a name="07061261000353"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;guard more effectively against the incremental harm to the policy development process that must inevitably arise from the disclosure of individually innocuous submissions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="70612-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07061261000186">It is not clear to me exactly how individually innocuous submissions become lethal when accumulated. The Secretary of State went on to bemoan the</p>
<a name="70612-0004.htm_brev4"><a name="07061261000354"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;discernible trend within the Information Tribunal that decisions on the public interest test have not been falling in the government&#146;s favour in key cases.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="70612-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07061261000187">Most Members will agree that that is good news. However, in response to the tribunal&#146;s failing, the Secretary of State is considering exercising the Cabinet Minister veto to annul those decisions. Clearly, therefore, one senior Minister is considering exercising the veto.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="70612-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07061261000188">As a consequence of yesterday&#146;s information tribunal decision that the Deputy Prime Minister must hand over documents relating to Vauxhall towers&#151;a development that the local council and UNESCO opposed&#151;the right hon. Gentleman might also be considering use of the veto. We need to get rid of the veto before Ministers develop a taste for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="70612-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07061261000189">I shall now turn to the subject of time limits within which public authorities must respond to public interest freedom of information requests. In 2006, there were 1,326 requests to central Government Departments, and extensions were taken beyond the 20 working day period in order to consider whether information should be disclosed on public interest grounds. That is allowed as public authorities can use whatever time is &#147;reasonable in the circumstances&#148; to consider the Act&#146;s public interest test. Figures from a Ministry of Justice publication show that 211 of those extensions were for between 21 and 30 days, 125 were for between 31 and 40 days, and 370 were for more than 40 days&#151;although for how much longer than 40 days is not known.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="70612-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07061261000190">If my Bill is passed, all such requests&#151;totalling more than 700 in that year&#151;will receive a response in less than 40 days. Departments such as the Home Office&#151;which set a new record of 18 months for tardiness in answering a Freedom of Information Act request&#151;would no longer be able to use delaying tactics to postpone the release of embarrassing information. Ben Leapman, <i> The Sunday Telegraph </i>home affairs correspondent, is familiar with that tactic. He sought information relating to the Soham murderer, Ian Huntley, and security lapses at Woodhill prison, and he had to wait I8 months for a response to the request. The reason for the delay was simple: the Home Office&#146;s desire to hold back sensitive&#151;in other words, damaging&#151;information. My Bill would stop freedom of information requests being kicked into the long grass.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="70612-0004.htm_para15"><a name="07061261000191">Finally, the Bill proposes an extension to the definition of public authorities to include school academies and private contractors. When individual Members of Parliament draft legislation&#151;albeit in this case ably supported by Maurice Frankel of the Campaign for Freedom of Information&#151;the Government can often point to technical flaws in the Bill. However, this Bill highlights the need for a debate about what constitutes public authorities. It is clear in my mind that academies are public authorities. The total capital costs of building 200 academies will be around &#163;5 billion. The 27 opened so far received revenue funding of between &#163;2 million and nearly &#163;9 million in 2005-06. They are funded overwhelmingly from public sources. They teach our children, employ teachers mainly trained in UK institutions and they are monitored by Ofsted: there can be no argument about whether they should be covered by freedom of information legislation; they must be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="70612-0004.htm_para16"><a name="07061261000192">The argument about private contractors doing work for public authorities is less clear cut. The Secretary of State does of course have the power to designate private contractors under section 5 of the Act, but has not chosen to do so. This Bill does not seek to include all private contractors working for a public authority within the scope of freedom of information legislation. The self-employed painter and decorator who does occasional painting and decorating jobs for the council should of course not be covered by FOI legislation. The definition in this Bill of a relevant contract&#151;one whose value exceeds &#163;1 million and extends for a period of more than 12 months&#151;would ensure that he was not covered by it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="70612-0004.htm_para17"><a name="07061261000193">However, what about Capita and the other huge firms to whom local authorities and central Government outsource large chunks of their business? They provide services for some local authorities and Government Departments that, for other areas and Departments, the public authority provides. They are, in effect, quasi public authorities. They must not be allowed to avoid the scrutiny provided by FOI legislation. They must be covered by the same rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="70612-0004.htm_para23"><a name="07061261000200">I turn first to a point that we must collectively understand. Members will know that this Bill has already been through the other place and, as ever, in most regards it is all the better for the scrutiny there. I accept that the Home Office has introduced a relatively large number of legislative measures over the last 10 years, and I do not doubt that that issue will be referred to again today. Legislating, as people know, is not governing, and the Home Office cannot and should not be a legislative sausage machine. So the first question that I ask, as a Minister, is, &#147;Does the Bill in question add to our fight against crime?&#148; In this case the answer must be and surely is a profound yes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="70612-0004.htm_para24"><a name="07061261000201">What does this Bill do? It provides a flexible new tool for law enforcement to use in preventing the serious harm caused by criminals, before it can have an impact on individuals and communities. It will improve the sharing of data across the public and private sectors for the purposes of detecting and preventing fraud. It takes forward much of the work done by the Law Commission in plugging the hole in the criminal law on encouraging and assisting crime. It will also enable us to improve the way in which we take away the profits made through the suffering of others through serious crime. The Bill also takes forward the Government&#146;s proposals in last year&#146;s Green Paper and has already been rigorously scrutinised in the other place. The result is a Bill that delivers what I am sure all of us want, and what all those we represent need. The Government introduced amendments to address concerns expressed in the other place and these have improved the Bill. I am grateful to Opposition Front Benchers for the constructive way in which their parties approached the provisions in the Bill, introduced into the other place.</p>

Someone who brings heroin on to our streets must be caught quickly, brought to justice effectively and punished appropriately. However, is it not better to ensure that the heroin does not hit the streets, with the attendant harm, in the first place?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="70612-0005.htm_para2"><a name="07061261000206">Clause 1 creates such a tool in serious crime prevention orders.

 Everyone wants to deal with heroin dealers effectively. Is the Minister aware that only two people were given the maximum sentence for dealing in class A drugs, according to the last figures I received about a year ago? Does not he agree that before he introduces new legislation he should use the legislation we already have more effectively to put those people behind bars, where they belong?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will know, because he is an astute Member, that we are talking about subsequent legislation. He makes his usual sweeping assertions, which I accept for the sake of convenience, and I agree that all the powers that we have on the statute book should be used to their fullest extent, but I do not accept his starting premise. It is right and proper to consider any gaps in the legislation alongside the proper utilisation of existing statute. The fact that some of the existing provision is not used as fully or extensively as it might be does not preclude the proper introduction of new legislation where appropriate.</p>

 The Minister mentions heroin reaching our streets. Given that the Serious Organised Crime Agency has prime responsibility for UK drug seizures&#151;there are concerns about its performance in that regard&#151;is now the time to transfer the responsibilities of the Assets Recovery Agency to SOCA, which is struggling with its core responsibilities? There is also widespread concern about SOCA&#146;s accountability. Only last month, Lord Justice Sedley described it as</p>

 Absolutely not. I am tempted to apologise to the House for introducing the issue of heroin, which does not figure in the Bill. I take issue with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s assertion that somehow SOCA is struggling with its core duties. That is not the case at all. It is barely a year old and it goes from strength to strength. It is doing fine work. All the elements in the Bill that put the ARA with SOCA were welcomed in the other place. It is in all our interests to ensure that SOCA and the ARA work collectively in the fulfilment of their core activities.</p>

 We all want effective action against serious crime, but I am rather puzzled by how the Government define that. Why is fishing for salmon with a &#147;prohibited&#148; instrument to be regarded as a serious crime? Will the provision extend to someone poaching farmed salmon? What is the rationale behind it?</p>

 The offence merits inclusion as a serious crime under certain circumstances. Neither I nor any other Minister thought the measure up as a means of attacking people who enjoy fishing. It has been included in the Bill because ACPO tells us that salmon poaching is a widespread and serious environmental crime in our countryside. We are not attacking individuals: our intention is to deal with a serious and substantive organised crime. Even if it is aimed principally at salmon farms, who am I to challenge ACPO&#146;s expertise in the matter?</p>

 I am afraid that that was not entertaining. Very unusually for a man of the law like the hon. and learned Gentleman, it was obtuse. My answer goes back to the point made by the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies). I think that the House will agree that, in relative terms at least, we are probably well covered for homicide, terrorism and a range of other serious crimes. This Bill is designed to fill the gaps and lacunae that exist in the law, and its scope does not extend to every crime that, however remotely, could be construed as serious. As I said earlier, the Bill and schedules have been devised precisely to fill what we perceive to be holes in the existing legislation covering serious and organised crime. An ongoing review of homicide law will report in due course. The hon. and learned Gentleman is esteemed for his knowledge of that legislation: he should point out what he considers to be serious gaps in it to those carrying out the review, and not to me.

In advance of discussion here and in Committee, I must note that&#151;unusually&#151;it contains important inaccuracies. In the main, I have high regard for Liberty briefings, even though I sometimes I disagree with them, but this one is littered with unfounded assertions and important inaccuracies. It seems to belong more to the Paris Hilton school of intellectual rigour, as it does not live up to Liberty&#146;s usual standards.</p>

Contrary to the statement in the briefing, the purpose of the orders is not to avoid the full rigours of criminal prosecution; they are aimed at preventing future behaviour, not punishing past behaviour. If a criminal prosecution is possible, it will be brought. As set out in clauses 1 and 6, the orders will contain only conditions that prevent the subject from further involvement in serious crime. That is set out clearly in the Bill and goes against Liberty&#146;s assertion that the conditions that can be put in place would amount to criminal sanctions. The conditions will be decided by the High Court, or the Crown Court in the case of an order made immediately on conviction, and can and will act only in a way that is compatible with convention rights.</p>

 I appreciate that as the Bill provides that the threshold for making the order is reached only in the event of conviction, most people would be satisfied with that as proof that somebody was involved in the commission of serious crime, but there is real concern, which goes beyond the issues raised by Liberty, that people could be caught by other provisions in the Bill for conducting themselves in a way likely to facilitate the commission of a serious offence by themselves or another person. When the extent of the anticipated involvement and the nature of the predicted crime need not be specified, surely the fact that such a provision could produce an extremely restrictive order, with a five-year punishment on breach, should give us real grounds for concern.</p>

Crown Court route and the preventive and disruptive powers of the orders is a perfectly fair matter for debate in Committee. We want the orders to work and if what the hon. Gentleman suggests would be a barrier to that, or if there are concerns that they would run counter to compatibility with the convention, those matters can usefully be explored in Committee, but I half take his point&#151;I do not mean that churlishly; I genuinely only half take the point.</p>

violent crime, but as I said yesterday at Home Office questions, it is not an abdication of our responsibility to say that the use of knives by young people will not be dealt with just by legislation. As I think the whole House broadly agrees, we have made it clear that education, awareness and a range of other issues must come into play in terms of getting rid of the culture in which it is considered smart or otherwise to carry knives and associated weapons.

In 2006-07, they recovered a record total of more than &#163;125 million of assets from criminals, representing a fivefold increase over five years. Last month we launched a new asset recovery action plan to double last year&#146;s total to &#163;250 million per year by 2009-10.

 Does the Minister accept that one of the reasons why the Assets Recovery Agency has not been as successful as we all might have hoped is that when cases are brought under the Proceeds of Crime Act, they take a long time and are defended to the hilt&#151;often by the use of changes of counsel or the extensive use of the Human Rights Act? It could be argued that that is why those cases have not set the necessary precedents to allow the ARA to recover as much money as it, and we, would like. If that is the case, what confidence can any of us have that the transfer of responsibilities to the Serious Organised Crime Agency will be any more successful?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has got the wrong end of the stick. This year, the Assets Recovery Agency has been more successful than it was in the past. I take in part his point about much of its success being stuck in the courts pipeline. In one sense that is quite proper; it comes down to safeguards, although there are abuses. However, with the greatest respect, that is not a reflection on the success or otherwise of the ARA, either within or outwith the Serious Organised Crime Agency. As he suggests, the current situation owes more to the shenanigans&#151;that is probably the technical term&#151;of assorted defence lawyers who are seeking to defend their clients and prevent the recovery of their assets and ill-gotten gains. I honestly do not think that that charge could be levelled unduly at the ARA, or that the issue would lead to a lack of success on the part of the ARA. Those are matters that the ARA, SOCA and, more generally, the Home Office are looking to take forward with colleagues in the criminal justice system. Although there might be abuses around the edges, people are perfectly entitled to pursue objections to their ill-gotten gains being recovered, and we do not want to throw the proverbial baby out with the bath water.</p>

 I agree with the Minister entirely, and I certainly do not suggest that any of the practices to which I referred have been used improperly. My point is that I do not see how we can be confident that the provisions in the Bill will result in SOCA being more likely to recover the proceeds of crime than the ARA was; what I am suggesting to the Minister is that the provisions do not go to the root of the problem of why the ARA has not been successful.</p>

We are working with prosecution authorities and others, based on the experience of the ARA&#146;s relative success to date, to bring forward in the Bill particular proposals that we think will go towards addressing the issues to do with recovery through the courts that the hon.

 As my hon.

To be fair, the police, through the Association of Chief Police Officers and by other means, have shown over the past couple of years that they are taking the matter extremely seriously. All that is to the good and we will push on in those matters. As and when ratifying, rather than just signing, the convention means something substantial for the development of public policy, we will do so.

 Before the Minister moves on to the two issues that he intends to raise, can I take him back to the part 1 issue of serious crime prevention orders and the Liberty briefing? He will be aware that the Joint Committee on Human Rights shared concerns not only about legal certainty and the equivalence to a determination of criminal charge, but reference to a civil standard of proof. The Government maintain that that is a flexible standard that can be raised as high as that of beyond reasonable doubt. However, if, for issues relating to clauses 1 and 2, the standard will always be that of beyond reasonable doubt, would it not be a good idea to make that clear in the Bill for reasons of understanding our law and what the Government are about, and to avoid allegations relating to Paris Hilton, which the Minister mentioned earlier?</p>

Act 1968 gives powers to detain and search, and a constable may enter any place to conduct the search. Powers to seal off an area are provided by section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, but under strict safeguards. ACPO has confirmed its very strong view that it is fully satisfied with its powers in that area and is concerned about the wide extension of powers that the amendment provides. Liberty has also expressed its concerns, agreeing with the Government&#146;s position on the total lack of safeguards in this clause. <i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> .</i><i> ]</i> Well, to be fair and as I said at the beginning, what Liberty said about the orders earlier on in the Bill was unusually sloppy, lacked intellectual rigour and was assertion rather than fact, and I meant &#147;unusually&#148; as well as all the other words. I take very seriously what Liberty says, which is why I am all the more disappointed when I have cause to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="70612-0006.htm_para12"><a name="07061261000269">Under the power to which I referred, any constable could decide to seal off an area with no requirement for referral to a senior officer, no indication of the extent of that area and with no time limits specified. On balance, that is a reckless provision that would disproportionately affect our communities and potentially result in public disorder, and it is not terribly well thought out. Appropriate, proportionate, intelligence-led policing, such as that conducted by Operation Trident in the Metropolitan area, has proved to be successful in tackling gun crime. Stigmatising certain communities by cordoning off areas in the way provided for in the clause would not achieve that goal, advance what is already on the statute book in terms of searching for firearms, or help in any way to develop community cohesion. For those reasons, as the House has probably already worked out, we intend to remove the clause from the Bill in Committee.</p>

The amendment, which was inserted into the Bill on Report in another place, is simple. It would alter the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 to allow the prosecution to apply to the court for permission to use intercept as evidence in terrorism or serious crime cases. Unless or until an application was made, the current ban on intercept as evidence would stand. The amendment assumes that if a decision were made to offer intercept as evidence, regular public interest immunity provisions would be sufficient to protect sensitive material from disclosure. We believe that that is a rash assumption.</p>

The Government&#146;s position is well established. We support changing the law to permit intercept as evidence&#151;but only if the necessary safeguards can be put in place and the potential benefits outweigh the risks.

It is right and proper to make progress on that work. I believe that it is right and proper to work the matter through to a conclusion. We have therefore agreed to set up an independent review of the subject on Privy Councillor terms. Not only are we convinced that the politicians should come together on matters of national security, but we want to ensure that we work together to solve the difficulties of that highly complex matter, and not try to pretend that they do not exist.</p>

We are not offering a Privy Council review in the context of the autumn&#146;s proposed terrorism Bill as a ruse simply to get through the Committee stage of the measure that we are considering. However, the Lloyd amendment is substantially lacking in thought and rigour in offering a way forward for intercept as evidence. We hope that that view commands the support of the House.</p>

Clearly, the first mandate&#151;an interesting word, but let me put that to one side&#151;relates to whether there is a substantial and viable case, which would have to include the safeguards and other elements that are part of the debate, for taking forward intercepted evidence within an appropriate legal framework. Clearly, if the answer to that is yes, the substance of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point becomes the second part of such a review. If at that stage the answer, given the concerns of the security services, the police and others, is no, at least it takes the issue to termination&#151;for want of a better phrase.</p>

Is there a way to take these matters forward and use intercept as evidence in a way that probably goes beyond public interest immunity to what amounts to PII plus, plus or whatever? Some work has been done on that already. If the answer is yes, we should proceed as the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg) suggests. If the answer is no, and everyone is convinced that it is no, that clearly brings the matter to an end.</p>

Gentleman suggested can be laid out. I have to say that from what I have seen I am not convinced that it can be, but the matter is worth exploring further and in more detail through such a vehicle as a review across party lines on Privy Council terms.

Therefore, we are very clear that we want to take the matter further in the terms that I have suggested. As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary outlined last week in respect of other provisions for a potential terrorism Bill, which will not be introduced until at least the autumn, it is appropriate to secure a cross-party basis for taking this forward.

What thought have the Government given to the Bill allowing post-charge questioning&#151;I believe that it should&#151;in relation to serious crimes?</p>

<p><a name="st_o155"><a name="07061261000284"><a name="70612-0007.htm_spnew1"><a name="07061261000538"><b>Mr. McNulty:</b>
 That is an entirely fair point. My hon. Friend will know that we are going down that route in the proposed terrorism Bill in the autumn. Rather than introducing such a measure for serious and organised crime in a knee-jerk fashion, it would be better to explore the possibility in the future. For completeness, in public policy terms I would rather see how effective such a measure was in terrorism cases and, as it were, work backwards to determine whether it might be appropriate for serious and organised crime. It is certainly a matter worthy of subsequent exploration.</p>

I am sure that whoever works on the Bill&#151;who knows what is going to happen in the next couple of weeks?&#151;will enjoy themselves enormously. It will have profound implications for taking forward our fight against serious crime. Other than for the amendments on searching for guns and on intercept evidence, both of which we shall seek to overturn, I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

 The whole House will acknowledge the need to deal with serious crime, the economic and social costs of which are estimated to be between &#163;20 billion and &#163;40 billion a year. The assets derived from crime represent about 2 per cent. of the UK&#146;s gross domestic product. Let us not forget the human suffering caused by the violence and fear that organised crime breeds. These are not victimless crimes; the fact that the abuse of class A drugs is estimated to cost &#163;13 billion a year is evidence of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="70612-0007.htm_para2"><a name="07061261000287">The question is whether the Bill will be effective in dealing with these problems. We must ask why there is another Home Office Bill and how thought through it is. It is only two years since the passing of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. It has been pointed out that the Government are focusing on legislative solutions. The Home Office has introduced 62 pieces of legislation since 1997, including six Bills in the most recent Queen&#146;s Speech, not all of which we have seen. Twenty-three of those pieces of legislation have subsequently been repealed, either wholly or in part. In the same period, more than 3,000 new offences have been created, 430 of them by the Home Office. The creation of 3,000  <br>

new offences works out at a new offence for almost every day that Labour has been in power, and it is twice the rate seen under the two previous Conservative Administrations. The Government have not yet worked out that the effectiveness of the law enforcement agencies and police forces is at least as important as the legislation that they seek to pass, often in haste. When legislation is necessary, however, it is important that it should be proportionate and effective. That is the yardstick against which we will judge the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="70612-0007.htm_para3"><a name="07061261000288">Part 1 of the Bill immediately gives us a problem in that regard. The Government tell us that the proposed serious crime prevention orders are aimed at the Mr. Bigs&#151;the 400 major crime bosses in the UK who have amassed a criminal wealth of approximately &#163;440 million. The orders are a new type of civil order, similar to antisocial behaviour orders. Indeed, they have been nicknamed &#147;gangster ASBOs&#148; or &#147;GASBOs&#148;. They will be made by the High Court, which could impose a broad range of prohibitions, restrictions or requirements on an individual or business. They could last for up to five years, and could be renewed indefinitely. Breach of an order would be a criminal offence carrying a sentence of up to five years&#146; imprisonment. They appear to be a hybrid of control orders and ASBOs. As such, they are hardly likely to recommend themselves to Conservative Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="70612-0007.htm_para4"><a name="07061261000289">We have two principal concerns about the proposals. First, how effective will they be? After all, we know that more than half of all ASBOs are breached. Some 35 per cent. are breached more than five times and 79 per cent. of those who receive them have previous convictions. The Youth Justice Board report described ASBOs as being worn by youths like a</p>
<a name="70612-0007.htm_brev0"><a name="07061261000357"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;&#145;badge of honour&#146;, rather than addressing the causes of&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="70612-0007.htm_para5"><a name="07061261000290">bad behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="70612-0007.htm_para6"><a name="07061261000291">Most seriously, MORI research shows a lack of public confidence in ASBOs. An Ipsos MORI poll published in June last year, six months after the launch of the respect action plan, found that nearly half the public do not think that ASBOs are effective in stopping antisocial behaviour. Nearly a third of people subject to control orders have absconded. Since the beginning of 2006, 19 people have been subject to control orders, six of whom have absconded and all of whom remain at large. Given the record of ASBOs and control orders, we view the prospect of a new fusion of the two with a certain amount of concern about their effectiveness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="70612-0007.htm_para7"><a name="07061261000292">Our second concern is about the underlying principles governing the orders. They are predicated on the notion that at some future point in time, a person will commit an unspecified criminal offence and needs to be prevented from doing so. Hon. Members might have seen the film &#147;Minority Report&#148;, in which the system of punishing someone with imprisonment after a crime has been committed has been replaced with pre-crime, which operates before a crime takes place in an attempt to prevent it from happening. It is no longer fanciful to say that that concept of pre-crime is being introduced into our legal system today. The only difference is that Tom Cruise relied on mutants who foresaw the future, whereas the Minister and his proposals will rely on hearsay evidence to back up the new gangster ASBOs.</p>

They have also been expressed by the Law Society, which said:</p>

 Can my hon. Friend think of a reason why the Serious Organised Crime Agency might wish to prosecute? Under the Bill, criminals&#146; assets can be seized, they can be labelled with the stigma of guilt of serious crime on the balance of probabilities, and they can be subject to the most onerous restrictions on their liberty. Why would anyone want to go to the trouble of lengthy criminal proceedings if all that could be done on the balance of evidence in an ex parte hearing on affidavit?</p>

 My hon. and learned Friend makes a good point. Just as the Government make great play of their desire to take cases out of the courts in developing their summary justice programme, of which they regard ASBOs as being a part, there is no doubt that in this instance they seek an alternative means of dealing with serious criminals. That may mean that the proper avenues of court procedures will not be followed, and that no safeguards or checks will enable the House to monitor or assess on an ongoing basis the extent to which these provisions are being used for their proper purposes.</p>

The Government say that the High Court will provide oversight, but as Mr. Justice Sullivan said in the context of control orders, to which these measures bear some relation, judicial involvement in the making of such orders can be no more than a &#147;thin veneer of legality&#148; which &#147;cannot disguise the reality&#148;.

We are concerned that the introduction of SCPOs represents a similar step in relation to serious crime generally. In our view, the human rights compatible way to combat serious crime in the long run is not to sidestep criminal due process, but rather to work to remove the various unnecessary obstacles to prosecution, for example by relaxing the current prohibition on the admissibility of intercept material&#148;.</p>

If the committee finds that the use of intercept evidence is necessary, the Government should accept that.

 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend about the Privy Council committee and its composition, and perhaps through him I might invite the Minister to consider the following point. Does my hon. Friend accept that it would also strengthen the committee if we made sure that among its members were not only Privy Councillors but members of the senior judiciary, some of whom are Privy Councillors? They have experience in criminal matters, particularly the operation in practice of public interest immunity applications.</p>

 That is a very interesting suggestion. The crucial criteria should be that members of that Committee have experience and expertise, and that the Committee be balanced; it should not be capable of being controlled in any way by the Government. We await the Prime Minister&#146;s proposal.</p>

The Government claim that this is a narrow and targeted provision to prevent fraud. However, we are concerned that extensive powers are being taken that could allow for the first time widespread data sharing between the private and public sectors, which would overturn the basic data protection principle that personal information provided to a Government Department for one purpose should not, in general, be used for another. Instead, the principle appears now to be that information will normally be shared in the public sector, provided it is in the public interest. The Bill therefore clears the way for a large-scale data-matching exercise, even though a Home Office consultation paper published last year acknowledged that many public bodies feared that such operations could be seen as fishing expeditions. We believe that such procedures can be justified only on a crime-by-crime basis. As the former chief constable of the west midlands, Lord Dear, said in another place, there is</p>

The Committee was also concerned about the absence of strong safeguards to ensure the proportionate use of data sharing. It proposed two limits on the powers, the first of which was to limit the width of the power, for example by specifying the information that could be disclosed and the categories of people to whom it could be disclosed, in place of the open-ended authorisation of disclosure to any person to whom disclosure happens to be permitted by the arrangements of a particular anti-fraud organisation. The Committee&#146;s second proposed limit was to introduce additional safeguards in the Bill such as defining the threshold for reporting information on suspected fraud, limiting disclosure so that only information on those suspected of fraud would be shared.</p>

 That was not the view of the Joint Committee. I am open-minded about whether the Government can reassure us that that provision will prevent fishing. Our concern is to ensure that fishing is not allowed. The provisions should be able to be used only to identify existing patterns of criminal activity. We will examine those detailed issues in Committee.</p>

Indeed, the Bill specifically amends the data protection legislation to achieve that widened definition of data that may be shared. What is the justification for widening the definition to include sensitive personal data that does not immediately appear to relate to fraudulent activity?  <br>

We will seek reassurances from the Government on those points and, if necessary, amendments to the Bill. The Minister may be able to give us those reassurances when he winds up or, more likely, when we examine the detail of the Bill in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="70612-0008.htm_para6"><a name="07061261000338">We are mindful of the Information Commissioner&#146;s warning that we are sleepwalking into a surveillance society. The House has to be careful before passing wide ranging powers that could allow considerable intrusion into people&#146;s private lives and the data that are held on them in breach of the principle of the data protection legislation. It is right that we should consider these proposals very carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="70612-0008.htm_para7"><a name="07061261000339">Chapter 2 of part 3 relates to the proceeds of crime and the abolition of the Assets Recovery Agency. As an example of the Government&#146;s legislative frenzy, the ARA was set up only in 2002 and has since been subject to various changes through legislation. Five years later, it is to be abolished, but that is perhaps not surprising given the National Audit Office&#146;s report in February, which pointed out that the ARA had recovered &#163;23 million against costs of &#163;65 million. The Minister will have to explain how simply dismantling the agency and reconstituting it within SOCA will make it more effective. The deckchairs are often moved around the deck of a sinking ship, but we want to know how the proposals will improve performance in assets recovery. We will also seek reassurances about the effect on Northern Ireland, where the agency has been more successful and is valued by the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="70612-0008.htm_para8"><a name="07061261000340">We have cause to be concerned about the placing of the ARA into SOCA. The former has been in operation for just over a year and we are concerned about its accountability. It has a budget of nearly &#163;400 million, capital funding of &#163;43 million and 4,500 full-time equivalent staff. However, the House has had no opportunity to debate the effectiveness of the agency since it was established or since it has reported. The ARA is meant to be accountable to Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="70612-0008.htm_para9"><a name="07061261000341">I concede that it is too early to assess SOCA&#146;s effectiveness properly, and that we can take some positives from its first annual report, such as the volume of drugs that it has seized and the stronger international co-operation that it has fostered. Concerns remain, however: the agency has prosecuted fewer cases in the UK courts than its predecessor, and it has missed its targets for seizing criminal assets. Reportedly, it has suffered from poor morale, too much bureaucracy and staff problems. Questions have been asked about its cost-effectiveness too as, so far, it has achieved fewer convictions of organised criminals than its precursor, even though it has more than twice the budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="70612-0008.htm_para10"><a name="07061261000342">Perhaps SOCA can answer all those questions, but it is very important that the House has an opportunity to assess its effectiveness, especially before we accept a proposal to place within it the already not very successful ARA. We shall have to look at all those matters more closely as the Bill makes its way through the House.</p>

ACPO had said that the power was unnecessary, but what about the idea for a new stop-and-question power that he floated in the press? It was dropped unceremoniously a few weeks later, but did the Government take ACPO&#146;s view into account then? No, of course not. The Government are happy to pray in aid ACPO&#146;s opinion when it suits them, but they are equally happy to float a proposal and gain a good headline without even having the courtesy to talk to ACPO beforehand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="70612-0008.htm_para12"><a name="07061261000344">We need to examine the new power on its merits. The Minister described it as a &#147;reckless&#148; provision, but we will have the opportunity in Committee to hear his explanation of why he believes that the existing powers are sufficient, and to look at the issue in a rather more sober manner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="70612-0008.htm_para13"><a name="07061261000345">The Bill is typical of the Government&#146;s piecemeal approach to dealing with crime. The promised Criminal Justice Bill has not yet emerged, even though <i> The Sunday Times </i>promised us in January that it was to be the Prime Minister&#146;s final assault on Britain&#146;s thug culture. We have had a series of Home Office Bills that have been badly thought through and incomplete, when what we need is more effective action by the agencies concerned, and more thought about the proposals brought before the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="70612-0008.htm_para14"><a name="07061261000346">Despite the scrutiny of the Bill undertaken in another place, some serious questions remain, such as the implications for civil liberties of data sharing and the justification for, and the reach of, the serious crime prevention orders.

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="70612-0008.htm_para18"><a name="07061273000005">Before I get down to the nitty-gritty of the Bill, I shall make three broad observations about what may have informed the Government&#146;s thinking about it. First, it is fair to say that they are hopelessly addicted to what the Prime Minister famously described as &#147;eye-catching initiatives&#148; on crime. I shall briefly revisit the e-mail from &#147;TB&#148; of 29 April 2000, in which he said:</p>
<a name="70612-0008.htm_brev3"><a name="07061273000156"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;On crime, we need to highlight the tough measures...we are lacking a tough public message...we should think now of an initiative, eg locking up street muggers. Something tough, with immediate bite which sends a message through the system.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="70612-0008.htm_para19"><a name="07061273000006">At that point, obviously thrashing around for a few more examples of what might send out the right media message, he went on:</p>
<a name="70612-0008.htm_brev4"><a name="07061273000157"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Maybe, the driving licence penalty for young offenders&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="70612-0008.htm_para20"><a name="07061273000007">after seven years, we have still not seen that one&#151;</p>
<a name="70612-0008.htm_brev5"><a name="07061273000158"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;but this should be done soon and I, personally, should be associated with it.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="70612-0008.htm_para21"><a name="07061273000008">The reason why I quoted the e-mail so extensively is that the Bill exhibits the same traits. We are being invited to bring into our vocabulary new expressions such as the &#147;serious crime prevention order&#148;&#151;the SCPO, or perhaps there is another way of describing it. Perhaps Ministers did not think that was catchy enough so they came up with &#147;gangster ASBOs&#148; to capture with greater force the essence of the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="70612-0008.htm_para22"><a name="07061273000009">It is worth recalling the words of Louise Casey, the Government&#146;s co-ordinator for respect&#151;I did not make up that title. Recently, she was reported as saying that she &#147;punched the air&#148; when she heard the word &#147;ASBO&#148; on EastEnders. That, in a way, sums up very well what the Government regard as the test of their eye-catching initiatives. Do they get mentioned on prime time TV? Do they enter the popular vocabulary? It is not necessarily to do with whether they are as effective as they might be in tackling crime and in passing the test of scrutiny in the House. No matter that in some parts of the country three quarters of ASBOs are now breached. As long as the co-ordinator for respect can punch the air because people watching &#147;EastEnders&#148; know what ASBOs are and regard the action taken by the Government as sufficiently tough, the initiatives will have achieved their objective. This is the era of soundbite and spin&#151;I hope it will last for precisely one more fortnight, but I suspect that it will not&#151;and the Bill has to be seen in that context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="70612-0008.htm_para23"><a name="07061273000010">My second observation has been touched on earlier and it is that the Government are hopelessly addicted not only to eye-catching initiatives but to legislation. It is worth stepping back and looking at what the Government have put through the House in this broad field since 1997. Labour has created more than 3,000 new criminal offences, passed 115,000 pages of legislation and introduced more than 50 Bills, including 24 criminal justice measures. In the 60 years between 1925 and 1985, Governments of different colours managed to get by with only six criminal justice Acts,  <br>

an average of one every decade. This Labour Government have been getting through them at the rate of more than two a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70612-0008.htm_para24"><a name="07061273000011">If I list the measures in this broad area that have been put before the House in just this Session, you will, Madam Deputy Speaker, get a sense of the legislative frenzy within which the Bill sits. The list contains the Fraud (Trials without a Jury) Bill, the Legal Services Bill, a criminal justice Bill, an asylum and immigration Bill, the Offender Management Bill, a counter-terrorism Bill, the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Bill and this, the Serious Crime Bill. It is no wonder that Ministers have little time to run their Departments effectively. They are so busy trying to make a splash with legislation in the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="70612-0008.htm_para25"><a name="07061273000012">My third observation is how hopelessly cavalier the Government are with the foundations of our criminal justice system. What am I talking about? I refer to the very essence of our criminal justice system and the features that, as children growing up in the United Kingdom, one learned to value and regard as important. Those features include trial by jury, the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial before an independent court. These are not niceties and added extras, but fundamental protections for the individual citizen from the excessive power of the state and they have been developed over many centuries. We have to be extremely cautious about regarding them lightly and disregarding them quickly in the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="70612-0008.htm_para26"><a name="07061273000013">I shall concentrate my specific comments primarily on part 1 and to a lesser extent on part 3. The big issue that we need to consider today and in the Bill&#146;s remaining stages is that part 1 seeks to restrict the liberties of people who may never have been convicted of any criminal offence. The whole notion of a person being innocent until proven guilty&#151;as I have said, I was always given to understand that it is the fundamental right of every British citizen to start with that assumption made about their guilt or otherwise&#151;has been stood on its head. Instead, the High Court merely has to be &#147;satisfied&#148; or have &#147;reasonable grounds&#148; to issue a serious crime prevention order. That is a considerably lower threshold than innocent until proven guilty and the other safeguards that I have touched upon. That is why the Liberal Democrats tabled an amendment in the House of Lords that would add after the word &#147;satisfied&#148; the phrase &#147;beyond reasonable doubt&#148;. That was rejected in the other place, but we intend to revisit the matter in Committee if the Bill is given a Second Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="70612-0008.htm_para27"><a name="07061273000014">The Minister in the other place, Baroness Scotland, admitted that what I have described is indeed the case. Let me take the House briefly through the relevant passage of her speech. In exchanges between Conservative Front-Bench Members and the Minister for Security, Counter Terrorism and Police, we were told that the safeguards were rigorous and that there was not as much need for concern as I have claimed. However, Baroness Scotland said:</p>
<a name="70612-0008.htm_brev6"><a name="07061273000159"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;These are civil orders, so this involvement will have to be proved to a civil standard. But I know that many of your Lordships will be only too aware&#151;so I hope that noble Lords will forgive me if I emphasise it&#151;that where serious assertions are made, the civil standard can be virtually the same on certain issues as the criminal standard.&#148;</p>

Like everyone else in the House, I deplore fraud, and I accept the arguments often made to say that it is certainly not a victimless crime; all of us can, collectively, be victims of it in many different ways. There are occasions when I wish that the Government, in putting in place schemes such as tax credits, would ensure that they were sufficiently tightly administered and were not so prone to fraud, but leaving that to one side, I think that we could all agree that measures to tackle fraud have desirable objectives. However, I and others are extremely concerned about confidentiality, and we are alive to the dangers of the surveillance state. I am pleased that the Select Committee on Home Affairs has decided to make it its business to consider the surveillance state and the degree to which people who justifiably want their security enhanced and strengthened, using modern surveillance techniques, need to be reassured about their privacy and the protection of their liberties. That is the balance that we need to strike in a state such as ours.</p>

People may on occasion be frustrated or exasperated to find that a piece of information that they gave to one Government agency has not found its way to another, as they assumed that it would, and when that would have made their interaction with the Government much more efficient, effective and smooth, so I appreciate that we are not talking about absolutes. None the less, my concern, and the concern of many other Members, is that as soon as data are shared widely across Government, and by Departments for which the data were not intended, there is a serious risk that they will be used inappropriately, whether for phishing expeditions, as was said earlier, or for any other reason.</p>

It is legitimate to examine this aspect. If we are to extend the power and scope of the state in such a way that the privacy of individuals may be compromised, it would be useful to know what the up side is in terms of revenue savings. If we do not know that, it is hard to make a value judgment. There are many, myself included, who will feel that the amount of money is immaterial because there are issues of principle at stake to do with the liberties of the individual citizen, but others may regard that as a reasonable quid pro quo, assuming that the amount of revenue saved is considerable.

Of course, when one stops and thinks about it, it seems obvious. If people visit one of those stores and choose to have one of their cards&#151;I accept that that is a choice; it is not compulsory, but millions of people make that decision&#151;the time and location of their purchase is logged. In other words, each time they use the card, the firm knows where in the country they are.

I read in one of the Sunday newspapers that the idea of Members of this place considering the use of intercept evidence was a brilliant and original scheme devised by the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), which came as news to me because I had heard Liberal Democrat Members putting forward exactly such a proposal many years before it appeared to come to the attention of the leader of the Conservative party. None the less, I welcome the growing consensus in this House on the use of intercept evidence in some court cases where it is deemed to be necessary and appropriate&#151;although that consensus seems only to be making a certain amount of progress on the Government Front Bench.</p>

They are the front line, charged with the national security of this country. Consistently, time after time, they have made it clear to both Opposition Front-Bench teams that they are opposed to that approach.

Then the Prime Minister in waiting, the current Chancellor of the Exchequer, suddenly conveyed a greater interest in seeking to establish a consensus and the goal posts appeared to have moved.

Today, I received a written answer from the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker), who will be familiar with it, having crafted it in detail and provided it for me. My question was fairly straightforward. On the basis that the Criminal Justice Act 2003 put in place a mandatory five-year sentence for people carrying an illegal firearm, I asked how many of those who have been convicted of carrying an illegal firearm since then have been sent to  <br>

prison for five years. One would assume that the answer was 100 per cent., because that is what a mandatory sentence would imply. However, as the Minister will know from the answer that he gave me, the actual figure is 37.9 per cent.

The burden of proof will not be the criminal standard&#151;namely, that a jury should be sure beyond reasonable doubt&#151;but that a judge is satisfied that the defendant is probably guilty: that, on the balance of the evidence, it is likely that the defendant was involved, as the Serious Fraud Office or the Director of Public Prosecutions contends.</p>

The consequence is that the inconvenience and tedium of bringing through to a trial and persuading 12 ordinary people in a jury box that a man is guilty can simply be circumvented by that device.

If that is right, what is the need for the provision? If it has to be established beyond reasonable doubt, that is essentially recreating a criminal trial in a civil court. Of course, the consultation paper did not say that and nobody really believes&#151;not even, I suspect, the Minister&#151;that the criminal standard of proof can conceivably apply in those circumstances. It will be a civil standard of proof and merely a question of probabilities, not of reasonable certainties. What does the consultation paper say about that? It explains why a Mr. Big, instead of being prosecuted, properly convicted and sentenced by a judge, should simply be subject to this summary-type of procedure based on written evidence and no trial. It says that it can be justified because of the quantity of the evidence or because some of it is in a form not admissible in criminal proceedings, but that can be used in civil cases&#151;namely, hearsay.</p>

Be that as it may, what the consultation paper is essentially saying is, &#147;We don&#146;t have the evidence against this person. We can&#146;t prove that they are involved in serious crime. We haven&#146;t got the necessary foundation to deprive this man of his liberty, to strip him of his assets, to take away his good name and to impose restrictions on him that would have a substantial effect on his family.&#148; The orders in the Bill would have just such effects.</p>

I ask Members on both sides of the House to reflect on whether we ought to admit that as a principle in this House. It is in this House that so much sweat, toil and effort has been put into the cause of freedom and liberty. Should we, on a quiet Tuesday afternoon, allow so fundamental a principle to pass without at least a voice of protest being raised or critical and constructive opposition being mounted? Our ancestors would have gone to the stake before permitting the Executive to restrict an individual&#146;s liberty in this draconian way.</p>

In another place, Baroness Scotland outlined the circumstances in which a manufacturer or business man was making items that could facilitate crime. She gave as an example the production of cargo storage containers with false bottoms, saying that such equipment would plainly be manufactured with little else in mind but a criminal purpose. The orders might therefore be used to prevent such items being manufactured. We might also think of those who manufacture speed camera detection equipment.

I ask the House to reflect on that. Producing such items is a perfectly lawful, admissible activity, but the House is being asked to make it unlawful through legislation, rather than a proper criminal offence being brought on the basis of aiding and abetting&#151;or, under this Bill, assisting and encouraging. Such people would be eminently chargeable under the new provisions with assisting and encouraging an offence, and one of those orders would be made. That would criminalise lawful conduct without reference to the House. It would visit upon the individual the consequences of a conviction and of engaging in unlawful activity without having made the activity unlawful.</p>

The consultation paper also invites us to accept, as a basis for passing the Bill, that orders could be an</p>

Let us imagine that the Serious Fraud Office, the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Serious Organised Crime Agency had a potential criminal under investigation. It would investigate him in the normal ways open to it, no doubt including surveillance, covert interception and all the other paraphernalia available to the law enforcement authorities. Under the proposals, the Director of Public Prosecutions, for example, could pop along to a High Court judge and say, &#147;Now look, we&#146;re investigating this chap.&#148; The judge would say, &#147;Well, haven&#146;t you got to serve a notice on the person you&#146;re investigating?&#148; The director would have to say, &#147;Yes, the Act requires it.&#148; He would be faced with the bizarre situation of having to tell the serious criminal that he was investigating him, because he would have to seek an order in the High Court and serve notice on the criminal to prevent him from engaging in any further activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="70612-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07061273000066">I ask the House to reflect on whether those two things are compatible. If we are seeking a civil order restricting a person&#146;s liberty and stripping him of his rights as a free individual, we are inherently telling him that we are investigating him and that he is a target of a law enforcement agency. There would then be no point in getting one of these civil orders, unless the evidence was already in the bag&#151;in which case, why not just prosecute him?</p>

If it is so hard to discern the basis on which the orders will be made, and exactly where the provisions will fit into the criminal justice system, why are we taking a step that is fraught with such grave consequences to the principles of liberty for which the House has always stood? Is it surprising that people in the judiciary and the wider society are saying that they can no longer trust the House of Commons to stand up for their liberties, and that that must be done by the judiciary? That argument is always used to justify the power of judges to take away from the House its role as the vigilant defender of human rights and liberties.

We had 340 sections and 37 schedules to the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and 179 sections and 17 schedules to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005.

What on earth happened between the time when the 2003 provisions became effective and the 2005 Act was drafted to make it necessary to rewrite all the money laundering provisions in that earlier Act? As my hon. and learned Friend said, perhaps the truth is that legislation is not receiving the quality of attention that should.

However, I ask the Minister to reflect on the idea that what is at stake is not trivial or light; it is a tradition and principle of liberty for which his political ancestors as well as mine have fought for hundreds of years and which was always considered to be, and I believe still is, one of the most valuable inheritances to which all of us, on both sides of the House, have the privilege of acceding. That is why I ask him to reflect very carefully, before the Bill is allowed to pass through the House, on the real justification for it, on the logical bases put forward in the consultation paper, and on whether or not it does not amount to a very significant invasion of our liberty and one that the House should not pass.</p>

I want to place the Bill, and part 1 in particular, in the context of the avalanche or tidal wave&#151;call it what you will, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;of criminal justice legislation since 1997. My hon. Friend identified the catalogue of criminal legislation that we have had and the huge number of additional offences that the Government have created in the past 10 years. However, it does no harm&#151;in fact, I think it does some good&#151;to remind the House of something, because it is often forgotten. I can remind only part of the House, of course, because despite introducing the Serious Crime Bill, the Government have failed to persuade a single Labour Back Bencher to come and support the measure. I appreciate that not everyone who is elected as a Member of Parliament can be here all the time. I appreciate that not every Member of Parliament is in the least bit interested in legislation. I would have thought, however, that at least one Labour Back Bencher would have had the nous to read the Bill, to have some thoughts about it and to speak gleefully on behalf of the Government in its favour, or even just to read out a Whips&#146; brief&#151;</p>

 Possibly that, too. Perhaps Labour Back Benchers have legislation fatigue. I mentioned in an intervention that 34 Home Office Bills had been repealed, repealed in part or not fully implemented. That is bad enough, but let us consider the sort of Bills they are. I am not going to recite all of the 34 out of the 64 Bills for which the Home Office has been responsible since 1997, but I will give just a few examples. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 contains 43 sections and two schedules that have been repealed in whole or in part. The Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 contains 15 sections and one schedule that have been repealed in whole or in part. Half a dozen of its sections and schedules are not yet in force, and it was passed seven years ago. The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 has 21 sections and two schedules that have been repealed in whole or in part, and an equivalent number of sections from the Police Reform Act 2002 have not been brought into effect or have been repealed in whole or in part. The Criminal Justice Act 2003, about which my hon. and learned Friend and I had a brief discussion, contains four sections and two schedules that have been repealed in whole or in part, and approximately 50 sections and 17 schedules that are not in force.</p>

we are discussing is a form of civil injunction to prevent a crime. It seems that things have changed, but I was always taught that it was not possible to obtain an injunction from a High Court judge to prevent an anticipated crime, because the criminal law was sufficient injunction in itself. That was the deterrent: that was the way in which our behaviour was regulated in relation to criminal activity. It would not be possible to go to court and say to the judge &#147;I want an injunction to prevent the defendant, or respondent, from committing an anticipated burglary, an anticipated murder, or some other anticipated crime.&#148; The judge would simply say &#147;The law is on the statute book.

Now, however, we are watching the Government quietly&#151;I say quietly because no Labour Back Benchers are here to listen to this, or to listen to the Government&#146;s justification of their intention&#151;move huge chunks of criminal law and procedure into the civil jurisdiction.</p>

It seems to me at least possible that the Minister for Security, Counter Terrorism and Police, who introduced the Bill, has not read the underlying legislation to which the schedule refers. The clue is that the Minister tends to resort to abuse rather than argument when faced with a difficult question. I am not suggesting that we are discussing the possibility of people being caught by prevention orders for fishing with a spinner during the fly season, but I do think the Minister ought to come here with his work done before  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="70612-0011.htm_para5"><a name="07061273000095">The Minister chided me, telling me that I ought to get out more. I would get out more if I were not having to keep the Government under a watchful eye, but there are some interesting gaps in the schedule. For instance, homicide, grievous bodily harm, offences of robbery and indeed terrorist offences are not included in part 1 of the schedule. Perhaps the Government let them slip. I worry that the Ministers in charge of this Bill have not been giving it their proper attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="70612-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07061273000096">One other issue about which the House ought to be concerned is clause 5(4), which yet again provides an example of this Government requiring this Parliament to give this Government Executive powers to amend the criminal law without resort to Parliament. Clause 5(4) says, in the most disarming way:</p>
<a name="70612-0011.htm_brev2"><a name="07061273000097"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Secretary of State may by order amend Schedule 1.&#148;</p>

If one wants to change the principles or detail of primary criminal law, one should do it by primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="70612-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07061273000099">What will these orders be able to cover? My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon has been through those. These are fundamental restrictions on liberty, on where you can work, to whom you can talk, where you can go, who you can meet, what you can do with your money and matters of that nature. They apply to individuals, to partnerships, to unincorporated associations and to corporations. Most extraordinarily, we have these examples, which as my hon. and learned Friend pointed out, are merely examples of requirements that may be imposed:</p>
<a name="70612-0011.htm_brev3"><a name="07061273000100"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a requirement on a person to answer questions, or provide information, specified or described in an order...at a time, within a period or at a frequency...at a place...in a form and manner; and...to a law enforcement officer or description of law enforcement officer...notified to the person by a law enforcement officer specified or described in the order.&#148;</p>

(Mr. Coaker), say that from a sedentary position. It is not a civil matter, except by description from the Government. In terms of the European convention on human rights, which the Government have domesticated into our jurisdiction and jurisprudence, we are talking about the imposition of savage penalties&#151;five-year prison sentences&#151;for breaching a civil order. That is a penalty in anyone&#146;s book. If the Minister thinks that simply by mouthing the word &#147;civil&#148; in front of every piece of criminal procedure or criminal law that he brings into this House, he makes it actually a civil penalty, he is in a greater state of unknowing than I had previously thought that he and his colleagues might be.</p>

 Having heard two very powerful speeches, I can be rather briefer than I intended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70612-0011.htm_para13"><a name="07061273000106">The hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) made some telling points and said that he would truncate his remarks after his hon. and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox) made a powerful speech, which showed a lot of understanding of the procedures that should inform these debates but frequently does not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70612-0011.htm_para14"><a name="07061273000107">It was unfortunate that in opening the Minister referred to the &#147;shenanigans&#148; of lawyers. I confess to defending and prosecuting asset recovery cases, and I do not recognise the word &#147;shenanigans.&#148; It is always unfortunate when Ministers see fit to insult lawyers, and the Minister of State, albeit that he was goaded from this side, concurred with that description. Let us remember that many thousands of people each year are acquitted of offences with which they have been charged; they are innocent people. Without the &#147;shenanigans&#148; of lawyers, heaven knows where they would end up. [<i> Interruption.</i>] &#147;Even the odd Minister,&#148; according to the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire). I am sure that that was not meant in any way to be personal about the Under-Secretary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="70612-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07061273000108">I was concerned that the Minister stressed that we are not talking about the civil standard of proof&#151;that is to say, on the balance of probability&#151;but about something nearer the criminal standard. He was relying on the case of McCann, in which the House of Lords suggested that, in many cases, there would be a civil standard but that, in some, it might move up to somewhere near the criminal standard. That does not satisfy me at all; even if the learned judges had said that in every case that would be so&#151;I know that they were talking about a previous Bill, but the issue is the same&#151;I would not be at all persuaded. Who decides to apply something nearer the criminal standard? When does that kick in? When is it appropriate to rely only on the civil standard? These are fundamental matters, especially when one deals with the draconian measures that may be introduced in lieu of these orders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70612-0011.htm_para16"><a name="07061273000109">The Minister says that the civil standard of proof certainly will not apply. Clause 34 says:</p>

When one reads the Bill, one cannot conclude otherwise. The only thing on which the Minister could fall back was to blurt out the McCann case; McCann says that the standard of proof could be the civil standard or almost, maybe, at times, something approaching the criminal standard. That is no good at all. Liberty is right in what it says, and I do not accept what the Minister says at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70612-0011.htm_para19"><a name="07061273000114">Everybody in this House is keen to make sure that we stem the rise of organised crime. Nobody would argue against that being a priority, but we must not throw away our civil protection&#151;the protection that has been woven into the judicial process over many centuries&#151;in an urgent rush to do something about organised crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70612-0011.htm_para20"><a name="07061273000115">This Government introduced antisocial behaviour orders, and they want to limit the right to jury trial and spend less on legal aid. We find the same steps being taken in every area we consider. I served on the Committee that considered the civil contingencies legislation. It is difficult to believe, but it is true, that a Government Whip can decide to declare an emergency. A Government Whip can also decide not to enter someone&#146;s house to look for evidence, but to knock their house down, and the householder does not have a right to sue for damages. That is in the Bill. That might be thought of as small potatoes when compared with some other measures, but it does not make me feel any better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70612-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07061273000116">There is a consistent drift&#151;a constant attack on civil liberties and on the judicial process. The fact that the Minister prays in aid the thoughts of the judiciary in the McCann case shows that the Government are on the ropes. There is a certain frisson in the relationship between the Government and the judiciary at present, so it appears that the Minister was clutching at straws in trying to justify the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="70612-0011.htm_para22"><a name="07061273000117">I am unhappy with the Bill. There are many examples of what might happen to people. It is unacceptable to condemn a person to house arrest without their having the opportunity to be tried properly on the accusation giving rise to the order. There are also restrictions on travel, on the use of a private dwelling, and on meeting and making arrangements with associates. All such restrictions are perfectly proper if a proper degree of proof has been established through the courts, but without that they are utterly unacceptable as they then amount almost to house arrest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="70612-0011.htm_para23"><a name="07061273000118">A breach of the conditions can give rise to a five-year prison sentence. Equally insidiously, the order can be renewed indefinitely. We should think about that. Does anyone fancy being under house arrest indefinitely? I would not like that. It is all very well saying that an appeal will lie somewhere or other, but I do not know where it will lie because presumably in the initial event a High Court judge will have imposed the order&#151;and an appeal might well be difficult to mount in any case. These are serious matters. The Bill is rightly  <br>

</ul>

Suffice it to say that grave concerns are felt by a range of organisations, including the Bar Council, the Law Society, Liberty and Justice. I would not argue with the Government if what they were asking the House to sanction was intended to be imposed after a thorough examination of the evidence, where on a proven basis a person was convicted or found to require this kind of order. I would still be unhappy about the indefinite imposition of those conditions, but I could not reasonably argue about the imposition of an order. However, the measure in its current form is an attack on our criminal justice system. It is an attack on the presumption of innocence, the equality of arms and, crucially, the right to a fair trail before an independent court. Almost every aspect of the system is being attacked.</p>

The far-reaching matters I have referred to should be looked at properly, and these orders should not be established in their current form.</p>

The hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon eloquently addressed it. There is a cumbersomeness about the criminal justice system in respect of acquiring evidence, putting it before the court, and in proving the case&#151;but so there should be. We are talking about people&#146;s reputations and liberty. If we are not careful&#151;cumbersome&#151;about such things, where are we headed?

 Much of what I was going to say has been said, so Members will be relieved to know that I will be blissfully brief. It is wise to treat any new Government law and order legislation with a degree of scepticism. We have heard already of the 3,000 or so offences that have come on to the statute book in the last 10 years, and of legislation such as the Criminal Justice Act 2003, of which large parts&#151;constituting nearly a third, I believe&#151;have never been brought into force or repealed. It is time to say to the Government that the effectiveness of an anti-crime strategy should be measured not by how much legislation they pass and put on to the statute book, but by how effective that strategy is in convicting criminals, and by the perception and reality of crime in our communities and constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07061273000139">This is a very significant Bill that to an extent redefines the balance between giving new powers to the state&#151;to the Executive, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) said&#151;and the erosion of civil liberties. Let us be clear: the introduction of a civil order is a significant shift in power from the individual to the state. The chief concern of many is the eroding of civil liberties. It goes without saying that, like everyone in this House, I want to see serious criminals arrested, charged and convicted, but my worry is that if these orders become law, investigations into such criminals will go so far, and then the path of least resistance will be taken. Too often, the path of least resistance will be to apply to the High Court for a serious crime prevention order. The Government assure us that these orders are just another arrow in the quiver of their law enforcement provision. My concern is that instead of being an add-on, they will be used as an alternative to proper judicial process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07061273000140">I am conscious that I am standing here surrounded by colleagues who are learned in the law, so I will be going down a difficult path in briefly examining the detail of the legalities of what the Government are trying to do. The Bill is still very loose in the parameters it sets. It contains a requirement that</p>
<a name="70612-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="07061273000198"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a person has been involved in a serious crime&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07061273000141">which suggests to us, in line with a common law definition, that an individual has to have been convicted of a crime before such an order can be sought. However, we know that that is not the case. The Bill in fact says that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07061273000145">That is a matter for the courts. It is clear that the legislation allows for circumstances where no crime has been, or is likely to be, committed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07061273000146">There is a further worry regarding the intent of an individual and the possibility that they had no knowledge that they were operating in a way that facilitated a serious crime. I shall not go through the Bill&#146;s definition of serious crime&#151;my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough has done so&#151;but there are gradations of such offences, and some are more serious than others. I do not intend, either, to go into the salmon fishing, trout poaching scenario that the Minister talked about earlier, not least because I would probably have to declare an interest. However, we cannot be satisfied with the extent of that definition in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07061273000147">It seems that the Government view law and order legislation as being roughly on the right track if it enrages the legal establishment. I do not consider the approval of organisations such as the Law Society and the Criminal Bar Association as always necessary, but it is at least desirable to have their seal of approval; after all, these people do know what they are talking about. If the Government had listened at an earlier stage to such organisations and to the Select Committee, there would have been less need for a whole raft of amendments in another place. I will not repeat what the Law Society said about this provision, but is worth getting on the record what the Criminal Bar Association said:</p>
<a name="70612-0012.htm_brev5"><a name="07061273000203"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there can be no public policy that necessitates such a draconian course which rides roughshod over the legal principles upon which our criminal justice is based&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07061273000148">Those are serious words.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para11"><a name="07061273000149">People are right to say that the use of a civil process to impose a criminal liability is criminal justice by the back door. There are already such provisions on the statute book&#151;we are starting to get used to this process&#151;although I am not seeking to repeal them or to trash them this evening. Company directors&#146; disqualification legislation, football banning orders and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 were all civil orders leading to a criminal liability; however, little of such legislation is on the scale of this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07061273000150">The role of civil process is to provide a mechanism for resolving private wrongs where the public element of the wrong is absent. These orders are introduced as civil injunction orders, which means that the Government are taking us down a much more treacherous path. They are predicated on the notion that at some time in the future, a person will commit an unspecified criminal offence and needs to be prevented from doing so. That is entirely different from someone actually committing an offence, or encouraging, assisting or inciting another to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07061273000151">I want to touch briefly on the amendment in the House of Lords concerning gun crime, which the Minister swept aside as though it did not matter at all. The hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) and I are members of the Home Affairs Committee, and we have heard recent evidence about appalling situations in challenging communities where gun crime is an all too present danger. This is a really serious issue, yet the Minister swept it aside with a quote from the  <br>

Association of Chief Police Officers saying that such legislation is unnecessary. Initially, I was amazed to discover that the amendment by Lord Marlesford was necessary; I thought that a provision in law already existed enabling the searching of people for guns. The amendment is about using technology against gangs and groups of young people to search them for firearms, which is a sensible option. If the police were concerned about it, I would take that into consideration, but when Lord Marlesford proposed the amendment he said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para14"><a name="07061273000152">I hope that the Minister will consider that point. I am prepared to accept that the amendment may require more safeguards, as it is only a short provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07061273000153">Despite grave concerns, I wish to give the Minister the opportunity to prove that the orders can operate without undermining our system of justice. It took 20 years to achieve the recent conviction of a Mr. Big, and I note that he was convicted, Al Capone style, of a fairly minor offence compared with some of the offences that people felt he might have been convicted of. We cannot treat this matter lightly, because there are some serious criminals out there whom we want to stop, and we must provide the police with all the means of doing that. But we cannot ride roughshod over the freedoms and liberties that have been fought for so hard and for so long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para16"><a name="07061273000154">Today, some of my constituents visited the Palace and, like many visitors, they commented on the small size of the Chamber. People are always surprised that it is so small. I always remind them that Winston Churchill used to refer to this place as a &#147;little room&#148;. He did not mean that pejoratively, but as a term of endearment. As he pointed out, this little room is the shrine to our liberties. He really understood that the liberties we guard in this place were hard fought for and should be protected. While we support any action that bears down on the most appalling criminals in our society, we do not do so at the expense of those liberties.</p>

 Given the powerful and persuasive speeches made by Members&#151;solely on this side of the Chamber, I might observe&#151;my remarks will be brief, but seriously meant. It is often said that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, but so too is the road to authoritarianism. I use that word deliberately, because this Bill is an example of mission creep. Each individual proposal that appears reasonable in relation to criminal justice legislation runs the risk, even in a mature democracy, of going down that road. The Bill is another example of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para17"><a name="07061282000002">It is also said that men can sit on the fence so long that the iron enters their soul.

the criminal courts, defending and, in latter years, mostly prosecuting. Like some of my hon. and learned Friends, I dealt with serious criminal offences and I was conscious, when I presented a case on behalf of the prosecution, that if I were to secure the conviction of an individual I had to ensure that the case I made would be subject to a high burden of proof. I had to jump through certain hoops to prove the prosecution case. Those who investigated the case&#151;the police officers and the Crown Prosecution Service&#151;also had to jump through various hoops to bring the case home. That was right and proper, because of the gravity of imposing a criminal sanction on someone, be they a minor criminal or a Mr. Big. That is a fundamental principle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para19"><a name="07061282000004">In the last few years I was in practice, I was concerned by the repeated complaint from experienced detectives involved in the investigation of serious crime that they were often obliged to curtail the extent of their investigations. As a prosecuting lawyer, I might suggest that they needed to obtain further information to tie up the loose ends, but they sometimes could not do so because of budgetary constraints. That is a real problem for police forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07061282000005">Against that background, my great fear is that instead of ensuring that a case is watertight and will end in a conviction, police officers and prosecuting officers will be tempted to look at this Bill and say, &#147;No, we will take the expedient route and use the civil sanction&#148;. It is because it is expedient that we should be very wary of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para21"><a name="07061282000006">The specific points have already been well made by hon. Members in the course of the debate, but I accept that there are times when the use of the civil standard of proof can be appropriate in criminal proceedings. However, the key test is that those occasions should be exceptions to the rule and very specifically defined. Many of us will have been involved in confiscation proceedings, under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and, before that, the drugs trafficking provisions. The point of those provisions is that they are specifically limited to kicking in only when there has been a criminal conviction to the proper, high standard. That is a very different scenario from the pre-emptive measure envisaged in the Bill. It is the lack of specificity that is a real flaw in part 1.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para22"><a name="07061282000007">That view is shared by many outside organisations, especially Justice, which is no mere local lobby group. It is the UK section of the International Commission of Jurists and speaks with some authority. I would be saddened if our criminal justice system, which is often held up as a beacon, were to become tarnished in the eyes of the international legal community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para23"><a name="07061282000008">Of particular concern, as has already been mentioned, are the definitions in clause 3. It expressly removes the requirement that a person must have actually intended to facilitate a serious criminal offence or even to believe that his actions would do so. There is an interesting contrast between the vagueness of the definitions in part 1 and the much more specific definitions in part 2, which follows on from the Law Commission&#146;s proposals and is altogether more useful. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para24"><a name="07061282000009">Justice points out that any number of third parties could be caught by clause 3 as unwittingly facilitating the commission of a serious offence. For example, is the  <br>

taxi driver who drives passengers to a destination where they carry out a serious offence facilitating that offence? If a computer retailer sells equipment to someone who uses it for drug dealing or human trafficking, would he be caught by the provision? If a landlord rents premises to a tenant who uses them for the manufacture and storage of drugs, would he be caught? That will be a risk for businesses, especially those that have no legal obligation&#151;or indeed right&#151;to inquire about the use of otherwise legitimate equipment. It is also a risk for the small person, who may not sensibly be in a position to make such inquiries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para25"><a name="07061282000010">It may be argued that the definitions in clause 5 will oblige the court to disregard activity that the defendant shows to be reasonable, but that is pretty vague. Moreover, that in effect puts the defendant in the frame, according to the civil standard of proof&#151;like the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), I am not at all satisfied that such matters will be dealt with according to the criminal standard&#151;and the result is that a reverse burden of proof is placed on the defendant who chooses to assert his innocence and demonstrate that what he did was reasonable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para26"><a name="07061282000011">That is wholly unacceptable. The scope of the provision is too wide, and Justice has pointed out that it mixes ASBOs with some aspects of control orders issued under the prevention of terrorism Act. The UK courts have found that ASBOs are civil rather than criminal in character, but the status of control orders has not yet been fully determined. The House of Lords has yet to decide the matter, and it seems inappropriate for the Government to be creating the sort of hybrid that I have described while we still await clarity in respect of control orders from the highest court in the land. That determination may very well affect the interpretation of the orders proposed in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para27"><a name="07061282000012">As has been observed, the Government domesticated the European convention on human rights in our law, and most informed observers consider that it is most uncertain that the European Court of Human Rights will agree that SCPOs are civil in character. Indeed, there are some doubts about whether it considers ASBOs to be civil in character, but the proposed orders are more draconian and so are more likely to be regarded as criminal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70612-0012.htm_para28"><a name="07061282000013">The Government are going down a most dangerous route with this Bill, and we must be very wary. I know that the fact that the Opposition do not intend to vote against the Bill will not be taken as an indication that we believe that all is well with it. The Minister said that we should look in Committee at the use of intercept evidence, and the Bill&#146;s proposals in that respect are good. My experience leads me to believe that they are worthy of sensible consideration, but I hope that he will be open minded about the much more troubling elements of part 1. We need to examine them very carefully before we commit ourselves to anything.</p>

In his extraordinarily powerful speech, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox) highlighted many serious concerns about the import of the Bill, including what he described as the bypassing of the criminal justice system.

He asked about the justice and appropriateness of an ability to create a virtual house arrest for ever and a day. Those are very serious matters in the context of the human rights issues that he highlighted, and we shall need to examine them closely and carefully as scrutiny of the Bill continues in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70612-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07061282000025">My hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon) spoke of the potential shift in the balance between the individual and the state, and about the implications of the Bill&#146;s ambiguous and uncertain language. He also drew on his experience as a member of the Home Affairs Committee in respect of the gun crime amendment agreed in the other place, and we will examine that provision closely to see whether what the Minister said about its necessity and scope was correct. We will look at that matter in detail to determine whether it should remain in the Bill, subject to appropriate amendment and consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70612-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07061282000026">Finally, my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) asked whether the Bill was to some extent motivated by expediency, and he also pointed to its lack of specificity. There is little doubt about the concerns that have been expressed, but the Minister in the other place, Baroness Scotland, portrayed the SCPOs as a practical way to stop crime happening. On Second Reading there, she said:</p>
<a name="70612-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="07061282000046"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;These orders are not about punishing people without proof; they are not punitive. Rather they are proposed to be preventative.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 7 February 2007; Vol. 689, c. 729.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70612-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07061282000027">However, if prevention is the key, as she suggests, recent history indicates that the new orders are unlikely to fare well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70612-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07061282000028">As we have heard, SCPOs have been described as hybrid of ASBOs and control orders. Yet breaches of ASBOs are running at around 60 per cent., and there have been obvious examples of the failure of control orders&#151;a third of them have been breached, and six people remain at large. In that context, when the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker), winds up, will he indicate to the House what measures will be implemented to monitor compliance with the orders, and what degree of compliance will be expected? Alternatively, is it expected that the orders will in fact be breached&#151;as has been suggested&#151;and that their whole purpose is to secure a custodial sentence? Is the deliberate aim of the measures to find a way round the criminal justice system? When the Minister opened the debate he was at pains to stress that that was not the case, but those issues need careful and close examination to ensure that the fears expressed with some passion from the Opposition Benches are not borne out and that if appropriate protections are still required they are included in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70612-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07061282000029">There is a more general question about whether the orders are the right way to proceed. The Law Society briefing for the debate notes:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="70612-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07061282000030">It is interesting that the Bill contains no provision for consideration of whether a prosecution is possible before application for an SCPO. The Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 incorporates such protection in relation to control orders and requires that the possibility of prosecution be kept under review for the duration of the order, yet the Bill does not. The Minister needs to explain why not.</p>

The position is made more complex by the likely interpretation of the orders by the courts&#151;a point made eloquently by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon and also by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. The McCann case in the House of Lords was highlighted in the context of antisocial behaviour orders; it was suggested that in certain circumstances, for fairness, something close to the criminal standard would be applied, yet clauses 34 and 35 show clearly the intention that the civil standard should apply. We need clear legal analysis of the impact of those provisions. If the House, in full knowledge of the McCann judgment, decides that it wants to include that provision in the Bill, is it open to the courts to say that is what would happen? I hear what the Minister has said and I note the comments of Baroness Scotland in the other place, but there is room for uncertainty. We should always aim for certainty in legislation, so we should consider including a provision in the Bill so that the matter is put beyond doubt.</p>

It is entirely appropriate that we make the best use of data systems to detect and prevent fraud, but the measures must be proportionate and balanced against the need for general personal privacy. The Bill introduces wide-ranging powers that could allow, for the first time, widespread data sharing between the public and private sectors. It could overturn the basic data protection principle that personal information provided to a Department for one purpose should not in general be used for another. Instead, information will normally be shared in the public sector, provided it is in the public interest.</p>

We shall examine that point in greater detail in Committee. We look forward to the detailed proposals for a code of practice&#151;a promise made in the other place and reconfirmed today. Some progress was made on the issue in the other place and I pay particular tribute to the work of my noble Friend, Baroness Anelay, but there is more work to be done.</p>

Protections may exist under the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Human Rights Act 1998, but the House must be satisfied that the Bill&#146;s provisions are sufficiently focused on tackling crime and that appropriate protections are afforded to ensure that the general rights of ordinary members of the public are not compromised by wide-ranging snooping powers justified on the basis that something useful &#147;might come up&#148; from the information obtained.</p>

Despite what the Minister for Security, Counter Terrorism and Police says, the ARA has been a failure. The Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), recently summed up its performance by pointing out that it had spent &#163;65 million but recovered only &#163;23 million; has no complete record of the cases referred to it; has worked on more than 700 cases but managed to recover assets in a mere 52; and that 90 per cent. of the financial investigators trained by it have not even completed the necessary courses.

However, the National Audit Office report on the ARA made various recommendations that will apply equally to the new bodies responsible for its current functions; case management was highlighted as a particular weakness. In assessing the provisions for transferring the operations of the ARA we will need to be satisfied that there will be appropriate measures to address the evident performance failures and the issues highlighted by the NAO report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70612-0013.htm_para17"><a name="07061282000040">Transparency is needed, particularly in the future performance of SOCA, which has not been subject to detailed public scrutiny to date. In evidence to the Public Accounts Committee, the Comptroller and Auditor General gave an assurance that it would continue to be possible to assess whether the costs of the asset recovery function of the SOCA exceed or are less than the assets it recovers, confirming that a proper system of management accounts will be put in place. For the House to have confidence in the arrangements proposed in the Bill, mechanisms for proper, robust, external scrutiny of SOCA are essential. After the failure of one agency, it is important that the House can review the performance of its replacement and that the information can be made public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="70612-0013.htm_para18"><a name="07061282000041">We welcome the inchoate offences provisions, which build on the excellent work of the Law Commission. In the other place, the Government set out some of the rationale for their divergence from some of the Law Commission&#146;s original proposals, but we will use opportunities in Committee to probe the detail of their proposals to ensure that the appropriate balance has been struck.

However, serious questions remain as to whether the provisions of the Bill will advance this cause and whether, by virtue of the breadth of the Bill&#146;s scope and the practical operation of its provisions, it may undermine some of the fundamental values and freedoms that the House should be seeking to uphold and protect. That is where Conservative Members will maintain our focus and will challenge the Government robustly when we believe that they fall short.</p>

but I do not ignore the fact that all Members are dedicated to working towards the same aim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70612-0013.htm_para21"><a name="07061283000007">I have listened with interest to the debate and some hon. Members have referred to centuries of tradition. The hon. Member for Taunton said that I had answered a parliamentary question today, which I have, about mandatory minimum sentences of five years for the possession of a handgun. He pointed out that although Parliament had passed the provision, the judiciary, in determining the appropriate sentence, had not in all cases given the five-year sentence. That is because the legislation gives the judiciary the opportunity to take account of exceptional or extenuating circumstances&#151;I cannot remember the exact phrase in the law. The hon. Gentleman cannot castigate me for being responsible for legislation that does not result in the judiciary automatically giving a five-year sentence and then, two minutes later, castigate me, my hon. Friend the Minister for Security, Counter Terrorism and Police and the Government for undermining centuries of tradition if we are not able to dictate to that same judiciary that it should have no independence and that it should automatically and without any reference to extenuating circumstances apply the five-year sentence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70612-0013.htm_para22"><a name="07061283000008">I make that point because it is fundamental to this debate. We cannot pick and choose with respect to constitutional principles. The hon. Gentleman chose to have a go at me and the Government about the minimum five-year sentence and will no doubt suggest that the Government are failing on gun crime because it is not being applied, but he then said that the Bill was a wicked erosion&#151;I paraphrase&#151;of centuries of tradition in this country since the Magna Carta.</p>

 It will be interesting to hear whether the hon. Gentleman supports the independence of the judiciary, or perhaps has another explanation.</p>

 I did not wish to cause the Minister personal offence. The point that I was trying to make was that when there was an outbreak of public concern about gun crime and the Prime Minister called a &#147;gun summit&#148; at No. 10 Downing street, and legislation on gun crime went through the House in various criminal justice Bills to put in place a mandatory five-year sentence, the overall effect of that range of activity was to convey to the public that the Government were tough on crime and, by implication, that the other parties in the House were less tough on crime. I was making the point that legislation is not always brought before the House with the intention of trying to make the laws of the land more effective; it is there for presentational purposes and to have an &#147;eye-catching&#148; approach, as the Prime Minister put it. Quite often, it does not actually work in practice.</p>

 With respect to the hon. Gentleman, the point that I was making, as I think every other hon. Member appreciates, was that one of the problems of an independent judiciary is that it sometimes makes decisions or interprets the law in a way that he and others find difficult. The hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon said that centuries of tradition were in danger of being swept away, but all that I was I saying is that people sometimes see centuries of tradition being swept away when they  <br>

disagree with something that the Government propose. As with all things, we need to reach a compromise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="70612-0013.htm_para23"><a name="07061283000013">I am grateful to everyone for contributing to the debate and will now turn to some of the points that have been made. On serious crime prevention orders, I emphasise the potential usefulness of a flexible measure against those who engage in insidious crimes with intelligence and adaptability. The orders can be made only, as McCann stated, when it can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the subject has been involved in serious crime. The conditions contained in the orders will only be preventive, not punitive, and will be entirely in accordance with the European convention on human rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="70612-0013.htm_para24"><a name="07061283000014">Two categories of points seem to have been made in the debate: those about principle and those about practice. On principle, the main points were about whether the orders would be a means of circumventing the criminal process. One particular point made by Opposition Members was why we would want to prosecute when we can seize assets and impose major restrictions on liberty on the basis of an ex parte hearing. Those who made that point were wrong. It will not be possible to seek these orders on an ex parte basis and the interpretation of the way in which the orders work is a complete misunderstanding of the Government&#146;s intention. The orders will not be an easy option to be used in place of criminal prosecution&#151;their purpose is completely different. Prosecution is about punishing previous actions, whereas these orders are about preventing future involvement in serious crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="70612-0013.htm_para25"><a name="07061283000015">In addition, to assert that the orders are an easy option is to misunderstand and underestimate the role and expertise of the High Court. The applicant authority will have to convince the High Court, to a standard that we expect to be close to beyond reasonable doubt that the proposed subject of an order has been involved in serious crime. That will be no simple task. As we may recognise, High Court judges do not fall over themselves to agree necessarily with the Government&#146;s view. The court is a public authority for the purposes of the Human Rights Act 1998 and so will only make an order that is reasonable, proportionate and compatible with convention rights.</p>

<p><a name="st_o196"><a name="07061283000016"><a name="70612-0013.htm_spnew4"><a name="07061283000146"><b>Mr. Cox:</b>
 The Minister says that the orders will be dealt with on the basis of reasonable doubt, and I have every respect for those who are briefing him. I am sure that they know a great deal. However, the reality is that the consultation document that his Government produced made it clear that one of the main reasons for introducing the orders is that, in some circumstances, they would not be able to acquit themselves of the reasonable doubt standard. In cases in which evidence fell below that standard, there would be a justification for the order. The Minister is making a good speech and I applaud and commend the tenor of it, but, with respect, he cannot have it both ways. If the reasonable standard test is too high, the civil standard of proof will be used, not reasonable doubt.</p>

out that the civil standard will be applicable. However, we accept that that standard is flexible and that, in the light of the House of Lords judgment in the case of McCann, the court will probably expect the heightened civil standard of beyond reasonable doubt to apply when deciding whether a person has been involved in serious crime. If the hon. and learned Gentleman reads the McCann judgment, he will see that it makes it clear that there is a flexible standard that can be applied to civil orders and that, in respect of involvement in serious crime, the expectation would be that the level of evidence required, if not identical to the criminal standard, would be nearly identical to it. He may disagree with the House of Lords judgment, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy did, but&#151;</p>

 I do not want to add more confusion where there is plenty already, but in my experience, in a civil proceeding that may involve criminal allegations, the court, in order to be persuaded of those allegations, will still apply the civil standard, but it will slide up the civil standard. If there is an allegation of murder, the court will require to be better persuaded than if there is an allegation that somebody parked on a double yellow line. That is simply a flexible application of the civil standard. The Minister should not persuade himself that the Bill&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The Minister can take the advice of the Leader of the House or my advice&#151;I think that I have practised a little longer than the right hon.

 I am not making a false argument. The argument that I am using is the argument used by the House of Lords in its judgment with respect to McCann. The application of that judgment to serious crime prevention orders will be particularly useful.</p>

sharing and data matching proposals will make a significant difference in detecting and preventing fraud. We are involved in close discussions. As hon. Members will know, because we have set up meetings between all hon. Members and the Information Commissioner, the Information Commission is broadly satisfied with the proposals in the Bill. We will continue to consult with the Information Commissioner to make sure that that continues to be the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="70612-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07061283000026">Many of our constituents will be surprised that some of the data sharing that the Bill allows&#151;to prevent and detect fraud&#151;is not already allowed. Rather than be concerned about the implications of the measures, as some hon. Members are, they will wonder why those measures have taken so long to come about. Of course, we have to have the appropriate safeguards, but this is about using information technology and the various means at our disposal to deal with serious crime.</p>

Many of the current clients&#151;if I can put it that way&#151;of the Assets Recovery Agency are people who are involved with serious crime. The synthesis and merger of those two agencies will benefit law enforcement when it comes to taking assets from criminals, whether through the civil recovery route or the enhanced powers that we intend to give others through changes to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Many of our constituents would want us to continue the improvements in practice when it comes to taking ill-gotten gains from criminals.</p>

The Association of Chief Police Officers supports the Government&#146;s position. Lord Marlesford&#146;s amendment is unnecessary. Hon. Members who are concerned about the Government&#146;s attitude to civil liberties should note that we believe that what Lord Marlesford&#146;s amendment does&#151;it allows a police constable, on his own, to designate an area, unspecified in size, in which to stop and search and/or question anybody&#151;is disproportionate and an infringement of our civil liberties. I ask hon. Members who have talked about civil liberties to look carefully at that amendment.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to hold this Adjournment debate today, not least because it is my birthday. I thank Mr. Speaker for allowing me to hold the debate on such a momentous day. It is also the last day for submissions to the consultation on the draft Climate Change Bill. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment will take on board my contribution&#151;I will, of course, buy him a drink afterwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="70612-0014.htm_para15"><a name="07061283000041">This is the first debate in the House on climate change since last week&#146;s G8 summit, which made some important progress, albeit from a very low threshold. I want to make it plain at the start that I support the Government&#146;s initiative to launch the draft Climate Change Bill. It is a world first and, for that reason, I hope that we get it right. I support the rationale behind the Bill, which states:</p>
<a name="70612-0014.htm_brev18"><a name="07061283000129"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Climate Change Bill is necessary to provide a clear, credible and long term domestic framework for tackling climate change, whilst at the same time allowing the UK to demonstrate strong international leadership, which is key to helping achieve multilateral agreements.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="70612-0014.htm_para16"><a name="07061283000042">That is what I want to focus on&#151;the quality of leadership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="70612-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07061283000043">I sought this debate not because I am a pedant obsessed with figures, although some might disagree with that assessment, but because I believe that if we are to tackle climate change effectively, we should do our best to be aware of what the figures provided by bodies such as the intergovernmental panel on climate change, and in our own 2005 climate change conference, actually mean. We could set any target we liked, but we should be honest and tell people the likely consequences of whatever target we choose. We could say, as some still do at the international level, that we do not want any targets at all. Of course, if we did that, we would be inviting mammoth damages to our economic prospects, and death and destruction on a massive scale, as Nick Stern indicated. We would not be able to insulate ourselves from the consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="70612-0014.htm_para18"><a name="07061283000044">That is the most irresponsible position imaginable, but there are a host of positions on dealing with the problem, on a sliding scale of enthusiasm. At the other end of the scale, we could don a painful hair shirt and make immediate heavy cuts in emissions&#151;something that no Government appear willing to do, for understandable short-term reasons. We have chosen the target of a 60 per cent. cut in emissions by 2050&#151;a reasonably high figure, by most other countries&#146; standards. That is the figure in the draft Climate Change Bill, although I realise that the Bill refers to a cut of &#147;at least 60 per cent.&#148; I can see why we would use the phrase &#147;at least&#148; in the Bill, but it has no legal meaning whatever. If I told you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that you had to pay a fine of at least &#163;60, well, &#163;60 would do. Indeed, more often than not, the Bill&#146;s target of at least 60 per cent. is referred to in official documentation as simply 60 per cent.

the United Nations last week, the prefix &#147;at least&#148; has been in the habit of disappearing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="70612-0014.htm_para19"><a name="07061283000045">That might appear a trite point, but it is actually very serious. To understand why, we should study how we alighted on the 60 per cent. figure. As the Government acknowledged, it originated in the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution report entitled &#147;Energy&#151;the Changing Climate&#148;, published in 2000. The 60 per cent. figure was derived from a calculation that suggested that a CO2 concentration in the atmosphere of 550 parts per million may be an acceptable limit allowing us to contain global warming at a reasonable level, but no country can calculate its own target for greenhouse gas emission reductions from a greenhouse gas stabilisation level without factoring in the share that it must bear of global emission reductions. It would be worse than pointless to pretend that we could ignore the distribution of responsibility among countries. Of course, the United Nations framework convention on climate change recognises that fact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="70612-0014.htm_para20"><a name="07061283000046">As my hon. Friend the Minister knows only too well, the formula that our 60 per cent. calculation relies on is called contraction and convergence, and the RCEP report used that framework, coupled with an upper limit of 550 parts per million, to arrive at the 60 per cent. target. Sadly, as our understanding has progressed, and in light of more recent reports&#151;notably Stern&#151;we have realised that that target will, more likely than not, lead us into &#147;a very dangerous place&#148;, as Stern says. I therefore cannot see why we do not run the contraction and convergence formula that the RCEP used seven years ago again to get a more up-to-date figure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="70612-0014.htm_para21"><a name="07061283000047">There are things that we need to factor into the calculation that were not, to a great extent, factored in seven years ago&#151;things such as positive feedbacks. Examples include permafrost melting and releasing methane; the albedo effect of the Arctic icecap being lost as that icecap melts, and the seas therefore absorbing more sunshine; and the possibility of the rain forest dying. We talk about sink failures; more recently, we have heard about the acidity levels of the southern ocean reaching dangerous levels, and its therefore not being able to absorb as much CO2 as we originally thought that it might.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="70612-0014.htm_para22"><a name="07061283000048">I can imagine several political reasons why the Government fight shy of acknowledging the intellectual basis of the 60 per cent. target, but it simply cannot be concealed any longer. I say that because I want the Climate Change Bill to become the gold standard of climate change legislation, and I want it to be emulated by other countries. For that to happen, it is essential that we heed the response that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) at the Environmental Audit Committee last week. The Secretary of State said that we must not pluck figures out of thin air. I do not think that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith wanted to pluck anything out of thin air, but he did want a scientific and logical justification for the 60 per cent. target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="70612-0014.htm_para23"><a name="07061283000049">When we are not prepared to admit that a figure is problematic, our explanations of it become problematic. That was amply demonstrated by the Government&#146;s chief scientific adviser in evidence to the Joint Committee on the Draft Climate Change Bill the day after the  <br>

Environmental Audit Committee met. He simply could not make things match up. Frankly, he tied himself up in knots. That approach is categorically not good enough. I have said recently that the reasoning behind the current figure lacks intellectual rigour, and I say so again. We have to decide whether we want to seek a safe and sustainable stabilisation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere or not, and if the answer is &#147;not&#148; we should prepare accordingly, which means spending a lot more on adaptation, and we should make plain to people what we think the consequences will be. However, if we want to achieve that safe and sustainable level&#151;and I know that the Government do&#151;we should calculate what effort is required in the time scale available. From that figure we can backcast all the things that we need to do to achieve it; it does not work the other way round.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="70612-0014.htm_para24"><a name="07061283000050">There is no serious, scientific study that tells us that the chance of containing a temperature increase to 2° C on the basis of a 60 per cent. cut in emissions by 2050 is more than evens. I know it, the Government know it, and anyone who takes climate change seriously knows it, so why do we persist with the 60 per cent. figure, even if the phrase &#147;at least&#148; 60 per cent. is used? Clearly, the politics is having difficulty keeping up with the science. The spectacle of George Bush apparently agreeing to a 50 per cent. target last week tells us what is going on&#151;not frightening the horses is what is going on. I do not believe for one moment that Bush has any intention of honouring his alleged pledge, not least because he will not be President when the time comes to sign on the dotted line. That shows how difficult it is to get any movement at all at the top level, and to get others to follow us, but does that mean that we have to gut the science and make it bend to our notion of realpolitik? Do the experiences of King Canute not teach us something about that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="70612-0014.htm_para25"><a name="07061283000051">The question is where we go from here. We should state firmly and categorically what we intend to do with our Bill. It is being introduced because we want to make our contribution to achieving a safe and sustainable level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We should state explicitly and firmly how we have formulated our targets&#151;in other words, we should demonstrate that we have not plucked them from thin air&#151;and we should firmly and explicitly state that the formula that we have used is considered to be fair and reasonable; surely we would not have used it if it was not.</p>
<a name="07061283000110">
<p>To do those things is not to bind ourselves to an international agreement based on contraction and convergence. We should always be open to the possibility that somebody out there has devised something better, and is willing to have that idea examined and tested. It seems to me an absurdity for the Government to obfuscate the origins of our national target, as if by some freak of fate nobody could discover what those origins were. We are begging to be found out, and if we are, what will that do for our credibility? It is a strategy that invites the proposing of weaker and more fragmented frameworks. I recognise that there are many critics of contraction and convergence, and mostly those criticisms are levelled not at the need to achieve a safe and sustainable concentration level, but at the means of achieving it. As Stern found, there are great difficulties in determining what constitutes equity, and for many, the idea of a per capita share allocation is a step too far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="70612-0014.htm_para26"><a name="07061283000052">I find it frustrating that although these criticisms are happily thrown at contraction and convergence, rarely is an alternative proposal put forward. Instead, we hear much about fairness and justice, with abundant references to the fact that the poorest, who did least to create the problem, will be the ones to suffer most from it, but these words remain frozen in air, never to be given substance or converted into hard, practical solutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="70612-0014.htm_para27"><a name="07061283000053">It is ironic that Ministers are reluctant to talk openly about contraction and convergence. We have a de facto contraction and convergence Bill, whose antecedents are easily traceable, and at the same time we are not proposing any other framework, at least as far as I know. The Prime Minister has single-mindedly driven the twin agendas of climate change and Africa to the top of the international agenda, but we shy away from acknowledging a widely accepted framework that is supported in many places precisely for its coherence in addressing these twin issues. It is time to see such coherence coming from the Government, too. They must propose a coherent link between these issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="70612-0014.htm_para28"><a name="07061283000054">What is the alternative? The G8 agreed that we should have a Kyoto replacement ready by 2009, which would allow time for its ratification by 2012. We have two years for something concrete to emerge, which is inclusive of all, seeks to solve the problem faster than we are creating it, and is coherent and fair&#151;two concepts which, I admit, are not always found in international treaties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="70612-0014.htm_para29"><a name="07061283000055">I assume that in the coming months and years, we will be telling others about our Climate Change Bill. We will want to display our initiative as a model, just as last week the Secretary of State told the United Nations about it. True, some people may find our proposals too difficult for them, especially if vested interests appear to be threatened, but are we then necessarily obliged to start from a lower base and hope that somehow we can make up lost ground later?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="70612-0014.htm_para30"><a name="07061283000056">That, in truth, has always been our hope&#151;that if we do the right things, the result may be greater than the sum of its parts. The trouble is that we face a challenge that has no precedent in history, and our old way of stitching things together is hopelessly inadequate. The effort needed is immense, even if Nick Stern&#146;s quoted cost of 1 per cent. of GDP seems so slight. Let us remember that almost 40 years ago the UN set a target for developed countries of giving 0.7 per cent. of GDP in aid, and so far only three countries have managed it. We can break the psychology that has made for failed commitments in the past by adopting a rigorous and coherent framework now.</p>

So that I am not misinterpreted, I conclude by saying that the challenge is not just for the Government. It is for all parties in the House. There is no escape clause from the necessity of achieving a solution that solves the problem faster than we are creating it. The evidence is abundant that that is beyond 60 per cent. I believe the Government agree. I hope the Opposition parties also agree and do not try to make party capital out of the 60 per cent. figure.

We are on track to meet our Kyoto targets, not least because of the dash for gas. Our old, dirty coal-fired stations were phased out as the gas stations came in. Germany has met its obligations because of the closure of large sections of heavy industry in east Germany. For the same reason, much of the former Soviet Union is also meeting its obligations, so it is puzzling why the Russian Federation did not sign up sooner to the Kyoto agreement.</p>

Targets of a 26 to 32 per cent. reduction in emissions by 2020, and the 60 per cent. target by 2050 to which the hon. Member for Morley and Rothwell referred are indeed ambitious. Although the Bill will aim to address that, will the Minister address the concerns that have been raised with me by people who say that this is not justiciable&#151;that the Government cannot control it? The reductions in CO2 are being achieved not by the Government but by heavy industry, consumers, motorists and the rest. Those concerns have been raised during the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill. Many people think that it will not get off the ground. What would happen if we failed to meet our targets and legal action was taken by Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth? Could it be made to stick in court, given that the emissions are not directly within the Government&#146;s control? Yes, the Government can put structures in place and participate in the European emissions trading scheme, but can they be held to account in that respect?</p>

What would happen if, for example, the UK succeeded in developing new clean technologies in the aluminium industry or other metallurgical industries such as steel smelting and the rest? What if we were so successful that such industries were developed here and closed down in other parts of the European Union? Who knows, by 2050 the large complexes in the Donetsk region of Ukraine could be closing because we could do it more efficiently here. UK emissions would therefore increase in terms of our participation in the trading scheme. In other words, we would miss our target but the global situation would improve. That occurred to me immediately. If the UK were to go it alone, would we then be precluded from trading in emissions within Europe, which would increase UK emissions but reduce total EU emissions?</p>

Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill) is right to point out the weaknesses of the emissions trading scheme, but it surely behoves individual states to recognise that it is their prime responsibility to ensure that they do not damage the living opportunities of the following generation.

 I can see the point that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make. However, my concern is that in recent years heavy industry has gone east to countries where emissions standards are not so tight, or not so tightly policed, and where labour is cheaper. We need to claw those industries back to western Europe, where we have clean technologies. The European emissions trading scheme is a good mechanism for that, but if we set ourselves a target that would be jeopardised by such trading, that could be counterproductive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="70612-0015.htm_para11"><a name="07061283000074">The UK needs to take some tough decisions. We all subscribe to the wish to reduce emissions by 60 per cent. by 2050&#151;or to reduce emissions as much as we can, because we know that in other parts of the world similar ambitions are not held with the same strength. Many developing countries feel that they should catch up with us before they make any cuts at all. Perhaps the Government should try to focus on things that they can do&#151;for example, on the tax tools that they hold. In recent years, under this Government, the total tax take from environmental taxes has been falling. Perhaps they should address that. Constituents sometimes write to me saying, &#147;We hear there&#146;s a marvellous Government scheme to insulate our houses.&#148;. However, they then find that the money has all gone because no sooner is it announced than it is snapped up by housing associations, among others, who are geared up and ready to go for those subsidies, but not by individual householders, who may be a little slow off the mark. Perhaps more money should go into research and development, which will result in better technologies. And what a shame that the plug has been pulled on the carbon sequestration scheme that was due to go ahead in Scotland. There are areas that the Government need to be considering. They should not just think that because they can set these targets in stone the rest of us will have to comply and that they will be held to account if we do not.</p>

Let us try to bring that closer to home and encourage farmers in this country to produce biodiesel.

 My former colleague in the European Parliament is absolutely right. In recent years, we have been fortunate in that when there is famine somewhere in the world there are stocks of food to send. What would be the reaction in this country if, faced with famine in Africa, we were told, &#147;Sorry, we don&#146;t have any wheat to send because we&#146;ve turned it all into ethanol and we&#146;re burning it in our cars&#148;? We have seen this around the world&#151;not only in Brazil but in the far east where the habitat of the orang-utan is under threat because of oil production to go into biodiesel.

I just hope that the Government will not find themselves kicked around when the Climate Change Bill is introduced. Many of us, not only people on the environmental side but lawyers, are seriously concerned about whether it will be made to work. Can the Government legislate on something that is not directly within their control? If it fails and the Government are taken to court and fined, who will pay the fine? Presumably the Government will have to pay the fine to the Treasury, which will then put the money back into the system again.

The marine Bill is very close to my heart, and there is strong support for it on both sides of the House. It does not have the legal and other problems that have been raised by those who, while having the objectives of the Climate Change Bill very much to heart, are concerned about whether it is the right mechanism and whether it will work.</p>

The UK&#146;s dash for gas was second only to the collapse of the Soviet economy in achieving carbon reductions, but Sir Nicholas Stern clearly sets out his explanation for our achieving the Kyoto target so long ago&#151;as far back as 1999.

It begins with the degree increase in global warming that we are prepared to tolerate. He makes it clear that some of the consequences are extremely serious at more than 2°. They include:</p>

Significant changes in water availability... Possible onset of collapse of part or all of Amazonian rainforest... Many species face extinction... Rising intensity of storms, forest fires, droughts, flooding and heat waves... Onset of irreversible melting of the Greenland ice sheet&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="70612-0016.htm_para0"><a name="07061283000100">Let us remember that 2° is the target that the G8 plus 5 has failed explicitly to endorse in its communiqu&#233;, thanks to the influence of the Bush Administration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="70612-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07061283000101">How does that translate into targets in terms of parts per million? Again, Sir Nicholas helpfully sets out a clear table, in which he takes a range of risk analyses, from the intergovernmental panel on climate change at one end of the scale to the Hadley centre at the other. The risk of exceeding 2° C, relative to pre-industrial levels, is for 450 parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere, or 38 per cent. according to the IPCC. The Hadley centre says that at 450 parts per million, the risk is as high as 78 per cent. At 550 ppm, even the IPCC says that the risk is 77 per cent.&#151;far more than likely&#151;and the Hadley centre estimates the risk at 99 per cent.&#151;in other words, virtually certain. Even the lowest of those percentages, at 38 per cent., is not a risk that I would like to take crossing the road, let alone risking the future of the planet. It is very clear from the figures in the Stern report that 450 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere is actually the minimum level that we should aim for either at the international level or in terms of UK domestic carbon emissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="70612-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07061283000102">The Stern report does not make a very clear association between that target and the percentage reduction of CO2 emissions that we need in the Bill. Luckily, however, others have done so. In its response to the publication of the Climate Change Bill, the Tyndall centre said:</p>

The pathway demonstrated that even a 30 per cent. chance of not exceeding the 2° degree threshold required the UK to cut its total carbon emissions by 70 per cent. by 2030 and in the region of 90 per cent. by 2050.&#148;</p>

or 90. That clearly demonstrates that the 60 per cent. target contained in the Bill is utterly inadequate. Indeed, on a previous occasion, I believe that the Minister told the House that the Government were ready to contemplate 70 per cent. If that were true, why could we not have a target at least that high built directly into the Bill?</p>

 I share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view that we should go further, but with that in mind, would he support controls on individual households in order to secure a reduction there? Everybody talks about business, the Government and communities, but what about individual households?</p>

 I am not quite sure which controls the hon. Gentleman has in mind. If he is talking about personal carbon allowances, I think that there are real practical problems with introducing a comprehensive system of such allowances, but there are methods that work at household level. For instance, we have suggested a green mortgage financing scheme that would enable people to invest in energy efficiency in their houses for a guaranteed reduction in their household energy bills. There are certainly policy mechanisms that we can bring forward at national level that will work for people at the household level&#151;a very important level for these things to work at.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="70612-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07061283000106">However, the real purpose of this debate is to talk about targets, which is what the hon.

It is also about leadership, and indeed about having the moral authority to be able to talk to countries such as the US and say what will happen if, when it comes to an international process after 2012, certain countries will not play ball. What is plan B? The Stern report raises the issue of a carbon border tax; Sir Nicholas Stern goes on to reject that option, but he has raised it at least as an issue for debate. We must be tough in conducting international negotiations and it is sad that in the end the G8 summit thought it more important to have a communiqu&#233; that included the US than one that included the 2° target. That is not a hopeful sign.</p>

 I am not sure that I would concede that. The US Administration is under enormous domestic pressure. Having lost domestic legislative elections, having been subject to Al Gore&#146;s campaign to raise awareness in the US, and with states like California and north-east states ploughing on with emissions reduction campaigns on their own, George Bush has been looking more and more isolated and unrealistic. It was clear that he would have to make some concessions in this direction, and he has done so only under great pressure. His suggestion that the Kyoto process, under the auspices of the UN, should be abandoned for some kind of side-deal with a group of high-emitting nations is profoundly unhelpful and threatens to undermine the Kyoto process.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell (Colin Challen) on securing this Adjournment debate. As is customary, I will respond primarily to him, but I shall take on board and address the comments made by the other hon. Members who have participated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="70612-0016.htm_para6"><a name="07061285000002">This has been another opportunity to highlight the risks from dangerous climate change and the urgency with which we need to tackle it. As we have acknowledged before, climate change is the greatest long-term challenge facing the human race and it is a top priority for this Government. That is why we have consulted on and published our draft Climate Change Bill, and I welcome the commitment of my hon. Friend to its principles and the wide support that it has received in the House and in the country at large.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="70612-0016.htm_para7"><a name="07061285000003">We recognise that tackling a global problem effectively requires a global agreement. We therefore very much welcome the significant progress made by the G8 last week. The G8 recognised that a global emissions reduction goal must be agreed, involving all major emitters and taking account of the European goal to halve emissions by 2050. This is the first time that the G8 has announced the need for a goal against which global efforts should now be measured. At the United Nations framework convention on climate change meeting in Bali later this year, we need to launch talks immediately on a post-2012 climate change framework in order to conclude it by 2009. Also, for the first time the US has seriously committed to engaging in discussions on a post-2012 international climate change framework under the UNFCCC, and demonstrated its increased engagement by pledging to host a meeting of major energy consuming and greenhouse gas emitting countries, which will support and add momentum to the UNFCCC process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="70612-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07061285000004">The G8 leaders also discussed the rapidly growing movement towards the global establishment of emission trading schemes&#151;our preferred way of creating a price for carbon&#151;at national and sub-national level, and the importance of sharing experience on emissions trading as a precursor to the future linking of these schemes. As the Stern review highlighted, establishing a carbon price signal across countries and sectors will ensure that emissions reductions are delivered in the most cost-effective way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="70612-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07061285000005">So, despite what some might say, the G8 summit was an important step forward. Without global action or a  <br>

That is why this Government have sought to play&#151;and are playing&#151;a key leadership role internationally through our involvement in the UNFCCC and the G8 process, and in particular through the Gleneagles dialogue.</p>

 The Minister mentioned the emissions trading scheme. Have the Government been advised on what would be an appropriate price per tonne to aim for, if we are to achieve the kind of reductions necessary in the European Union? A company called Vattenfall has estimated &#8364;40 per tonne, and the recent price for 2008 permits was about &#8364;23. Do the Government&#146;s advisers or the Minister have a view on this matter?</p>

 It would not be appropriate for the Government to specify a figure in the carbon market. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that phase 1 of the carbon emissions trading scheme has been a learning-by-doing phase, and we in the UK have certainly not pretended that it has been perfect&#151;far from it. We have learned lessons, however, and we believe that the Commission has learned lessons, which is why phase 2 will represent a significant improvement and why the carbon price for phase 2 under shadow trading for 2008 contracts is significantly higher. We want to see a strong carbon price signal and it is important that the EU carbon trading scheme should receive popular support. It is the cornerstone of what could be an emerging world carbon market and we need to ensure that it is a robust scheme that ensures scarcity in the marketplace, which we did not see in phase 1.</p>

 That is precisely the point that I was going to raise. Does the Minister accept that it was the over-generous allocation of carbon credits to countries such as Spain that undermined the market in carbon and resulted in the low prices in the first tranche of the scheme? Does he agree that we need to tighten that up if the scheme is to be made to work?</p>

 I do not want to single out individual countries, but we need to recognise the success of the EU emissions trading scheme in getting a scheme that covers 45 per cent. of Europe&#146;s CO2 up and running. One of the key lessons to be learned is that we need to ensure scarcity overall if we are to have a carbon price that sends out the right signals to encourage long-term investment in low-carbon technologies. I am sure that we have all learned that lesson and taken it on board as part of phase 2 of the programme. As part of our review of the directive, we are reflecting also on how we can further improve that post-2012.</p>

and 2007 energy White Papers included a suite of measures for reducing carbon dioxide emissions and emissions of other greenhouse gases. It is simply not true to say that our performance on reducing greenhouse gas emissions&#151;and the UK has an impressive record as being one of the few countries that will double its Kyoto commitment&#151;is down to the dash for gas.

 I was saying that it was clear that we met the Kyoto target because of the dash for gas. That caused the steep reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions, which brought us below the target as long ago as 1999. Emissions have been going up since then, although they are perhaps not as high as they would have been without other measures.</p>

 We have not met the Kyoto target yet because it is over the period of 2008 to 2012. The effect of the dash for gas might account for at most a third of our reductions in greenhouse gas emissions overall. Our other reductions in greenhouse emissions are a direct result of the Government&#146;s actions on encouraging energy efficiency measures that have been taken by industry and the increase in the deployment of nuclear power during the 1990s. I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman cannot have it all ways. It simply is not true that all our performance on the Kyoto targets is down to the dash for gas. Nuclear has had a role to play, as has the Government&#146;s climate change programme.</p>

I admit that at the moment we are not on course to meet our target for 2010. It is a matter of regret, but we should not ignore the fact that making a 16.2 per cent. reduction, which is the latest projection, by 2012 is a significant commitment and achievement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="70612-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07061285000016">Looking further afield, the measures announced by the Government, including those recently set out in the energy White Paper, should help us to cut carbon dioxide emissions by more than a quarter by 2020, relative to 1990, even though the economy will have doubled in size. We are demonstrating that we can have green growth&#151;that carbon can be taken out of the economy&#151;and at the same time have high and stable levels of employment.</p>

I want to address that in particular because it is the gravamen of the comments by my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell. It is worth reminding the House that the Government have for some time recognised the need for a long-term target. That is why they committed themselves in the 2003 energy White Paper to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent. by 2050, a target recommended by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution.

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="70612-0016.htm_para14"><a name="07061285000018">Some&#151;including my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell&#151;suggest that that target is out of date, that the science has moved on, that the scale of the problem demands a greater response and that, consequently, the target for 2050 needs to be increased. Let me start by considering the response that is currently being recommended as part of the Climate Change Bill. As everyone knows, the European Commission has adopted the 2ºC limit as its stabilisation goal. It has said that for that to be met, the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases must remain well below 550 parts per million volume carbon dioxide equivalent. The European Union has said that that will require global greenhouse gas emissions to fall by between 15 and 50 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2050, with reductions in developed countries of between 60 and 80 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="70612-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07061285000019">As has been mentioned this evening, last year&#146;s Stern review of the economics of climate change recommended a long-term stabilisation goal of 450 to 550 parts per million of carbon dioxide equivalent, and showed that globally emissions need to peak in the next 10 years or so and then fall by 25 to 70 per cent. below 2005 levels&#151;equal to a 10 to 65 per cent. cut below 1990 levels&#151;by 2050. That means that industrialised countries such as the United Kingdom must reduce their greenhouse emissions by at least 60 per cent. by 2050. The Stern review also set out a strong case for urgent action to reduce emissions. The longer the world waits, the more costly and difficult it will be to make the reductions that are necessary to stabilise at 450 to 550 parts per million carbon dioxide equivalent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="70612-0016.htm_para16"><a name="07061285000020">The latest assessment report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change, published earlier this year, suggests that even more stringent reductions may be necessary. The panel&#146;s best estimate is that to stabilise the global mean temperature at between 2ºC and 2.4ºC above pre-industrial levels, concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere should be stabilised at between 445 and 490 parts per million carbon dioxide equivalent, and that that would require global emissions cuts of between 50 and 85 per cent. by 2050.</p>

They will reach 450 parts per million in less than 10 years. However, the Government&#146;s target of at least a 60 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions is consistent with what is being recommended, albeit at the lower end, and the Government have proposed legislation that would make that target legally binding.</p>

Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell said, in giving evidence last week to the ad-hoc Joint Committee scrutinising the draft Climate Change Bill, Sir David King, the Government&#146;s chief scientific adviser, stressed the importance of the long-term target being achievable and recognised that 60 per cent. is the correct target now. Interestingly, in its response to the draft Climate Change Bill consultation, which closed today, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution also thought that the 60 per cent. target was the right one for now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="70612-0016.htm_para22"><a name="07061285000033">We will continue to debate the science and we cannot predict with any certainty how it will evolve. There may be a need to amend the long-term target in the future, which is why it will be kept under review. The Climate Change Bill includes a provision to allow the target to be amended in the light of significant developments in scientific knowledge about climate change science, or international law or policy. That can be done by order, using the affirmative resolution procedure, to ensure that Parliament is guaranteed a debate and vote on the issue.</p>

We are saying that a more stringent target will require further advice, evidence, discussion and agreement. There is not a consensus on any of the targets at the moment, other than the 60 per cent. target contained in the draft Bill.</p>

 The Minister&#146;s quote from the fourth assessment report of the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change shows that if we do aim for the sort of cuts he is talking about, we will not hold global warming to within 2<sup>(o)</sup>C of pre-industrial levels. The science has moved on. Surely it is time for the Government to recognise that and to move with and be guided by the science, and not attempt to ignore it for reasons of political convenience.</p>

 The Government are certainly not ignoring the science; we have looked carefully at the fourth assessment report and I have tried to explain the Government&#146;s view in the light of our assessment of its findings. I have tried to say that the Government have an open mind and recognise that there is a dynamic process involved, which is why there is flexibility in the draft Climate Change Bill to be able to amend the target by order in the future if that is required.</p>

Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill) suggested that climate change emissions might be beyond the control of the Government, and he also referred to justiciability. That is not the spirit of Kyoto or what is required for the future. We took on legally binding commitments at Kyoto and we hope that we will take on legally binding commitments in a post-2012 regime. It is not, as he suggests, a question of the UK going it alone. He will be aware of the spring European Council decision on a 20 per cent cut. unilaterally across the European Union, and we want it to be more than that&#151;30 per cent. by 2020. We hope to see international agreement on that.</p>

There is a range of Government programmes that the hon. Member for Cheltenham wants to ignore at every possible occasion, but which are helping the UK in our drive to become a low-carbon economy.</p>

His speech was long on criticism but wrong in most respects where it gave credit for action to tackle climate change. He needs to address the nuclear issue&#151;and the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby might want to convince the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) of the benefits of nuclear.</p>

The Government are not hiding from that. We are looking for the best possible framework through which to address the global problem of climate change. As part of our international deliberations, we are considering in detail contraction and convergence, along with three or four other potential models in terms of the emissions reductions that can be delivered and the economic costs. As I have said to him  <br>

before, there is no international consensus about what is the right approach to adopt, but I understand the importance of contraction and convergence as a potential model.</p>

 I had an Adjournment debate on this subject shortly after the last election, when a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Minister said exactly the same thing. I would like to know when the considerations on the framework will be concluded. What will be our position when we go to Bali? Will we put a formula on the table and say, &#147;We understand that there is no consensus but we want to get a consensus around this formula, because this formula is the one that we have used to achieve our target in our legislation&#148;? It would be reasonable to propose that.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a good point. In Bali, we want to reach an agreement on a comprehensive framework for negotiations. We have talked about the need for a clear stabilisation goal, the need to recognise the important role that carbon markets can play, the importance of technology and of addressing deforestation, the need to adapt to climate change, and the need for common but differentiated  <br>

treatment to run through all the negotiations. As part of that common but differentiated treatment we need to look at the whole issue of equity, which is at the foundation of the contraction and convergence model. We cannot ignore the international context of a model. I have sympathy with the approach that my hon. Friend suggests, but we need to find the best way through to an agreement on a comprehensive framework that will work and that will avoid the most dangerous consequences of climate change. The Government are committed to doing that.</p>

It provides a coherent, long-term legal framework for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Many of the points made in the debate have also been raised in the consultation on the Bill, which closed today, and in the pre-legislative scrutiny process. We will reflect further on all the comments made tonight and those made by stakeholders as we bring forward the legislation for consideration by Parliament this autumn.</p>
