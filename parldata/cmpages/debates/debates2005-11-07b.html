 We are making good progress on all the major projects in the strategy. The first stages of the new accelerated asylum process are in place. We expect to handle all new claims under   the new process by September next year, and the   number of removals is increasing month on month. The public consultation on the new points system for economic migration, which we launched in July, closes today.

My constituents, particularly those from Somalia, have expressed concern about the inappropriate and premature removal of their families and friends. My constituents from Sri Lanka are worried about the human rights considerations of such removals where country agreements are in place. Can the Minister give some assurance that removals are made only where appropriate safeguards are in place?
</p>





<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51107-01_spnew1"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I can give my hon. Friend that assurance. Obviously, great care is taken by the immigration service to ensure that before a removal can take place, an individual is properly identified and documented. The documentation, of course, is important for their removal to be able to take place. With regard to removals to Zimbabwe, we are considering the verdict given by the asylum and immigration tribunal some days   ago, but we continue to consider matters on a case-by-case basis, and to take appropriate decisions as a result.
</p>





<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51107-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Peter Lilley  (Hitchin and Harpenden)</b> 
 (Con): Can the Minister explain why his plan for migration does not include a single reference to the Government Actuary&#039;s forecast that net immigration will add 6 million to the population of this country within 25 years? Why is there no provision for the land that will need to be set aside for the dwellings that will have to be built to house those people? Can he confirm that his colleague in another place has forecast that a third of new households in this country will be the result of net immigration in future?
</p>





<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51107-01_spnew3"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 What I can tell the right hon. Gentleman is that the Government will certainly not accept an arbitrary quota on migration, which was proposed by his party at the general election, and which, I believe, would be highly damaging to the British economy. We will not be going down that path, if that was the thrust of his question. The net contribution to our economy made by migrants should be celebrated, and it is high time that he and his party stopped playing

 (Lab): Is my hon. Friend aware that as recently as 1997, many of the people who came to our surgeries had been waiting seven or eight years for an asylum interview, never mind a decision? Will he tell us what the average time is now for an initial decision on asylum cases and the time that it takes for removal?
</p>





<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51107-01_spnew5"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I am grateful for that question, as my   hon. Friend raises an important point. When the Government came to power, the average time that it took for a case to be processed, I believe, was some two   years. That left families and individuals in an unacceptable kind of limbo, and made it all the more difficult to remove someone at the end of the process. In answer to his question, we have greatly reduced the time taken: in the vast majority of cases, a decision is made within a two-month time frame. He is right to point to the need for continued progress in this area, but I am pleased that he and I can celebrate the progress that has been made.

 (Con): Is the Minister aware that last month saw the publication of statistics showing net inward migration to this country of 223,000 in 2004, which was far more than the Government&#039;s estimates? According to the Office for National Statistics, it was the highest number since the present method of estimation began. Can the Minister say whether he expects his managed migration policy to result in a higher or lower level than 223,000?
</p>





<p><a name="st_8"><a name="51107-01_spnew7"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 What I can say to the hon. Gentleman is what I said to his right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) a moment ago. We will take decisions on levels of migration that are good for the British economy. If he wants me to set limits irrespective of the damage done to the British economy, that is a policy that Conservative policy should state openly and allow people to debate. If that is the way that he wants to go, I would be interested to hear the discussions between him and the CBI about that proposal.

Can he explain why that is happening?
</p>





<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51107-01_spnew9"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has raised some important issues. Removals are always difficult and present the immigration service with issues that are hard to deal with, but I assure my hon.

Early-morning visits tend to be made at a time when the family will be together, for obvious reasons, but they are not made before 6 am, and are normally made between 6 am and 7 am.

They will be able to vote in those elections&#151;for the party that allowed them to come here and contribute to the United Kingdom&#039;s economy, not for that lot.

<p><a name="qn_1">2. <a name="51107-02_wqn0"><b> Mr. Philip Dunne  (Ludlow)</b> 
 (Con): If he will make a statement on the performance of West Mercia police.  [24790]


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Nov 2005 : Column 5</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>


<p><a name="st_16"><a name="51107-02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the   Home Department  (Paul Goggins): </b> 
 The police performance assessments published by the Home Office and Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Constabulary on 27   October show that in 2004&#150;05 the West Mercia police force achieved a very positive assessment of its performance across the range of its core policing activity. All delivery grades are either good or excellent, and most direction grades have improved.
</p>





<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51107-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Dunne: </b> 
 I am sure the Minister agrees that we should congratulate Paul West, the chief constable, on the fact that his force not only achieved those grades but   was the top-performing force in the country, on the   Minister&#039;s own criteria. How does he reconcile that   outstanding performance with his Department&#039;s arbitrary decision, made during the current &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; consultation, that there should be a minimum force size of 4,000 officers? West Mercia has just proved that, with only 2,400 officers, it can deliver the best performance for the best value in the country.
</p>





<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51107-02_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I am happy to join the hon. Gentleman in praising Paul West and all his officers and staff for their tremendous achievements. They have cut crime in their area by 13 per cent. Burglary, for example, is down by 22 per cent. However, there is no contradiction between giving that praise clearly in the House and elsewhere and accepting the advice of Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate that, in order that we can deal with terrorism and serious organised crime, and ensure that neighbourhood policing is not taken away from local communities, we need to have strategic forces of the size that it suggests: 4,000 officers and 6,000 staff. Those are not arbitrary figures. Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate judges that those are the numbers that we need.
</p>





<p><a name="st_19"><a name="51107-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Michael Foster  (Worcester)</b> 
 (Lab): May I add my congratulations to the chief constable and the team at West Mercia? What is the Minister&#039;s assessment of the position in relation to violent crime in West Mercia and the police&#039;s performance overall on that aspect? In making that assessment, can he perhaps refer to adverts that were carried across West Mercia just a few months ago, paid for by the Conservative party, that said that violent crime went up in West Mercia when, in West Mercia and in many other regions, it actually went down?
</p>





<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51107-02_spnew3"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that important point. I confirm that, in the past year in West Mercia, robbery went down by 19 per cent., so it is a safer place to live in. Again, the police deserve praise for that. In relation to the change that is being suggested by the inspectorate and the need to ensure that we have robust strategic police forces, there is no blueprint. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department has no blueprint for the forces that will emerge. He wants to hear from local opinion. Hon. Members on both sides of the House will be able to contribute to that consultation.

 The police authority in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s area received a fair assessment and a fair allocation, but he has just used an interesting word&#151;&quot;overstretched&quot;. In fact, as we have discussed, the police are performing remarkably well. Think about how the police in his area will deal with the threats posed by terrorists and serious organised crime and the increasing pressure that that brings. If we do not make these structural changes now, there will be a tendency for police to be drawn away from the local neighbourhood and local communities that he may represent. It is in order to get that balance right that we need to press ahead and to form these new larger strategic forces.

 That is quite a revelation. I have been informed, perhaps misinformed, that there are currently five vacancies.

 No, I entirely reject the hon. Gentleman&#039;s assertion. I ask him to check his numbers. We have three vacancies. Cambridgeshire has decided to make an appointment for a 12-month period because of the pending restructuring. Lancashire and Norfolk both   have temporary appointments in place. They are ensuring that their forces have good leadership and a proper command team. The purpose of looking at the restructuring of our forces is to ensure that they have the   capacity and capability to look at the range of challenges and threats that they face.

 I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s concern and he is a great champion of policing in Lancashire. We have just published the police performance assessment and Lancashire is doing an extremely good job; it is one of our really good forces, with two excellent grades, three good grades and two fair grades. The force is going in the right direction. My hon. Friend will always be keen to make sure that his area gets the very best policing, but he will agree that the force is doing a good job. I have no doubt that the members of the command team will keep their eyes on the ball and make sure that they are delivering to the people of Lancashire.

</p>





<p><a name="st_31"><a name="51107-02_spnew13"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman will be well aware that the basic unit of policing in his area will be a basic command unit with a borough commander, which is the basis on which neighbourhood policing will be provided. We have a commitment to ensure that every community, urban and rural, has a dedicated, available and accessible neighbourhood policing team by 2008. People will have the team&#039;s mobile phone numbers and can contact them, and they will have the same officers for two or three years. That is the way in which the hon.

 It is very important that the debate be led by police authorities and police forces, and it must involve Members of Parliament and local councils.

I cannot say at this stage what the procedure will be in terms of that recruitment process, but I am clear that the police authorities need to be fully involved in the process so that they get the command teams that can do the job we want them to do.

 My hon. Friend is entirely correct to identify the issue of co-operation between police forces and international organisations. I am glad to say a recent agreement between Europol and Interpol has led to a tangible increase in strategic co-operation. They now have joint incident response teams and are involved in joint contingency planning for terrorist attacks. This country is working to support such co-operation, and two members of the National Crime Squad are working in Europol&#039;s national liaison unit to achieve better relations overall.

</p>


<p><a name="st_49"><a name="51107-03_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Fiona Mactaggart): </b> 
 The national delivery plan for domestic violence, published in March 2005, sets out eight performance indicators that are used at national, police force and local level to monitor the impact of action against domestic violence. The plan is performance managed by the inter-ministerial group on domestic violence and reviewed quarterly. The number of domestic violence cases that result in successful prosecutions has risen from 53 per cent. in 2004&#150;05 to 59 per cent. in the first two quarters of the present year.
</p>





<p><a name="st_50"><a name="51107-03_spnew12"><b> Lyn Brown: </b> 
 In March, the Home Office released a report that mentioned specialist courts for domestic violence cases to enable more support for victims and better advocacy. Will the Minister tell us how those courts are now delivering?
</p>





<p><a name="st_51"><a name="51107-03_spnew13"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 This year we will be rolling out 25 specialist courts and eight are already in place. The pilot, which revealed what those courts could achieve, showed that in Caerphilly, guilty pleas increased from 21 to 27 per cent. and by September this year they had averaged 61 per cent.&#151;an indication of their increasing success. Convictions in court went up from 8 per cent. to 19 per cent. in the pilot period and they have now reached 32 per cent. Victim withdrawals, which have been a particular problem with domestic violence cases, went down from 53 to 27 per cent. in the pilot period and have now decreased further to 17 per cent. In addition, together with the specialist courts, domestic violence advocates help women to go through all the complications of the different bits of the system that deal with domestic violence&#151;ensuring not only that they get successful convictions, but that the system meets those women&#039;s needs rather than their having to meet its needs.

While some excellent work is being done to make perpetrators confront their behaviour, do not those figures underline the importance of giving effect to sections in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, which make assault an arrestable offence and make breach of injunctions a criminal offence? Why have they not yet been brought into effect and when will they become enforceable?

</p>


<p><a name="st_56"><a name="51107-04_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Andy Burnham): </b> 
 The national DNA   database is the biggest operational policing DNA database in the world. It now holds more than 3.3 million DNA profiles and provides the police with around 3,000 intelligence matches each month. The annual number of direct DNA detections more than doubled from 8,612 in 1999&#150;2000 to 19,873 in 2004&#150;05. In addition, a further 15,732 crimes were detected in 2004&#150;05 as a result of further investigations linked to the original case in which DNA was recovered.

 I thank the Minister for that answer, but I wonder if he is aware that earlier this year figures showed that 32 per cent. of all black males in the UK were on the DNA database, but only 8 per cent. of white males.

 I know that the hon. Lady has shown an interest in this subject and has tabled parliamentary questions on it. The data held on race profiles are not directly accurate, in that they are derived from the impressions of the police officer in the custody suite, not a statement by the individuals involved. There are therefore problems with providing the data that she requires. However, the procedures apply across the piece to people who have been arrested, so they are not discriminatory. Moreover, huge public benefit is derived from the database with regard to the detection of serious crime.

<p><a name="st_60"><a name="51107-04_spnew3"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 They are allowed to keep the DNA to help with the solving of serious crime. My hon. Friend will know that some serious offences have been solved by using the database. For example, in 2001 a shoplifter was arrested in Derby. His DNA was taken and found to match that in a rape that was committed in 1998 in Canterbury. If people are guilty of no crime, having their DNA on record can only help to ensure that they are not wrongly accused of a crime.

<p><a name="st_62"><a name="51107-04_spnew5"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 The national DNA database is not linked to the Department of Health. It is focused on the solving of serious crime and is a major operational tool for the police to use to ensure greater reliability in connecting the guilty to a crime. There is no direct link to the systems that the Department of Health is introducing. The Government have invested some &#163;300 million in expanding the DNA database.

 Drug treatment plays a key role in rehabilitating offenders and reducing reoffending. That is why we have developed a comprehensive structure to deliver drug treatment to offenders wherever they are in the criminal justice system, and have invested heavily in a range of programmes, including enhanced treatment in prison, the drug interventions programme and drug rehabilitation requirements for community sentences.
</p>





<p><a name="st_66"><a name="51107-04_spnew8"><b> Mr. Burrowes: </b> 
 I am grateful for the Minister&#039;s response, but does he share my grave concern about drugs in Pentonville? A recent inmate struggling to rehabilitate himself from drugs told me that the prison is awash with drugs, with cannabis bars thrown over the walls, and crack cocaine and heroin easier and cheaper to obtain inside the prison than outside. When will the Minister and the Government take action to deal with that scandal, which is happening not just in Pentonville but in prisons throughout the country?
</p>





<p><a name="st_67"><a name="51107-04_spnew9"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The Prison Service, prison governors and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety work hard to counter drugs being brought into our prisons. The problem is significant and nobody can deny it, but the failure rate for mandatory drug testing was 24 per cent. 10 years ago and it is now down to 11 per cent., so I hope the hon. Gentleman will recognise that that is an indication that the efforts of staff in all our prisons to reduce the amount of drugs coming into prison and being misused by people in prison are having some impact. I do not deny for a minute that the hon. Gentleman makes an important point: this is an evil and we need to continue to work together to bear down on it.

 May I express some mild surprise? The hon.

The number of people employed to work with drug misusers has increased from 6,000 to 10,000 as a result of the massive investment that the Government have made, not just for offenders in prison but for offenders in the community; 55,000 offenders in prison were on a maintenance or detoxification programme last year and 40 per cent. of all prisoners are on voluntary drug testing.

<p><a name="st_73"><a name="51107-04_spnew15"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 We will not be deflected from harm minimisation, because it is essential that people who misuse drugs are helped to get off them and that the people whose houses they burgle and whose lives are made a misery owing to that criminality can also be protected. We have invested massively in drug treatment: the pooled drug treatment budget increases to &#163;478 million in two years&#151;an astronomical increase. We are absolutely determined to ensure that when people caught up in criminality as a result of their drug misuse want to change their behaviour we will give them every assistance to do so, but if they will not change they will have to take the consequences.

 (Con): Many hon. Members hope that the current reorganisation of police forces, on which the Government are consulting, will lead to a reduction in administrative burdens, although we remain to be convinced of that. Those of us who represent rural areas with small police forces must weigh that against what we think will be a reduction in local democratic accountability and pressure on rural policing because big cities drag in more of the resources. Are the Government prepared, in response to that consultation, to entertain proposals that would create two levels of policing&#151;one at regional or national level that would deal with very serious crime, thereby leaving local policing to locally accountable police forces?

<br>&nbsp;<br>force level, and then the national and international levels that we have now. We are about to establish the   Serious Organised Crime Agency, which will look at those national and international levels. However, it is   crucial that all those levels of policing should stay   connected because very often local community intelligence can help to tackle neighbourhood crime, more serious, organised crime and even international crime. I would not want those forces to become divorced   from one another. The concentration on neighbourhood policing is very much the top priority for me because that is where the public want to see their officers, and people should have that relationship with their local police in rural areas as much as in urban ones. Having strategic forces ought to reinforce the ability of the neighbourhood police because if there is a big murder in a small force, very often neighbourhood officers get taken away to deal with that complex crime, but bigger forces have the resilience to ensure that that does not happen.

 I know that my hon. Friend has been campaigning on this issue for some time. I also know that he regularly goes out on patrol with his force, so he sees for himself what is happening on the ground. Several areas are piloting the use of hand-held computer devices, which means that officers do not have to go back to the station. The increasing civilianisation of custody suites means that officers can hand over prisoners to civilians to be put through custody, which means that more officers can be released to the front line so that they can patrol and give the public the reassurance that they want.

If the police do, as they say to me, have to fill in many forms, which keeps them in the police station, rural areas are clearly suffering from inadequate numbers of bobbies on the beat.

 I thank my hon. Friend for that reply and share her concern about the individual whom she named. Does she share the anger of local people in my area, and the frustration of senior police officers, after discovering that a prolific local offender had been in breach of his tagging order 22 separate times and that Securicor, the contractor, had failed to inform the police of those breaches, which became apparent only when the man was arrested for committing a public order offence while in breach of his electronic tagging order for the 22nd time? Is that not a disgrace? Will the Minister carefully examine Securicor&#039;s behaviour?

 I am very keen to examine carefully any breaches of the agreement that we have with the electronic monitoring companies. One of the   changes to which I referred is that 100 per cent. of   actions by them are now monitored by us. A breach of the sort that my hon. Friend described would thus automatically affect the contract with the company involved. If he will provide me with further details of the   case, I will certainly look at it to ensure that it has been properly followed up. The scheme can be an effective way of monitoring offenders. It can help to regulate offenders&#039; behaviour between prison and the community and have positive effects, but only if it is operated effectively by the monitoring companies.

Two weeks ago I visited Group 4 Securicor&#039;s tagging headquarters and was surprised to learn from the company that it is currently not subject to an inspection regime. With more than 3,000 prisoners tagged and high-profile failures, why is there no specific provision for an inspection regime in this highly sensitive area?

 The company&#039;s performance is monitored regularly by staff employed by the Home Office, and they are required to report on a series of particular performance indicators, including how quickly breaches are reported and brought back to court, for example. Under the new contract, any failure on any case is counted as a breach. It is not a sampling system, as it was under the old contract.

<p><a name="st_95"><a name="51107-06_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Fiona Mactaggart): </b> 
 A programme of management action has resulted in a reduction in sickness absence in the public sector Prison Service. That includes improved monitoring by senior managers, staff access to occupational health support, particularly for stress and back pain, and a willingness by management to take the difficult decisions either to retire medically or dismiss staff on the ground of medical inefficiency where they are unable to give regular and effective service. In nine out of the 10 prisons with the   highest levels of sickness absence as identified in the PAC&#039;s report, there has been an average reduction in sickness absence of 36 per cent. since 2002&#150;03.

 In those statistics, the Minister did not mention that the Prison Service still has the highest sickness absence in the civil service, that sickness absence in the 10 worst offending prisons has fallen only from 22 days to 15 days a year, or that, astonishingly, prison officers in two prisons are taking one in every five weeks off sick.

 The hon. Gentleman is right to say that sickness absence is a serious problem. When his Committee produced its helpful report identifying that there was a serious problem, the difference between the average amount of sickness absence in public sector and private sector prisons was about seven days. It is now below one day. We have reduced the number of days taken as absence in each of the 10 prisons identified in the report by more than seven days.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the collapse of the court martial of seven paratroopers from the 3rd Battalion the Parachute Regiment, accused of murdering an Iraqi civilian two years ago.
</p>





<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51107-06_spmin3"><b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence  (Mr. Adam Ingram): </b> 
 I want to make it clear from the outset that the armed forces operate to the very highest standards. All personnel are aware of the necessity to operate within the law. It remains MOD policy to initiate a service police investigation into every instance where the action of British service personnel may have led directly to the death or injury of Iraqi civilians. The Government back our troops fully. I, together with the chiefs of staff, am very proud of the role that British armed forces play in the world. They do an exceptional job in very difficult circumstances and operate to the very highest standards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The trial of the seven members and former members of the 3rd Battalion the Parachute Regiment concluded on 3 November in Colchester, after the Judge Advocate General directed the board to find all seven defendants not guilty. The trial related to an incident in Iraq which occurred at the roadside in Maysan province in southern Iraq on 11 May 2003, following which Mr. Nadhem Abdullah, an Iraqi citizen, died. The seven individuals were jointly charged with murder and violent disorder.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">I am limited as to what I can say about the Judge Advocate General&#039;s decision, as this is a matter for my noble and learned Friend the Attorney-General. However, it may be helpful if I place the trial in its operational context.The end of the trial has raised the question of why the soldiers faced those serious charges. Soldiers understand that they are required to operate within the law and their rules of engagement and can be held to account for their actions. All soldiers in Iraq and elsewhere receive a briefing on that. They also receive training in the law of armed conflict as part of their annual training. Soldiers are not above the law.

<a name="51107-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Whenever an incident occurs or an allegation is made,   a Royal Military Police&#151;RMP&#151;investigation is launched by the commanding officer. The conduct and   scope of such investigations is determined independently of the chain of command. The RMP   special investigation branch&#151;SIB&#151;is a fully professional investigative agency, which conforms to UK Home Office standards, where appropriate, and follows civilian police investigative procedures. Investigations are carried out thoroughly, professionally and in accordance with the rules of evidence, UK best practice and the Association of Chief Police Officers standards, but operational circumstances or cultural differences may limit the forensic and investigative opportunities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">In this case, the Royal Military Police was operating in a hostile and volatile environment, which clearly impacted on some aspects of its investigation, both in terms of its scope and its timing. The decision to prosecute was taken by the Army prosecuting authority based upon the evidence gathered by the RMP. The APA acts as prosecutor in all courts martial and has a similar role to that of the Crown Prosecution Service in

</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">The Judge Advocate General made it clear that he had no criticism of the Army prosecuting authority in   bringing the case to trial. This court martial demonstrates the Army&#039;s commitment to transparency and accountability. It was held in open court, where it was open to full public scrutiny, and to the same standards of justice and independence that are present in the civilian justice system. All the parties and authorities involved, military and civilian, acted properly and in good faith.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">The British Army is not complacent. Following all operational commitments, a process of continuous and determined professional review is undertaken. The comments of the Judge Advocate General are being considered and a comprehensive review of the 3 Para trial is under way. In addition, the Army announced a review following the trial earlier this year of members of 1 Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. The review is being conducted on behalf of the Chief of the General Staff by a senior experienced officer and is looking at issues arising from concluded courts martial relating to deliberate acts of abuse. It will seek to learn lessons and look at wider issues emerging from trials and other reports, in order to safeguard and improve the Army&#039;s operational effectiveness. Any findings can be published only after all the courts martial have concluded, so publication is therefore likely to be some time in the future.

More than 80,000 servicemen and women have served in Iraq&#151;only a very small number of them have been accused of ill treatment of Iraqi civilians, and a number of those have already been cleared of any wrongdoing, as in this case.

He, like me, pays frequent and heartfelt tribute to our armed forces&#151;he has done so again today, and I join him in doing so. Indeed, it is for that reason that I have put down this question because, as he

<a name="stpa_8">Of course, where a crime has been committed and the evidence substantiates it, it must be prosecuted, but that   was clearly not the case here.

<a name="stpa_10">We need urgent answers to those questions. They also form part of a wider concern about the serious damage to morale arising from doubtless well-intentioned but ultimately unsubstantiated prosecutions such as these and that against Trooper Williams, which also collapsed earlier this year. We must never forget that our forces are operating in a highly dangerous and hostile environment where confidence is essential and where nearly 100 of our soldiers have lost their lives. They cannot operate effectively with the spectre of the lawyer metaphorically looking over their shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_11">Does the Minister agree that such prosecutions are highly damaging to recruitment and retention, both of which are under severe pressure?

Will he undertake to initiate a full review of how such prosecutions are undertaken?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-07_para4">

<a name="stpa_15">All judicial processes have to be wholly independent, and those circumstances applied in this case. I recognise the way in which it has played out. Great publicity was given to it and it was sometimes exploited by those commenting on it, perhaps for political purposes, on both sides of the debate&#151;those who want to oppose the Government per se and those who want to oppose what the Government are doing in Iraq overall. That does not help in the judicial process, which must be wholly independent and, in the right sense of the word, calculating in terms of all the evidence that is before it. The Judge Advocate General determined that there was true justification for bringing this case to trial and sufficient material evidence so to do. He also recognised the very difficult circumstances in which the SIB carried out its investigations, although he went on to comment on what he perceived to be the failings in those investigations that ultimately led to the collapse of the case.

I give the right hon. and learned Gentleman that commitment. As I said in my opening statement, that review is under way.

Some of the comments that are made off side do not help morale because they undermine the difficult task that our soldiers face.

That happens in civilian life, too, but does not mean that the Attorney-General should not be involved in due process. I am not a lawyer, but I believe that it is right that the highest judicial authority in the land examines such matters if required because that places a protection in the system of proper legal assessment of all aspects that are presented.

It so happens that, in this trial, a view was taken that those involved in hearing the trial should visit the scene. However, it was   judged to be too dangerous for them to do so. It could also be too dangerous in many circumstances for   the Royal Military Police to carry out further investigations. This would not be for a lack of trying, or for a lack of resources, but because circumstances might just dictate that it was impossible. I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands that.

 If I may, I wish to put this proposition to my right hon. Friend as honestly and sincerely as possible. I accept that our soldiers have to operate under the rule of law&#151;that is what makes them different from the people they are fighting against&#151;and we must ensure that any trial or action abroad is totally independent. We must make that as clear as possible, so as to dismiss any allegations that political pressure has been brought to bear to ensure that this trial took place. We must be seen to be operating according to the letter of the law, to win friends in places such as Iraq. Will my right hon. Friend give the House an assurance that there was no political involvement in, and no political pressure brought to bear on, these cases?

I   can give him an absolute guarantee, as I tried to do in my opening response, that there was no political interference in this matter&#151;nor should there be. It would be wholly damaging if we were acting on one side of the debate. It could damage the independence of the judicial process or the morale of the troops if things were going the other way. We have been completely hands off. The Army prosecuting authority is wholly independent, as are the investigation processes. Some of   the nuances involved, such as the role of the commanding officer, will of course be considered during the process of the Armed Forces Bill. I am sure that my hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>recruitment and retention. Will the Minister confirm that only a tiny, tiny minority of our armed forces are ever accused, let alone found guilty, of wrong doing, and that when young men and women decide to take up a career in the armed forces, they carry with them the pride and the reputation of this country and the thanks of this House?
</p>





<p><a name="st_11"><a name="51107-08_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman makes a valuable and important point. The answer to his question is yes, only a very small number is involved. As I have said, two more cases have been directed and two await direction, so we shall have more of this debate. The men and women, many of whom are very young, who join the armed forces are joining a highly professional, highly capable organisation, which seeks to deliver the good face of this country. They are a force for good. As in any part of our society, when people step over the line and do wrong they must be brought to justice. That applies to the armed forces as much as to   anyone else. However, given that more than 80,000 of our armed forces have served in Iraq, and only a very small number have been accused never mind found guilty of wrongdoing, that speaks volumes for their quality. Clearly, that should encourage more young people to consider the armed forces as a career.

 Will the Minister put on the record that the seven serving and former members of the 3rd Battalion the Parachute Regiment left that court martial without a stain on their character? Can I advise him that the relief across the Colchester garrison and the wider community is matched only by the disbelief that the trial happened in the first place? Many figures have been mentioned, but can he indicate how much the whole saga cost?

 On the cost issue, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that when dealing with QCs the cash register keeps running for some time afterwards, so the total cost is not available. It was very sizeable, however, given that each individual had a QC and all the support arrangements that applied. When any of our people are subjected to the rule of law in terms of court action, we are determined that they should be given full support. In addition, although I cannot give him a precise answer, we probably do not count in all the welfare support and man hours that contribute to providing that type of support to our people, who, we recognise, can be very fragile in such circumstances.

<p><a name="st_56"><a name="51107-10_spnew20"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 By definition, if we are not taking a decision now to revalue but are keeping our options open, all options remain open in future. But we have made it clear that we think it right to keep property tax as the basis of local taxation, to invite Sir Michael Lyons to complete his review, and to assess the role of a revalued council tax in that context.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_36">As the House knows, at the same time as we announced the extension of Sir Michael&#039;s remit, we   announced that we intended to legislate to postpone council tax revaluation. As our announcement explained, the case for revaluation&#151;that it is right to maintain a fair alignment between house prices and council tax bands&#151;is linked to wider questions about the structure of council tax and to the operation of council tax benefit. It is also relevant that a number of   other changes in the local government finance system are imminent, including the move to three-year budgets, the review of the local government finance formula, and the creation of a dedicated schools budget located in the Department for Education and Skills.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_37">We have reached the view, therefore, that to proceed with the current timetable for revaluation would not be sensible. We have concluded that we need the flexibility to revalue as part of a fully developed package of funding reforms, rather than as a precursor to them, and at a moment of greater financial stability for local authorities.

 The right hon. Gentleman is being extremely generous in giving way. All the things that he has just announced were known when the Government decided to move towards revaluation. They have spent &#163;60 million on it,   of which &#163;45 million was spent on software alone.

 I think that the hon. Gentleman may be referring to the statement of 20 September, which was repeated before the House on 10 October. If he read on, he would see that we expect the Government to come forward with their views during the completion of the comprehensive spending review in the summer of 2007. As I said, that was made clear on 20 September.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_39">Although this is a short Bill, it may help the House if I   explain its effects. First, it removes the requirement laid down by the Local Government Finance Act 1992 for the compilation of new lists on 1 April 2007. Clause 1(3) amends section 22B of the 1992 Act by removing the duty on the listing agency&#151;in practice, that means the Valuation Office Agency&#151;to compile a new valuation list to billing authorities in England on 1 April 2007 and a draft of that list to be completed by 1 September next year. We have already informed the   House that the VOA has stopped work on the revaluation of domestic properties in England to prevent nugatory expenditure&#151;and the provision formalises that position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_40">Secondly, subsection (4) removes the requirement for subsequent revaluations on the 10th anniversary of the previous one, unless an earlier date has been specified by   order. Until the Government have received and considered Sir Michael Lyons&#039; final report, we cannot take a view on how frequently revaluation should occur and we therefore think it right that we should not be   statutorily committed to revaluing on a rigid, predetermined cycle.

 I hear my hon. Friend&#039;s argument for postponement&#151;I do not agree with it&#151;but I do not understand the argument for deleting the provision for a 10-yearly cycle for revaluation. That was the subject of Government consultation in 1999&#150;2000 and was the subject of a White Paper, which set out a commitment to a 10-year revaluation. As far as I know, Sir Michael Lyons has not been asked to comment on whether that revaluation cycle should change. I simply do not understand the Minister&#039;s logic for cancelling a provision for regulation revaluations.

 He is, indeed, my very good friend and he speaks with a great deal of authority on these matters. He will know more than anyone else that at the time of the 2002 Bill there was a great deal of discussion about   the requisite period.

<a name="stpa_41">As my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) knows, there was considerable discussion about the period and we think that it is right to keep the flexibility created by the clause.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_42">Finally, the Bill replaces those two provisions for revaluation, for at least 10-yearly intervals, with a power for the Secretary of State to specify the date on which a new valuation list must be compiled. Such orders will be subject to the House&#039;s affirmative resolution procedure. That was also the case in respect of the Local Government Finance Act 1992, which created the council tax in the first place. For the sake of completeness, clause 2 simply provides for the short title of the Bill and for its extent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_43">I can bring the House up to date with progress at the   Valuation Office Agency, which was responsible for carrying out the revaluation. Immediately following the announcement, the VOA took steps to reduce ongoing expenditure and to reshape the agency to fit the new situation. Some 420 staff employed as casuals or on fixed term contracts will have left the agency by the 18 November. A voluntary early departure scheme has been announced, with some 600 staff expected to depart between March and June 2006. Coupled with natural wastage, the total reduction is expected to amount to some 1,250 staff.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_44">As we set out on 20 September, there will be significant short-term savings for the Government from   not proceeding with revaluation. However, the Government have been explicit that &#163;45 million of the   &#163;60 million spent so far is a prudent investment in modern and efficient working practices. The VOA will ensure that the country has an up-to-date, electronic property database, available as a source of accurate data.

Does the cancellation of the revaluation mean that if we reinstate the revaluation for council tax in the future, we shall be blocked from going anywhere near 2010 because of the implications for staffing?

<b>7 Nov 2005 : Column 42</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a system of bandings means that there is no need for regular or frequent revaluations. The only reason why Labour wants to revalue and re-band the council tax is to tax the uplift in property values that has taken place since the early 1990s.

<a name="stpa_76">As the Minister has said, the Bill essentially does three things. It removes the requirement for a new valuation by 1 April 2007&#151;we agree with that.

Finally, it will empower the Secretary of State to determine when a revaluation should take place, with which we do not agree. As Labour Members will testify, the Library has produced an excellent brief that details the problems that have occurred because of revaluation in the past and all the problems due to the postponement of revaluation, especially. Given the nature of the council tax and the bandings, we think that the most sensible thing would be for a decision to be taken on the Floor of the House&#151;by way of primary legislation&#151;each time revaluation needs to takes place.

I was the Minister who had the misfortune of taking the legislation through the House with Michael Portillo. We specifically looked at how property could be revalued from time to time, and I remember an exchange in debate in the middle of the night between the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), who has just left the Government again, and my right hon. Friend, as he then was, about whether we should have inflatable balloons floating over people&#039;s back yards, which is no sillier a suggestion than those we have heard this weekend. This is not just a question of balancing function and who pays. The Minister of Communities and Local Government has forgotten that the whole point about whether local government finance is to succeed is where the balance lies between Treasury funding and the raising of tax locally.

 Is my hon. Friend familiar with another aspect of council tax&#151;that students are not required to pay it? The Government helpfully provide a CBT1 form, which is returned by local authorities to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister each year recording the number of properties in the hands of students, but because the reporting time is in the autumn, the actual number of student properties is not known until the following spring. Students are generally slow to return their council tax demands and to get an exemption form. As a result, areas such as mine miss out to the tune of &#163;500,000 or &#163;750,000 and face a further problem, which is surely why people are paying too much through their council tax.

<a name="stpa_81">The Government&#039;s increased use of means-tested benefits and complex application forms has resulted in reduced take-up of council tax benefits, which means that more people on lower incomes are paying higher council taxes. Fewer than two in three eligible pensioners claim the council tax benefit to which they are entitled, compared with three out of four before Labour came to power. It is a terrible indictment of the Government that the take-up of benefit should drop so significantly under their care. The Government should feel ashamed of this unmet pensioner poverty.

<a name="stpa_82">The House deludes itself if it believes that revaluing property or adding further bands will cure the unpopularity of the council tax. The increase in the   proportion of the tax taken from household budgets is a symptom of a desperate problem. The revenue generated by local authority&#039;s tax base has a direct effect on the size of the revenue support grant. Ring-fenced grants often distort the calls on the council tax&#151;the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Robert Key) made so eloquently a few moments ago.

<a name="stpa_90">The revaluation is much more complex than that undertaken in 1992. The 1992 revaluation, which established the council tax, placed each house into one of eight valuation bands based on 1991 house prices, with the bands being determined by primary legislation. The banding of the individual properties commenced in January 1992, and the draft valuation lists were published in December 1992. In other words, valuers knew the banding structure when they conducted their assessments. They did not need to draw up a list of numerical valuations for each property and merely had to place each property in a band.

 The right hon. Gentleman rightly highlights that the existing framework provides for revaluation if a property&#039;s value has materially changed and it has been sold. However, that does not apply if the property remains in the hands of the existing owner. That is one of the many inherent anomalies in a system which has prolonged gaps between regular revaluations, and one of the strong arguments in favour of a regular cycle of revaluation.

<a name="stpa_103">The problem with the Government&#039;s position is that, although they say that they are postponing, not cancelling, revaluation, they have given no indication about when the postponed revaluation will take place. The date of 2007 was set for revaluation after a lengthy period of consultation. The Green Paper, &quot;Modernising Local Government Finance&quot;, which was issued in autumn 2000, invited views on whether there should be   provision for regular revaluations and, if so, how   frequently. It was suggested that there might be six-yearly, eight-yearly or 10-yearly gaps between revaluations.

<p>
<a name="51107-15_para8">
<a name="stpa_104">The 2001 local government White Paper, which I had the privilege of preparing and implementing, made it   clear that respondents to the consultation overwhelmingly supported the principle of a fixed cycle. The White Paper announced the Government&#039;s conclusion that there should be a regular 10-yearly cycle of revaluation, with the first being based on 2005 values and taking effect from 2007. There was a logic behind that.

<a name="stpa_105">As my hon.

It was therefore considered sensible to conduct the first revaluation of council tax as soon as possible after the completion of the 2005 business rates revaluation and well before that of 2010. That was the logic behind choosing 2007.

<a name="stpa_106">That was not only agreed through all the usual channels of Government but, because legislation was required to effect the decision, debated at length in 2003 during the passage of the Local Government Bill.

 No, it does not. If the hon.

The argument in favour of a council tax is that it is relatively simple to collect and difficult to evade, and that it meets with a high level of acceptance. There are huge problems with his party&#039;s preferred alternative of a local income tax, which is neither predictable nor easily collectable. It would also be very easy to evade, and it would be open to huge administrative costs. It would also place burdens on business and result in arbitrary consequences for households with two or more earners, who would find that they were clobbered. The hon.

That was the remit given to Sir Michael Lyons, and that is the premise on which we are proceeding. If, in future, alternative plans are put forward, hon.

<a name="stpa_110">What are the consequences of the Bill? We know that the basis of the council tax&#151;the 1991 values&#151;will become increasingly remote from reality as we get further away from the current valuation date. Having to calculate notional 1991 values for every new property built is nonsense. As I mentioned in our previous debate on the subject, some areas of my constituency were entirely void industrial wastelands 15 years ago, and anything built there would have had no value at all, so, now, it is slightly odd to create notional 1991 values for properties built as a result of that area&#039;s regeneration. That pattern is replicated all over the country. In addition, as the former Minister responsible for local government, the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) rightly highlighted, there are already provisions for revaluation of some properties where those properties change hands and there has been a material change in value. The anomalies will therefore get worse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_111">The overwhelming majority of properties, of course, have increased significantly in value since 1991&#151;by some 216 per cent. on average, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.

<br>&nbsp;<br>frightened into believing that because their property&#039;s value has increased dramatically over the past 14 years, they will be clobbered by revaluation. That is fuelled by unscrupulous Opposition scaremongering, of which we saw a great deal in the run-up to the general election, and of which we have heard a great deal more today. That does not help to foster a serious and rational debate about the proper system of finance for local government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_112">As the Government have made repeatedly clear from 2001 onwards, however, the purpose of revaluation is not to increase the council tax yield but simply to bring values up to date, so that the tax is based on modern values rather than values that are increasingly remote from reality. Were the bands to be increased in line with house price inflation since 1991, most households would find themselves in the same band as before, with no increased liability for council tax. I have seen no recent Government estimates for the numbers of households whose banding would either increase or decrease under a revaluation. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Communities and Local Government has assured me that no new Government estimates have been prepared for Ministers since the election. The only official figures are those prepared previously&#151;before the April 2005 valuation date. I am a little surprised that new estimates have not been prepared to inform Ministers&#039; decision to postpone the revaluation, but in the absence of up-to-date official figures, we can only go on the evidence produced by well-informed commentators such as the RICS and the Halifax building society. Both indicate that the majority of households would have remained in the same band as a result of revaluation, and also suggest that more households would have gained than would have lost.

<br>&nbsp;<br>there would be no increase in yield. I warn Members of what I call the mother of Parliaments, here in London, that they could be making the same mistake.

<p><a name="st_134"><a name="51107-16_spnew12"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 There is no such intention in England. The commitment was to ensure a revaluation based on the current yield, with no increase in yield. In Wales, a number of changes were made: an additional band was added, which must had some impact on that process. It was therefore a very different scenario, and we should not assume that because there was an increase in Wales, there would be a similar increase in England. If the hon.   Gentleman examines the figures, he will see the   difference. As I said, the estimates produced by both the Halifax and the RICS show that a larger number of households are likely to gain from revaluation than to lose. I do not remember the precise figures, but about 33 per cent. of households in Wales lost and only about 8 per cent. gained. That is a very different scenario from the one that we envisage for England.

As the figures show, that is because there would be rather more gainers in the lower house-price bands, and a disproportionate number of losers in the higher bands.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_113">That brings me to my final point. If those figures are valid, it appears that the Bill will be regressive. It will result in more households on lower incomes paying more than they should because of a failure to revalue, while those in higher income bands and occupying more highly priced properties, who would possibly have paid more because the value of their properties has risen, will be spared. I cannot support a measure which seems to me to have no logic and no principle behind it, and which will have a regressive impact. It saddens me to say this, but I will not be able to support the Government tonight.

 In getting back to the subject of this Second Reading debate, I   should begin by pointing out that, as a member of the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation, and of the   Society of Clerks of Valuation Tribunals, I have some professional involvement in this area. I have certain predetermined views on local government finance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_131">I should also make it clear that I see some merit in the Government&#039;s argument for ensuring that revaluation is tied to a review of, and re-jigging of, local government finance; my real concern is the length of that delay. The history of any property tax shows that the longer revaluation is delayed, the more that tax is fundamentally undermined. There was a revaluation in the years immediately after the war, when the Inland Revenue was responsible for valuing the rates. There was another revaluation in 1956, and further revaluations in 1963 and 1973. By the end of the 1980s, after various Ministers delayed a further revaluation and following the experience in Scotland, it was impossible for the then Tory Government to have another one. We ended up with the poll tax.
</p>





<p><a name="st_155"><a name="51107-18_spnew3"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 I am listening to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s opening shots with interest. He is comparing rates with council tax, but the situation is different. At the moment, valuation for council tax purposes is used for the distribution of grant and of the tax itself. So many of the arguments used earlier by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr.   Raynsford) actually support the positions of both the Government and of Conservative Front Benchers, so long as the proportions do not change dramatically.
</p>





<p><a name="st_156"><a name="51107-18_spnew4"><b> Mr. Borrow: </b> 
 I shall deal with that point now. Let us contrast such revaluations with the revaluation of business rates. Since business rates were nationalised in 1990, we have stuck to five-yearly revaluations, which have been supported by all those affected. Their argument is not that because no big changes have occurred in a given five-year period, there should be no revaluation. Rather, the argument is that if comparatively small changes in relative values occur under a system of regular revaluations, the impact of each revaluation is not so massive, be it on businesses or those occupying domestic property. If we argue that we do not need a revaluation because&#151;allegedly&#151;there has not been a big change in relative property prices in the past 14 or 15 years, and if we have revaluations only when there is a massive change in the relative prices of property, the danger is that the impact will be huge, with a lot of winners and a lot of losers. Under such a system, it will become virtually impossible for a Government of any colour to proceed with that revaluation.

<br>&nbsp;<br>winners will be concentrated in certain geographical areas and the losers in others? My part of the world, the west country, has experienced rapidly increasing property prices&#151;a point that applies whether one is on a high or a low income. That is the basic unfairness.
</p>





<p><a name="st_158"><a name="51107-18_spnew6"><b> Mr. Borrow: </b> 
 I come back to the experience of regular revaluations for business rates. When revaluations took place in the 1990s, some parts of the country experienced booms in property rents and certain classes of property had large increases in comparison with others. Provided that we have regular revaluations and some sort of transitional relief in place, we have a way of coping with the problem. We do not want to find ourselves in a position where we cannot have a revaluation because the change is so massive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_132">I remember looking into property values in central Liverpool in the early 1980s. At that time, rates were based on rental values of the early 1970s and many business properties in the area were attracting more in rates than in rent. At the same time, there were tenants in central London paying 10 or 20 times as much in rent as they were in rates. That reflected the change in the economy during the period. It was also reflected in changes in domestic property values, albeit to a lesser extent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_133">Another important problem with putting off property revaluations is that they have an impact on Government grants. The longer we delay revaluations, the longer it will be before Government grants reflect economic differences between one area and another. Liverpool got hammered in the 1980s with cuts in services and real financial problems. Had there been regular revaluations throughout the 1970s and 1980s, I suspect that Liverpool city council&#039;s budget position would have been much stronger in the 1980s because the revaluations would have reflected the recession in the   city and would have fed through into the amount of Government grant awarded. We never did the revaluations, so that never happened.

<a name="51107-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_135">I want to restate a point that I made in an earlier intervention&#151;that the reason for having a revaluation in 2007, as against a business rate revaluation in 2005, was to even out the work load of the Valuation Office Agency, the valuation tribunals and all those involved in the valuation of rating and council tax. The danger is that we could end up with a revaluation of council tax not in 2011 but in 2013&#151;20 years after the first council tax valuation. It is important that the revaluation of council tax ties in with the reform of local government finance because of the revaluation&#039;s impact on the amount of Government grant. Those two aspects need to be tied together under a new regime, rather than introduced separately. The timing is crucial.

I have served on Standing   Committees in which Conservative Front-Bench spokesmen have said that there should be regular revaluations. There is plenty of documentation in the Library about the occasions on which Tory Front Benchers have argued in favour of having regular revaluations.

Let us suppose that I buy one of those houses and put on a conservatory and a granny annexe&#151;although they are unlikely to be big enough to allow the latter addition&#151;and, a couple of years later, I sell it. It will be revalued for council tax purposes and will probably go up a band. Let us suppose that the right hon.

Across the country, people ask, &quot;Why on earth is he paying the same as I am?

 The hon.

The hon. Gentleman should not be quite so aggressive about a point that relates to the consequence of the Conservative Government&#039;s policies of 10 or 12 years ago.

<a name="stpa_153">The issue before the House is relative simple. In a sense, one could say that one agrees with it or does not agree with it. It is whether the revaluation of council tax should be deferred and the power handed over to the Secretary of State to determine whether that should happen. If that were all that was being asked of the House, the answer should be no. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) made a perfectly good point, as did two Labour Members, for regular revaluations. My hon. Friend the Member for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow) said that the longer the revaluation is left, the more a property-based tax is undermined.

<br>&nbsp;<br>considering the functions and finance of local government. I do not necessarily think that it is a bad idea because the council tax was introduced in a panic after the Conservative party had politically assassinated a Prime Minister. The poll tax, which Conservatives introduced because they had failed to revalue the previous rating system, turned out to be probably the   most unpopular tax that this country had seen in the previous 200 years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_154">The council tax itself was better than the poll tax&#151;the community charge&#151;but is it something that, 12 years on, Labour and Opposition Members should be going to the barricades to defend? I think not. That is why I   will vote in the Lobby tonight with my hon. Friends who sit on the Front Bench. If we were simply asked whether giving the Secretary of State the power always to determine when a property-based tax should be revalued was a good thing, I would say that, on its own, it was not. However, in the light of the Lyons review of form and function, it is just about justifiable to look at the situation 12 years after the council tax was introduced, after many changes have been made in local government structures and when some are still in the pipeline.

<a name="stpa_155">I do not want to stray too far off the point&#151;this relates to the Government&#039;s argument about why we should delay the revaluation&#151;but at the bottom of the debate lies what we think local democracy&#039;s future is in this country. The simple answer, which is difficult to reach, is that local people in cities, towns and shires should be able to take decisions about the matters that they want to determine and that they can relate to, and they should be able to raise a lot of that tax locally themselves. We have got the balance wrong in this country, when only between 20 and 25 per cent. of tax is raised by the council tax, and when, if taxation is considered across the board, 2 or 3 per cent. of tax is the responsibility of local democracy.

<br>&nbsp;<br>why and there is some unfairness in the system&#151;I   suspect that the Labour party&#039;s communications and propaganda do not make enough of the fact that we are still paying 2.5 percentage points of our VAT more than we were paying before 1993 to pay for the mess of the   poll tax previously. I use that figure to illustrate the difficulties in using council tax, with its imperfections, as a basic tax to sustain local democracy. People in the streets are not angry that we are paying 17.5 per cent. VAT, rather than 15 per cent., but they are genuinely concerned about council tax because it increases year on year and a bill drops through the door. When Lyons looks at that, people&#039;s perceptions must be taken into account.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_157">The other issue that we should consider in deferring the revaluation of council tax is its efficiency. People have been very careful and accurate to describe the council tax as a property-based tax. Of course, it is a property-based tax, but it also has an element, which is left over from some of the thoughts on the poll tax, that is related to the number of people in the household. People are entitled to a 25 per cent. discount if they live on their own. Although this might not be completely fair, I have collated two sets of statistics on the matter, which indicate that there is a problem with the council tax and its revaluation.

<p>

<a name="stpa_158">Some 3.5 million people are not on the electoral register. It is my contention&#151;I have some evidence for this&#151;that a large percentage of the people in my constituency who are not on the electoral register are avoiding paying council tax. When we consider the revaluation of council tax, it is important to know how many people pay it and how many others are ever likely to pay it. I have checked the situation regarding the houses in one of my inner-city wards. It turns out that there is a ratio of two women to one man, but if one walks around the streets of that polling district, one realises that the ratio is 50:50. The conclusion is fairly obvious: a certain degree of council tax evasion is going on, which the Electoral Commission has picked up through its study of how many people have not registered on the electoral register. If we are considering deferring the revaluation, we must look at the basic efficiency of the council tax. It is considerably more efficient than the poll tax, but not as efficient as the domestic rates were.

The Conservatives were responsible for some such quangos and this Government have been responsible for others. We must consider not only the weight of democracy that the council tax can support, which is not that much, but the democracy that it should support. Given the two contradictory problems of the inefficiency of the council tax and the fact that little of it is determined locally, and what I would like to see coming back to local government, I am happy to support a deferral of the revaluation of council tax because it will be no friend to that property-based tax. I hope that Lyons will understand such things and look at the problem thoroughly, instead of just taking instructions to say that we should strip so much out of local government and destroy more local democracy because that is all that council tax will bear.

 We have heard several thoughtful speeches&#151;the last two were good examples. It must be accepted that there is no outcry, with the possible exception of two Labour Members, in support of a national revaluation. However, my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) pointed out that there are local cries for revaluation, which I accept, so I thought that I   would try some lateral thinking about that. My right hon. Friend and I used to take that approach in a little office down the road when we discussed such matters previously. Today, however, I want to use the reasoned amendment as a way to look for a slightly different approach.

<a name="51107-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_161">Although the council tax is a property-based tax, we must remember that it is not actually based on property values in the same way as business rates or the domestic rates. The slightly different approach behind the council tax has two effects. Valuation is used to put properties into bands through which the tax is distributed locally. Importantly, especially for people in the south-east, such information is used by the Government in their assessment of ability to pay when grant is distributed, which has led to a dramatic shift of grant from the south-east to northern urban areas since the new system was introduced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_162">We should be able to think about a slightly different approach.

<br>&nbsp;<br>authorities, heaven forbid&#151;or at least the taxing authorities to reflect any dramatic changes that might occur in their areas. We could thus go for localised revaluation. I cite that specifically in response to the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon that there are areas&#151;the Thames Gateway will probably be a classic example&#151;in which huge amounts of building will occur, so revaluation due to the sale of such properties would obviously be appropriate, and perhaps necessary. That might mean that the value of the bands in such areas would shift.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_163">The major effect of the council tax that we must consider is the fact that the Government mistakenly base ability to pay on the value of properties. That is why a national revaluation could have a dramatic effect on the south-east and London, while being positive for council tax payers in the north-east and the north in general. Using slightly lateral thinking to find a different approach, albeit perhaps from a rusty base, I think that we should be considering a different way of judging ability to pay.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_164">An obvious approach would be for the Treasury to produce each year a borough-by-borough estimate of individuals&#039; income throughout the country. That assessment could be a substitute for the valuation bands   with which we currently judge ability to pay and grant distribution. Such an assessment should be complemented by a system to assess people&#039;s cost of living. Part of the cost of living, especially in London and the south-east, is dependent on the value of properties because of the size of their mortgages. That factor should be reflected when the grant from central Government is calculated, but it is not.

<a name="51107-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_165">I support the Government in one aspect because the delay will create the opportunity for more radical thinking than Sir Michael Lyons would have been likely to achieve without the Bill. I support the reasoned amendment because we must move away from a national revaluation of properties that are not business properties because of the reasons that I have outlined. I   especially support my Front Bench colleagues because I have deep concern, contrary to the view of my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon, about the proposal to create extra bands instead of changing the valuation of the existing bands, because that would shift dramatically the proportion of grant allocated throughout the country, which could cause damage.

If we are fortunate enough to own our own home, our families are offered a certain level of security.

Under Labour, stamp duty has tripled in my constituency, with the stamp duty bill for an average detached house being almost &#163;4,000.

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. In areas such as my constituency in north Hampshire, where we have seen house prices increase by 13 per cent. more than the regional average, we will be waiting for tax hikes of around &#163;300 per household, taking the average council bill to well over &#163;1,500, which many of my constituents cannot afford.

The Government said that that was aimed not at changing the amount of money collected nationally, but at ensuring that individual rateable values reflected the changes that have taken place in property markets since the last revaluation in 2000&#151;very much the arguments that have been rehearsed today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_181">However, the business revaluation hiked taxes on local firms by more than &#163;1 billion a year across the country, pushing up average firms&#039; bills by three times the rate of inflation. In Basingstoke, which is one of the most important hubs of business and enterprise in the   south of England, the average bill paid by local firms has risen by 6 per cent. to over &#163;16,000 a year, despite the Government&#039;s claims that the business rate revaluation would be revenue neutral. Almost 2 million businesses across England were sent revised business rates in April. That money will not be kept by local government, but will be snatched back by central Government. Higher taxes on local firms will damage the economy and increase the prices in our shops. Our experience to date is that re-banding is no revenue-neutral balancing exercise, as suggested by the Government today.

<a name="stpa_182">There are more deeply rooted reasons for the Government&#039;s climbdown on revaluation, which some of my hon. Friends have touched on. It is a symptom of a growing realisation of the crisis in local government finance. We have noted the fact that we are paying over 70 per cent. more in council tax under the Government, analogous to 3 per cent. on income tax. But those accountable to the voters at local government level have little control over council tax levels for which they are judged at the ballot box, despite what the Minister said in an Opposition day debate only a few weeks ago. The Government have in essence broken the link between taxation and representation, with 75 per cent. of local government spending coming from central Government and only 25 per cent. from local council tax payments.

Hampshire has achieved great savings over a number of years in response to the pressure under which it finds itself, but this year the sums simply do not add up. In 2006&#150;07 the projections are that, after the Government have ring-fenced the revenue support grant into the new dedicated schools grant and removed the one-off grant support designed to keep council tax figures low in a general election year, Hampshire will see a 1.7 per cent. increase in Government grant, yet it needs an increase of 5.4 per cent. to finance the Government&#039;s local spending plans and maintain current levels of service. This means that my constituents are facing a further 8.4 per cent increase in council tax, on top of the vast rises in recent years under the Labour Government.

<a name="stpa_184">If the council is not allowed to put such an increase in place, the result will be cuts in services to the tune of &#163;8 million, according to current projections.

It also made it clear in its local government manifesto 2004 that it is against local income tax and any other form of transfer tax, so it favours one unchanged, unrebanded tax based on 1992 property values, which is a strange policy.

<a name="stpa_191">One of the problems with the Conservative policy of not rebanding is that, as other hon.

The Conservative Opposition want to enter government with a tax that progressively bears less and less relation to the actual value of property. If one were cynical&#151;as I have said, that is not my position&#151;one would say that that policy would serve some people rather well, because, assuming that house prices continue to inflate, as taxes drift further and further away from real property values, so a larger and larger number of people will be in a band in which no one pays any more council tax, regardless of increases in property values. Perhaps the thinking is driven by the political party that people in those bands tend to support.

<a name="stpa_194">Incidentally, the 1992 council tax legislation did not include a revaluation provision because it was widely believed at the time in Government circles that placing the bands on the statute book and maintaining council tax within them would remove the need for valuation, because property price movements would be absorbed by movements within the bands.

 As the hon.

When there is a transition in value between various parts of the country, the dampening mechanism works to a better or lesser extent in different places to equalise as far as possible the effect of the   revaluation over a period of time. However, if a dampening mechanism is introduced, it cannot necessarily ensure that there is no difference in yield because it works differently in different parts of the country, depending on the change that has occurred in   the revaluation. A revaluation with a dampening mechanism cannot give a revenue-neutral, guaranteed yield in the way that the Government suggested could be done for council tax revaluation. I am sure that the hon.

The previous Conservative Government introduced bands in the Local Government Finance Act 1992. They were prepared in something of a hurry, on the erroneous understanding that they would ultimately get rid of revaluation. I believe that a system of points would be a fairer and better method of valuing properties than the current bands system. We would not then have the   worry about moving between bands.

<a name="stpa_210">Points would be given on the basis of a specific valuation. As we have heard, the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation has said that, if revaluation were to proceed, it would provide an individual valuation for   each property. It would thus be relatively straightforward to move from individual valuation to a series of points rather than placing properties in a band. The total number of points that a local authority had would form the basis on which council tax could be levied. That would provide considerable certainty about the amount of money available for the local authority to levy council tax as part of its budget-making activity.

<a name="stpa_212">The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon and the hon. Member for Brent, East both mentioned proposals to localise the business rate. It has been suggested that that should happen because it would introduce a greater degree of autonomy to councils in terms of the decisions that they make about their finances. If there were no gearing effect, however, that would be of less significance. However, the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon rightly pointed out that, since the business rate was introduced, with the intention that it should not be levied at above the rate of retail price inflation, the percentage of funding into the local government stream that the business rate has provided has gone down from about 27 per cent. to 22 per cent. If we had historically pitched the level of the business rate against increases in earnings rather than in prices, it would have been possible more or less to have kept up that proportion over a period of time. If we prospectively pitched the business rate against earnings rather than prices, it would re-equalise that proportion over time, so that it would continue to operate on a level basis, rather than falling continuously against the total proportion of moneys raised for local government and against the amount raised by council tax. That would resolve another problem.

If, as a result of this process, we achieve a council tax that reflects more marginally on people&#039;s concerns about the tax bill landing on the carpet, that relates more fairly in terms of its effects on the rise of property prices and to the actual amount that people pay, and that is in line with the way in which the business rate works, we will have done a good job, so far as temporarily suspending the revaluation is concerned. If the tax comes back refreshed in that way, the question of revaluation will play a part in the process but it will not form most of the process. That would be a positive outcome from a decision that people in some quarters are calling a U-turn, and it could result in something good for future local government.

 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead). I agreed with many of the points that he made at the beginning of his speech. Sadly, I did not agree with what he said about local income tax, but it seems that we shall have to take up that debate on another occasion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_214">Two aspects of this debate are quite bizarre, one of which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. That was the fact that it seems very difficult for hon. Members to stick to the point of the debate. One reason for that is easily explained: it is difficult to separate valuation from the rest of local government finance. Some reference to those other matters is necessary in order to understand the decision that we face tonight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_215">The other point is fascinating, and relates to the internal debate on the two sides of the House. It became increasingly difficult to tell whether a speaker was speaking from the Conservative side of the debate or from the Government side. A serious point lies behind that difficulty as well. There are inherent difficulties with the council tax, and both sides are finding it difficult to come to terms with that. It is the most regressive major tax in the Government&#039;s taxation armoury. Indeed, it causes the whole taxation system to be regressive: the top 20 per cent. pay less tax overall than the bottom 20 per cent. of the income distribution. We all have constituents who face extraordinary council tax bills. I   have one who has to pay 10 per cent. of his income in council tax, which is an extraordinary figure. This leads to the conclusion that we have reached, which is that the whole council tax system ought to be abolished and replaced by a different system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_216">My own position on the Bill is simple, and the hon. Member for Southampton, Test got close to identifying it. For me, revaluation is a pointless and expensive exercise that should be scrapped. It is pointless because the council tax is inherently unfair and should be replaced by a better tax, namely local income tax. It is expensive because it has already cost about &#163;60 million and is likely to cost another &#163;100 million, if not more. Those resources would be much better spent on almost any other aspect of local government expenditure. The Bill means that the Government will be in a position to   call off this wasteful and pointless exercise, and I   therefore support it in principle. I would, however, like to see some changes made to it in Committee, and I   shall mention at least one of them later.

<a name="51107-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_217">First, however, I want to challenge the Conservatives&#039; position on the Bill, which is puzzling. Their amendment says that the House should decline to give the Bill a Second Reading because it does not cancel the council tax revaluation. However, as the hon. Member for Southampton, Test said, we all know that the Government will use the power that the Bill will grant to call off the 2007 revaluation. The current law is clear: there is an obligation to hold a revaluation in 2007 under the terms of the Local Government Act 2003. If the Bill were to be defeated tonight, therefore, that would remain the law and the 2007 revaluation would continue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_218">The Conservatives&#039; position is puzzling in another way. I differ from the hon. Member for Southampton, Test, at this point, because the Second Reading debate of the Bill that became the Local Government Finance Act 1992 shows that it was always thought that revaluation would be necessary at some point under the council tax system. That Second Reading debate makes fascinating reading, and I recommend it to all hon. Members, especially for the remarks by Labour Members who were in favour of something called &quot;fair rates&quot;&#151;a concept that seems to have disappeared completely&#151;and for the views of the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) and the then Member for Dagenham, who held fascinating views on the invasion of privacy that would result from the introduction of the council tax valuation system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-24_para12">
<a name="stpa_219">Nevertheless, little was said in the 1991 debate about the revaluation issue, except in so far as Conservative Members said that the need for revaluation was a serious problem in the old rating system and would also be a problem in the fair rates system. That problem would not be eliminated under the council tax, however, but simply reduced. The then Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr. Ian Lang, in the debate on Tuesday 12 November 1991&#151;a Second Reading debate that was held over two days, which I have yet to see in the House in my time, although perhaps it is not necessary for this Bill&#151;stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">&quot;The banding system irons out much of the effect of relative changes in property values within an area which, under the rating system, brought regular pressure for revaluation. The need for general revaluations is therefore much reduced. If, however, such a revaluation were required, say, 20 years hence, the same house in band D would probably remain a band D house, provided that its relative position within the range of property values had not changed so much as to take it outwith the new parameters for that band.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 12 November 1991; Vol. 198, c. 918.]</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_220">Council tax does not therefore eliminate the need for revaluation, but merely reduces it.

<p>
<a name="51107-24_para14">
<a name="stpa_221">The then Conservative Government expected to have a revaluation in around 2011, only four years later than that provided for in the 2003 Bill. The puzzle in the Conservative position is that if clause 1 of the Bill that we are considering tonight had been included in the 1992 Act, no one would have turned a hair. It would have been perfectly compatible with the policy of the   then Government. We have heard tonight that Conservative policy now is that there must be primary legislation every time a revaluation is suggested. No one said that in 1991. It strikes me as somewhat over the top to require primary legislation for what would in effect be a one-clause Bill, as opposed to a positive resolution of the House under the current arrangements.

<a name="stpa_222">Let me turn to the one aspect of the Bill that requires further attention. Hon. Members have referred to the difficulty that politicians have in bringing to fruition revaluations of property-based or near-property-based tax. The technical reasons for introducing such revaluations have been well explained, especially by the hon. Member for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow). They are related to divergence in property values. The relevant divergence is at the individual property level, not at the district or regional level. Those technical advantages of revaluation, however, are always outweighed by the political cost. Ministers of whatever party find it impossible to revalue without paying a very high political price.

 As an ex-leader of Cambridge city council, my hon. Friend will be aware that the political cost of the council tax has been substantial over time. Part of that has been caused by the continuation of the Conservative Government&#039;s policy of increasing council tax by more than inflation. At standard spending, in 1993&#150;94 council tax was &#163;492.66, and in 2002&#150;03 it increased to &#163;769.16. It then changed to the assumed national council tax, putatively &#163;1,000.83, which has increased to &#163;1,101.96.

That lacks fundamental transparency.

<a name="51107-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_225">I ask the Government to consider an amendment to the Bill that would do the following things. First, the Secretary of State should have a duty from time to time to consider whether he should use the power that the Bill grants him. Secondly, when considering whether to use the power, he should be under an obligation to give reasons as to why that power was not exercised in any particular year. Thirdly, those reasons should include an assessment of the variation in property values that has taken place since the previous revaluation. That would allow us all to see whether the Government&#039;s decision not to go for a revaluation on any particular occasion was justified technically or was merely following a political imperative. I would be interested to hear the Minister&#039;s response to that.

 We have heard many opinions today, but there is one incontrovertible fact: people like living in my constituency. They live there until and after they retire; they live in the same houses from generation to generation. In the meantime, the value of their houses naturally increases, often at a rate that far exceeds any income that might enable them to buy their houses.

<a name="stpa_227">We often talk about value, and it is the subject of today&#039;s debate, but to many such people it is an abstract concept, becoming relevant only when they sell. We must be cautious about references to value and revaluation, which should be linked to ability to pay. Houses in my constituency are worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, but those values are not always linked to householders&#039; ability to meet an increase in   council tax. Many an ordinary family in my constituency with a high-value property is scrimping and saving to pay the mortgage, and may have a lower standard of living than those with less valuable houses. Similarly, hard-working constituents in council or social housing may live in high-value properties that are already affected by a high council tax valuation, and would be more affected by a revaluation. Those who will not profit from a sale will not benefit from an appreciating asset.

<a name="stpa_242">If minor adjustments were made to the amount coming from central Government&#151;let us say that, in our hypothetical council, the &#163;80 became &#163;78, a drop of less than 2 per cent.&#151;council taxes would have to go up by 10 per cent., from &#163;20 to &#163;22, to make up the difference. That is the so-called gearing effect, which has caused disproportionate council tax rises in the past few years.

 The hon. Gentleman will be aware that, since 1997, central Government funding has increased in real terms by 33 per cent. Is not the level of council tax&#151;I speak as a former local councillor who served two terms of office&#151;to a great extent due to what local councils themselves want to set it at?
</p>





<p><a name="st_228"><a name="51107-26_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Order. I hope that the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies) will steer skilfully back within the terms of the Bill. I would not want him to go off course as a result of that intervention.

<p><a name="st_229"><a name="51107-26_spnew7"><b> David T.C. Davies: </b> 
 I am deeply grateful for your guidance, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I will try to answer the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point in a moment in a way that I feel is relevant to the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_243">I warn hon. Members that, when re-banding was introduced in Wales, we were told that it would be fiscally neutral, just as hon. Members in this Chamber are being told that the re-banding exercise in England will be fiscally neutral. When Governments find that their estimates are not quite what they expected them to be, it is easy for them to manipulate local government funding to raise revenue directly for themselves. If hon. Members&#039; experience is anything like the experience of those of us who live in Wales, they may find that their surgeries are full of people complaining about council tax rises of 130 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_244">If we abandon revaluation for good, how will we overcome the problems that will result? To take the   point made by the hon. Member for Preston (Mr.   Hendrick), I think that there is a strong case for looking at the inflation that is occurring within local authorities. Local authority inflation is not at the same headline level as the inflation figures generally. He talks about 33 per cent. extra going into local authorities. I do not dispute that, but what has been the percentage increase in costs for local authorities? For example, a Government initiative such as the teachers work load agreement in Wales&#151;there is an equivalent one in England&#151;is not properly funded. The National Union of Teachers talked about a shortfall of &#163;30 million or so in that alone. If the costs rise above the level that is given to local authorities, they will have to make up the shortfall by putting up council taxes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_245">Therefore, the first thing that we need to do is to set up an inquiry into how expensive it is to run a local authority, to take evidence from local government leaders and to ask them about the extra increases and burdens that they have and to what extent they are being 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Nov 2005 : Column 88</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>funded by Government. There is a responsibility on Government not to announce any headline-grabbing initiatives unless they are prepared to fund them properly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-26_para13">
<a name="stpa_246">The second thing that all of us need to do, whether in Wales or England, is to look at the way in which the formula for local government funding operates. That again is easy to manipulate. In fact, it has been manipulated in a manner that I believe is completely unfair to the southern counties of England and to the rural areas of Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-26_para14">
<a name="stpa_247">When assessing deprivation, it is easy to look at the number of people on benefits, which is what the formula does. The formula should take into account average household incomes, because that is a much clearer way of defining deprivation than simply looking at the number of people of benefit. We all know of people working in agriculture, tourism or the service sector for the minimum wage. They are not taking home much money and their incomes are no better than they would be on benefit, but they are not counted as being deprived for the purposes of the formula.

<p><a name="st_230"><a name="51107-27_spnew0"><b> Kali Mountford </b> 
: The hon. Gentleman is making a cogent argument in favour of not going ahead with the revaluation now and to go ahead with the Lyons review. In looking at poverty indices, he should remember that there was a time when poverty was measured by the number of outside toilets in a constituency, which was not at all fair. Does he accept that looking at the number of people on benefit is at least a vast move forward from that point?
</p>





<p><a name="st_231"><a name="51107-27_spnew1"><b> David T.C. Davies: </b> 
 That is a perfectly fair comment. I   agree that it is an improvement, but we have the ability to look at average household incomes rather than the number of people on benefits. Perhaps an hon. Member could correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that the number of white goods in a household is one of the measures being looked at. That, too, is a fairly random way of trying to define deprivation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_248">It is not just in terms of deprivation where the formula is deeply flawed. Rurality is another important part of any formula. The more rural areas have higher costs; it costs more to do anything in rural areas. It costs more to collect the bins, and to send a lorry up and down the lanes of a rural area is more expensive than sending it past a few terraced houses. It costs more to maintain roads in rural areas, yet the formula in use at the moment reduces the emphasis given to rurality, which has had a deeply detrimental effect on those areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_249">My final point on the formula&#151;there are many discrepancies about which we could talk&#151;is that information relating to the age profile of the population has been removed. Clearly, an increasing part of any local authority budget is the part spent on providing nursing and residential care. It is vital that any formula that we have takes full account of the numbers of people aged between 65 and 70 and the incremental increases right the way up to people in their nineties. Otherwise, areas with large elderly populations are also going to lose out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-27_para2">

<br>&nbsp;<br>doing, to look into the way in which the formula is applied to different areas. The second is to ensure that extra costs on local authorities are fully funded by central Government. If we did that, we would still have a tax that was not perfect. I am slightly off-message with my political party on this issue; it is unusual for me to say that. I am not in favour of scrapping council tax. I   do not think there was an issue with council tax until three or four years ago. Certainly, in 1999, when I   fought an election for the Welsh Assembly, council tax did not feature anywhere in anyone&#039;s election literature.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_251">It is not that I think the principle of council tax is unfair. It is the level at which it has been set.

<p>
<a name="51107-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_254">I wish to respond directly to some of the comments of Labour Members, but, first, I should point out that the Welsh experience is relevant. The decision to postpone council tax revaluation in England was described by a   Minister as a huge, vaulting, 180&#176; U-turn, and that full-on U-turn is embodied in the Bill. I accept that one of the motivations for that U-turn might be to have a much wider ranging inquiry led by Sir Michael Lyons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_255">I believe also that the Government are conscious of the political difficulties that could be caused and, with one eye on the experience in Wales, they will know of the resentment and anger that was caused by a botched council tax revaluation.

<a name="stpa_258">Likewise, the right hon. Gentleman referred to the number of winners and losers in the revaluation process and his figures were correct. The proportion of losers in Wales was 33 per cent. of households, with 8 per cent. being winners. Again, contrary to what he seemed to be suggesting, that is at odds with the assurances given by Labour Assembly Ministers at the time, who promised that there would be as many winners as losers. They talked about roughly 50 per cent. of households staying within the same band, with 25 per cent. of bills going up and 25 per cent. going down. I caution hon. Members who hear assurances that revaluation can be revenue neutral; the experience in Wales suggests that perhaps it will not be.
</p>





<p><a name="st_233"><a name="51107-27_spnew3"><b> Tom Levitt: </b> 
 Why does the hon. Gentleman think that the number of people whose property valuation went up or down equates to whether the proposal was revenue neutral? Surely if 10 per cent. were big winners and 30 per cent. small losers it could still be revenue neutral. He has not given us the figures.
</p>





<p><a name="st_234"><a name="51107-27_spnew4"><b> Mr. Crabb: </b> 
 Ministers in the Assembly have now conceded that the overall tax take has increased and rather than there being a 4 per cent increase in council tax take in 2005&#150;06, the increase was actually nearer 10 per cent.
</p>





<p><a name="st_235"><a name="51107-27_spnew5"><b> Mr. Roger Williams  (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD):</b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting point and he is correct in terms of the numbers of winners and losers in Wales. However, there has been confusion between revaluation and re-banding, which is what happened in Wales. Re-banding did not take into account the bigger increases resulting from the revaluation and, as a result, there were rather more losers than winners.
</p>





<p><a name="st_236"><a name="51107-27_spnew6"><b> Mr. Crabb: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors pointed out that had re-banding in Wales been undertaken in accordance with house price inflation, there would have been a much fairer outcome.

<a name="stpa_262">As the hon.

In one ward in my constituency, for   example, some 40 per cent. of homes have been re-banded upwards. The proposal that we are discussing today is based on the Welsh experience. The Welsh have undoubtedly been used as guinea pigs, and the hard fact is that the Government have seen what has happened in Wales and do not like the consequences.

I urge Ministers to pass the message back to the Lyons review about the vital need for a much wider range of sources of funding for local government. A property tax undoubtedly has its place, but we need a wider range of sources so that the funding that local government receives from central Government becomes a diminishing proportion of its total expenditure. It is certainly not healthy for local government to depend, as it increasingly has in recent years, on central Government funding. That is not healthy for local democracy, so we need a much higher proportion of local government funds to be raised locally if we are to increase the accountability of local government to local people.

 When I first heard the proposal to delay the revaluation of council tax, I admit I felt some dismay. If we are to carry on with council tax, revaluation is a necessary part of that system, given that house prices are rising erratically, with prices in areas differing from one another, not just regionally, but in my constituency, where a house that sold for &#163;60,000 two years ago was sold for &#163;148,000 last week. There has been a similar increase in the value of similar houses in that village, so what fear is there from revaluation overall? Very simply, the fear is that if we do not take time to take stock of how we raise local funds and make local democracy count, we will face some difficulties. I could not support the Bill if it did not run alongside proposals to consider the way that we fund councils overall.

<a name="stpa_287">I have a small degree of experience: when I was a chair of finance, I had to consider exactly those issues in the context of the moneys that we raised for the local area. At that time, about 50 per cent. of revenues were raised directly from the local population, and the other 50 per cent. came from the revenue that we got directly from the Government. Of course, such revenues are not the total amount that a council spends. We must also consider the grant, direct funding and capital systems, all of which must be applied for. Under the previous Government, such applications were made in terms of a huge, competitive arena, with one council set against another. I am not convinced therefore by Conservative Members&#039; arguments that the council tax system, which they set up, has now become so inherently flawed that revaluation should never be necessary. That is a ludicrous, ridiculous argument. If we carry on with council tax, revaluation is an essential part of the system; otherwise the existing inequities will not only persist, but broaden.

We are talking about those who are not wealthy, who live in a property that, as against other properties, has not risen in value at the same rate. Therefore, in terms of property as a proportion of income, those people are much worse off. That seems a good reason for carrying on with revaluation. If we continue with council tax as it is now, we must look carefully at such matters. We cannot escape our responsibility to those people.

In a village 2 miles further on, which does not have the same attractive postcode, does not have film crews up and down its lanes every day and does not attract the same tourism, property prices have levelled off and started to descend. Although the houses are of the same type, there is a huge difference in property values between the two villages, and between the amount that those families should pay and can afford to pay. It does not reflect their family income and how they deal with it. That is why, if I am to support the Government tonight, it is on the basis that we consider how the system in future will protect those constituents and make sure that the poorest pay fairly and appropriately, but no more than they have to pay.

 My hon. Friend is right. The stakeholders are council tax payers, who need to know why they are paying the amount that they are and what it is going towards.

</p>





<p><a name="st_316"><a name="51107-32_spnew11"><b> Kali Mountford: </b> 
 Absolutely. If and when we reach the point where revaluation is necessary, people should be given full information about the effects of not having it&#151;not only on the family concerned but on the amount of money available for all those services. The gearing effect, which Conservative Members acknowledged, is particularly pronounced when it comes to the police and fire services, where a precept is built upon it. It can be made to sound as though not revaluing will have a disproportionate effect on the amount that is raised locally for those services. People will say, &quot;I&#039;m not prepared to pay a 74 per cent. increase&quot;, not realising that the burden on an individual family is not 74 per cent. of the total council tax payable but 74 per cent. of a certain part of it.

In Scotland, revaluations have taken place fairly frequently: in 1961, 1966, 1971, 1978 and 1985. They did not take place after 1985, because the poll tax was then introduced, initially in Scotland, without great success either there or in England and Wales.

<a name="stpa_310">Under the Bill, revaluation would be deferred but not done away with. While I want a deferral, I do not want it to be deferred into the mists of time. A revaluation will address the question of differential house price rises. When house prices rise in different adjacent parts of a constituency, city or rural area, those who have seen an above-average increase in the value of their houses pay lower council tax than they would if a revaluation had taken place. Correspondingly, those whose houses have risen in value by less than the average, assuming a revenue-neutral system, would pay more council tax than they should. That happens to some extent in the current system, but the longer a deferral continues, the   more pronounced that unfair trend becomes. Of course, it favours those who have done best out of rising house prices in the booming economy under this Labour   Government. The discrepancies and unfairness therefore get worse the longer a revaluation is deferred. Consequently, as I said to my hon. Friend the Minister, while I support a deferral of the revaluation pending the outcome of the Lyons inquiry, I do not want it deferred too long.

Friend the Member for South Ribble (Mr.   Borrow), in an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley, said that there is no perfect tax. Arguably, death duties are a perfect tax, because one pays them only when one is dead. Council tax is quite useful because it is on a house that one cannot move&#151;I do not know the collection rate in your area, Madam Deputy Speaker, but in mine it is about 97 per cent., so it is important to bear that in mind in terms of revaluation. We need to consider what revenues might be brought in, but we also need a sound system that by and large works well, even though there are difficulties.

 We have had a good debate, featuring many ex-Ministers and many future Ministers, as well as Members with great experience of local government. It has been such a good debate that many people rushed in at the end to make their own speeches. They must have been terribly impressed by the earlier contributions of Members on both sides of the   House.

The speech will bear some rereading, as it contained some interesting comments aimed at Ministers. The hon. Member for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow) demonstrated his experience with the Valuation Office Agency, and made some interesting points, particularly about the cycle of revaluation between council tax and the unified business rate. I think that many people took his speech on board.

He made the salient point that revaluation, whether under the rates system or the council tax system, has always meant Governments of all political colours facing difficult choices and they do not always make the right one.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_328">The debate is of the Government&#039;s own making. Revaluation was not part of the 1992 Act, but the Government decided in July 2001 to revalue council tax on 1 April 2007. That was in the Local Government Act   2003, for which many Labour Members voted.   Conservative Members voted for a reasoned amendment. I had the pleasure of serving on the Committee that considered the Bill. The fact that the Government have changed their minds and are accusing all sorts of people on the Opposition Benches of changing their minds has a lot to do with the fact that they decided to go down that political avenue and have now thought better of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_329">We heard a lot about kicking issues into touch and about panic attacks. It is probably sensible for the Minister to put off revaluation because the salience of the council tax issue is high and increasing. The Welsh experience is a useful one. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors estimates that, if we had the same uplift following the English revaluation as occurred in Wales, that would mean &#163;2 billion extra in council tax, and that council tax for 7 million out of 21 million council tax payers would go up. Those are big figures, which have no doubt concerned the Government and were one of the reasons why they decided to kick the issue into touch.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-34_para13">
<a name="stpa_330">Revaluation itself is a costly exercise. In 2004, the cost was estimated at &#163;108 million and, in 2005, at &#163;178 million. We got so far as to spend nearly &#163;60 million, of which &#163;45 million, we heard, was spent on software. I am not sure that we received an answer about the value of the software if the revaluation is put off, and I hope that the Minister will reassure us on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-34_para14">
<a name="stpa_331">We heard that the Valuation Office Agency has taken on nearly 1,400 staff to deal with revaluation, many of whom will be on short-term contracts. We have not heard very much about the cost of those appointments. The Government said that there would be savings and, of course, there will be savings, but there will be further costs to come from shortening the contracts of 1,400 staff.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-34_para15">
<a name="stpa_332">The hon. Member for South Ribble said that, within the cycle, it would be possible to use those staff and others to undertake a revaluation of council tax and then to get back to the cycle for the revaluation of the uniform business rate. However, the whole thing is now out of synch.

<a name="stpa_333">Council tax is an important issue because a lot of people feel that the basis of its funding and the distribution between the various regions of the UK is not fair. The gearing effect, about which we have heard much today, means that it is difficult for local authorities to keep the rate of increase in council tax down to the rate of inflation. As we have heard, since 1997 council tax has increased by well over 76 per cent., which is why the issue is particularly salient politically. No doubt that is why we have ended up with a Bill to put off the revaluation.

<a name="stpa_334">The Opposition are concerned because the Government have some form in terms of the way in which they distribute grants. Over the past eight years, we have been concerned about how money is redistributed to the various regions, which is one of the reasons why we want to show our displeasure in a vote tonight. We are concerned about the impact on many areas in terms of grants.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-34_para18">
<a name="stpa_335">The other concern is that the Government have taken powers to change the bands, and to introduce more bands, to make council tax more progressive, which can be done by altering the various elements in a revaluation. If we have a revaluation and new bands are introduced at that point, we will have a very different tax from that introduced in 1993. There are concerns about the way in which the process will be dealt with and we need reassurances about a transitional relief scheme. When there are winners and losers, it is important to offset the increases for a period so that people become used to the new rate.

Those concerns need to be addressed. There is concern over council tax and over the distribution of grant.

Well, blow me down, the number of bedrooms is taken into account in the valuation of a property. Presumably, whether a property has a swimming pool, a conservatory, an attic or a golden garden shed will also be taken account in the valuation. Of course, the valuation office also takes into account certain attributes that work in the opposite, negative direction.

Either prices have aligned, which would mean no turbulence would be caused by revaluation, or we would need revaluation because prices have not aligned. Which is it?

<p><a name="st_346"><a name="51107-36_spnew1"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 Well, it was in the financial pages. On 6 November, not 24 hours ago, it was stated that rising wages and lower unemployment have lifted more than 600,000 households out of the net for council tax benefit. So people are better off under a Labour Government and are less dependent on benefits.
</p>





<p><a name="st_347"><a name="51107-36_spnew2"><b> Mr. Pickles: </b> 
 The Minister would do well to listen carefully to what Members say. My point was not about numbers, but about eligibility. The numbers show that those who are eligible are not claiming.
</p>





<p><a name="st_348"><a name="51107-36_spnew3"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 I did listen to the hon. Gentleman closely, and that is why I referred to the article in <i>The   Mail on Sunday</i> before I referred to the proportion claiming and I shall put on record the position regarding council tax benefit. Nobody in this country is being sent to jail because they cannot afford their council tax. Judges do not do that. The only circumstances in which one can be imprisoned for not paying one&#039;s council tax is if one is unwilling to pay it. There have been two such cases in the past year&#151;Alfred Ridley and Sylvia Hardy. Opposition Members are trying to whip up a storm on the back of the IsItFair campaign and, in my view, they are exploiting people. Through their scaremongering, they are scaring people, many of them low paid and vulnerable. The Government will not allow that to happen.

<p><a name="st_350"><a name="51107-36_spnew5"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 The &#163;200 extra help with the council tax was opposed by the Opposition. Pensioners in receipt of the guaranteed pension credit get a 100 per cent. rebate of council tax. Of course, it is our policy to improve take-up and I join with the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar in making that point. I hope that he will join our campaign, in a non-partisan manner, to encourage take-up of the benefit by pensioners by explaining its advantages. But I would wager that not many people in receipt of, or entitled to, council tax benefit cross the door of the hon. Gentleman.

<a name="51107-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_350">My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) made a characteristically well-informed and authoritative speech and argued against postponement of the revaluation. I again point out, to reassure him and my hon. Friend the Member for   Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) who also spoke on   the matter, that the Bill is a postponement not a cancellation. It may give Members further reassurance to know that the Government could have taken the option to propose simply to cancel the legislation in the Local Government 2003 Act, which amended the Local Government Finance Act 1992. We chose not to do that but to include in our Bill the commitment to introduce revaluation at the appropriate time, following the Lyons review. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich will accept that reassurance.
</p>





<p><a name="st_355"><a name="51107-36_spnew9"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, but can he tell the House when he and the Government envisage that power being used? The point has been made clearly during the debate that, due to the need to   avoid a clash with the valuation for business rates, 2010 is not possible, but 2011 and the period immediately afterwards would be. Is my hon. Friend prepared to give us an undertaking that the Government will proceed with a revaluation on that timetable?
</p>





<p><a name="st_356"><a name="51107-36_spnew10"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend makes an important point. The investment in the Valuation Office Agency&#151;the computerisation, entering information and ongoing work&#151;means that it can give me assurances that it will have the capacity to ensure that those revaluations can take place, if necessary, should Parliament decide on a concurrent timetable. The problem that my right hon. Friend raised is being solved&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>

 In just one second.[Hon. Members:&quot;Give way.&quot;] Members might have let me finish my sentence, but I shall of course give way to the distinguished former Minister, if only to remind the   House that the right hon. Gentleman spoke against his Front-Bench policy.
</p>





<p><a name="st_361"><a name="51107-36_spnew14"><b> Mr. Curry: </b> 
 The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) did not ask the Minister whether he had the capacity to carry out a revaluation; he asked him whether he had the intention to order a revaluation in 2011. What is the answer?

<a name="51107-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_351">As the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon will know, because he has read the Bill, it proposes that the powers for legislation for revaluation be given to the Secretary of State with the proviso that the House, through affirmative resolution, has the opportunity to debate the matter. Rightly so. That should give him the commitment that he is looking for, but the strategy outlined by the Government and in the comments made by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Communities and Local Government ensures that there is the opportunity to review local government&#039;s role and functions. Taking on board the important new work that has been done specifically under local area agreements, the three-year local government finance settlement and the certainty and stability needed for all involved requires a serious review of the local government&#039;s role and functions. That review is being undertaken on our behalf by Sir Michael Lyons, and I   am sure that many hon. Members on both sides of the House have and will contribute to that important debate. <i>[Interruption.]</i>
</p>





<p><a name="st_365"><a name="51107-36_spmin2"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Order. Once again, I appeal to the House to come to order. Some Members have been here listening to the debate throughout. Will those who have just come in have the courtesy to allow the Minister to continue?
</p>





<p><a name="st_366"><a name="51107-36_spnew18"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker.
</p>





<p><a name="st_367"><a name="51107-36_spnew19"><b> Mr. Curry: </b> 
 We are all familiar with the fact that the House may agree or disagree with a Minister&#039;s proposition, but the House does not do so on the basis of some existential musing: it does so because a Minister asks it to do so. Does the Minister intend to ask the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Nov 2005 : Column 120</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>House to proceed with a revaluation in the time scale mentioned by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich?
</p>





<p><a name="st_368"><a name="51107-36_spnew20"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 As the statement of 20 September and as my right hon. Friend has made clear, our policy is to ensure that, following Sir Michael Lyons&#039;s review, at the right time&#151;we have said that we do not believe that that   will be in the lifetime of this Parliament&#151;we will introduce in the House proposals for revaluation, and that is why on several occasions at the Dispatch Box my right hon. Friend and I have been able to reassure those who take the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s point of view that   this is a postponement, not a cancellation of revaluation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_369"><a name="51107-36_spnew21"><b> Mr. Borrow: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has been generous in giving way. May I try to help him on this point yet again? Many hon. Members wish to be reassured about whether he recognises that the longer the current council tax list continues without a revaluation, the more that list becomes unstable and unsustainable.
</p>





<p><a name="st_370"><a name="51107-36_spnew22"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 My hon. Friend made that point in the debate. Of course, the answer depends on what happens to house prices. If he is asking whether the Government&#039;s policy is to support a property tax on the   basis of valuation, the answer is, of course, yes&#151;unlike the Conservative party&#039;s policy of supporting property tax without a revaluation, which seems wholly untenable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_352">Hon. Members have argued in the debate that there is no need for revaluation. They argue that relative house price movements across the country during the past 10 years are such that the revaluation is unnecessary. They would cancel revaluation, rather than postponing it. However, during the debate of 19 October, when the hon. Member for Upminster (Angela Watkinson) was challenged by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) to say whether the Conservatives would ever revalue, the response was &quot;we never say never&quot;. We look forward to receiving the Opposition&#039;s support for the Bill when it returns to the House after its consideration in Committee because it provides exactly the kind of flexibility that their policy appears to call for.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_353">Finally, I should remind the House that in the past eight years, the Government have provided a 33 per cent. real-terms increase in Government grant, which compares with a 7 per cent. real-terms reduction in the last four years of the previous Government. Last year was the eighth successive year in which the Government provided local government overall with an increase in total Government grant that was above inflation, and it was the third year in which we were able to guarantee increases for all local authorities at least in line with   inflation. One would have thought that the Conservative party would be interested in balancing the books, not scaring the pensioners of this country.

 It is my privilege to present a petition on behalf   of my constituents, a list of names collected by Mr. C. Perrin of March, a town in my constituency. It is part of the IsItFair council tax protest campaign. I do not necessarily agree with the campaign&#039;s conclusions, but I certainly agree with the thrust of the campaign, which is that this Government have used council tax as a means of stealth taxing huge swaths of our population who can hardly afford the levels of council tax that are now being charged. I personally do not agree with the idea behind the petition, which is completely to remove council tax and replace it with an alternative, which I   suppose would have to be income tax. I believe that a property-based tax is a sensible way forward, and it would not take a massive injection of Government money from general taxation, including income tax, to bring the levels of council tax down to a more manageable level.

 First, may I put on record my great thanks to the Speaker for granting me this debate?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-39_para6">
<a name="stpa_362">I want to bring to the attention of the House the work of Middlesbrough borough council, its elected mayor, Ray Mallon, and the Safer Middlesbrough partnership to cut crime and make the town a safer place. First, I   want to praise the efforts of the men and women of Cleveland police, and the force&#039;s chief constable, Sean   Price, who has made a great contribution to ensuring that the council&#039;s plans have succeeded and provided great leadership.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-39_para7">
<a name="stpa_363">The success of the initiative would not, of course, have occurred without the Government, who have provided resources, financial support and strong commitment from the top. They have given a strong commitment to tackling crime and law and order problems, and have assisted the local authority and the partnership to deliver results.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-39_para8">
<a name="stpa_364">I naturally want to say a little about the respect agenda which the Prime Minister has led from the front. Middlesbrough, like every urban area, has experienced problems of crime and the rise of the yob culture, but it has actively developed a strategy of policies on the ground rooted in a firm determination to take back the streets and estate from the yobs and petty criminals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-39_para9">
<a name="stpa_365">I must declare an interest. I am a very good friend of the mayor, Ray Mallon, and I respect and admire the leadership that he has given our town. Since his election, he has become a national figure. Many Government and Opposition Front Benchers visit his office regularly. It has also been visited by Lord Falconer, the Lord Chancellor, by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and Wales, by the Minister of Communities and Local Government and, of course, by the Leader of Her   Majesty&#039;s Opposition. Both candidates for the Conservative party leadership have visited Ray Mallon and sought his counsel, and the great and the good of the Labour party establishment also visit and seek his support. He commands a great deal of respect at national level, and he too leads from the front.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-39_para10">
<a name="stpa_366">When Ray Mallon ran for office, he made it clear that tackling crime and disorder was one of his top priorities. He has delivered on that pledge, and the success of his approach is reflected in the fact that on the tough urban beat of Middlesbrough, crime has fallen by 20 per cent. since he became mayor. His first act, which he performed only months after taking office, was to launch an initiative called &quot;Raising Hope&quot;. Raising hopes and expectations of an effective crackdown on crime, bad manners and loutish behaviour was and is the key priority for everyone in the town.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-39_para11">
<a name="stpa_367">I know that directly from my constituency postbag, and also from the comments of people whom I meet in the streets, in their workplaces and at a series of coffee mornings that I hold throughout my constituency. For them, knowing that action is being taken to tackle crime 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Nov 2005 : Column 133</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and antisocial behaviour is the key to the hope of a   better quality of life. &quot;Raising Hope&quot; is truly a partnership approach, based on Ray Mallon&#039;s appreciation of the realities of policing in areas where the louts have established a dominant foothold. It is an   intelligence-led approach, and the police share data   and information on a daily basis. They work with   other control agencies, notably the council and its street-warden service but also local businesses, retailers, pubs and clubs and schools. Their approach links the panda car with the CCTV operator, the school head fighting truancy with the mobile truant patrols in the town centre, and the street warden with the local shop. Above all, it links all those agencies in a relationship with the people and communities of the town.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-39_para12">
<a name="stpa_368">Mayor Mallon&#039;s philosophy is holistic. To him, a clean, safe environment is one in which crime and antisocial behaviour are driven to the margins. To him, a confident community is one that knows it can report vandals and petty criminals to the authorities, who will listen to their concerns and take action against those who are reported. He also recognises that inequalities and divisions in local society, between rich and poor, young and old and black and white, create an environment in which crime and intolerance can flourish. He argues for the need to rebuild a 19th century industrial town as a new city fit for the 21st century, a city with new businesses, new jobs, new forms of leisure and consumption and clean, swift, efficient transport rising from the foundations of the old. Although all those priorities are ends in themselves, they all play a key role in crime eradication and in making Middlesbrough a truly safe community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-39_para13">
<a name="stpa_369">Ray Mallon has used the legislation provided by successive Government Acts and initiatives to structure his approach. Crucial legislation for him was the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 from the Home Office and the   Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s Local Government Act 2003. Combining the crime-fighting powers conferred on councils and elected mayors by   that legislation, he was able to weave together an all-embracing culture in the council and, crucially, outside it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-39_para14">
<a name="stpa_370">Ray Mallon has told me of his frustration with those agencies that publish glossy mission statements and strategy documents and then retire from activity. Those agencies are convinced that, by merely drawing up those   documents, they have fulfilled their obligations to their stakeholders and clients. He has told me that he feels that that is one key reason why there is so much cynicism among the general public over the effectiveness of crime-busting measures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-39_para15">
<a name="stpa_371">In order to sell his mission to the people of Middlesbrough, Ray Mallon embarked on a comprehensive road show engaging in debate and discussion with people across the town. I have been present with him at many of those events and he in turn has been prepared to assist me when I have held similar &quot;meet the people&quot; sessions in the part of Middlesbrough that lies in my constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-39_para16">
<a name="stpa_372">Ray Mallon takes a personal interest in listening to the people on the front line of local government. Too many councillors, he argues, relate only to chief 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Nov 2005 : Column 134</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>executives, policy officers and departmental heads. He listens to people in local government such as street wardens, road sweepers, toilet attendants, lollipop ladies and home carers, who seldom, if ever, get to meet their councillors face to face to give their views on the service that they provide and how it could be improved. Mayor Mallon regularly drops in at depots and offices to hear what those employees say and he believes that it has paid dividends.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-39_para17">
<a name="stpa_373">Mayor Mallon also recognises that many of the problems facing local communities suffering from crime and antisocial behaviour come from the activities of local young people. He and his cabinet, most notably Councillor Barry Coppinger, the council&#039;s lead member for community security, see diversionary activity as the key to peeling youngsters off the road to crime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-39_para18">
<a name="stpa_374">The local drug scene is an example. The headlines talk of crack and heroin. Sadly, crack and heroin abuse does exist in our community. Indeed, much of that abuse contributes to the basic motivation of most of the muggings and burglaries that take place across Middlesbrough. A crack or heroin addict needs constantly to replenish his or her &quot;high&quot; and usually it is someone else&#039;s money, handbag or cash till that becomes the target. That is why the crackdown on hard drugs is central for both Cleveland police and the council&#039;s community wardens.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-39_para19">
<a name="stpa_375">However, far more common than hard drugs is the use of so-called &quot;recreational drugs&quot; for Saturday night fever&#151;mainly ecstasy and other amphetamines. The   council&#039;s drug strategy reflects that division. The strategy and council staff back Cleveland police 100 per cent. in their &quot;get a dealer a day&quot; campaign and in their work of identifying, targeting and then raiding crack and heroin dens, but they also run education programmes across schools, youth clubs and colleges, alerting youngsters to the dangers posed by the abuse of recreational drugs and to what that abuse can lead to.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-39_para20">
<a name="stpa_376">Youth activity and empowerment is central to the council. A small sum spent on a youth centre in an informal setting on an estate, or a minor shift of moneys from the mainstream education budget to a special diversionary scheme run at a street level can bring great rewards. It can pay valuable dividends for the future and can be achieved easily and effortlessly if the will is there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-39_para21">
<a name="stpa_377">The alternative, of course, is to do nothing. That may safeguard the sanctity of a local council&#039;s or school&#039;s budget in the short term, but will cost society heavily in the years to come. It can cost heavily as antisocial behaviour or teenage deviancy becomes the modus operandi of sub-criminal and criminal behaviour in early adulthood. That is why the need to ensure the success of the respect agenda is so vital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-39_para22">
<a name="stpa_378">We have to remember that we all pay a price for allowing criminality to flourish unchecked. There is the human price wreaked on the powerless and vulnerable by the activities of the thugs and the hooligans, and the   physical price of constantly having to resource an ever-expanding police and community security budget, let alone the price of running an effective offender management service and the Prison Service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-39_para23">
<a name="stpa_379">For the respect agenda to take root and flourish, and for it be accepted for real by a jaded public, it has to be seen as part of an all-embracing and holistic programme that is a core part of the life of the community and

<a name="stpa_383">This debate comes at a very opportune time as the   crime and disorder reduction partnership in Middlesbrough has undergone a number of changes recently. It is now in a better position to deliver its ambitious target of reducing crime by over 20 per cent. by 2008. Such a target is not an end in itself but, if achieved, will have a considerable impact on the safety and confidence of my hon. Friend&#039;s constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-40_para3">
<a name="stpa_384">I will comment in more detail on the situation in Middlesbrough in a moment. But first, I should like to set the context by saying one or two things about the Government&#039;s overall strategy for reducing crime and the progress that we are making.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-40_para4">
<a name="stpa_385">Although it is true that our constituents remain understandably worried about crime and still perceive it as one of the main issues that the Government need to address, in fact, crime in England and Wales has been falling dramatically over the past decade. Since 1997, overall crime as measured by the British crime survey is down by 35 per cent., with particularly significant reductions in domestic burglary and vehicle crime. According to the BCS, violent crime has reduced by 34 per cent. in the same period.

<a name="51107-40_para5">
<a name="stpa_386">However, such progress is meaningful only if it is translated from percentages into something practical and real at local level that enables local communities to feel safer and to be more secure. I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for explaining how this strategy applies in a challenging urban area such as Middlesbrough, which experiences a wide range of crime-related problems. I   am certainly pleased to hear positive feedback about   how crime and disorder is being tackled in Middlesbrough, and how the local community&#039;s concerns are being taken fully into account.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-40_para6">
<a name="stpa_387">As I said at the beginning, this is a good time to talk about crime and disorder in Middlesbrough. This year, the Audit Commission found evidence that fear of crime in Middlesbrough appears to be reducing&#151;a feeling supported by recent significant reductions in vehicle crime and robbery. Acquisitive crime&#151;such crime is often associated with drug misuse, as my hon. Friend said&#151;has also reduced significantly overall, pointing to the success of programmes and initiatives such as the drug interventions programme, which is targeted at drug misusers caught in the criminal justice system, and   the prolific and priority offenders programme. The   latter is targeted at those who commit a disproportionate amount of crime and disorder in our communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-40_para7">
<a name="stpa_388">This progress was noted during self-assessment of the prolific offenders scheme that was recently conducted in   collaboration with the Government office for the north-east. The scheme was particularly strong in areas such as performance management and establishing good practice. The interim evaluation report on the national prolific offenders strategy, which was published just a couple of weeks ago, suggests that the scheme may be having a positive impact on re-offending among this hard core group. I will follow the progress of the Middlesbrough scheme with great interest following this debate. Some other partnerships in the area are also having a positive impact. For example, the Cleveland local criminal justice board is bringing agencies together to ensure, for example, that a larger number of offenders are brought to justice, and that greater community confidence can be built throughout the local area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-40_para8">
<a name="stpa_389">Following the 2004 crime and disorder audit in Middlesbrough, extensive consultation took place involving community organisations, businesses and other stakeholders, in order to help set out the local strategy for the period 2005&#150;08. Respondents were asked about their main priorities for the partnership to tackle, and the following five themes were identified as being of greatest concern: antisocial behaviour, misuse of drugs, house burglary, robbery and mugging, and street violence. As a result of this consultation, the Safer Middlesbrough partnership has agreed an ambitious 20.1 per cent. crime reduction target for the period 2005&#150;08. This target includes a reduction in common assault and wounding of 30 per cent. The partnership has been restructured to integrate drug and crime issues fully under a new chair and a new executive. Although the partnership faces a period of change, local people have every reason to be positive about the changes that have been made, which should ensure that the right structures are in place to deliver the area&#039;s crime reduction target.

<a name="51107-40_para9">
<a name="stpa_390">Other welcome developments include the introduction of four problem-solving groups to cover the whole of Middlesbrough, in alignment with the community policing areas. The partnership is also implementing initiatives to address drug and alcohol-related violent crime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-40_para10">
<a name="stpa_391">I would also like to commend the partnership agencies in Middlesbrough for their success in tackling antisocial behaviour, using a range of effective tactics, such as antisocial behaviour orders and dispersal orders, to make the streets and neighbourhoods safer. My hon. Friend mentioned and laid great emphasis on the respect agenda, which is being led from the centre and right across government, introducing a range of practical measures to deal with disorder and change the culture so that we can remove fear and enable people to feel safer in their own homes and on their streets. My hon. Friend was quite right to emphasise that it is the poor and the vulnerable who suffer most when people show disrespect in our local communities. Dealing with the problem is very much a matter of social justice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-40_para11">
<a name="stpa_392">In support of those improvements, Government investment in Middlesbrough is increasing. During the current year, the Safer Middlesbrough partnership will receive a total of &#163;345,220 from the Home Office element of the safer stronger communities fund. That will be   used to help achieve the agreed crime reduction targets as well as local priorities and includes &#163;25,000 specifically to tackle antisocial behaviour.

<p><a name="st_395"><a name="51107-40_spnew0"><b> Greg Clark  (Tunbridge Wells) (Con):</b> 
 The Minister rightly makes great play of the importance of reducing drug offending, especially among young people, but does he accept that in order to get young people off   drugs, they have to go through a period of rehabilitation? However, there is currently only one place in rehab for every 10 juvenile drug addicts, so will he clarify how he intends to deal with that problem, not just in Middlesbrough but throughout the country more widely?
</p>





<p><a name="st_396"><a name="51107-40_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I would be happy to make a few remarks that I intended to make in any event about drug misusers, particularly young people, and how best to deal with them. The best way to get them off drugs is to   prevent them from getting into drugs in the first place. That can help enormously and result in fewer victims of crime around the areas where they steal in order to fund their drug habits. Of course, residential rehabilitation can form an important part of a drug programme for a young person, as for an adult, but we need a range of programmes and interventions to make the difference.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-40_para12">
<a name="stpa_393">The drug interventions programme is now developing well&#151;not just in Middlesbrough but across the country&#151;and I can tell the hon. Gentleman that in June this year, 2,000 drug misusing offenders came into treatment. That is well on the way to our target of getting 1,000 such offenders into treatment every week by 2008. Of course, once we have got people into treatment, we need to keep them in it to ensure that we reap the full impact&#151;a change in their behaviour. Some of the signs are very encouraging. I attended an event earlier this evening and noted that people at the front line of drug services are developing better ways of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Nov 2005 : Column 138</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>ensuring that people stay in treatment. That can change their lives and ensure that they resort to fewer crimes in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-40_para13">
<a name="stpa_394">I and my hon. Friend have spoken positively about what is taking place locally and nationally, but there is no room for complacency at either local or national level   and we recognise the disproportionate impact that   crimes of violence can have on the confidence and well-being of a victim and in the wider community. That is why we introduced the Violent Crime Reduction Bill to give the police and local communities the powers that they need to tackle guns, knives and alcohol-related violence. There are a range of measures in the Bill with which my hon. Friend will be familiar.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-40_para14">
<a name="stpa_395">We want to give the police and the courts new powers to tackle violent criminals and ensure that they are effectively punished. We want to crack down on imitation firearms and misuse of air guns. We want to raise to 18 the minimum age at which people can buy a knife. We want to give the police powers to require licensed pubs or clubs to search for weapons on entry, and to empower head teachers to search pupils for knives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-40_para15">
<a name="stpa_396">I hope that my hon. Friend will agree that the action that we are taking, the policies that I have described and the figures that I provided earlier all represent a significant achievement. Such achievements are often down to those people who work together at the local level to deliver services that can make a difference.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-40_para16">
<a name="stpa_397">Perhaps most important is that the risk of being a victim of crime is now a quarter lower than it was in 1997, which means that 3.3 million fewer people are falling victim to crime. That encourages greater confidence in our communities, helping people to feel safer as fewer neighbours, friends and family members experience the trauma of burglary or robbery. We are also getting a firmer grip on antisocial behaviour and a combination of legislation and strong partnership is working to make our streets and communities safer. As my hon. Friend said, we have set up the respect task force to drive that agenda further forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-40_para17">
<a name="stpa_398">We are working with our partners&#151;the police, crime and disorder reduction partnerships, the correctional services and many others&#151;to develop a wide-ranging strategy focused on several areas. First, we want to prevent and deter first-time offending, through interventions that deal with the causes of crime and divert young people in particular away from trouble. Secondly, the prolific and other priority offenders strategy targets those who commit most offences. We have plans to reduce the opportunities for crime, including making cars that are harder to steal, designing houses that are more difficult to burgle, creating environments that are safer, and&#151;crucially&#151;giving greater support to victims and witnesses. So much of what the Government have done in recent years has tried to redress the imbalance in the criminal justice system and make it much more in favour of the victims and witnesses of crime, not those who commit crime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51107-40_para18">
<a name="stpa_399">To complement those plans, we have record numbers not only of police officers, but police support staff, who are trained to carry out specific roles so that police officers can be freed up to protect the public by patrolling the streets where the public want to see them. We now have more than 6,300 community support

<b>7 Nov 2005 : Column 139</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>officers in England and Wales and we are on target to   have 24,000&#151;as promised in our election manifesto&#151;by 2008. Community support officers and neighbourhood wardens, also mentioned by my hon. Friend, have increased the visibility of the police family by reassuring the community and preventing crime. The introduction of CSOs was one of the main planks of our first round of police reform&#151;a process that we are continuing, in consultation with the police service and its partners.

<a name="stpa_400">As I hope this debate has made clear, the Government have placed crime and disorder at the heart of our programme of reform. We are now seeing the results, not least in my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency. The Government are committed to building on our reforms and to continue to drive down crime and the fear of crime across our communities, including those represented by my hon. Friend.
