Manchester were pretty much abandoned. A great deal of thought and planning went into deciding the size of the new maternity units. Account has been taken of the number of births, ongoing changes to maternity practice and projected birth rates. Taking all factors into account, all the new maternity units will have the flexibility for additional capacity, should it be needed.

 Decisions such as that taken by my hon. Friend&#146;s PCT are for local primary care trusts. I have to challenge him on his interpretation of the National Audit Office findings and the Healthcare Commission&#146;s findings. The NAO report did not find any evidence of risk to patient safety in out-of-hours services, and it showed that eight out of 10 patients were satisfied. As I have said, the Healthcare Commission report found significant improvements in performance since 2005. Neither of the reports found that there was variable performance between private and non-private providers.</p>

 As a doctor himself, the hon. Gentleman will know that this country has among the highest levels of vetting of professionals of any country in the world. Employers have a legal duty to ensure that all doctors whom they appoint are fit to practice, and all doctors, including locums, must be on an official performers list, and must be registered with the independent regulatory body, the General Medical Council. He is right: we are talking about an absolutely terrible case, for which the doctor has been tried in his absence. As a result, as I informed the House, the SHA, with local primary care trusts, is reviewing the contract given to the company concerned. There are clear legal obligations on PCTs and strategic health authorities to ensure that their out-of-hours services are safe. Something went terribly wrong in the case that we are discussing, and he is right that it is important that both the local and national NHS learns the lessons as a result of it.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point. The vast majority of out-of-hours services up and down the country are still provided by local GPs, whether working in co-operatives or social enterprises, or for private organisations that are contracted or commissioned by the primary care trust. The difference between the system now and the previous system is that they are not compelled to do so. The problem with the previous system was that GPs often felt overtired: mistakes were made and the service was patchy and dangerous in many places. The Conservative idea of going back to the bad old days of forcing all GPs to provide out-of-hours-services would be an absolute disaster.</p>

As we have heard, the tragic death of David Gray in Cambridgeshire starkly highlighted the inconsistencies and variations in primary care trusts&#146; registration of locums, as well as the lack of co-ordinated quality in patient safety standards. That needs to be addressed urgently.

 It is only since 2004 that we have had a framework that is supposed to deliver a uniform service across the country. People behave and talk as if there was some golden age in which there was a wonderful out-of-hours service, but it did not exist. Some parts of the country did not have a service at all; in other parts, the service was dangerous or patchy. Doctors resented being forced to do that work, and we had massive recruitment problems, particularly for women doctors. Doctors were often overtired, and there were serious accidents. We now have a system in place with a legal responsibility on the commissioners at local level&#151;the PCTs&#151;to deliver a quality service for their population. They are overseen by the regional level of the NHS and by the independent regulator, who did not exist before. We therefore believe that we have the right systems in place&#151;it is the implementation of those systems that we need to ensure is right, and as the independent Healthcare Commission itself says, the quality of out-of-hours services has improved significantly since 2005.</p>

 That has been working well. The Health Protection Agency has been doing the contact tracing&#151;tracing those who have been in close contact with people who are symptomatic. When we publish the information about new cases, the agency makes sure that the families and close relatives have been advised first, so that the information is known to them first, and then we do the contact tracing.</p>

One of our worries has been the problems that children have been having. Text messages have been sent and there has been bullying around the idea that people from the school concerned have some kind of plague. That has caused the Health Protection Agency not to name publicly the schools involved. I guess that, locally, the schools will become known pretty quickly, not least because they generally close for seven days. But people are trying to be sensitive about the information and to ensure that the policy of containment works and that people support it. Incidentally, all our evidence from the public&#151;most recently this morning&#151;is that between 75 and 80 per cent. of them think that what I have described is the right way to deal with the outbreak.</p>

 I hope to be able to say more about the vaccine in the debate on Thursday. British scientists at the Health Protection Agency in Colindale have identified the strain&#151;the so-called isolate. They have passed that to Potter&#146;s Bar, where the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control will now do the work of producing a vaccine. That work has been completed, and the next stage is what I hope to be able to tell Parliament about on Thursday. Efforts are going on in this country and abroad to ensure that we get a vaccine developed as quickly as possible. Of course, it would take at least five to six months to manufacture and produce it. However, we hope that having taken the first step, whereby we have identified the isolate, the next stage&#151;to get the vaccine from that&#151;is very close.</p>

 Spending on the development, delivery and maintenance of the choose and book IT system to March 2009 was &#163;134 million. As at 31 March 2008, which is the latest date for which an estimate of the overall local and central expenditure on the NHS IT programme was made, the National Audit Office estimated that a total of some &#163;3.55 billion had been spent on the programme.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. I speak to a lot of GPs, as I am sure all Members do, and the impression that I get from them is that patients prefer their GPs&#146; advice. GPs know their patients rather better than do software systems, which often override patient preferences anyway. In view of that, and given that the system has had a long time to bed in, is the Minister content that it is giving real value for money?</p>

 I am slightly puzzled by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question. There is no contradiction between using choose and book and giving patients choice; in fact, choose and book is a vital component in helping GPs to ensure that their patients are given choice. If, as he says, there are GPs in Cornwall who are not offering their patients that choice, I find that as unacceptable as he does. If there is a problem with the choose and book system whereby slots are not becoming available, which may be what he wants me to address, that is an issue that the local primary care trust needs to address. The latest figures for Cornwall that I have show that it is one of the highest performers in the country on choose and book, with up to 80 per cent. of GP referrals being made through that system. It therefore sounds to me as though both choose and book and the choice system are working pretty well in Cornwall.</p>

However, given that according to the National Audit Office the figures are running at &#163;3.5 billion, has he analysed the benefit that is derived from such schemes compared with the cost of investing in other parts of the NHS? There is a great feeling that IT is overtaking many other aspects of clinical care, and that many local needs could otherwise be met through those funds. Is he convinced of the value for money of this funding?</p>

 There is no doubt that an initiative such as choose and book is cheaper and easier to use and helps to enable the choice system or other elements of the national IT programme such as picture archiving, which is incredibly important and successful around the country. No one can have any doubt that these initiatives have not only improved the quality of patient care but are saving the NHS a lot of money. At this stage of the national programme&#146;s development, it is difficult to quantify the total benefit in terms of economics and patient gain, but every day patients and clinicians are benefiting from the advantages that the computer system provides to them. There are still many challenges ahead&#151;I do not duck those at all&#151;but countries all over the world are considering this, including Barack Obama&#146;s America, where people are looking to introduce a similar sort of national computer system into the American health care system as the one we have here.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. In Health questions just now, I referred to Stafford hospital. In the light of what the Leader of the House said in reply to a question that I put on 30 April, I and other Members thought we could expect an oral statement&#151;not merely a written statement&#151;from the Secretary of State regarding the Stafford hospital situation, given the reports. In fact, I think it is true to say that the Secretary of State has certainly, during the course of the last 10 days, indicated to me that he thought he would be doing so.

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90512-0004.htm_para4"><a name="09051228000170"><i> Motion for leave to introduce a Bill (Standing Order No. 23)</i></p>
<a name="ordayhd_1"><a name="90512-0004.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="09051228000309"><h5 align="left">3.37 pm</h5>
<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="90512-0004.htm_para5"><a name="09051228000171">Mr. Mike Hall (Weaver Vale) (Lab): I beg to move,</p>
<a name="90512-0004.htm_brev3"><a name="09051228000298"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require water companies to exempt from surface water and highway drainage charges places of worship, non-profit making sports clubs, scout groups and guide associations; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90512-0004.htm_para6"><a name="09051228000172">In short, the need for this Bill has been created by the water regulator, Ofwat, when it called on water companies to alter the way in which they charged for surface area and highway drainage, and by the very short-sighted actions of United Utilities, when it implemented changes to the way in which it charged non-household customers for surface water drainage&#151;incidentally, those changes were approved by Ofwat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90512-0004.htm_para7"><a name="09051228000173">On 30 September 2003, Ofwat announced the outcome of its review into how water companies charged for surface water drainage. It concluded that the fairest way to charge for surface water drainage was by charging non-household customers on the basis of the size of their estate&#151;that is called site area charging. However, Ofwat failed to implement its own guidance in those matters and did not carry out a regulatory impact assessment on the change of policy. Astonishingly, it did no work on the impact that surface area charging would have on community voluntary groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="90512-0004.htm_para8"><a name="09051228000174">What Ofwat did instead was to warn water companies that a change to surface area charging may have a negative impact on sensitive properties such as schools, hospitals and places of worship. In general, Ofwat warned water companies that they would need to take into account the scale and speed of any changes to see whether they were reasonable and acceptable to customers. United Utilities took Ofwat&#146;s advice and brought in surface area charging, but it did not take into account the scale and speed of the changes, the impact that that would have on its customers and whether that was reasonable or acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="90512-0004.htm_para9"><a name="09051228000175">In defence of the change, United Utilities stated that it had been required by Ofwat to bring in surface area charging. It went on to claim that the changes would be revenue neutral. On that point, United Utilities has not been able to produce figures that substantiate that claim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90512-0004.htm_para10"><a name="09051228000176">It was not long before churches, community sports clubs and scout groups contacted me about media reports and contacts from their parent organisations warning that they would be required by United Utilities to pay massive increases for surface area and highway drainage. Before the change to surface area charging was introduced, such organisations had been granted significant discounts on their water bills because of their status. Their bills were based on the rateable value of their property, which was either zero or heavily discounted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90512-0004.htm_para11"><a name="09051228000177">I took up these cases with United Utilities. Sadly, in several cases, it emerged that United Utilities had not been billing the organisations for water rates at all, and it then decided to issue them with water bills based on surface area charging. The bills were also backdated for seven years. That was a particularly insensitive approach by United Utilities.</p>
<br>


<meta name="Date" content="12 May 2009">

<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>12 May 2009 : Column 685</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90512-0004.htm_para12"><a name="09051228000178">I will give two examples of just how much the water bills are going up. The 1st Halton scout group in my constituency saw its water bill go up from &#163;37.80 to &#163;198, which equals a massive 424 per cent. increase. St. Mark&#146;s church and the Bethesda church in the Hallwood ecumenical parish in Runcorn are billed jointly. In 2007-08, they did not pay any water rates. In 2008-09, their surface area charge went up to &#163;181.76. That is set to rise to approximately &#163;2,000 by 2010-11. That is a massive increase that the Hallwood ecumenical parish will not be able to afford.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="90512-0004.htm_para13"><a name="09051228000179">For places of worship, community sports clubs, scout groups and guide associations, every extra &#163;1 they spend on surface water drainage is &#163;1 less that they have to spend on the valuable services they provide for their parishioners, communities and members. In the area covered by United Utilities, there are more than 2,000 faith buildings and 600 not-for-profit sports clubs. There are also 900 scout groups in the United Utilities area which are going from strength to strength. Over a three-year period, those groups will face an increase in bills of up to around &#163;2,000 per annum. If those increases are implemented, for many groups it will mean bankruptcy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="90512-0004.htm_para14"><a name="09051228000180">There has been considerable criticism of the way in which the surface area charging scheme has been implemented for places of worship, community sports clubs, scouts and guides. That criticism has come from both sides of this House, and we have seen concerted effort from hon. Members, especially through the all-party scout group, to try to change the policy. Interestingly, Ofwat has now started to criticise United Utilities&#146; approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="90512-0004.htm_para15"><a name="09051228000181">On 21 January, Ofwat issued a statement saying that United Utilities had poorly implemented the new system of surface water charges. In particular, it had failed to communicate the fairness and environmental benefits of the new system and failed to take into account the impact on the 2,000 faith buildings and 600 not-for-profit sports clubs in its area. Ofwat went on to announce that United Utilities had agreed to a one-year moratorium during which surface area charges would be frozen at 2008-09 levels for faith buildings, community sports clubs, scout groups and guide associations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="90512-0004.htm_para16"><a name="09051228000182">At face value, that was a much welcomed measure. However, I am very concerned that this one-year moratorium will only delay the implementation of surface area charging and will not result in a charging policy that is both acceptable and fair to those groups. The reason why I am concerned is that Ofwat has made it clear that United Utilities should use the one-year moratorium to work with customers to communicate the need for the new charges and offer advice on how they can implement environmental improvements which will help them to reduce costs significantly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="90512-0004.htm_para17"><a name="09051228000183">Ofwat has also said that United Utilities will use the moratorium to create a new time frame for the implementation of the surface area charging scheme by spreading the remaining charge over a longer period of time to allow time for customers to take measures that will offset future costs and also benefit the environment. On that basis, at the beginning of the financial year  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="12 May 2009">

<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>12 May 2009 : Column 686</b><br>
2010-11, places of worship, community sports clubs, scout groups and guide associations will still be faced with substantially larger bills for surface area drainage. Simply altering the implementation date is not good enough. Those organisations want to see a scheme that places them back where they were prior to the change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="90512-0004.htm_para18"><a name="09051228000184">Ofwat has made it clear that certain water companies have been able to bring in changes to charges that have been beneficial to the communities they serve, and it cites Severn Trent Water. Severn Trent has an exemption for community and voluntary groups from surface area charging. It is very popular with those groups, for understandable reasons, and that is why there have been no complaints to Ofwat about the charges under Severn Trent. Unfortunately, Ofwat has instructed Severn Trent that the exemption cannot continue and that it must re-visit the scheme and remove any subsidies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="90512-0004.htm_para19"><a name="09051228000185">Ofwat has made it clear to water companies that it will not approve any tariffs for surface area charging that involve cross-subsidies, are based on rateable values or involve exemptions. Ofwat has also instructed all water companies that their tariffs for surface area charging have to be approved by November this year. Conversely, Ofwat has not said what types of charges other than surface area charging will be acceptable. Unless something is done now, places of worship, non-profit making sports clubs, scout groups and guide associations will still be faced with the bills, which will have been delayed for only 12 months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="90512-0004.htm_para20"><a name="09051228000186">United Utilities and other water companies have fallen foul of the same directives from Ofwat. We have here a classic case of unintended consequences of the actions of the regulator, and only the regulator can break the deadlock and put things right. United Utilities and other water companies say that they do not have the legal scope to bring in a scheme for surface area charging that will benefit places of worship, community sports clubs and guides and scouts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="90512-0004.htm_para21"><a name="09051228000187">The Bill sends a very strong message to Ofwat that it must act now to break the deadlock, and must start to be part of the solution and stop being part of the problem. If action is not taken now, it will have a massive impact, with massive water bills closing down places of worship, community sports clubs, scout groups and guide associations across the county. The purpose of this Bill is to provide certainty that such a scheme is possible by bringing forward legislation that exempts places of worship, community sports clubs and guides and scouts from having to pay surface area drainage charges. I commend my Bill to the House.</p>

We have tabled amendment 1 for the same reasons that applied last year. We believe that the headline rate of corporation tax is uncompetitive, and that it impacts on the UK&#146;s attractiveness as a place to do business.

The average in the OECD is 22.5 per cent., so Britain&#146;s rate is some 5.5 per cent. higher than that. That is something that we need to address. Without a change, we are likely to find ourselves slipping further down the OECD table and putting ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to other members of the OECD, the G20 and the EU.</p>

how much the proposal would cost and how the Opposition intend to pay for it. On the point of comparison, however, does the hon. Gentleman agree that our present 28 per cent. rate is distinctly lower than the various forms of corporation tax in France or Germany, taken together?

It is not good enough to say, &#147;Okay, France and Germany have higher rates than we do.&#148; We need to look at the broad perspective, because there are other countries that are happy to compete for inward investment and people to join their work forces.</p>

I would not want always to benchmark myself against the performance of the French and German economies.

He is right: there are other factors that businesses bear in mind when thinking about the location of their business. They include the predictability and certainty of the tax system, which again are perceived to be weaknesses in the UK tax regime.

 My right hon. Friend makes some important points. I shall discuss later some of the companies that have relocated from the UK to overseas jurisdictions because of tax regimes and rates. A number of Lloyds-based insurers have moved to Bermuda, in part for regulatory reasons, but in part because of the rate of corporation tax in Bermuda. Canada is setting a clear policy goal of having the most competitive rate within the G7, because the Canadians recognise how easy it is to move from one jurisdiction to another, particularly among English-speaking countries, and how important tax is&#151;perhaps following the Irish example, where a very low corporation tax rate was set to attract businesses into the country.</p>

 People regard such tax policies as a way to gain competitive advantage and we need to bear that in mind. When I first spoke on a Budget from the Dispatch Box, in 2006, when the right hon.

I thought that that was a disappointing, short-sighted view of the importance of tax to attracting businesses to the UK. The present Financial Secretary is much more aware of these matters and I expect us to discuss some of the reforms to the taxation of foreign profits later.

Norway and Sweden are in line with us, but Canada&#151;a member of the G7&#151;has a rate of 19.5 per cent.; our position in the G7 is therefore under threat from Canada. Within the EU, the Czech Republic, one of the new accession states, has a rate of 21 per cent., and Portugal, Greece, Denmark and Austria all have a rate of 25 per cent. Although the rate in Germany is a central Government rate, clearly there are federal rates, too. The headline rate in Germany is 15.83 per cent. There are a range of views.

 Surely the point is that when we make a judgment we have to take the most meaningful comparators. We could include whatever country we liked from across the world, if we took what the hon.

Given the economic situation in Ireland&#151;businesses are closing down and leaving that country&#151;is it really a valid comparison? Is that really the model that we should look to?

problem for the Irish economy, as I understand it, is that because of the euro there were low interest rates when the economy was booming. There was an asset price bubble in Ireland, which has burst, as it burst in the UK. Some of Ireland&#146;s problems flow from that, rather than from the fact that it has a low corporation tax rate or a particular regulatory environment.</p>

 I am not sure that it is the main cause, which is the asset price bubble that built up because credit was cheap, thus enabling people to borrow, pushing up prices in the housing market. That is exactly what has happened in the UK. We have a solution in macro-prudential regulation and in giving the Bank of England greater control over the amount of debt in the economy, which will tackle issues relevant to the asset price bubble at a time when inflation rates are lower.

The first was that, in his estimate, the cost would be &#163;6 billion and he asked where the Conservative party would find that money; the second was to ask why the hon.

Because we are so open, we cannot tax businesses on the basis that they have no choice but to stay here. The evidence has shown that businesses move. During the period covering the last Finance Bill, when we debated the same issue, companies such as United Business Media, Shire, Kraft, Experian and Google had moved outside the UK. To pick up on the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham, since then, Beazley, a Lloyd&#146;s of London insurer; WPP, the advertising giant; Regus, which provides office services; Henderson, a major fund manager; and Charter, an engineering company have all done the same.

There is an issue about the tax take and what a tax gap is. One comment made about research by the TUC is that it does not take into account some of structural reliefs that are in place in the UK tax system.

He prayed it in aid in relation to VAT in last week&#146;s debate on the Bill. I do not know whether he has seen Canada&#146;s aspiration for corporation tax rates, which was highlighted in the report produced by Bob Wigley for Boris Johnson. It stated that Canada&#146;s mission statement on tax was that:</p>

 Indeed, and that is why I carefully quoted the report, pointing out that the quotation related to the general federal rate. The report flags up the scale of the reduction&#151;7 percentage points&#151;in the federal rate of tax. The Canadian Government believe that that will provide the lowest overall rate of tax on new business investment in the G7, which is a clear statement of direction. In thinking about how economies move out of recession and plan for the future, countries that can afford such tax changes will think very carefully about making them.</p>

That is why the package we propose today is cost-neutral.

We will bring the rate of capital allowances more closely into line with the accounting measure for depreciation, which is meant to reflect the deterioration in value of assets over their life.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his generosity in giving way. On the projections for corporation tax this year&#151;I do not say he accepts those figures&#151;the amendment would cost the Exchequer &#163;3.7 billion. If he proposes a cost-neutral package, the &#163;3.7 billion will be raised from businesses through other mechanisms&#151;for example, changes in allowances. How would the amendment, as part of such an overall package, have any effect on whether a company decided to relocate to Switzerland? A company would examine the total tax burden, including allowances, not simply the headline rate of corporation tax.</p>

 I do not agree and I shall explain why. The hon. Gentleman argues that there is a clear relationship between businesses that pay corporation tax and those that benefit from capital allowances. He claims that they are alike in their profile, but I do not think that that is the case. The headline rate sends a powerful signal to business about the advantages of locating in the UK. Perhaps some businesses are not interested in capital allowances; that depends on the nature of the business&#151;on whether it is service-oriented or invests more in capital equipment. There is a mixture of incentives, and there will be some winners and losers. However, it is important to send a signal about the direction of travel. There is no money available for tax cuts, so a funded package is the sensible way to send the right signal to business about the importance to us of the UK tax system&#146;s remaining competitive.</p>

 The debate is interesting. As the hon. Gentleman said, we often had it in the Treasury, and the headline rate seems attractive. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) said, the tax burden remains the same. Will the hon. Gentleman bear in mind the massive impact of &#163;3.7 billion a year on capital allowances? It cannot simply be dismissed as a compensating factor. The problem with much of British industry, particularly the manufacturing sector, is the UK&#146;s persistent tendency to under-invest in capital. Increasingly, we say that we will have cheaper and more flexible labour and we chase that market down, but it does not get us anywhere. Let us consider what the Germans have done. Germany is the biggest exporter in the world. Its manufacturing sector is strong because of its continuing capital investment in its industry. By how much would the &#163;3.7 billion a year reduce capital allowances? Has the hon. Gentleman taken that into account? Can he give us that figure?</p>

 Bringing those allowances into line with depreciation is no good at all.

Tight though Lord Weinstock&#146;s controls were, investment often ran at less than the depreciation rate. Manufacturing is a bit more in the spotlight now&#151;rightly so, I think, and not just because I represent a manufacturing constituency in Coventry, in the west midlands&#151;and it is regaining importance, given the imbalance that the collapse in the financial sector has caused, which we need to remove.

The Treasury recognises the power of the argument. Indeed, the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor), who is a great campaigner against the tax gap, will be very concerned about distortions in the tax system that led to particular types of behaviour. I just think that the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West should be a little more careful not to state the Government&#146;s case too boldly.</p>

 Is there not a slight paradox, given the argument being made?

We have had debates in Committee about reformed capital allowances before. The Financial Secretary and I had a debate about the abolition of the industrial buildings and agricultural buildings allowances. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The Minister says from a sedentary position, &#147;You were against it.&#148; We argued that the issue should be explored in more detail&#151;so that the competitive impact could be considered&#151;and that the Government had rushed into things without proper thought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="90512-0006.htm_para12"><a name="09051228000281">There are issues on both sides of the argument, although I take on board the important comment that the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West made about manufacturing. I know from my experience of visiting manufacturing companies in my constituency that compete at the top end, producing high value-added items that compete with the best&#151;that is, if they are not the best in the world themselves&#151;that there is a mixture of plant in those operations. There are some very old, faithful bits of kit in those factories, as well as some very new, modern equipment. It has been pointed out that the life of some of the more modern pieces is quite short, in relation to their contribution to the top end of manufacturing, and that they might therefore require a shorter depreciation period and a steeper write-off. We need to think about that.</p>

We must be mindful of that. We are not blind to the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West, but we do not want to see distortion in the tax system.</p>

 Distortion in the tax system is one thing, and we have had the arguments about neutrality. I am sorry that I was not at the previous meetings of the Committee. May I just plead that we do not build into Conservative thinking the idea that the Treasury or the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform have ever had the policy&#151;which the hon. Gentleman is now adopting&#151;of reducing capital allowances down to the bare minimum of depreciation? That cannot be a proper theoretical or practical position to take up.</p>

 This is about trying to reduce distortions in the tax system to ensure that decisions are not being driven by tax considerations. The rate of the capital allowance is a cash flow issue. Over the life of an asset, a business will get full relief on that asset, assuming that it uses it until it is scrapped. It is a question of timing as to when that relief arises. I am sure that, at a later stage in Committee, we shall have a debate about the 40 per cent. first-year allowance being introduced in the Bill. Perhaps such a measure is right in a crisis, but for the purposes of the long-term reform and simplification of corporation tax, we need to look at reducing the distortions in the system.</p>

Companies&#146; compliance costs would also be reduced, and my old employer, PricewaterhouseCoopers, might not get quite the same revenue flow from tax planning as it had in the past. That might be a price worth paying, however.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="90512-0007.htm_para1"><a name="09051228000286">I have spoken for rather longer than I hoped to, but the Committee will be pleased to know that I have almost completed my remarks on this subject. It is important for Britain&#146;s competitive position in the global economy that we have a corporation tax regime that is fit for purpose. Part of that can be achieved through tackling complexity, improving predictability and certainty, and having a proper consultation process in place. A fundamental part of the package, however, is to reduce the headline rate of corporation tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="90512-0007.htm_para2"><a name="09051228000287">The amendment is part of a package that would ensure that the measure was cost-neutral. Regrettably, I cannot table amendments that would increase the tax take, so I cannot propose the flipside to this package, which would change capital allowances. However, we have set out a clear package of measures to reform corporation tax, in order to improve the competitiveness of the UK economy. As we look beyond the recession, we need to ensure that we are competitive not only with the G7 but with other global economies, so as to make the best of the advantages that we have, to broaden the base of the economy and to bring wealth and prosperity back to the UK.</p>

 Having been lucky enough to catch your eye, Sir Alan, I wish briefly to revert to the question of effectively reducing the capital allowances, which would come into effect in year 1. Given the recession and its likely progression, immediate cash-benefit to companies is the very thing we need at the moment. Despite the seeming good news today, I think we all know that we are still in a precarious position and should not take anything for granted. The real need is for cash flows to companies now, so reducing capital allowances at this point in time would hit the very thing we need for the future, which is investment. The timing is particularly perverse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="90512-0007.htm_para3"><a name="09051235000002">Apart from the wrong timing, we would be hitting the very area where we are already weakest, and the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban), who led for the Opposition, should realise that. We already have a relatively low depreciation charge, which arises directly from the fact that our manufacturing sector is weak compared to our main competitors in exports and world markets&#151;India and China, for example, are taking the lead on many consumer goods. Where we have to compete, we already have a low depreciation charge arising from our relative under-investment over the years, so driving it down still further would hit the very sector that most of our policies should be directed at improving.</p>

because of under-investment but mainly because of the world situation. The right hon. Gentleman has, surprisingly, made precisely my point for me. In the short term, those companies will not benefit from any reduction in corporation tax, so we should be trying to get them what they need by securing money for them from the various schemes that have been announced. Of course, I am the first to acknowledge, in front of the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, that we have been slow to get those schemes off the ground. The Conservative party offers no help, however, by suggesting that we have &#163;50 billion in our pockets and that it be should doled out to anybody who wants it. That is not serious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="90512-0007.htm_para4"><a name="09051235000005">I put it to the hon. Member for Fareham that what he proposes is wrong. I accept that getting the headline rate down is important, and the first thing we did in government, if the hon. Gentleman remembers, was to introduce a whole range of tax changes, including moving to a new system of corporation tax and other measures. Of course, we reduced the headline rate of corporation tax&#151;it was the first thing we did in our first Budget. I do not underestimate the importance of that, but it is important that we send the right signal and timing is so important. It is no good sending a signal at the wrong time. No one is coming here to invest at the moment. However well we are doing in other respects, the important thing is to get money to the worst-hit sector at the moment, which is manufacturing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="90512-0007.htm_para5"><a name="09051235000006">I highlight the manufacturing sector, because, despite the dire forecasts of the City of London&#151;the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) knows far more about that than I will ever know; indeed, he has probably forgotten far more than I will ever know, and probably to his own benefit&#151;comparatively speaking, the City has not been so badly hit. Not yet, at any rate, so the losses are occurring where they always occur&#151;in my own area, that of my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) and that of my right hon.

In fact, I know that their proposal to reduce capital gains is not remotely serious&#151;it is a talking-point, and quite a good one in a way. However, I believe, Sir Alan, that now is not the time and what is offered is directed at the wrong target. The amendment should not be pressed and we should not accept it.</p>

Under this and previous Governments, the Treasury has rightly adopted methods of preventing or stopping that practice. It is, however, an entirely legitimate business strategy for a multinational with factories, service areas and operational centres around the world to decide where, at any given time, it is best to allocate particular types of business. Obviously, if a multinational has footloose business of a high-technology, high-value-added, high-growth kind which will produce a high margin and plenty of profit, it will look very carefully at the effective and, especially, the headline tax rates around the world. All other things being equal, it may then decide to put more of its high-value, high-profit business into the parts of the world that offer the most competitive headline rates.</p>

They know that it happens and that it is a real possibility now, which is one of the additional reasons why I think my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham is right to press them again on whether they are certain that 28 per cent. is a sufficiently competitive rate at a time when the whole world is hungry for jobs and for higher-technology and high-value-added business, and when there is not enough business to go round and there are not enough jobs to go round.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="90512-0007.htm_para10"><a name="09051235000012">It is true that our debate takes place against the background of a sharp devaluation of the pound. Such a devaluation has many drawbacks. It makes us all poorer, and it pushes up inflation&#151;although it has one important advantage in that it makes our industrial and service activity much more competitive in the short term from a British base, which I trust will limit the damage in Britain compared with that in some of our competitor economies. However, we need to think beyond the one-off impact of the devaluation. We need to think beyond the present trough of the recession. We cannot be sure how long it will take, but there will be recovery, and we need to ask ourselves that fundamental question: is 28 per cent. a sufficiently competitive rate at the present time?</p>

That was very sensible, but I think that they got stuck. I do not think that they realised how rapidly the rest of the world had moved on. In the opening exchanges today, my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham was asked if he recognised that all that we needed was one of the more competitive rates in the G7, and that if we had it we would be all right. Of course we will not be all right. The world has been completely transformed. The Prime Minister accepted that in hosting and chairing the G20. The serious competitive threat to keeping manufacturing in Britain or attracting it to Britain today comes primarily from China and India. It is a serious option for most multinational companies to switch production from the United Kingdom or Germany to China or India. Most multinational companies already have several factories  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="90512-0007.htm_para12"><a name="09051235000014">The proposal that we are discussing goes to the heart of that issue. Why are we talking about the headline rate? Because it is the headline rate that people usually use in their simulations, models and forecasts when considering where to put their future investment. They also look at the underlying trend of policy. If, as in Canada, it is clearly a commitment to make the current rate the maximum and to say that in future it will be reduced, that will be a fairly influential factor when it comes to the judgment on the back of the numbers. If people see a Government who face a monumental deficit and who seem to think that it is only possible to secure more tax revenue by raising tax rates&#151;itself a very dubious argument, in my view&#151;they may well say to themselves that the Government could not be bothered to cut the rate below 28 per cent. although they knew that 28 per cent. was no longer particularly competitive, and that in a year&#146;s time they, or some other Government, might be forced to put the rate up. That is not a good background against which to make an investment judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="90512-0007.htm_para13"><a name="09051235000015">I urge Treasury Ministers to think again. I urge them to understand that our prime competitors have much lower tax rates than ours, as well as having lower remuneration and other competitive advantages. I urge them to understand that the big investment players in manufacturing in this world already have capacity around the world, and the ability to switch. I also urge them to understand that we are talking about not just where the new factory goes, but where the work is allocated around the different factories of the world, and that if we allow our country to be perceived as more hostile to business&#151;less competitive in tax and regulatory terms&#151;we will start to be on the wrong end of business judgments. The people in the American, Japanese or Chinese multinational will start to say, &#147;Well, we&#146;ll leave the old, low value-added, less profitable business in Britain because of the tax rate,&#148; and that means that Britain will lose jobs rather than create them, and that, in the end, the British plant will be the one most likely to face the closure notice because&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;it has the worst business and then it has the worst figures. The people in the multinationals will forget that the reason why that particular country has less good factory results is because, for tax reasons, they chose to locate a less profitable business in it. Therefore, if countries are not careful, they can find that they are on a very slippery slope indeed.</p>

I can assure Labour Members that, from conversations I have had on account of my work on the policy review and for other purposes, it is clear that the low headline rate of corporation tax has probably been the number one attraction to footloose international businesses in choosing to go to the Republic of Ireland. They did not go there for the European Union grants; most of those were paid to agriculture, which was not a particularly successful sector. They did not go there to join the euro either, because they have to deal in a multi-currency world and what matters to them is the rate into the dollar, the renminbi and the rupee, so the euro is not that important. What mattered to them was that they assumed that they would run profitable businesses&#151;and for quite a lot of years,  <br>

many of them did&#151;and it makes a huge difference to their forecast cash flows on an investment if they are keeping 90 per cent. of them rather than only 70 or 72 per cent. of them with the rest going to the Government. The Financial Secretary is a clever man, and he knows the power of compound arithmetic. The compound effects of taxing at 10 per cent. are so much more benign than the compound effects of taxing at 28 per cent.</p>

I am trying to make our lives easier, because I believe that this is one of those rare cases where we can have our cake and eat it. I believe that if a country is brave enough to set a lower tax rate, as the Irish were in spades, it can attract a huge extra amount of business, because world business is very footloose and very sensitive to the individual tax rates on offer. The Irish moved from being a lot poorer than the United Kingdom to being a lot richer. At the same time, they moved from spending less per head to being able to spend a lot more on public services because the low rates brought in so much more revenue. Such low rates can therefore have an extremely benign effect, but there is also the reverse effect: if a country allows itself to become too uncompetitive on the headline rate, it discovers that even putting it up does not solve its revenue problem, but can actually make the revenue problem worse.</p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) produced a partial list of those companies that have gone. There are others as well, and in certain sectors, such as insurance, it is becoming a rush to get to the exit on time. The situation could be the same for some of the higher charging investment management companies, one of which my hon. Friend mentioned. This is a serious problem for the United Kingdom. To those on the Labour Benches who say, &#147;Well, we don&#146;t want to keep those sorts of businesses if they&#146;re that sensitive to the tax rate and do not want to pay their fair due&#148;, I say that that is a very short-sighted view. Businesses are, on the whole, motivated by profit and money as well as by wishing to serve the public, but they know they have to serve the public well to generate the revenues&#151;that is the deal&#151;and if we are too cavalier in our approach to taxing them, we do not just lose the tax revenue they were paying in terms of corporation tax, but we lose the tax revenue they were paying in terms of the tax on their employees, the national insurance and the VAT on the money their employees would have spent in the shops. We lose a great deal of tax revenue if we become too cavalier about where businesses are to be located.</p>

That is my second-best option&#151;I would rather just cut the rate&#151;but it makes more sense than doing nothing, because it does take the trick on the headline rate and I do not believe it does the damage that the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson), who is no longer in his place, seemed to suggest. Past corporation tax reforms have cut allowances and cut rates, and they have been helpful and benign; they have usually resulted in more flows of business as long as they establish a competitive international rate that we can work with and of which we can be proud.</p>

Perhaps they are resting on the laurels of the devaluation and perhaps they do not understand how tough the situation is, particularly in the manufacturing heartlands.

A lower corporation tax rate would help to do that. I do not despise financial services. I would like us to grow and improve our financial services offering in Britain and keep London as a very important financial centre. That, too, is very dependent on a very competitive corporation tax regime. The Financial Secretary knows that I am not happy with the huge sums tipped into banks, which have grossly distorted the economy&#146;s adjustment process and have delayed the necessary adjustment in those banks. I wanted to keep them going at a much lower cost.</p>

If we had not wasted all that money in the banks, even the Financial Secretary could have afforded my 20p in the pound proposal for corporation tax, given his view that it does not generate the extra revenue that I believe it does. That option would have been a much better competitive package for Britain than losing billions in RBS and delaying the time when RBS sorts itself out and actually generates some money for British taxpayers and for the Treasury, instead of taking away all the money that we need in order to offer a more competitive package. I hope that the Treasury will also go away and think about squeezing some money out of the banks to make the rest of British business profitable, rather than squeezing the rest of British business to try to buttress the banks.</p>

In round terms, three 28ths of the projected revenues of &#163;34.7 billion is &#163;3.7 billion. If one were to cut our corporation tax rate to the OECD average, which the hon. Member for Fareham helpfully informed us is 22.5 per cent., that would be a five and a half 28ths cut in &#163;34.7 billion, which would be a &#163;6.8 billion cut. Now that is not before us tonight. I suspect, from what the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) said&#151;although he did not say so directly&#151;that he would not pursue the logic of his position and seek to put the UK at the average rate of the OECD, but only cut from 28 to 25 per cent. That was because he wanted a revenue-neutral package, and that the counter-balancing measures that he outlined to make up for that loss&#151;which I calculated at &#163;3.7 billion, although I appreciate that he does not accept that figure&#151;would come to &#163;3.7 billion. His countervailing measures did not come to &#163;6.8 billion and therefore he could not go the whole hog to cut corporation tax to 22. 5 per cent.</p>

Gentleman has to be careful about pushing the Canadian model too far. There are many jurisdictions in Canada, and those subject to federal taxation are federally incorporated and make up a tiny minority of companies, engaged in activities such as telecommunications and transport that, under the Canadian constitution from 1982 and the British North America Act 1867, are the federal preserve. Almost all business in Canada is the provincial preserve, and the huge trade barriers between provinces are an issue that bedevils that country. I understand that the hon. Gentleman aspires to that model, and it does raise some money at the federal level, but he should not push it too far.</p>

There is no natural way for people to behave that is somehow then distorted, because to say that is to buy in to the whole nonsense about perfect competition, which never exists, even on eBay. We have taxation measures to encourage certain forms of behaviour, and some of those behaviours are related to commercial matters, including for example, the lack of VAT on newspapers and books, and the company car taxation regime. So, corporation tax as part of a package of taxation measures will have an effect on behaviour and one must be very careful about that so as not to drive business out. I reject any suggestion that we have perfect competition and that we should not intervene at all.</p>

 The hon.

that the computer writing down allowance should have continued for a bit longer, until we had even more computers in the economy. That allowance was very helpful. I urge my hon. Friends to reject the amendment, because it is part of an overall package that would hit manufacturing and would be bad for British industry and bad for jobs in the west midlands.</p>

 The measure proposed by those on the Conservative Front Bench is actually rather simple and modest. One would think from the attempt to draw dividing lines, as is fashionable in politics at the moment, and from the length of the speech made by the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) that a huge point of principle was being proposed that distinguished the Conservative party from the Government. If the sentiments expressed by the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) had been the substance of the amendment, that would have been true. He made a serious ideological point that distinguished between what he thought was the best way forward for the British economy and the Government&#146;s proposed way forward for the British economy. The distinction made by the amendment is not nearly as substantial and as impressive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="90512-0008.htm_para3"><a name="09051235000037">The right hon. Member for Wokingham said that there was great value in cutting headline rates. I think there is some truth in that, although it is not always as straightforward as he might think, as shown by the Prime Minister&#146;s experience in his last Budget as Chancellor of the Exchequer. He cut the headline basic rate of income tax to 20p, thinking that that would be extremely popular and would incentivise a lot of people on low to middle incomes to do more work. It appeared not to have that effect when people realised that it was revenue-neutral and that some would be disadvantaged as they would have to pay additional taxes to make up the shortfall arising from the money that was lost by cutting the headline rate. Cutting headline rates is not always as popular as politicians and legislators might think.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="90512-0008.htm_para4"><a name="09051235000038">I was also interested in the point made by the right hon. Member for Wokingham about the Laffer curve, although he appeared to suggest that the Laffer curve&#146;s principal benefit is attracting investment from other countries into the jurisdiction where that applies. I would have been more interested if he had gone on to advance the view that it would generate more money from companies within the existing area of jurisdiction. He appeared to dwell less on that point, although I suspect that that is also his view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="90512-0008.htm_para5"><a name="09051235000039">By way of contrast, the amendment attempts to create an impression that, at this time of recession, the Conservative party would like to give British companies preferable tax treatment. However, having heard the explanation from the hon. Member for Fareham, one understands that that is not the case and that the proposal is revenue-neutral with regard to the total tax take. For that reason, his speech could have lasted two minutes rather 50&#151;he could simply have said, &#147;This amendment seeks to redistribute but not reduce the tax burden on British businesses.&#148; Given that our budget deficit will be &#163;175 billion this year and &#163;173 billion next year, and that we do not have huge amounts of surplus revenue sloshing around to use to reduce taxes, I and my party are minded to support the amendment precisely because of its modesty.</p>

 I will in a moment. We are considering not how much business is taxed, but whether the burden on different aspects of business should be redistributed in a way that renders the total tax take more reasonable. By and large, I think there is scope for collecting the same amount of tax revenue in a more simple way, and I shall set out my three principles for doing so. Before I do, however, I shall give way to the right hon. Gentleman.</p>

 That would have been funnier if the timing had been better. As it was, it was a typical Back-Bench attempt to be conservatively amusing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="90512-0008.htm_para7"><a name="09051235000045">The Conservative party believes it is here to argue the case for British business. That is reasonable, but it is trying to create the impression that it wants to cut the tax burden on British business. In reality, though, it does not want to do anything of the sort, and that is why I said that the amendment could have been dealt with rather more quickly. Had the Opposition proposed from the Front Bench the measures articulated by the right hon. Member for Wokingham, that would have been worth debating all of today and tomorrow because it would have represented a massive change in economic and tax policy. However, that is not what the Conservatives are trying to do: they are trying to give that impression, but they are not really trying to achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="90512-0008.htm_para8"><a name="09051235000046">Even so, for the reasons that I am about to outline, I think the amendment is probably a step in the right direction. The first principle that I think ought to govern these matters is stability. Stability is beneficial: the Government have kept the rate unchanged, and that is a reasonable step in the right direction. It would help if they gave an indication of how long the rate will be kept at that level. I realise that future Finance Bills and general elections make it harder for them to give a firm commitment, but it would be helpful if business could have a feel for where corporation tax rates are going.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="90512-0008.htm_para9"><a name="09051235000047">The second principle is simplicity, and it is in that regard that I think the amendment is most worthy of support. Removing lots of rates and reliefs and concentrating on a lower headline rate makes the system easier to understand for companies. It is harder for people to dodge tax, and complying with tax obligations is less of an administrative burden.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="90512-0008.htm_para10"><a name="09051235000048">The third principle is transparency.

We do, however, service a number of companies that are in the relevant tax bracket, and therein lies my interest, because supply chains are a vital component of the whole structure.</p>

Business men tend in the main to be more creative than accountants and they tend to dwell less on detail. It is that degree of creativity that makes the amendment interesting and it is the reason why I commend it so strongly. What the amendment proposes would create a feeling of the worth of being involved and of using money to gain more money and to grow on behalf of the nation, as well as on behalf of the people we employ. It reflects an attitude of mind&#151;one that is often not understood by Government Members.</p>

In fact, many business men are there to create, to build and to grow, and that very objective is the driving force that creates jobs in this country. Therein lies the importance of the amendment: it would encourage creativity, which in turn encourages jobs. That is a vital part of the process in which we need to be engaged right now if we are take advantage of the green shoots that will appear, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) and my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) have said. When those green shoots appear, we need to be in a position to exploit them to the advantage of our nation. High taxation in any form does not help us to do that.</p>

I am amazed by the arguments advanced by some Government Members, who seem to think that our real opponents are Germany and France&#151;that those countries should be our comparators and that, as long as we are lined up relatively sensibly with them, the world is okay. Let me tell Ministers that the world is changing dramatically and the G7 may not always be in pole position. In fact, I believe that the present elements of the G7 will not be in pole position for very much longer, because I perceive a massive, dynamic change in the world, which the present recession will only enhance.

because it is not a major oil-producing part of the world, but it is a hub for a massive region. People there said to me time and again, &#147;We used to look to the west; we now look to the east.&#148; Business man after business man in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates told me that. Of course, many of them were not nationals of those countries. They were European business men who decided to settle their businesses in that part of the world because of the potential that it provided. That is what we are competing against. It is against that background that this debate is so important. It is about ensuring the recharging of Britain&#146;s natural entrepreneurial spirit. That creativity is vital, and lower tax rates inspire that creativity. I beg the Government to recognise the connection in the amendment, even at this late stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="90512-0008.htm_para15"><a name="09051235000054">I was rather surprised at the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson), whom I admire enormously.

I was particularly surprised that, although he recognised that we created the lowest corporate rates of taxation in the G7, he did not seem to think that that was too important. That was a very confusing argument.

 Of course my right hon. Friend is correct. Many of the greatest business supporters of the current Government were the proponents of such exercises. The hon. Member for Coventry, North-West&#151;I repeat that I hold him in great esteem&#151;said that the argument was about timing. That was the essence of why he did not want to support a cut to 25 per cent. at this moment. I would argue that it is precisely because of the timing that we need to make the change. I was one of those people who saw, from &#146;79 onwards, a great rebirth of entrepreneurial spirit in this nation. I saw what that did for people like me, who wanted to go out and be their own boss, to build and create, and to drive forward the jobs that were so successfully created in the next years.</p>

Therein lies the import of the cut to 25 per cent. Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham, I want further cuts as time progresses, but timing is vital if we are to grab the green shoots that will surely appear. That is why it is important that we make the change now, and that we tell people we want to support business and entrepreneurism.

of an overall competitive framework for business, that is a prerequisite for solid economic growth. When we look back over the medium term, we can see that many countries which, when they reduced their business tax burden, in fact experienced a business tax increase year on year as the rates came down.</p>

It is the case, however, as we have discussed before, that concerns arose when business taxes were kept high. Even when allowances and reliefs for investment were extended, there were concerns that that regime failed to support the good businesses that were simply getting on and running their companies, and supported only the companies or firms that invested in particular areas. I shall return to that in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="90512-0008.htm_para18"><a name="09051235000060">The hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) suggested that the proposed tax cuts would fundamentally be paid for by reducing or removing allowances or reliefs, by simplifying the allowance or relief system. Although I agree with the need for a simpler tax allowance and relief system in general, I have a couple of questions about his amendment. What assessment has he made of the value of lost investments&#151;investments that might be cancelled or delayed as a result of the proposals&#151;if those allowances or reliefs have already been budgeted into the costs? Why has he proceeded at this point with the cut, rather than proposing a longer time scale for changes to the tax and allowance regime, which would allow the economy to benefit from the announcement effect, as we have seen elsewhere, whereby businesses come and set up in preparation for lower taxes, while mitigating the risk of investment projects being cancelled or postponed?</p>

However, I question the timing of the proposal. Why not say that it would take place in future, to benefit from the announcement effect, and why not tie that into a longer lead time for the abolition or simplification of allowances? Importantly, what assessment has the hon. Gentleman made of the risk of investment projects being cancelled? I want to support the proposal, but it would be useful to hear his thinking.</p>

 First, I should like to draw hon. Members&#146; attention to my interest in the Register of Members&#146; Interests as a director of a family building business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="90512-0008.htm_para20"><a name="09051235000065">We have had an interesting debate, and when we talk about first principles&#151;tax, tax rates and competition&#151;we often have such a debate. At the beginning of debate on the Finance Bill, we had almost a Cook&#146;s tour of Canada, Bahrain, Dubai, China and Dundee, East. That shows that we live in a competitive world environment that is not getting any easier year by year, but is becoming far more competitive. One of the examples that I used was Ireland, and a key message that has come across is that low taxes generate more revenue and jobs, attracting people to locate there. Ireland is one of our competitors and, notwithstanding its short-term difficulties, which are similar to ours as a result of asset price deflation and everything else, we must accept that this is a competitive world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="90512-0008.htm_para21"><a name="09051235000066">We should not look at the question on a year-by-year basis; we need to look at the medium term. Our economic problems do not relate to one year alone, but to half a dozen years. We have to keep business in the UK and attract it to the UK. Setting a rate, a direction of travel, of 25 per cent. will make things a little easier than if we set a rate of 28 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="90512-0009.htm_para0"><a name="09051235000067">One of the messages to come from our financial problems has been how big some of the banks and international companies are in relation to our economy. We know that people sitting in various capitals around the world look at the various competitive differences of language, productivity and tax; all those things feed in. Although we do not necessarily need the lowest tax, we do not want to tax too much more than our competitors. That is a black mark when people are considering where they are going to invest and to locate their businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="90512-0009.htm_para1"><a name="09051235000068">Paying for the measure by restricting the capital allowances reliefs is probably right. Most businesses that have to invest in equipment and machinery do so for reasons to do with the business and not because of the tax advantages. The hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) has already told us that there may be an impact on manufacturing. Of course: the pound has devalued against the euro and interest rates have massively reduced. All those things should&#151;fingers crossed&#151;help west midlands manufacturing. So what I have been discussing is a rather good way to go about things.</p>

Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) mentioned companies such as Google and insurance companies, some of which are moving for regulatory reasons as well as the reason of rate. Such companies are more mobile. Manufacturing can move, but it is a hassle to move a plant; it is easier for an insurance company, bank, investment fund or software company such as Google to move. It is perfectly possible for my hon. Friend to come up with a calculation for amendment 1 whereby the burden on UK business would be the same but the pot might be bigger, because we might retain businesses that would otherwise consider moving&#151;whether to Bermuda, southern Ireland or the Netherlands&#151;and we might well attract businesses in. We have tremendous advantages as a nation. We are creative and hard-working, and the English language is a tremendous asset. That also means that we have to be competitive because a lot  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="90512-0009.htm_para3"><a name="09051235000070">My hon. Friend made some compelling arguments. At the beginning of this debate he said that five years ago we had the fourth lowest headline rate in the EU and that today we had the 19th lowest. However, as we have heard, our competition comes not only from the EU&#151;let us face it; many EU countries are rich and successful and will get through the problems&#151;but from the whole world. Setting a lower rate is therefore important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="90512-0009.htm_para4"><a name="09051235000071">The hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) made some good points. A simple proposal that is more certain and not as avoidable is far better than having a higher rate and lots of reliefs and allowances. We see the direction of travel, but countries in the rest of the world are trying to get our business. They want to attract our companies, and they are doing so by setting more competitive rates. Unless we respond to that, we will not be defending the wealth, jobs and investment in the UK. We have to look beyond our current economic difficulties. Let us face it&#151;we know that the corporation tax take is going to take a hit and that, even when recovery comes, there will be a lag. However, we also know that international businesses plan on a three, five, seven or 10-year basis. We should therefore plan our economic renaissance on the basis of setting rates to encourage people to look towards the medium term.</p>

 There is over-capacity within the car industry, and there will be cutbacks there; and we have already seen bad news from Teesside as regards steel. Many international businesses will be looking to see where they want to expand in future. We face great competition, and the tax rate is one of the things that might encourage people at least to consider staying here at a difficult time. Many of our major manufacturing plants are hanging in there by their fingernails. We hope that we will get through the current problems. However, it is important to send a message in terms of public policy, setting rates and stating a direction of travel if we are to retain people and stop them moving abroad. I was surprised when my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham listed some of the companies that have moved. I was aware of some, but perhaps I am not as glued to the financial pages as somebody who does the Treasury job full time and is a chartered accountant.</p>

The stock market was doing rather well last week&#151;not that I had time to undertake any speculation&#151;and unemployment was under control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="90512-0009.htm_para6"><a name="09051239000002">There is one great difference between Canada and the UK: Canada has a Conservative Government. One of the Committees that I have served on over the past few months considered the Corporation Tax Bill. Nothing new was introduced into that Bill&#151;it was part of a tidying-up exercise; &#147;simplification&#148; was the euphemism used&#151;but the fact that it had some 1,300 clauses shows that we have some problems in our corporation tax system. It was evident that what was required was not just telling the press about closing loopholes but genuine simplification of a regime of allowances and reliefs that interact with each other, are extremely complex and set a very confusing picture for foreign investors who come to this country. It is a shame that the opportunity was not taken to make more of simplifying the corporation tax system as part of the way out of the current crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="90512-0009.htm_para7"><a name="09051239000003">There is huge scope for simplifying the system even further. For several years, I was an inspector of taxes&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I hear cries of &#147;Shame!&#148; from my hon. Friends. I remember that when I first started, all the income and corporation tax Acts could be put into a reasonably small box that could be put into one&#146;s briefcase and taken home. That is no longer so, which is a great shame. Even then, one had to deal with huge areas of enormous complexity, such as transfer pricing.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Hood. I shall try to do that. That complexity, though, is very much part of the balance that needs to be struck in deciding what reduction in corporation tax is required and how it can be adjusted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="90512-0009.htm_para8"><a name="09051239000006">A lot of hon. Members have spoken about competitiveness in reducing the rate, and I endorse the many comments that have been made about the role of a lower rate of corporation tax in encouraging foreign investment into this country. For a number of years, it was very much the UK that set the agenda in encouraging newly developing countries in how they should approach their financial systems and set their own rates. I remember being involved in discussions how the countries of central and eastern Europe, as they emerged, could get the right balance between the rate of corporation tax and the need to bring in foreign investment through other means. That was always a difficult discussion, because countries always want to encourage companies to come in initially through means other than reducing corporation tax. It takes quite a lot of maturity for a country to get to the point of reducing it, as the amendment proposes.</p>

They do not look at it on its own, and the comments about not considering it in isolation are correct. However, companies consider the direction in which it is going and are prepared to take a punt on that, and to examine other circumstances, such as the simplicity of the tax system. An incredibly complex system will offset some of the advantages of reducing the tax rate. It is therefore right to proceed with simplification.</p>

companies&#151;compared with 28 per cent. in the UK. However, as we have heard, the Canadian Government have announced an aspiration to reduce that rate and, in due course, for Canada to have the lowest rate in the G7. Clearly, there cannot be two countries&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> It is possible, I suppose, to have two, if both countries set the same rate. It is worth pointing out, however, that that aspiration was set before the problems in the world economy that we have seen over the past 18 months. There have been big changes in the world economy and Canada may wish to reconsider how best to address the fiscal consequences of the past 18 months. However, our intention&#151;which was set some time ago and which Canada said a little while ago that it wanted to emulate or even better&#151;remains, but of course we will need to see what happens.</p>

The UK tax system certainly has significant advantages, including a generous and well-developed system of research and development tax credits, relatively low administrative burdens for business, a large tax treaty network and no withholding tax on dividends paid. We are introducing a package of measures in the Finance Bill to reform the taxation of foreign profits, which the hon.

 I refer the right hon. Gentleman to the authoritative KPMG survey of more than 500 multinational companies that reached that conclusion. The World Bank&#146;s &#147;Doing Business 2009&#148; study ranks the UK sixth in the world. The evidence is clear: we are in a strongly competitive position, and it is important that we should retain that.</p>

 If everything is so wonderful, why have so many companies left for tax reasons and why have there been such strong representations in recent months about how hostile the climate now is on tax?</p>

 The climate is certainly not hostile on tax. Of course it is true that, from time to time, some companies choose to locate elsewhere. It is also true, however, that over a long period we have consistently attracted more foreign direct investment into the UK than any other country in the world, with the exception of the US, and in one year&#151;I forget exactly when; it was three or four years ago&#151;we got more in than the US as well. We have an absolutely stunning record on attracting foreign direct investment, which is a reflection of the strongly competitive character of the UK business environment.</p>

 I am pleased to hear the views of international businesses about the user-friendliness of HMRC. The prompt payment code, which the Government have signed up to, requires the payment of invoices by  <br>

the public sector and the Government within 10 days where there is the equivalent of an invoice, such as an acknowledged refund of corporation tax that is due. Is it the case that those payments, which are vital to the continuity of the businesses concerned, sometimes take weeks and weeks, because of peaks of work in the relevant tax offices, which is partly because of cuts in the headcount of staff? That is not good, is it?</p>

<p><a name="st_o216"><a name="09051239000036"><a name="90512-0009.htm_spnew22"><a name="09051239000587"><b>Mr. Timms:</b>
 No, it certainly is not, although I do not agree that our announcements about changing the way in which Revenue and Customs is organised, for instance, would lead to that kind of difficultly. If my hon. Friend is aware of a particular problem, I would be happy to hear about it from him and will gladly investigate. However, he is certainly right that such repayments should be made promptly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="90512-0009.htm_para20"><a name="09051239000037">In opening the debate, the hon. Member for Fareham seemed to say at one point that the change could be funded by simplifying taxation. Indeed, it would be a wonderful idea if one could simplify everything and thereby fund the reduction of corporation tax from 28 to 25 per cent. However, as we explored what he is proposing further, the position became clearer. Cutting the rate of capital allowances further could produce an effective rate of tax depreciation significantly below the average depreciation rate used by businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="90512-0009.htm_para21"><a name="09051239000038">Businesses with good commercial reason to invest would then find the tax system discouraging them from doing so, which would be a very undesirable state of affairs, discouraging investment by sectors such as manufacturing, transport, communications, retail and utilities, and certainly damaging our international competitiveness by reducing investment in those sectors. My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) was absolutely right to underline that point with his experience of working in manufacturing. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) made that point as well. The hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) did not think that that mattered, because of other benefits that the manufacturing sector was experiencing. It is certainly true that, for example, the change in the exchange rate over recent months has been helpful for manufacturing. However, he would be very ill advised indeed to rob manufacturing in particular of the significant benefits of the current arrangements for allowances. We simplified capital allowances in the Finance Act 2008 to pay for the reduction in the headline rate. Going further could create serious problems. Indeed, the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) was right to query the timing of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="90512-0009.htm_para22"><a name="09051239000039">I hope that the House will reject the amendment. Nevertheless, I underline the Government&#146;s commitment to maintaining the attractive tax environment for business that we have in the UK, not least through having the lowest headline main rate of corporation tax in the G7.</p>

 We have had a wide-ranging and thorough debate on the amendment about reducing the headline rate of corporation tax. It was interesting that the Minister acknowledged the fact that, in the Finance Act 2008, the Government were able to fund a reduction in the headline rate of corporation tax by simplifying the allowances. We discussed the reforms to the industrial buildings allowance and the agricultural buildings  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="12 May 2009">

allowances in Committee. There is therefore a track record of using the proceeds of simplifying capital allowances&#151;that is, reducing the rates&#151;to fund reductions in the headline rate of corporation tax. Our view is that that go further, in order to reduce the rate to 25 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="90512-0010.htm_para0"><a name="09051239000041">My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) was acting in his customary role as a critical friend, supportive of where we had moved so far, but perhaps keen for us to move further in the direction of reducing the headline rate of corporation tax. My other hon. Friends cited their business experience in talking about competitiveness and about what businesses bear in mind when locating activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="90512-0010.htm_para1"><a name="09051239000042">Mention has been made of the way in which Governments focus on tax as a means of competing, and I think that more reference was made to Canada in today&#146;s debate than perhaps at any time since it was a dominion and part of the empire. It was good that my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (John Howell), a former tax inspector, joined the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) as an aficionado of Canada and a spokesman on its behalf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="90512-0010.htm_para2"><a name="09051239000043">We discussed the fact that Canada has a federal rate and provincial rates of tax. I note that the OECD figures suggest that it has a combined rate of 33.5 per cent. If Canada were to achieve its aspiration of reducing the federal rate by 7 per cent., that would bring its combined rate down to 26.5 per cent., which is below the present UK tax rate. If the Minister is keen to match the Canadian rates, some progress clearly needs to be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="90512-0010.htm_para3"><a name="09051239000044">We discussed the impact of the proposal on capital investment and the possible reaction of businesses to it. Part of the problem that we need to address is the fact that the structure of capital allowances has been so unpredictable in this country. That has made it difficult for businesses to factor into their plans an understanding of what the capital allowance rate might be. For example, businesses planning on the basis of a 25 per cent. writing-down allowance might be surprised to find that there will be a 40 per cent. first-year allowance for this year only. The extent to which that provision will create an incentive for businesses to invest this year is unclear. Many businesses with a longer planning horizon might not be able to respond to such a short-term incentive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="90512-0010.htm_para4"><a name="09051239000045">It is important to have predictability so that businesses can make their plans. That is one reason why we are so keen to flag up our intention to reduce the headline rate of corporation tax, and to fund that reduction through a reduction in the rate of capital allowances. The broader economy would gain huge benefits from moving to a lower headline rate. Such a move would send a clear signal to inward investment that this is the place to come for lower corporation tax rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="90512-0010.htm_para5"><a name="09051239000046">Such a move would also tackle the issue of businesses moving out of the United Kingdom. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) was impressed by my lengthy list of businesses leaving the UK. Part of the problem is that, when the first few businesses moved, it was newsworthy and people paid attention, but subsequently, a stream of businesses leaving have left. It has become more commonplace and less  <br>

noteworthy, and people now accept that it is happening. But the fact that it is less newsworthy does not mean that it is less important for us to take action.</p>

He said that the UK was the best place for tax compliance and the best place for VAT, but let us not forget our other first. We also have the longest tax code in the world. We beat India by a country mile in that regard. International comparisons do not always work in our favour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="90512-0010.htm_para7"><a name="09051239000048">It is important for Britain to have a competitive tax rate. It is important for inward investment, and for strengthening the economy to make Britain a place where people want to do business. This proposal is only one part of a series of reforms of the corporation tax system that would lead to a better system for business in this country, but it is important that we send a signal that this is something that we are committed to.

 Having engaged in a helpful and thorough debate on amendment 1, relating to the main rate of corporation tax, we must now deal with the small companies&#146; rate. Amendment 2, tabled by me and by two of my hon. Friends, seeks to reduce the headline rate from 21 per cent. to 20 per cent., while amendment 3 seeks to change the fraction from 7/400 to 1/50. I shall say more about amendment 3 a little later. Many of the points made during our debate on amendment 1 about the unpredictability, complexity and uncertainty of the corporation tax system apply to small companies as well, but in the case of small companies there is a more pressing issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="90512-0010.htm_para13"><a name="09051256000009">There is a little bit of history attached to amendment 2. There has been a long-running debate in Government about the taxation of small companies, and about what tax rate has been appropriate. When I first served on a Finance Bill Committee as a Back Bencher in 2002, the then Chancellor&#151;now Prime Minister&#151;had proposed a zero per cent. corporation tax rate on profits of less than &#163;10,000. What the Government said at the time suggested that they saw the proposed rate as a spur to enterprise which would reinvigorate British business, but that rested on a key assumption which was misplaced then and which, in a sense, has led to some of our present problems: the assumption that only companies were entrepreneurial. That assumption ignored the contribution that can be made by partnerships and other unincorporated businesses to the dynamism of the British economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="90512-0010.htm_para14"><a name="09051256000010">The flaw in the Government&#146;s proposal was that it did not merely overlook the fact that other types of business organisation could be equally dynamic, but triggered a behavioural change. A raft of unincorporated businesses became limited companies, because a gap had opened up between the rates of tax that would be paid by, say, a  <br>

 I recall the decision and its implementation, and I recall the massive wave of incorporation that took place. It was not one of the best decisions that we have made in government. Does the hon. Gentleman agree with me&#151;and, indeed with most management consultants&#151;that, in the context of the framework for business, the decision whether to incorporate should never, or at best very rarely, be made for fiscal reasons?</p>

<p><a name="st_o223"><a name="09051256000012"><a name="90512-0010.htm_spnew4"><a name="09051256000068"><b>Mr. Hoban:</b>
 That is an important question. It returns us to what was said earlier about distortions in the tax system, and about attempts to persuade people to make decisions that reflect commercial realities rather than being driven by tax considerations. A difficult position arose. Very small businesses&#151;one-man bands&#151;became incorporated in order to take advantage of the fiscal position, which I believed was a flawed decision. I argued at the time that it would lead to a wave of incorporations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="90512-0010.htm_para15"><a name="09051256000013">The problem is that small companies are not measured in terms of numbers: in terms of whether they have one employee or two, three, four or five. They are measured in terms of the amount of profit that they make. On the one hand, there is the wish to create a level playing field for the plumber, the carpenter, the engineer and the IT software support worker, while on the other hand there is a range of businesses which are also incorporated and which are much bigger. In the latter case, the decision to incorporate was probably made on grounds of logic or to admit liabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="90512-0010.htm_para16"><a name="09051256000014">What is happening now, however, is that larger companies which nevertheless fall within the profit threshold for small companies are paying the price of the Government&#146;s early mistakes. Following the introduction of the zero per cent. rate in 2002, the Government saw what was happening and responded by introducing such measures as a higher tax charge on distributions. Gradually, a point was reached at which, rather than piling complexity on complexity, the Government decided to increase the small companies rate of corporation tax in an attempt to narrow the gap between the rate paid by people working by themselves as small companies and the rate that they would pay if they were employees or self-employed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="90512-0010.htm_para17"><a name="09051256000015">In 2007, the Government finally decided that enough was enough. They scrapped the system, and introduced a 19 per cent. rate. They then set out to increase corporation tax for small companies by 1 per cent. per annum until it reached a top rate of 22 per cent. This was meant to be the year in which it would reach that rate, but, in the light of the current economic circumstances, the Government decided to put the increase on hold. Let me ask the Minister a question that I asked on Second Reading last week. Can the Government give any indication of whether they intend next year to raise the rate to 22 per cent., and to continue on that upward path?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90512-0011.htm_para0"><a name="09051256000016">It was not just the change in rate that the Government considered as a means of tackling the issue of incorporation. They introduced a raft of rules on managed service companies in the 2007 Finance Act, and conducted a long consultation on the shifting of income between husband and wife, which, as far as I can see, has been kicked into the long grass. However, I think that we  <br>

need to learn the lessons of the original rate change policy. I think that it was misconceived. It triggered certain types of behaviour that the Government have sought to crack down on, and introduced a new complexity into the tax system. It is a sign of the uncertainty and unpredictability in the tax regime for small businesses.</p>

 I accept that the hon.

That complexity does not help either tax gathering or small businesses. Businesses are burdened by an unbearable cost in time and effort because of the opacity of the system, but a more streamlined version would help both them and the taxman.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point: we must have a less complex system. The Chancellor of the Exchequer made a commitment to simplify it when he was appointed to the post. I do not know whether the hon.

Therefore, although everyone aspires to achieve simplification, it is clearly hard to deliver. I know that complexity is an issue for the people who run small businesses; that was raised with me on Friday, when I was talking to small businesses locally.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments too, but I hope that that is the end of them, as his party colleague, the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="90512-0011.htm_para1"><a name="09051256000021">I have talked about the need to look at the direction of travel of the small companies rate, and about whether holding the figure this year at 21 per cent. is a permanent feature or it is the Government&#146;s intention to move to 22 per cent. next year. Many small businesses are finding the current economic crisis very difficult. In October of last year, John Wright, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, wrote an open letter to the Prime Minister under the heading,</p>

Not only is that a Conservative policy, but Mr. Wright clearly hoped that the Government would introduce it in the Budget. This is what Mr. Wright said after the Budget:</p>

<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>12 May 2009 : Column 728</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="90512-0011.htm_para3"><a name="09051256000023">In an FSB survey, when its members were asked if this was a Budget for small businesses, 68 per cent. said no. When asked if it would have a positive effect on their business, only 7 per cent. of respondents said yes. A survey conducted by the Forum of Private Business came to a similar conclusion: 97 per cent. of respondents said nothing had been done to ease the burden of costs that they face, and 94 per cent. felt that the Budget did not address the issues threatening the survival of their businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="90512-0011.htm_para4"><a name="09051256000024">It was not only business organisations that were critical of the Budget and its impact on small businesses. Theo Paphitis, one of the stars of the &#147;Dragons&#146; Den&#148; television programme, said:</p>
<a name="90512-0011.htm_brev2"><a name="09051256000061"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Chancellor forgot that small businesses exist. He also forgot that one in five households in the UK derives its income from small businesses. He also forgot that nearly half of all employees in the private sector are employed by small businesses. In fact, the Chancellor forgot a lot of things.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="90512-0011.htm_para5"><a name="09051256000025">One way in which we can help small businesses is by reducing the headline rate of corporation tax for small companies from 21 per cent. to 20 per cent. As with the measure proposed in amendment 1, this is a funded tax cut. I know that the modesty of it will upset the hon. Member for Taunton, but it is the prudent thing to do at present. Again, we will fund the reduction in the small companies rate through simplifying the capital allowances system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="90512-0011.htm_para6"><a name="09051256000026">Earlier on, we engaged in debate about the competitiveness situation for small businesses and how the UK tax regime compares with those of other countries. According to the OECD, our small companies tax rate is significantly higher than that of the US and France, whose rates are 15 per cent. Earlier in the debate, the Government were very keen to highlight that the UK mainstream corporation tax rate was one of the lowest in the G7. Clearly, however, as the US and France&#151;and, indeed, Canada&#151;have lower rates of corporation tax for small companies, we are out of kilter with other countries. My hon. Friend the Member for Henley (John Howell) will be interested in the Canada comparison, and I am sorry that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) is not present to hear about it, although I am sure he will pick it up later. We need to ensure that both the main rate of corporation tax and that for small companies are competitive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="90512-0011.htm_para7"><a name="09051256000027">The measure proposed in amendment 3 is very straightforward&#151;or at least I thought it was when I tabled an amendment last year reducing the fraction concerned to one fortieth, only for the Financial Secretary&#146;s predecessor to point out that that fraction was based on the corporation tax mainstream rate being 30 per cent. I have therefore gone back to my calculator, and it is my belief that the fraction should be one fiftieth, under which there would be a very smooth transition for businesses whose profits exceed &#163;300,000, which is the upper threshold for small companies until they reach the full rate for large companies of &#163;1.5 million. I hope the maths of that work. If the House were to agree to amendment 2, then amendment 3 flows logically from that. In our amendments, we both reduce the rate concerned from 21 per cent. to 20 per cent. for small companies and we have got the right fraction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="90512-0011.htm_para8"><a name="09051256000028">May I pre-empt the hon. Member for Taunton in his comments on his amendment 6? I was intrigued by it, and I wish to flag up my understanding of it. The  <br>

<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>12 May 2009 : Column 729</b><br>
intention appears to be to give further tax relief to small companies based on the rateable value of their premises. Does that not create a risk of giving highly profitable businesses relief simply because they might work from small offices? I am not sure whether that is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intention, but I am sure he will explain the situation at greater length.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="90512-0011.htm_para9"><a name="09051256000029">The thrust of taxation for small companies has been disjointed over the past few years. The Government saw it as a spur to enterprise when they introduced the zero per cent. rate back in the 2002 Budget. They then decided that that led to all sorts of inappropriate behaviour and, sadly, by increasing the rate of tax from 19 to 22 per cent., have started to penalise businesses that fall under the definition of small companies but that are not an alternative to being self-employed or employed. I see the emerging danger that we are penalising those small companies that have not sought to incorporate to take advantage of the tax rules, but that incorporated for the right commercial and legal reasons. They are being penalised because of a flaw in the Government&#146;s thinking back in 2002. I do not believe it is appropriate for that to continue. That is why I propose this cut in the small companies rate from 21 per cent. to 20 per cent. That, again, will be funded through a reduction and simplification in capital allowances. I hope that the House will support amendment 2.</p>

<p><a name="st_o228"><a name="09051256000030"><a name="90512-0011.htm_spnew4"><a name="09051256000073"><b>Mr. Jeremy Browne:</b>
 I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this part of our deliberations. I say at the outset that I was not criticising the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) when I said his proposals were modest: I was praising him, and it is precisely because of their modesty that I feel able to support them. If they had been unfunded&#151;the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) suggested that we consider such a situation&#151;that may have given us greater difficulty, given the overall state of the public finances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="90512-0011.htm_para10"><a name="09051256000031">That leads me neatly to this proposal, which, after all, is largely an extension of our discussion on the previous clause. However, as it is slightly different, I shall speak at slighter greater length to it. According to the Federation of Small Businesses, there are 4.7 million small businesses in the UK, a remarkable 97 per cent. of firms employ fewer than 20 people, and 95 per cent.&#151;19 out of 20 companies in the United Kingdom; I am not talking about 19 out of 20 employees&#151;employ fewer than five people, so the overwhelming majority of businesses and enterprises in this country are extremely small employers. More than 500,000 people start up their own businesses every year, small firms employ 58 per cent. of the private sector work force, 13.5 million people work in small firms, small firms contribute more than 50 per cent. of UK turnover, and 64 per cent. of commercial innovations come from small firms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="90512-0011.htm_para11"><a name="09051256000032">I rehearse those statistics because it is clear&#151;this point is made so often that it is a truism&#151;that small enterprises are extremely important to wealth creation and employment opportunities. Thus, it is important that we regard them as being a distinct entity for corporation tax purposes. That point is widely accepted, which is why the Government have a different rate for them. For the same reasons that I cited in our previous discussion, we think that stability is important. If the Government  <br>

are not going to cut rates, it is good that they at least indicate that there will be stability and that the rates will be frozen, and seek to convey to businesses the understanding that the situation will endure, even though it is not necessarily in the gift of the Government to guarantee that, as clearly it is not for a longer time scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="90512-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09051256000033">That statement of intent is helpful because it allows businesses to plan. However, it remains our view, as it was when we discussed the previous clause, that simplicity has a virtue and that our trying to reduce headline rates helps companies&#151;as my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) said, it helps in terms of their administrative burden&#151;and creates the right message for those looking to start businesses or invest in this country. For those reasons, and because I have the assurance of the hon. Member for Fareham that the Conservative proposal is costed and responsible, as I like proposals to be, it is reasonable to support it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="90512-0011.htm_para13"><a name="09051256000034">Amendment 6, which stands in my name and that of my colleagues, was an attempt to provide additional assistance. In an effort to be open-minded and generous-spirited, may I say that I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that there are potential difficulties with the system I am proposing? It is difficult to frame amendments that cover every eventuality, because the nature of the process is that amendments have to be reasonably brief. We seek to give further assistance to particularly small businesses, which may benefit from that help, given that, as I was saying, 95 per cent. of businesses in the United Kingdom have five or fewer employees.</p>

 I am a big admirer of the FSB and I use its website and services from time to time. Has it said whether there is any correlation between rateable value and profit? Why would it be sensible to use as a proxy for a definition of small businesses something related to rateable value? Far better measures could be used, particularly for organisations and small businesses that are devolved in an electronic sense through good numbers of people working from home. How would that be handled?</p>

I think there is broad agreement on the overall point that small businesses contribute substantially to the UK economy, and it is very much in our interests that that be recognised in the tax structure.</p>

 There would be an additional saving to such businesses, and it would depend on the rateable value of the premises. An assessment would have to be made of that rate, and the saving would accrue at that point. Even if you propose to let me press my amendment to a Division, Mr. Hood, I do not intend to do so; I was seeking to make the point that there is merit in the Conservatives&#146; proposal. I did not think it necessary to table an identical amendment, because I am more than happy to give my party&#146;s support to their suggestion. I was seeking to explore ways in which we could help particularly small companies that may benefit from additional assistance.

 I am not sure how my hon. Friend defines seniority, but could the hon. Gentleman make his point a little clearer?

 It is. We should recognise that the seniority to which I referred was with regard to pecking order, rather than anything else. I welcome the general thrust of the hon.

 Of all the things the Government have done in recent months, one of the worst is to increase corporate taxes for the small business sector. The timing of this proposal has been disastrous, and the Government&#151;and many of their supporters&#151;recognise the problems. The increase has had a depressing effect on small businesses. It has prevented entrepreneurs from starting businesses, and it has certainly stopped small businesses growing. We need to change that situation, and amendment 2 would help to do that. That is why I am so keen that it should be accepted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="90512-0011.htm_para15"><a name="09051256000049">My main point concerns the importance of retained profit to small businesses. Retained profit is the very essence of their growth and survival. Small businesses tend not to have loans or be involved in over-complicated financial support&#151;they simply have an overdraft. Therefore, the amount of money left at the end of the year is a vital consideration for their future growth, and to their protection against bad debt. That is particularly relevant at this time. For small businesses, cash is king and the more that the Government take in corporation tax, the less small businesses have to survive. The objective of most small businesses is simply to be here next year, and the Government could help enormously by accepting the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="90512-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09051256000050">The amendment would also help businesses looking to grasp the opportunities that will be provided by the green shoots when they come. I hope that the Chancellor&#146;s projections are right. I want to see the green shoots sooner, rather than later, and a cut in corporation tax would better prepare small businesses to exploit those opportunities. I do not need to tell the Government about the growth opportunities in small business, as they have been well proved. The creativity of small businesses is very valuable for this country, and we need to have them in situ to support the supply chains for our bigger plc companies. However, they will not be in situ if they do not survive, and we will lose that infrastructure. The amendment would be a small measure to encourage small businesses, because it would give them more cash at the end of the year, which would help their survival and their growth when the recession ends.</p>

 Clause 8 is important and amendment 2 would be very helpful. We have already heard how important small businesses are&#151;probably more for the employment they provide and the taxes thus generated, rather than for their profits and corporation tax purposes. Many companies in the small business sector are under-capitalised. It is therefore important that when they make money, it be retained within the business. Many of the capitalist entrepreneurs who run such companies pay the tax and leave the money in the company instead of taking a dividend, so that the company can grow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="90512-0012.htm_para0"><a name="09051256000056">If we are to get through these economic problems, we will need people who are determined, who are good managers and who have a vision for running a business. Many small businesses do not make a profit, but giving a signal to the small business sector by reducing, rather than increasing, the rate is potentially very important. Many people are in business out of sheer awkwardness&#151;they have run the business for years and are determined to keep faith with their employees. Those people are looking for better times ahead. Many of them have risked their homes, put off holidays and even ruined marriages over their businesses, so it is important that we give them a signal that they will be able to retain more of what they do make in profit.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, because he has only just started to speak. I am also grateful for his kind words.

The benefit of this sector is measurable in terms of not only current small businesses but many companies, employing thousands of people, that had to get off the ground initially.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. We all need to bear in mind and to stress the support provided by the interrelationship between small and medium-sized companies and larger companies. Many of the points that I made during our debate on amendment 1 are just as relevant to amendment 2. Other hon. Members have mentioned the effect on small businesses of uncertainty within the tax system and the need to get rid of that, as well as of the system&#146;s inherent complexity. Indeed, I would argue that those two elements are especially important considerations for the small business sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="90512-0012.htm_para4"><a name="09051263000007">Getting rid of uncertainty is vital and there is no benefit to anyone in maintaining a complex tax system for small businesses driven by entrepreneurs. It is totally unnecessary to make things complicated or more expensive. Entrepreneurs can be a funny bunch. They are very focused on their idea. I am sure that there are some very good examples of such people on the Conservative Benches and that they will take these comments in good spirit. That focus is the whole reason why their business ideas come up and why they are successful. However, as well as doing all the things that a business needs, they also have to undertake a range of other activities, from being the head cook and bottle washer to being the bookkeeper. I know that&#151;I have been there and have experienced the pressures of going out and getting business while ensuring that the cash flow is working and that there is back-up. The Budget presented a handful of measures for the small business sector, but it did not address the important issue of cash flow. The amendment seeks to address that problem.</p>

However, many are vulnerable because they have already had to make cuts in order to save costs. In some cases they have laid people off, and in others they have found different means to make savings. Also, as a result of the recession, many of the service sectors are already witnessing a decline in the number of people seeking their business. When businesses have made all those efforts and cuts in order to stay afloat, it does not go down well at all when they see the money that they have saved going on higher taxes. That is nonsense for them. They do not understand it and it does not encourage entrepreneurs into the system, particularly to begin start-ups.</p>

Very often, they can make an agreement on the spot in that call. More than 100,000 companies have benefited from the scheme, and between them they have deferred about &#163;2.3 billion in tax.

I accept the value of the benefits that the Minister has outlined&#151;it would be churlish not to&#151;but my point is that the customers of the business to which I referred say that, even though they get a lot of grant, they simply do not have the money that they need to put in themselves. They get a 40 per cent. grant, but they cannot afford the remainder, however they might want to pay it.</p>

 We are undoubtedly in a very serious world economic downturn, and the measures that the Government have taken are helping to support the economy through it. I was speaking to an accountant yesterday, and he told me that his colleagues who work in liquidation are less busy this year than they were last year. He thought that that was because of the success of the business payment support service and the large number of companies that have gained a significant  <br>

cash-flow benefit from it. The service has been very valuable for business survival, and its scope was widened further in the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="90512-0012.htm_para14"><a name="09051263000024">The hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) spoke about the fairness of the UK&#146;s corporation tax arrangements for small companies. At &#163;300,000, the UK threshold for the small company rate is the highest in the G7. It is perfectly true that rates in some other countries are lower, though not many are. For example, the small companies rate in the US is 15 per cent., but that applies to only about &#163;30,000 of profit, compared with &#163;300,000 in the UK. The fact that the threshold in Britain is the highest in any of the G7 countries means that companies making a profit of, say, &#163;250,000, or up to the threshold pay the lowest marginal rate on that profit in the G7. Finally, as we discussed earlier, we performed very well in an international analysis of competitiveness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="90512-0012.htm_para15"><a name="09051263000025">The amendments proposed by the hon. Member for Fareham would raise a serious problem of fairness. He acknowledged, I think, the problems that arose when the small companies rate was reduced significantly, as the result was a large incidence of businesses being incorporated, which was motivated purely by tax. The problem with his amendment 2 is that it would return us to precisely that problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="90512-0012.htm_para16"><a name="09051263000026">It would not be fair to encourage people to incorporate purely to gain an advantage in terms of tax and national insurance payments. We have set out a range of measures to make the tax system fairer across all small businesses, and to reduce the competitive disadvantage faced by unincorporated businesses. The amendment would make that disadvantage greater.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="90512-0012.htm_para17"><a name="09051263000027">The number of incorporations per year increased from 230,000 to 320,000 with the introduction of the zero per cent. starting rate. They reached a record high of 450,000 in 2006-07, but they have declined since, following the increase in the small company rate. The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Fareham would reignite the problem, which would be unfair and a mistake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90512-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09051263000028">The amendments also pose a substantial fiscal risk&#151;by the way, I accept that the hon. Member for Fareham has got his arithmetic correct this year&#151;because, as the hon. Gentleman indicated, a permanent reduction in the rate would cost something like &#163;500 million per year. He suggested that more changes to capital allowances would pay for that, but he did not give us any information about what they would be. I simply point him to the concerns that I expressed when we debated similar changes to the previous clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="90512-0012.htm_para19"><a name="09051263000029">I agree with the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) about the crucial importance of very small companies to the UK economy, although he accepted that his amendment 6 might not be the best way to identify them. I was not quite clear about what relief he had in mind, but he made some important points.</p>

changes proposed by the Treasury for the years to come will be that the owners of such businesses will have even less incentive and available collateral to grow them? Businesses like that are very often run by a single individual using his own pocket and energies, so being taxed at a much higher level post &#163;150,000 of earnings will cause them to suffer most. Does he agree that, as a result, the growth of small businesses that is so crucial to the economy will be undermined?</p>

<p><a name="st_o258"><a name="09051263000031"><a name="90512-0012.htm_spnew15"><a name="09051263000589"><b>Mr. Timms:</b>
 No, I do not agree with that. The entrepreneurs whom I know and admire earn a long way short of &#163;150,000 a year. Moreover, the owners of businesses occupying premises with quite low rateable values will not, on the whole, have earnings of over &#163;150,000 a year. For those reasons, I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="90512-0012.htm_para20"><a name="09051263000032">I hope that I have demonstrated to the House&#146;s satisfaction that the amendments would not help the majority of small businesses. They do not recognise the importance of fairness, which is a very important consideration in tax matters. In addition, the debate did not properly reflect the impact of the substantial measures that the Government have put in place to support small businesses. I hope that the House will decline to agree the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="st_o259"><a name="09051263000033"><a name="90512-0012.htm_spnew16"><a name="09051263000590"><b>Mr. Hoban:</b>
 This has been a useful debate, especially in having drawn on the experience of my hon. Friends the Members for Poole (Mr. Syms), for Henley (John Howell) and for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley), who have all been involved in small businesses. My experience before entering Parliament was largely confined to large businesses; in my professional practice, I had little contact with small businesses, but I have got to know the sector well in my role as a constituency Member of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="90512-0012.htm_para21"><a name="09051263000034">I have a great deal of respect for small business men, because they really do put themselves on the line in growing their businesses and taking day-to-day responsibility, not only for their own future, but for that of their staff. My conversations with them over the past few months have brought home to me how tough they are finding it to survive in the present economic climate. They are worried about their cash flow, for example. The Financial Secretary talked the tax payment deferral scheme, which I welcome, but before the Government announced their scheme, the Conservatives proposed a six-month deferral of payment of VAT, recognising the importance of cash flows. The hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) talked about smaller businesses. We also proposed measures on national insurance that particularly affected micro-businesses employing four or fewer members of staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="90512-0012.htm_para22"><a name="09051263000035">There is a judgment call to be made on the small companies&#146; tax rate. The Minister is right to point out that not all small companies are small businesses. He says that there are 4.7 million small businesses in this country, three quarters of which are unincorporated, leaving about 1.2 million small companies, of which 400,000 pay no corporation tax. We are therefore talking about 800,000 businesses across the country that fall into the small companies&#146; rate of taxation. This debate is important to them.</p>

small companies that incorporated for legitimate economic and legal reasons. That is where the division is between the Conservative party and the Government. The Government see incorporation of small companies as a way of managing down tax bills and not paying what is fair. In my view, and that of my hon. Friends who have had experience of running small companies, the increase in the small companies&#146; rate is not a matter of fairness. We believe that the increase is having an impact on their ability to retain profits which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South said, is important to their ability to build up reserves for the future and to fund investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="90512-0013.htm_para1"><a name="09051263000037">In our judgment, the small companies&#146; rate of taxation should fall, to incentivise genuine small companies and encourage their growth and future development. The rate should not be increased, as the Government would use it, as a means of cracking down on tax avoidance. That is the dividing line between the Conservative party, which wants to support entrepreneurs, and the Government, who have seen fit to crack down on them by increasing the small companies&#146; rate of corporation tax. The Government&#146;s argument on tax-motivated incorporation is, I think, an excuse for a revenue-raising measure, increasing the tax take from small businesses. They have sought to compensate for the increase through the annual investment allowance, but that is available to all businesses, not just small companies, so on average small companies will be worse off as a consequence of the changes that the Government have announced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="90512-0013.htm_para2"><a name="09051263000038">Because we want to support entrepreneurs and because we recognise that people have set up limited companies for genuine purposes, and not only for the purpose that the Minister says, we want the small companies&#146; rate of corporation tax to be reduced. We have set out clearly how we would fund the reduction through reforming the system of capital allowances&#151;our proposals are costed. I shall press the amendment to a Division, because it is important to send a clear signal to this country&#146;s small companies that we have their interests at heart&#151;we do not regard them as tax dodgers or tax avoiders and we want them to flourish and continue to grow. That is my party&#146;s policy; it is not the Government&#146;s policy. I therefore ask my hon. Friends to vote for amendment 2.</p>

Members will be familiar with many of the arguments, but before I make some slightly more general comments, I shall just explain the amendments that I tabled. Amendment 7, which has not been selected, but which appears on the amendment paper&#151;I hope I am not out of order, Mrs. Heal, if I briefly mention it, because it illustrates the direction in which I am seeking to move Government policy&#151;seeks to bring forward the day on which the VAT reduction from 17.5 to 15 per cent. ceased to apply to the date on which the Bill receives Royal Assent, which we believe is the earliest conceivable date on which that temporary reduction could be ended.

My party&#146;s view is that there is merit in fiscal stimulus&#151;trying to inject an extra boost into the economy will help us to get through the recession quicker, and the best way we can address our public finance deficit is to get the economy growing again. After that, we will have to ask questions about additional tax revenue, and about savings in the public sector. The immediate task, however, is to get through the recession and out the other end, growing strongly again. Some sort of fiscal stimulus, in my party&#146;s view, is the right way forward, if it is affordable.</p>

 Without wanting to make a point about it, I agree about the need for fiscal stimulus.

Everyone who responded on the VAT cut was extremely critical of it. Does the hon.

The answer, in our view, was yes, although it would be limited in scope because of the state of the public finances. The question that then arose was what form that fiscal stimulus should take. The Government&#146;s view, as I understand it, was that a VAT cut would be a good way to go, partly because it could be introduced speedily&#151;no doubt the Minister will put the Government&#146;s case; I do not with to misrepresent it, but I will explain my view. They thought a VAT cut would incentivise people to spend money, which would provide the sort of stimulus they believed would be advantageous in the short term. They also believed it would be beneficial for individual consumers. I remember their making the case when it was introduced that it would save money for typical households, and we were given examples of those savings. However, when some retailers did not pass on the VAT reduction, the Government then made the case that it helped the margins of those retailers. I accept that there was a degree of truth in the Government&#146;s position, even though to some extent they were having their cake and eating it: when the VAT cut was passed on, it would help consumers, and when it was not, it would help retailers and businesses.</p>

Members, including Government Members. There are numerous reasons for that but, first, the Government unfortunately cut VAT in the run-up to Christmas, when retailers were heavily discounting their products. Many companies were introducing cuts of 20, 25, 30 or 35 per cent. and, in that context, the 2.5 per cent. reduction was rather modest. It may have led to a small extra saving for consumers, but it was unlikely to provoke them to make a purchase that they would not otherwise have made. The cuts introduced by the retailers themselves were substantially greater than the VAT cut.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="90512-0013.htm_para11"><a name="09051263000534">There was the serious issue, too, of the administrative burdens placed on businesses as a result of the VAT cut. A number of businesses sought to reprice their goods, and if they were priced in a catalogue that had already been printed or if a similar approach had been taken, that presented even greater problems for those businesses. I went into a shop in my constituency where the company introduced the discount, but did not mark it on the price that appeared on the product, as that would have resulted in extra burdens. I remember buying a birthday card for someone for &#163;2, and I paid with two &#163;1 coins. I was given 4p change because the shop had kept the marked price as &#163;2, but I was given a discount, to reflect the temporary VAT reduction, which I had not anticipated. Up to a point, I appreciated it, but I did not necessarily feel incentivised to buy another card once I knew that another 4p was there for the taking. I suppose I had 4p more to spend on other goods and services, but I am not sure that the effect on the economy as a whole, even if everyone received that benefit, was as great as the Government hoped.</p>

 I very much agree with my hon. Friend&#146;s point, but is there not another marketing consideration? Something that had cost &#163;11.99 should cost about &#163;11.73 after the VAT cut but, as we all know, the price points are heavily determined by marketing considerations&#151;the prices tend to end with &#147;99&#148; and so on. Does my hon. Friend agree that the benefit of the VAT cut will almost inevitably gravitate back to the companies and businesses as they revert to the standard pricing points? No one can pretend that &#163;11.73 is a natural pricing point or that it has any marketing advantage.</p>

 I take my hon. Friend&#146;s point. Many retailers round their prices to a sensible point and then discount a penny to make them look more attractive. A lot of the margins might be greater than the VAT reduction, so the reduction might not have been felt in the way envisaged by the Government. With small items&#151;I just gave the example of a birthday card&#151;the saving to the consumer is small. With big items such as a new car, the saving would be greater. However, it is worth mentioning that car retailers were so desperate to turn over more of their products that the discounts by and large were bigger than the VAT reduction that was meant to incentivise consumers.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has talked about costs to small businesses, but there are also the costs to local authorities, which charge for a range of services such as car parking spaces. Some such charges have VAT implications. That created costs for local government, which had to reduce lots of charges to be able to comply quickly with what the Government wanted.</p>

 That is an entirely fair point. Parking charges are a good example, which leads on from the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik). By and large, parking charges are rounded to a sensible hourly rate. A reduction of 2 per cent. would mean that instead of paying &#163;1.50 an hour, a person would pay&#151;somebody else should do the maths&#151;&#163;1.47 or whatever. People might prefer to pay &#163;1.50 rather than &#163;1.47 or have difficulty in paying the precise amount. Many local authorities would think it easier to stick at &#163;1.50, so in such cases the benefit was not passed on to the consumer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="90512-0014.htm_para0"><a name="09051263000539">No doubt opposition parties of all colours in the authority would then criticise the administrating party for not passing on the VAT cut to consumers, even though it would have been administratively burdensome for the authority to do so. The money would be absorbed by the local authority, so I suppose that the Government would argue that the local authority would have more money to spend on other services. However, I am not sure that the money flowed through the system as neatly as the Government would have wished.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman and I both have constituencies in the south-west, where the biggest industry is tourism. He mentioned small and medium-sized businesses.

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. To follow on from that made by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames), I should say that my experience&#151;other Members&#146; experiences may be different&#151;is that there are two reactions to the reduction. One is hostility, which the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) described; the other is indifference. I have not met anyone who feels zealous enthusiasm for the Government&#146;s policy. Some regard it as making no difference whatever to their business or the assumptions that they make; others regard it as burdensome and troublesome and, if they went to great lengths to accommodate the reduction, are not looking forward to having to put the rate back up again.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an entirely legitimate point, which I have heard him make in other debates. The Minister needs to engage with it. New year&#146;s eve may well be the worst possible date of the year to pick&#151;365 options, and the Government pick the worst one of the lot. Clearly, there are cost implications in pushing the date backwards&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> I accept that the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="90512-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09051263000546">The broader point is that businesses as a whole&#151;and, in some cases, even individuals&#151;have either found the change burdensome or have not noticed it at all. I doubt whether many people have changed their behaviour as a result of the measure. I take the point made repeatedly by the Government&#151;people might have a little more money to spend and not consciously realise that they are changing their behaviour. They may buy one thing at the end of the week that they might not otherwise have bought because the accrual of all the 4ps saved when buying cards and other bits and pieces might make them think, &#147;I might buy one more birthday card because I am suddenly feeling a bit more affluent.&#148; My suspicion, however, is that even at a subconscious level, very few people have acted as the Government would have wished.</p>

 Given my hon.

 It would probably be better to hear the Minister&#146;s view of that claim; it does not accord with my experiences&#151;or, apparently, those of other Members taking part in our deliberations.</p>

My central point about the public finances&#151;the Government&#146;s finances&#151;is the cost of the measure and whether the opportunity cost represents a good decision by the Government. In all our deliberations on the Finance Bill, we have to return to the big elephant in the room: this year, we are running a public sector deficit of &#163;175 billion. That is &#163;480 million every single day, and &#163;20 million every hour; since we started our deliberations this afternoon, close to &#163;100 million has been added to the public debt.

First, it should try to ensure as quickly as possible that the economy starts to grow again; that, after all, is the whole purpose of a fiscal stimulus.

almost exactly &#163;1 billion a month. Amendment 7 is not within the prescribed boundaries of our deliberations, but I was keen for it to take effect because that would have saved the taxpayer about &#163;4 billion or &#163;5 billion, depending on the precise date of Royal Assent. The clock is ticking. If we are to try to come up with a more effective way to spend the fiscal stimulus, then every day that passes we have roughly &#163;30 million less to play with than we would have done had we made that decision a day earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="90512-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09051263000554">What strikes me as extraordinary is that a civil servant asked to come up with a &#163;12 billion or &#163;13 billion tax cut could not have come up with one that had less impact on the public consciousness. If the Government were seeking, albeit with borrowed money, to give away that amount of extra money to the taxpayer, they could have taken roughly 3p off the basic rate of tax for a year. They might not have thought that that was the right way to go, or they might have felt that it did not stimulate the economy in the way that they had intended, but every time people got their payslip at the end of the week or month, they would have noticed the sizeable reduction.</p>

Part of the reason for the Government&#146;s changes was to try to give people a sense that things were not so bad, that there was a bit more money to spend, that they could go out there and spend it, and that that would be a self-fulfilling prophecy in its impact on the economy. I do not think that that has proved to be the case, although others may disagree. If there were a cut in the basic rate of income tax, people might choose to save the money. The Government would say that cutting VAT means that people get the benefits only if they spend money&#151;they were keen to encourage people to spend, and continue to be so. However, psychologically, it did not have the impact that it could have had as regards people feeling that they had more money to spend, even if they did in practice because the 4p&#146;s were accruing here, there and everywhere as they made different purchases.</p>

 I am not aware of what consultation took place among retailers. I hope that the Minister is more aware of that than me, but from what I have seen there was little or no consultation. The Government felt a need to act swiftly, and perhaps they were right in that analysis. They grasped at the temporary VAT cut from 17.5 to 15 per cent. as being the best way to go&#151;there seemed to be very little evidence for it, and amendment 8 would be a good way of starting to examine whether they made the right decision&#151;and introduced it swiftly as part of an attempt by the Prime Minister, principally, to show that he had a grip on the economic situation. He wanted to show that the situation was bad, but that he was taking the decisive action necessary to get us through the recession as speedily as possible. I do not get the sense that alternatives were considered in as much detail as they could have been, nor that the adverse impacts of the Government&#146;s policy were considered in sufficient detail. No doubt the Minister will enlighten us about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="90512-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09051263000558">I am not sure that the behavioural impact was fully assessed. Some people may behave in a way that the Government had not intended. I suspect that if the date on which the VAT reduction ceased had been brought nearer to today, some people who were motivated to spend differently because of the VAT reduction&#151;for example, to buy a big-ticket item such as a car&#151;would have tried to make such purchases just before the rate went back up to 17.5 per cent. again. Interestingly, the effect of the stimulus might have been brought forward if the reduction had been for a shorter period. Had it not stretched for the full 13-month period, the monthly cost of the reduction might have been a bit higher, but the overall cost might have been lower. That is a theory, but it is the sort of area that such a report could usefully examine.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman says that the assessment should be done before 1 April 2010. Does he agree that it could be done very quickly, and that if it included an assessment that showed that direct capital expenditure would protect or preserve tens of thousands more jobs in the remaining period than the VAT cut, that might be something that those of us who believe in fiscal stimulus could yet coalesce around in the teeth of recession and in light of tomorrow&#146;s unemployment figures?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I accept that the date in the amendment is arbitrary; I was trying to take account of the typical time scale of such reviews. There is a degree of urgency&#151;very much so&#151;in terms of the economy and the he mentioned unemployment. Of course, the review would be retrospective were it to take place on the date that the amendment envisages, but there would still be some benefit, because we do not know whether the Government may in time seek to use such a device again. It would inform future decisions instead of dealing with the here and now. I take his point that the here and now is an important priority, and we will no doubt focus on that in discussing the clause as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="90512-0014.htm_para8"><a name="09051263000561">The hon. Gentleman takes me neatly on to what the money could alternatively be spent on, which is an entirely relevant consideration. There are, essentially, two schools of thought: that which says that there is no scope for a fiscal stimulus and that which says that there is. My party is of the second school, and while I do not wish to caricature anybody&#146;s arguments, I understand that we are in the same school as the Labour party and the Scottish National party. By and large, Conservative Front Benchers&#151;although we heard a dissenting view a few moments ago&#151;do not believe that there is scope for a fiscal stimulus beyond the automatic stabilisers that one would get at a time when the economy was shrinking. Having said, &#147;The Government&#146;s policy is to have a fiscal stimulus, and after all they are the Government: they are in power and enacting this policy&#148;, we can move beyond that and ask how the money would better be spent. The sum involved is generally estimated to be in the region of &#163;12 billion or &#163;13 billion, although the more popular the Government&#146;s policy is, the more effective it is, and the greater the cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="90512-0014.htm_para9"><a name="09051263000562">We should ask whether this is the best way to spend &#163;12 billion or &#163;13 billion, and whether it is doing two things. First, is it increasing demand and getting us through the recession more quickly than if the stimulus had not been put in place and the extra borrowing had not accrued? Secondly, will we have something to show for that large amount of public spending once it is finished? My party drew up a list, a package, when we were envisaging better ways to spend the entire &#163;12 billion or &#163;13 billion. As I said, with every day that passes that money ebbs away, but nevertheless I shall run briefly through some of the matters that we were talking about.</p>

 Thank you, Mrs. Heal, for that very helpful guidance. The point that I was trying to make&#151;I certainly do not wish to make it at excessive length&#151;was that amendment 8 asks the Government to consider the impact of the VAT reduction on</p>
<a name="90512-0014.htm_brev0"><a name="09051263000572"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;UK economic growth...the competitiveness of small and medium-sized businesses, and...the disposable income of low-income households&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="90512-0014.htm_para10"><a name="09051263000565">My contention is that the benefits in those three areas and more widely would have been greater had the Government gone down the path of spending the money on a range of programmes. I shall not list those programmes, but they would have been designed to encourage our country towards greater environmental sustainability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="90512-0014.htm_para11"><a name="09051263000566">We argued, and continue to argue even though the amount of money that we are arguing about gets smaller every day, that the money could have been spent on, for example, home insulation programmes, buying new rolling stock for trains or electrifying some train lines. That would have provided an opportunity for greater employment. It would have been a stimulus, but once we reached the end of the package, as the Government now envisage doing with the VAT reduction at the end of this calendar year, we would have had a lot of insulated houses, electrified train lines and new rolling stock.</p>

I fear that the review envisaged in amendment 8 would still not get us to the bottom of precisely what those benefits are. That is not &#163;13 billion of public money spent wisely, especially as that money was not available. Borrowing was increased, by this year&#146;s figures, from &#163;162 billion to &#163;175 billion, but we do not have longer-term assets such as I have described to show for it. The Government talk about investment when they really mean spending, but under our plans there genuinely would have been investment as well as spending. They would have stimulated the economy in the short term while providing a longer-term legacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="90512-0014.htm_para13"><a name="09051263000568">For all those reasons, amendment 8 requests a comprehensive review, and the debate gives us an opportunity to consider when the temporary VAT reduction should cease.

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="90512-0014.htm_para17"><a name="09051268000008">It is worth my being precise about where there is a difference between the Government and the Opposition, because there is a tendency to point to dividing lines and caricature our positions, and the differences between us can be exaggerated.

We recognise that tax revenues will reduce in the course of a recession and that expenditure will increase on certain things, particularly benefits. We have not argued that our fiscal policy should be such that we do not allow the automatic stabilisers to apply.

We clearly agree about that because, despite all the rhetoric in the run-up to the Budget in April from the Prime Minister on his world tour, when he made the case for a bold fiscal stimulus for every country, the UK did not pursue such a policy in the 2009 Budget because the assessment was that we did not have the money.

 Again, a little patience from the Financial Secretary would be appreciated. I know that he is keen to move me on from whether a fiscal stimulus was affordable, but I think that the subject should be tackled thoroughly. Given what we know now, who was right about the pre-Budget report 2008? Could we afford that discretionary fiscal stimulus? Hon. Members should remember that, at the time of the pre-Budget report, the Government projected that they would borrow &#163;77.6 billion in 2008-09, and the projected figure for 2009-10 was &#163;118 billion. By the time we reached the Budget&#151;which contains the most up-to-date figures that we have from the Government; some consider them optimistic&#151;the figures for 2008-09 were &#163;90 billion and those for 2009-10 were &#163;175 billion.

 That is an interesting idea.

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="90512-0015.htm_para10"><a name="09051268000040">A number of countries engaged in a fiscal stimulus, because they were in a stronger position and could afford to do so, but they did not go down the route of the VAT cut. There are also some practical points to be made about VAT, some of which were raised in the quotations that I have cited. First, at a time of sharp discounting of goods&#151;that was certainly the circumstance last November and last December&#151;the 2.5 per cent. reduction in VAT could have been lost. That point was made by a number of commentators. In particular, when Justin King, the chief executive officer of Sainsbury&#146;s, appeared on &#147;Question Time&#148; on 27 November, he said:</p>
<a name="90512-0015.htm_brev8"><a name="09051268000059"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If we walk down the high street today you&#146;ll see 20 per cent. off, 30 per cent. off, 50 per cent. off, so really in that context it&#146;s a drop in the ocean.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="90512-0015.htm_para11"><a name="09051268000041">That is one of the problems with the VAT cut.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="90512-0015.htm_para12"><a name="09051268000042">The second problem is one of practical difficulties. There were practical difficulties with the sudden decrease in VAT at a time when shops were certainly hoping to be busy. There had to be re-pricing with very little notice and we know that that caused difficulties. In some cases the VAT cut was not necessarily passed on. In other cases, people were sitting in shops with calculators deducting the necessary amount, which also created difficulties. There were real costs involved in changing the system so quickly. Retailers were not exactly overjoyed at being faced with what was, after all, a tax cut. There are other technical difficulties involved. For example, those businesses operating under the flat-rate arrangements will not have felt the benefits of the change. There were significant practical difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="90512-0015.htm_para13"><a name="09051268000043">At the big picture level, what was the test that the Government set themselves by reducing VAT? At the end of November, their argument was, &#147;Thanks to the measures that we are introducing in the pre-Budget report, the recession is going to end earlier than it would otherwise do. It is now going to end in the second half of 2009.&#148; Sadly, that is not going to be the case, although there are clearly some encouraging signs, and we hope that they will continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="90512-0015.htm_para14"><a name="09051268000044">The Government now accept that recovery will not happen until the end of the year. The test that they set themselves was to use the VAT measure to bring the recovery forward. They have had to downgrade their growth forecast for 2009 from the contraction of 1 per cent. of GDP predicted in the pre-Budget report to a contraction of 3.5 per cent. as set out in the Budget. Even that figure is optimistic compared with the projections of the likes of the International Monetary Fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="90512-0015.htm_para15"><a name="09051268000045">I am sure that the Minister will refer to the Centre for Economics and Business Research and to Doug McWilliams&#146; comments; he does so every time I debate this matter with him. Doug McWilliams has supported the VAT cut; indeed, he recommended that policy proposal in November. Having recommended it, he has subsequently looked at it again and concluded that he was right all along. His assessment states that retail sales over the December to February period were &#163;2.1 billion higher than they would otherwise have been. We do not necessarily accept that, however. We need to disentangle the impact of the VAT cut from the effect of the very substantial cuts in interest rates over the same period, alongside the policy of discounting that shops were adopting, as we heard from Justin King. Even then, the Government&#146;s  <br>

figures show that, in the period from December to February, the policy was costing the taxpayer something in the region of &#163;3 billion.</p>

 I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman has now looked at the CEBR report. I wonder whether he has read the sentence in it that states:</p>
<a name="90512-0015.htm_brev9"><a name="09051268000060"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The data also shows that the acceleration in retail sales volume was not achieved through fire sales and fierce discounting on the high street.&#148;</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="st_o309"><a name="09051268000048"><a name="90512-0015.htm_spnew18"><a name="09051268000088"><b>Mr. Gauke:</b>
 I have seen that comment, but I come back to the point that it is very difficult to disentangle all the various factors involved. The fall in interest rates at that time will have had a substantial effect on sales, as we have seen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="90512-0015.htm_para17"><a name="09051268000049">Having read the CEBR report, does the Minister agree with its view, which differs from that of the Government, on the actual cost of the VAT policy? The report cites a figure of &#163;11 billion, rather than &#163;12.5 billion. I would be grateful if the Minister updated the House on the Treasury&#146;s assessment of that cost, and told us by how much he thinks sales will increase. To what extent is the Government&#146;s view consistent with that of the CEBR?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="90512-0015.htm_para18"><a name="09051268000050">That brings me to the heart of amendment 8, which deals with the need to look again at this matter and for the Treasury to prepare a report and to evaluate the various consequences of the policy. There is a need to assess the policy in greater detail. There is clearly a debate to be had, and the Government will always argue that the policy has been successful. Most of us would argue that the fall in interest rates had a greater impact on retail sales, and the growth in the economy is certainly disappointing compared with what the Government were hoping for when they announced their policy. I am not, however, convinced as to whether the Treasury is the right body to review this, which I say in the context of last month&#146;s Budget, whose numbers have been heavily criticised. I will not go through all the detail, but the growth forecasts for 2009 and, more particularly for 2011 and 2012, seem to be out of line with those of most independent forecasters. The Government&#146;s reputation for making projections of the public finances has been very poor, and we have seen those projections substantially revised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="90512-0015.htm_para19"><a name="09051275000002">The point I am making is that there is a need for a body independent of the Treasury to make an assessment of projections for growth and for the public finances. We propose an &#147;Office of Budget Responsibility&#148;, and there may well be a case for referring this sort of review to a body that is at arm&#146;s length from the Treasury in order to assess whether the right approach is being put forward. I raise this particular caveat over the Liberal Democrat amendment, but there is much to be said for looking again at a policy that has not, I fear, by any means provided the best use of &#163;12.5 billion of taxpayers&#146; money.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Lady, but I am not sure whether it is a question of filling the gap, as it more a matter of reducing it. There we go, but she brings me on to the next point I wanted to make, so I am grateful for her intervention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="90512-0015.htm_para20"><a name="09051275000009">What clause 9 principally does&#151;I realise that I am venturing into a stand part debate, Mrs. Heal, but I am assuming that we are addressing the amendment at the same time&#151;is to delay the implementation of the return to VAT at 17.5 per cent. from 1 December to 1 January. The reason for doing so is that the Government introduced their VAT change through a statutory instrument, which provided the authority to make that change only for 12 months. The Government now wish to add on an extra month, but to be fair to them, it was always their intention to do so. For the various reasons I have set out, however, we think it would be beneficial not to move the date on from 1 December to 1 January, but to stick with 1 December.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="90512-0015.htm_para21"><a name="09051275000010">There are a number of reasons for doing that, so let me first address the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) about the difficulty of changing the VAT rate in the new year. It will be difficult for institutions in operation at the time when the VAT rate is changed, but perhaps even more significant is the fact that this will be in the middle of the post-Christmas sales. I should say the January sales, but it seems odd to have 1 January being in the middle and I am sure that you, Mrs. Heal, follow my point that there is a lot of activity going on in stores at the time of these sales. The representations we have received certainly suggest that retailers do not want the change to come in at this date. Whether it is the worst time of year, as the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) suggests, I am not sure, but it is certainly one of the worst dates and we believe there is an argument for changing it.</p>

 Is there not a case for pushing the date back rather than bringing it forward&#151;perhaps to 1 June, which might have electoral as well as commercial benefits?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right that a case can be made for moving it back, but that would have an effect on the Exchequer and, to be fair, I have been making the case that we do not have the spare money. As I have said, we oppose that because we do not think there is room in the budget, and we are therefore not persuaded of the case for moving it back to June or February or any other time.</p>

preference is for a middle view. The report suggested in the amendment would be useful, because it would enable us to judge what the Government did in the light of the alternatives.</p>

Alternatively, we give local authorities money that they can use to provide grants for environmental improvements to homes&#151;which we know will be a major challenge&#151;so that small business can become involved. Clearly, things have changed very rapidly. The Government made a decision in the pre-Budget report, and to some extent they are stuck with it. Therefore, it would be useful to have a report, particularly as 1 April 2010 is likely to be at the start of a general election campaign. We would have a document that we could discuss with great interest.</p>

I am also unsure whether it will have much effect on the competitiveness of small and medium-sized businesses. We have heard in the debate that there are costs. There are certainly costs to local authorities and to many businesses in this manoeuvre. On the disposable income of low-income households, as such households have a higher propensity to spend what income they have, there may be some modest positive impact on them, but I suspect there are other means and policy instruments that could have been used to put money into people&#146;s pockets.</p>

However, as we have moved on and the overall financial situation has deteriorated, one would also have to assess other things, such as the &#163;12 billion or &#163;13 billion cut in VAT revenue. That will leave a long-term debt legacy in terms of interest and compound interest, and there is also the opportunity cost of what else could have been achieved in the medium term while leaving a legacy of some sort, such as insulated homes or improvements in the overall economy.</p>

VAT. Business has consistently seen the VAT cut as having no positive impact on their sales. The Federation of Small Businesses conducted a survey of 5,000 of its members, and 97 per cent. said it had had no impact at all in terms of boosting trade. There has been a big cost impact, however. I see that in my own constituency, where a number of small retailers are very unhappy. They are part of the fragile and vulnerable small business situation that we described earlier today. As a result, there are large numbers of empty properties in many towns&#151;although there are perhaps some signs of shops being attracted back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="90512-0016.htm_para12"><a name="09051275000029">There is a cost involved in decreasing VAT and then increasing it again in terms not only of cash, but time. For those who run small businesses&#151;especially those who have to adjust to these changes in VAT&#151;that is perhaps the most precious commodity of all. The question of where to put in the effort and to use the expertise is crucial, but it is very difficult to cost. That is particularly difficult for a small business that sells tens of thousands of products, and perhaps has only one or two people running it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="90512-0016.htm_para13"><a name="09051275000030">The impact assessment for the Finance Bill listed a number of actions that business would have to take to implement the temporary VAT cut, including familiarisation; re-pricing; carrying out the extra bookkeeping checks involved; dealing with potential extra accountancy costs; and, of course, making systems changes and upgrades. It estimated that the total compliance costs for business would be about &#163;300 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="90512-0016.htm_para14"><a name="09051275000031">I was particularly worried by the paragraphs that followed, in which it was acknowledged that in deciding how to respond to those changes, businesses were likely to have to take lot of other costs into account. Such costs would arise from consulting advisers or, potentially, from renegotiating the terms of any contracts that are inclusive of VAT. Although the assessment recognised that those costs were likely, they were somehow dismissed as being commercial decisions&#151;as if the other changes it had costed were not commercial decisions. Even the impact assessment recognises that costs that have not been properly analysed are involved, and that they are not part of the costings in the assessment. Thus, it is very difficult to make a judgment on this matter, and that has not been a particularly helpful part of the Government&#146;s assessment of that part of the activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="90512-0016.htm_para15"><a name="09051275000032">On the costs on the ground, as I have mentioned, the FSB survey has shown that there is no sign of the VAT cut working, but it is worth examining whether it is working at the bigger picture level and whether the model behind it was applicable. Without an understanding of that, the assessment required by the amendment would be difficult to achieve. One of the worrying features about the underlying model was that it was a simple supply and demand model of consumption, which would perhaps have been suitable to use in an economy that was doing well, but in one that contained a large marginal element, it ignored the complexities involved. The policy and the modelling that must have taken place in order to introduce this adjustment&#151;the VAT cut and then the raise forward&#151;assuming that any modelling was undertaken, was flawed from the beginning.</p>

The view has been based on the volume of retail sales, and there are problems with that approach. The Government cannot have it both ways. If they are going to put a lot of emphasis and reliance on that report, logically they must accept the criticism it makes of raising VAT again in January 2010. It states that that</p>

It is one of those questions that are illogical in terms of their resolution, because we can make no direct comparison with the counter-argument as to what would have happened without the cut. The need for that was recognised in the evidence given by the Governor of the Bank of England to the Treasury Committee, in which he acknowledged that the real problem was that</p>

A simple increase in sales is not enough. Traditionally, we have looked at whether sales of VAT-able goods have increased more than sales of non-VAT-able. The key proxies are generally non-food sales with VAT versus food sales without VAT. The difference should be surprisingly large if we are to claim any proof that the VAT cut has worked. Because those measures are proxies and the model is simple, it is not possible to distinguish on the basis of volumes, or even values, other factors that have already been mentioned, such as discounts, or to take account of postponed purchases or lower interest rates that may also affect the outcome. So there is no proof there that the VAT cut has worked.</p>

 I am not as expert as the hon. Gentleman, but his argument about the proxies&#151;spending on VAT-able and non-VAT-able goods&#151;is flawed. If there is additional money in families&#146; pockets because they have saved money on VAT-able goods, sales of non-VAT-able goods could rise because they have more money to spend on food and other products. I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument makes sense.</p>

items. That assumption contains fallacies, and I am not sure that the distinction is very clear. But that is part of the difficulty of using proxies in situations where we do not have a proper counter-factual&#151;what would have happened if what is being examined had not occurred. One can make a best guess and even do some modelling, but there is nothing to actually compare, which is why proxies are used. I agree that it is a difficult issue, but that is why claims that the VAT cut has worked are unsubstantiated and probably far from the mark.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="90512-0016.htm_para23"><a name="09051275000042">I have already mentioned the comments from the report that the Financial Secretary is always keen to quote on such occasions about the impact of the date of the change. I wonder whether Ministers actually go shopping any more. Do they realise that Christmas and new year sales occur? That is not a hint for a present from the Financial Secretary, as I am sure that that would need to be declared somewhere. The arguments on the timing have already been made, and I have made my points about the difficulties of assessing the impact of the VAT cut.</p>

 I am delighted to be able to make a few points on clause 9. I shall focus on three main areas&#151;many of these points have been much discussed in today&#146;s debate&#151;the first of which is the amount of the reduction, which is 2.5 per cent., and the importance of that figure; the second is the issue of the date when the rate reduction ceases; and the third is the cost of the 2.5 per cent. reduction in VAT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="90512-0016.htm_para24"><a name="09051275000044">The Financial Secretary to the Treasury makes an interesting point when he says that such a change can be an effective instrument in stimulating demand, but I am curious about how he came up with the 2.5 per cent. figure. What sensitivity analysis did he carry out about the effects of a 2.5 per cent. decrease as opposed to a 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. decrease in trying to drive demand and the volume of trade? The cut is an attempt to kick-start an economy, but in the two or three debates that I have attended on the issue I have heard that the instincts of retailers and consumers were that it would not suddenly drive people to go out and purchase more. When the 2.5 per cent. cut came into effect, did the Financial Secretary rush out and start buying more retail goods? Now that the VAT rate is down to 15 per cent., what has he gone out and bought that he would not have bought at the 17.5 per cent. VAT rate? Perhaps he can tell me how his shopping patterns changed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="90512-0016.htm_para25"><a name="09051275000045">It was also interesting to hear the discussions and observations about some of our continental competitors. It was interesting that the French attacked the reduction as a not particularly effective way of stimulating demand. We heard similar criticisms from the Germans and the Dutch, and even from the IMF&#151;I think that it was the IMF chief economist who had no confidence whatsoever in the 2.5 per cent. VAT cut. As I said earlier to my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke), was it some sort of jealousy on the part of our European competitors? Were they suddenly nervous that huge volumes of trade would shift across continental Europe and across the channel, and that the Germans, French and Dutch would suddenly begin moving their trade from Germany, France and Holland into the UK to buy our goods merely because of this 2.5 per cent. cut in VAT? Somehow, I think not. I think that they  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="90512-0016.htm_para26"><a name="09051275000046">The proof of the pudding can be found in the evidence of experts&#151;that is, the evidence of the people who run some of the big retailers. We have heard Justin King&#146;s comments. Retailers are cutting their prices by 15, 20, 30, 40 and sometimes even 50 per cent. to try to drive trade into their shops. As people wander down the street, wondering which shop they should go into, a sign in the window of a shop that says, &#147;2.5 per cent. cut in VAT&#148;, across the street from a retailer advertising a 30 per cent. cut in the price of its goods will not drive people in to the shop with the 2.5 per cent. cut.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="90512-0016.htm_para27"><a name="09051275000047">We should focus on talking to some of the smaller businesses, as I did in Braintree and Witham, two of the towns in my constituency. I did not get a sense from any retailers there that the 2.5 per cent. cut would drive up volumes of business, but those volumes need to be driven up, because I have seen some major retailers in my town centres&#151;particularly in Braintree&#151;simply shutting down and leaving because the business was not there. The 2.5 per cent. that the Government chucked at them to try to drive up trade did not really work, I am afraid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="90512-0016.htm_para28"><a name="09051275000048">My next question for the Minister concerns what analysis he, his civil servants and the various people from consultancies who work for him have done. What uplift in the volume of retail trade can be attributed directly to the 2.5 per cent. VAT cut? How has it affected growth in the retail sector? Has it led to a sudden growth in our GDP, a point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (John Howell)? Those are pertinent questions, but my main interest is to know whether the Minister and his family rushed out and started to buy more as a result of the VAT cut. What goods did he end up buying?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="90512-0016.htm_para29"><a name="09051275000049">My next question concerns the date on which VAT will return to its original rate.

What does the Minister think of that figure? Is it reasonable? It is important to consider the expense for retailers, because it is not only the big retailers who are affected; they can probably handle issues of compliance and implementing systems to deal with the changes. It is the SMEs who struggle to deal with the constant shifting of the goalposts on VAT. It is inconvenient to them. They want to spend their time, not dealing with compliance and other regulatory issues, but improving their trade. The cost of having to hire more people, perhaps half a day extra a week or even a month, is a meaningful amount to them, because, as we all know, retailers work on very thin margins. I am trying to gain an understanding of the costs to retailers. I would be interested to know what homework has the Minister done on that question.</p>

 That argument is peculiar, because when the VAT cut is put through the input-output model, one finds that direct capital investment saves or creates twice as many jobs as the VAT cut. The hon.

 I am grateful to be called to contribute to this debate, Sir Michael. I touched on the VAT cut in my contribution on Second Reading, so it is a pleasure to be able to join in the Committee deliberations from the Back Benches. Much of the debate, and indeed the Liberal Democrat amendment to the clause, is an attempt to estimate the impact of the VAT cut in relation to other stimulus measures that have been introduced. Much has been said this evening about the difficulty of measuring the extent to which the apparent increase in retail transactions is attributable to the VAT cut, as opposed to other things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="90512-0017.htm_para5"><a name="09051276000014">I should like to give a bit of colour: now that we are in May, data have been published that tell us what has happened to different categories of retail sales since the VAT cut came into effect. In the first quarter of this year&#151;from January to March&#151;like-for-like sales in the food sector rose by 5.3 per cent., but like-for-like sales in the non-food sector fell by 2.9 per cent. That is according to the Monitor retail sales survey, which is one of the most widely respected retail sales measurements. That pattern was followed again in April, the figures for which came out very recently. In that month, like-for-like sales overall increased by 4.6 per cent. as against last April.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="90512-0017.htm_para6"><a name="09051276000015">At first sight, that would seem to suggest that the Government&#146;s VAT cut had had a positive impact on sales, but I have to inform the Minister that that may well be something of an illusion. The total spent on food during that period has risen by less than food inflation over the same period. That indicates that the volume of food sold over those four months is lower than it was a year ago; it is negative. It is therefore erroneous to suggest that there has been an increase in food sales by volume during the period. As I have already indicated, non-food sales have actually declined during that period, so it would be hard for any statistician to be able to determine that there had been an increase in retail sales as a result of the VAT cut.</p>

<p><a name="st_o337"><a name="09051276000016"><a name="90512-0017.htm_spnew11"><a name="09051276000609"><b>Mr. Newmark:</b>
 Does my hon. Friend think that that could have to do with the Government&#146;s anti-obesity campaign? Does he think that that is the reason for the decline in volume of food sales?</p>

 As the deputy chairman of the all-party group on diabetes, I take a particular interest in the level of obesity in this country. I suggest to my hon. Friend that although the Government have, in order to keep medical bills down, made some strides to reduce the intake of individuals who consume too much, not enough has yet been done in that regard. A lot more could be done. I do not think that obesity measures are the reason that the volume of food sold has declined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="90512-0017.htm_para7"><a name="09051276000018">The figures for April showed an overall increase of nearly 5 per cent., as I have said. That could well be attributed to changing patterns&#151;to changes in the date of Easter, a time when retailers put on special promotions and people like to spend money because they are off work, and, of course, to changes in that favourite in the retail trade, the weather. In 2009, Easter was in April, but in 2008 it was in March so sales were typically lower  <br>

the month after Easter than they were in Easter month. The weather this April, as hon. Members will remember, was balmily sunny, and many of them will have joined my family&#151;well, they were not actually with my family, but they did the same thing as us&#151;in having Easter lunch outside in the sunshine, which was something that we did not do in 2008. We managed to do it in April 2007, which presaged one of the wettest summers on record, and I hope that that is not a portent for this summer&#146;s weather. The weather this April was good, but the weather last April was bad, and those two factors may well account for a large part of the increase in overall sales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="90512-0017.htm_para8"><a name="09051276000019">Indeed, Stephen Robertson, the director general of the British Retail Consortium, said as much. He said of the sales figures:</p>

 My hon. Friend will have seen the unemployment statistics that came out earlier this week, indicating that about 224,000 people joined the unemployment queues over the past three months.

the unemployment figures by another 500,000 to 600,000. As a result of the VAT cut and the potential pick-up in volume, will the retail trade hire more people to deal with the problem, or have the Government seen no evidence of that coming down the path?</p>

<p><a name="st_o344"><a name="09051276000027"><a name="90512-0017.htm_spnew18"><a name="09051276000616"><b>Mr. Dunne:</b>
 My hon. Friend has posed a question for the Financial Secretary, who is now back in his seat; I am sure that his colleagues will brief him so that he can provide a proper answer. My point is that the Government seem set on failing to provide sufficient university places to school leavers this summer. The ranks of the unemployed may well be swollen by young people unable to get into university because the Government have not provided adequate funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="90512-0017.htm_para11"><a name="09051276000028">I move on to consider briefly one or two other factors that may have more significant impact than the VAT cut: I am thinking of the consequences of the reduction in interest rates. In the past 12 months or so, the base rate has declined tenfold from 5 to 0.5 per cent. That will undoubtedly provide a significant increase in disposable income to households that have tracker or variable rate mortgages. The point applies to the disposable income of not only low-income households, as suggested by the Liberal Democrat amendment, but that of all households that benefit from such mortgages. Those who were on fixed-rate mortgages and had the opportunity to reset them in the past 12 months will see some increase&#151;although it will not be as significant, because the banks are clearly making up their margins on mortgages and are not fully passing on the base rate cut. However, I would argue that that cut has had a far more significant impact on disposable incomes and economic activity than the footling VAT cut.</p>

<p><a name="st_o345"><a name="09051276000029"><a name="90512-0017.htm_spnew19"><a name="09051276000617"><b>Mr. Newmark:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point about the shift downwards in interest rates. Many of us have store cards; it would be interesting to know whether stores have passed on the decline in interest rates to consumers. Alternatively, have they kept their rates high? Do the margins that they make on that side more than make up for what they may be losing in trade due to VAT cuts and so on?</p>

<p><a name="st_o346"><a name="09051276000030"><a name="90512-0017.htm_spnew20"><a name="09051276000618"><b>Mr. Dunne:</b>
 The retail sector is one of the most innovative in our economy. It would not surprise me at all if customers had the opportunity of significant discounting on the ticket price, particularly of large ticket items, while the back-office finance departments recovered their margins by maintaining significant spreads on store cards and other forms of credit made available to facilitate purchases.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way; he is being exceptionally generous. Before he moves on, I want to put something on the record. A lot of banks are gouging people on interest rates. The interest on the Royal Bank of Scotland Black Card, which has just been introduced, is more than 50 per cent. a year. That bank has certainly not been passing on the cut.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="90512-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09051276000033">I should like to make two other brief points to Ministers about the clause. The first is an issue that I raised when the VAT cut was first announced last autumn: the extraordinary impact on the sectors of our economy that have the benefit of flat-rate VAT arrangements. By introducing the measure with such haste, the Government failed to take properly into account the consequences for the many sectors that benefit from such arrangements. Like, I am sure, almost every other hon. Member, I have had constituents writing to me complaining that, far from seeing a reduction in VAT as a result of the 2.5 per cent. general cut, their customers have seen an increase because the Government have failed accurately to calculate changes to the flat-rate arrangements. Many businesses are having to impose on their customers a higher flat-rate charge during this period of the so-called VAT cut than they did previously. That is quite extraordinary, and the Government have failed to provide a proper justification for it at any point. I hope that they will revisit the subject, even at this late stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="90512-0017.htm_para13"><a name="09051276000034">Finally, I should like to touch on the point made forcefully by my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) about the date. I also mentioned it in the Second Reading debate. It is quite extraordinary to choose a Thursday to introduce a significant change that will require the re-ticketing of every item, on and off the high street, that is subject to VAT. As my hon. Friend said, the only thing that the proposal has in its favour is that it is the calendar year end. It is not a month end or a week end; in most cases, it is not a financial year end. If the Minister had any familiarity with retailing, he would recognise that most retail financial year ends vary. They will typically fall at the end of January, not the end of December, but they vary according to the calendar. If it is, say, 31 December, it will be the final Saturday of the month closest to that date, not a Thursday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="90512-0017.htm_para14"><a name="09051276000035">I ask the Minister to consider something that might be familiar to his Parliamentary Private Secretary and to many of his other colleagues. Has he had any discussions with the retail trade in Scotland about what the impact might be of introducing a significant change requiring a large number of manual amendments to stock price items after close of business on Hogmanay evening? I suspect that that will be extremely inconvenient to retailers in Scotland, who will have to pay substantially more in overtime to their long-suffering staff for coming into work after lights out on Thursday 31 December, when they may well have other things that they would prefer to be doing. I hope that the Financial Secretary will deal with that point directly.</p>

I can tell the House that on 6 March, with my agreement, HMRC commissioned a study from an independent research organisation, ORC International, whose report will be published, as always with externally commissioned research. The research will look carefully at the compliance costs burden imposed by the change and compare them with the estimates in the public impact assessment. It  <br>

will also gather data about the commercial effects and the decisions that businesses took in the light of the VAT reduction, including looking next spring at the effects of the rate going back up again to 17.5 per cent.

To assess the impact of the VAT cut, we will need data from the consumer trends survey, breaking down consumption between zero-rated and VAT-able goods.

 Of course, but they are a data point in a growing and increasingly clear picture about what is happening to retail sales. That is in sharp contrast to what happened to retail sales in the 1990s recession, caused by the policies of the Conservative party, when there was a very different trajectory. In the first quarter of 2009, quarter-on-quarter GDP growth was minus 1.9 per cent., but retail sales growth was plus 0.9 per cent, which is a remarkable phenomenon. How is that remarkable performance to be explained? In part, of course, it is because of the cut in VAT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="90512-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09051276000048">We can examine retail sales, and we can examine what Goldman Sachs said a couple of months ago about some earlier figures. It stated:</p>
<a name="90512-0018.htm_brev2"><a name="09051276000594"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;With clothing and footwear...making the biggest contribution, it appears that the VAT cut was instrumental in driving this strength.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="90512-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09051276000049">There is also the more recent report, which I am pleased that Conservative Members have now had the chance to have a look at, by the Centre for Economics and Business Research in the name of an adviser to the Conservative party&#151;or a former adviser, I am not quite sure which&#151;with the title, &#147;Credit where credit&#146;s due&#151;the VAT cut is working&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="90512-0018.htm_para4"><a name="09051276000050">When the VAT cut was introduced, it was roundly condemned by the Opposition parties. But speaking of credit where credit is due, I pay tribute to the Liberal Democrats, who in their amendment at least acknowledge that it is right to look at the evidence before drawing a conclusion. I welcome that progress, and I hope that even the Conservative party might in the end not prove impervious to the evidence that is mounting, and will continue to mount, in the coming months. Today&#146;s data are another significant piece of evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="90512-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09051276000051">To be fair to the Conservative party, the shadow Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform always recognised the likely effectiveness of a VAT cut in boosting the economy. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) declined to dissent from that view, so I take it that he agrees, although he was not able to say so. Certainly the hon. Members for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) and for Poole (Mr. Syms) both endorsed it in their remarks. I hope that in the end, other Opposition Members will come round.</p>

<p><a name="st_o356"><a name="09051276000052"><a name="90512-0018.htm_spnew2"><a name="09051276000628"><b>Mr. Gauke:</b>
 The point is that all of us on these Benches, and certainly the shadow business Secretary, made it very clear that we could not afford the VAT cut.</p>

<p><a name="st_o357"><a name="09051276000053"><a name="90512-0018.htm_spnew3"><a name="09051276000629"><b>Mr. Timms:</b>
 I hope that that shows the hon. Gentleman&#146;s implicit acceptance that the VAT reduction has boosted retail sales, as the shadow business Secretary said that it would. If the hon. Gentleman can confirm that, I will be most grateful.</p>

 I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has declined so pointedly to endorse his right hon. and learned Friend&#146;s viewpoint, but other Conservative Members agreed with it. I suspect that, over time, it will gain currency on the Conservative Benches, given the evidence that is becoming clearer and clearer.</p>

<a name="ordayhd_23"><a name="90512-0018.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="09051276000595"><h5 align="left">9.45 pm</h5>
<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="90512-0018.htm_para6"><a name="09051276000056">We can say with certainty that retail sales and the condition of the economy would be worse without the temporary reduction and that it is benefiting all businesses&#151;large and small, VAT-registered or not&#151;by supporting the whole economy and increasing demand to higher levels than would otherwise be experienced. Of course, the VAT cut is especially beneficial to those on low incomes because it is worth 1.6 per cent. of gross income to households in the lowest income decile, compared with 0.5 per cent. to those in the highest decile.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="90512-0018.htm_para7"><a name="09051276000057">To those who suggest that it would be a good idea if the change took place on 1 December, I emphasise that that date is immediately before the busiest retailing weekend of the year. It would be a much worse date on which to make the change&#151;that was clear from our discussions with the British Retail Consortium. There is not much support for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="90512-0018.htm_para8"><a name="09051276000058">I want specifically to tackle one point, which was raised in today&#146;s debate and on Second Reading. Indeed, I was surprised that an amendment had not been tabled about the difficulty for the many businesses that will remain open beyond midnight on 31 December in coping with two different VAT rates in a single trading day. Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs will allow a few hours&#146; grace for businesses such as pubs and clubs, which will serve customers over midnight on 31 December, to enable them to charge the same 15 per cent. for a session that goes beyond midnight into the early hours of 1 January. HMRC will work with businesses on the details, but I think that that will address the concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="90512-0018.htm_para9"><a name="09051276000059">I hope that I have reassured the hon. Member for Taunton that we have taken steps to secure the objectives that his amendment would deliver, in so far as they are achievable, and that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_o360"><a name="09051276000060"><a name="90512-0018.htm_spnew6"><a name="09051276000632"><b>Mr. Browne:</b>
 Thank you, Sir Michael, for giving me an opportunity to speak at the conclusion of this helpful debate. Many hon. Members will appreciate the modest but none the less welcome concession that the Financial Secretary made at the end of his remarks about the specific arrangements at the end of December and into 1 January. Never let it be said that we do not achieve anything through our endeavours on the Liberal Democrat Benches to put pressure on the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="90512-0018.htm_para10"><a name="09051276000061">My party has said all along that the VAT reduction has undoubtedly had an impact. It would be odd to maintain that the Government could spend &#163;12 billion to &#163;13 billion to no effect. The question is whether the impact is as profound as the Government wished for that amount of expenditure. We have had a useful discussion about that, but I hoped that the review that I envisaged, or any other review, could draw the matter out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="90512-0018.htm_para11"><a name="09051276000062">The timing, which is effectively the stand part dimension of the debate, is relevant. We should consider whether there needs to be an additional stimulus for consumers to go out and buy items in December, of all months. The VAT cut costs roughly &#163;1 billion a month, but, in December, one would expect the cost to be much greater because expenditure is so much higher.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90512-0018.htm_para12"><a name="09051276000063">The amendment provided a useful opportunity to debate the subject in the round and, despite being urged by some hon. Members to press it to a Division, I will not. However, I will seek to vote on clause stand part. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

 As what I have just said is the case, I think it is best that I make a little headway for the moment, and try to explain why I think the Government&#146;s alcohol escalator acts to the detriment of a good number of our constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="90512-0019.htm_para3"><a name="0905132000027">Ministers frequently make the point that there have been changes in lifestyle patterns in the United Kingdom, and that the rates of taxation charged on alcohol of all types is not the sole determining factor of demand for those products. I accept that: people behave differently and society is different from how it was 20 or 30 years ago, and people have modified their behaviour quite outside how that is influenced by duty levels on alcohol. Also, although the popular perception is that alcohol consumption is soaring, the reverse is the case: the total UK sales of most types of alcohol are declining. Within that overall big picture, there are changes in the way that people consume alcohol, such as the extent to which they consume it at home as opposed to in licensed premises. That is one consideration, and I do not say that the Government are responsible for those changing lifestyle patterns. Indeed, in some regards they may even have advantages, although in other regards they may have disadvantages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="90512-0019.htm_para4"><a name="0905132000028">There are additional factors. The smoking ban, for example, has undoubtedly had an impact on some establishments. Establishments that specialise in serving food alongside the sale of alcohol may even have benefited from the smoking ban, but it has undoubtedly had an adverse effect on the business of institutions that do not have food so high up their pitch to their customers. I think all Members would accept that. There will be Members present who voted in different ways. I voted against the smoking ban, but I was in a small minority. Most Members voted for its introduction in England, but the ban has undoubtedly had an adverse impact on a number of bars, pubs and restaurants in England.</p>

<p><a name="st_o383"><a name="0905132000029"><a name="90512-0019.htm_spnew15"><a name="0905132000083"><b>Mr. Dunne:</b>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="90512-0019.htm_para5"><a name="0905132000030">I, too, voted against the smoking ban, and one of my reasons for doing so was to allow pubs in my constituency to continue to attract customers, many of whom have smoked. Many pubs also have breweries attached to them. I am told by the Society of Independent Brewers, whose best bitter I judged in Ludlow castle on Sunday, that my constituency has more independent brewers than any other, and they are extremely concerned about the increases through the beer duty escalator proposed in this Budget.</p>

 Sir Michael, that intervention may have been of a better length if the hon.

We are dealing with the impact that Government policy on alcohol taxation is having on pubs, brewers&#151;the hon. Gentleman rightly pointed that out&#151;and people who work in the entertainment industry. It is well known that pubs are closing at an alarming rate in this country. It is not our duty in this House to try to ensure that pubs that are unable to attract customers remain in business regardless of their ability to sell their product at an attractive price to the people who choose&#151;or do not choose&#151;to go to them. Nevertheless, there is a discernable pattern and it is undoubtedly influenced by a number of factors. I mentioned lifestyle changes, and the smoking ban is also a factor, but price&#151;specifically the price differential between sales in licensed premises and in off licences&#151;is certainly a factor. Most people would accept that that is having an impact, on pubs in particular.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="90512-0019.htm_para7"><a name="0905132000033">I am told by the British Beer and Pub Association that 70 per cent. of people oppose this increase in duty. That does not necessarily surprise me, but it is strange that it has become almost the received wisdom in political circles that putting higher duty on alcohol is popular. When I leave Westminster I find far fewer people who are enthusiastic about increasing alcohol duty than I do when I talk to think-tanks and others here, who tell me what a very good idea it is.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree with the publicans, who have lobbied most of us in this House, that this latest duty increase could be the straw that breaks the camel&#146;s back, given the recessionary influences also bearing on the pub trade?</p>

 Not only do I agree, but the evidence is there for all to see. Six or so pubs are closing on a daily basis, so the camel&#146;s back has been broken for them. The margins are fine on so-called liquid sales; the profit made by the publican, be it on spirits, beer, cider or any example that one chooses to highlight, is very modest. That is why so many pubs have, understandably, diversified into food and accommodation, but it becomes extremely problematic for publicans if they are not able to make some sort of meaningful profit from their core business of selling alcohol.</p>

 Will the hon. Gentleman say something about the tremendous amount of work that all sorts of bodies, in particular the National Association of Cider Makers, have done on responsible drinking? The Government&#146;s idea that increasing duty will be beneficial is counter-intuitive and does a great deal of damage to those bodies, which are working so hard. While I am on the matter of health, has he seen the Government deputy Chief Whip, who normally appears at these later hours&#151;he certainly appeared at all times during consideration of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill&#151;and does the hon.

the only cider manufacturer left in Taunton Deane&#151;and produces an excellent product. It is noticeable that, when people drink cider or other alcoholic drinks on the premises in traditional pubs, they are drinking in a controlled environment so it is much less likely to be detrimental to their health than if they were drinking in other circumstances. That is partly why community pubs have a civilising influence in many cases that would not be so obviously witnessed with other forms of retailer. Many people think that alcohol consumed in those circumstances is better than alcohol consumed in others.</p>

That is a very precise figure, and not quite half of Labour MPs. I am pleased to see much better representation on the Labour Benches than has been the case for other aspects of the Bill. It is still a modest turnout, but I hope that those Labour Members who have attended have come to champion the interests of their constituents, licensed premises, brewers and people who work in the entertainment sector in their constituencies.</p>

Previous winners include Sir Paul McCartney, the Queen and the Harry Potter films, so that is a measure of how much we value the traditional pubs in our society. They are enjoyed not only by all our constituents but by people who visit this country and regard visiting a pub and drinking the sort of drinks that are only available in this country as essential to the intrinsic appeal of being a tourist here.</p>

Has he had the benefit of work by the Pub is the Hub campaign, which underlines the contribution that pubs make to the local community&#151;it is much wider than their direct business contribution? For example, in my constituency the Tree inn in Stratton now has a post office. It has reopened in the pub and is providing a fantastic service for the people of Stratton.

 It is a perfect example. In many villages, the pub just selling alcohol to the residents of that village is no longer a viable economic business model, for the all the reasons I have touched on.

 Sir Michael, your guidance is invaluable. The only thing that I would say is that I visited Andy Fordham&#146;s pub when he won the world darts championship a few years ago. It was fantastic to see the world darts trophy behind the bar, next to the crisps and peanuts on sale there. Darts, right up to the highest level, is intrinsic to people&#146;s enjoyment of pubs.</p>

I have received an enormous volume of correspondence from people in my constituency and from institutions. They are extremely upset that the Government&#146;s policies are likely to make it far harder for pubs and other entertainment retailers to stay in business. Indeed, in the past few weeks alone I have received representations from &#147;The Westgate Inn&#148; in Taunton; the &#147;Allerford Inn&#148; in Norton Fitzwarren; &#147;The Blagdon Inn&#148; in Blagdon Hill, just outside Taunton; &#147;The Bear Inn&#148; in Wiveliscombe, which was Somerset Campaign for Real Ale pub of the year last year and has, I think, a very good skittles alley; &#147;The Crown Hotel&#148; in Exford; &#147;The Holywell Inn&#148; in Taunton Deane; and many others, including &#147;The Swan&#148;, &#147;The Bell Inn&#148;, &#147;The Cottage Inn&#148;, &#147;The Bridge Inn&#148; and &#147;The Waggon Inn&#148;. I list those institutions only because those who are less familiar with Taunton Deane than I am&#151;a large number of Conservative MPs visit my constituency, however, so perhaps I will take the opportunity to show them some of these institutions&#151;will not know that that list contains a wide range of different pubs. Some are in Taunton, which is a reasonably sizeable town, and others are in quite isolated villages, but they all share the concern held by me and many other hon.

 My hon. Friend is making a very powerful case. Does he agree that when pubs shut it is very difficult for the planning authority to resist an application for change of use? When such applications are resisted, the pub in question can often be resurrected and can be profitable and secure in the future. &#147;The Old Barn Inn&#148; in Three Cocks and &#147;The Shoemakers&#148; in Pentrebach are now doing very well indeed.</p>

 I am delighted to hear that. Perhaps you might seek to encourage Members to talk about pubs they enjoy visiting in their constituencies, Sir Michael. The general point is an extremely good one. When pubs close, they rarely reopen and are lost to the community. The planning laws make it hard for pubs to reopen in many cases, but when they do it can be an extremely successful venture. It is also worth noting, in passing, that when new housing estates are built&#151;the Government still aspire to have 3 million new houses, although progress has been slower than they might have hoped in that regard&#151;they are rarely built with community amenities such as village halls, churches or pubs. People who live in many new developments keenly feel that their community would be greatly enhanced by a gathering point, such as a pub, where people can go for a sociable drink and also get to know other people, attend Rotary club meetings and so on. That only serves to highlight the importance of the sector, and why it is so clearly unwise of the Government to try to penalise people in it.</p>

 I am following the hon. Gentleman&#146;s powerful speech with great interest, but will he tell the Committee how many pubs in his constituency have closed already? At least three in my constituency have and the one in Little Irchester, where the Hell&#146;s Angels always used to gather, has been flattened.

 I carry out extensive research into the well-being of the pub sector in my constituency, as you might be able to tell, Sir Michael. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a precise figure, but a number of pubs have closed. What is alarming and notable is that they have closed everywhere&#151;in Taunton itself, which is a reasonably sized town with a population of 63,000, and in villages too. It is extremely unusual for villages to have two pubs, as was common even 10 years ago. The sector is contracting the whole time.</p>

 There are a number of reasons why pubs are suffering. I touched on changing lifestyles, and I suppose that one could incorporate the drink-drive laws in that. Certainly, there have been big changes in what is regarded as socially acceptable, although the relevant laws have not changed for a while. The hon. Gentleman did not mention the smoking ban, the effect of which I acknowledge has been chequered: although it may have had a positive effect in some establishments, in most it was probably a negative one.</p>

Anyone who goes shopping will know just how cheap alcohol is in supermarkets compared with pubs. I observe that customers seem keen to buy alcohol sold cheaply in supermarkets. The public do not greet it with great hostility, but the differential involved makes it that much harder for pubs and other licensed establishments to be successful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="90512-0020.htm_para1"><a name="0905132000057">The differential also makes it harder for traditional brewers to be successful, because they are rarely able to offer to the supermarkets the heavily discounted alcohol that the large international brewers can offer. Therefore, they are at a price disadvantage even within the supermarket, because the economies of scale are not sufficiently big for them to be able to manufacture to the level that means that supermarkets will offer their products at a great discount.</p>

 I was fortunate enough to miss the start of the hon.

If one simply reduced the duty or altered how the Government increase the duty, it would affect all sellers of alcohol equally. The competitive position of pubs would not be altered one iota.</p>

 I regret giving way to a Member who, first, was not interested enough in the subject to turn up at the beginning of the debate&#151;it is not as though we are early in the working day&#151;and, secondly, was so discourteous. However, I shall answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. I think that drinking in pubs is quite price sensitive&#151;more so than other environments in which people consume alcohol. Pubs are more price sensitive than bars that sell in large volume. I am not convinced that the Government&#146;s policy will have a profound impact on binge drinking: people who go and drink 12 pints of very strong lager are unlikely to modify their behaviour, and if they do, it will take the form of drinking 11 and a half pints of very strong lager, the effect of which will be little different. On the other hand, people of more modest means who drink in a pub, in a village or an urban area, can be more price sensitive: they may choose not to visit the pub, or to have only one pint, rather than one and a half. There is a price factor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="90512-0020.htm_para3"><a name="0905135000009">As I said, a pub has a range of social dimensions, and the impact on them of sales taking a different form may not be so keenly felt.

Readers of <i> Somerset County Gazette</i> will see among all the reports of how well Somerset&#146;s cricketers are doing the publication of the skittles leagues. Those leagues, like the darts leagues, are based around pubs: most pubs have skittles alleys which are about the length of this Chamber and as wide as the area between the red lines, and many people visit pubs to play skittles as part of teams against another pub team.

 An important message that the Government have to take on board when it comes to the competitiveness of the alcohol industry is that we should have regard to the export industry that we have built up, in particular on the back of the expertise in the whisky industry. My point relates not just to whisky, but all the spirits industries that have grown up in Scotland on the back of the whisky industry. The export industry depends on access to other markets, and if our own Government are penalising the product at home, it is much more difficult to argue about opening up markets abroad.</p>

 I think that the cost will be considerably less than the cost to the taxpayer of the industry continuing to suffer as it does, due to the number of pub closures and the number of other licensed establishments affected. Of course, the precise cost would depend on how many people were consulted. I think that the consultation should be broad, because there are so many groups affected by the issue, including those responsible for postal services and rotary clubs that meet in pubs in my constituency.

up, supermarkets sell many products, and so can occasionally absorb the cost of increased duty to keep prices low and attract people in? It therefore affects pubs disproportionately when duty goes up on beer.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point.

 Yes, but may I first explain just how many different areas of public life in this country are taken up with alcohol-related sales and production, and quite how profound the impact of Government increases in duty over and above the rate of inflation is on all those individuals and sectors of society? It is important that a report of the type envisaged in amendment 10 is conducted before further increases are introduced. It is quite wrong for the Government to proceed blindly in increasing duty on alcohol, which has had a profoundly adverse impact on many people in the past, without their being fully aware of the consequences for all those different people.</p>

 I very much support the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments about the importance of breweries. The recently established Saltaire Brewery in my constituency is thriving. It supplies local pubs, virtually exclusively. If the duty on beer and alcohol puts some of those pubs out of business, the hon.

 The amendment invites us to change clause 11. The substance of the argument, as we heard in that interesting opening, is that the increases in duty proposed by the Government are too high and could damage jobs and the industry. An alternative mechanism is proposed for further review so that there would be no further increases in the duty rates unless and until we had taken proper advice about their impact on jobs. That has a lot to recommend it, and I look forward to hearing what my party&#146;s Front Benchers think about it.</p>

of the impact of these high and rising duty rates on the business and why she might think that another proposal is not necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="90512-0020.htm_para7"><a name="09051322000003">In the explanatory notes to the Bill, we are told that clause 11 increases the duty by a nominal 2 per cent. However, if we look at what the clause actually says, we see that, for example, the standard rate of duty on beer is to rise from &#163;14.96 to &#163;16.47&#151;a rise of a little over 10 per cent.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is well known for his erudition and knowledge about a whole range of issues. To back up the comments that he is making, will he tell the House how much a pint of beer is at his local pub? When did he last buy one?</p>

 Sir Michael, I would be wandering far wide of the amendment if I were to go into all my drinking habits. I do not see this as an opportunity to take the hon. Gentleman on a conducted tour of all the pubs in Wokingham, although he can rest assured that I fully support my local pubs&#151;just as he supports his, I am sure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="90512-0020.htm_para8"><a name="09051322000006">My argument relates to the impact on the national picture of these duty rates. I take the hon. Gentleman back to where we were. I was pointing out that the standard rate of duty on beer shows an increase of more than 10 per cent.; I appreciate that there are VAT changes as well. There is also an increase in duty per hectolitre on sparkling cider from &#163;188.10 to &#163;207.20, also an increase of more than 10 per cent. The duty per hectolitre on non-sparkling cider whose strength exceeds 7.5 per cent. also increases, from &#163;43.37 to &#163;47.77&#151;again, a rise of more than 10 per cent. The rate of duty per hectolitre in any other case increases from &#163;28.90 to &#163;31.83, which is yet another increase of more than 10 per cent. It would be useful if the Minister took us through her figure work to give us some idea of what, over the period covered by the amendment, the Government have in mind under the alcohol duty escalator that they are designing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="90512-0020.htm_para9"><a name="09051322000007">The structure of clause 11 also reminds us that there are large steps up in duty on categories of wine, depending on whether it is sparkling and on its alcoholic strength. There is a duty increase of about 40 per cent. between wines of 3.9 per cent. strength and wines of 4.1 per cent. strength. There is more than a doubling of the duty if the strength goes up from 5.4 to 5.6 per cent. For some reason, sparkling wine in the 5.5 to 8.5 per cent. bracket is slightly cheaper than the equivalent non-sparkling wine, but for sparkling wine with a strength of more than 8.5 per cent. there is an increase of some 30 per cent. in duty over the standard amount. That does not seem to be particularly tidy or fair, and it will mean different impacts on different elements in the industry. Some people feel that duty is becoming penal at the higher levels, and there is no necessary correlation between drinking too much and the strength of the drink. On some occasions, people are much more careful with stronger drinks, for obvious reasons, and one has to be a little careful about the gradations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="90512-0020.htm_para10"><a name="09051322000008">We need some background on how these duties are tabled. Without a better explanation of why they are fair and just and related to wider social aims, it seems attractive on the surface that there should be a pause in the escalator and a proper review of its impact.</p>

 Does the right hon. Gentleman think that one problem with the Liberal amendment is that it would prevent any decrease in, or indeed the removal of, the escalator over the next three years?</p>

<p><a name="st_o442"><a name="09051322000010"><a name="90512-0021.htm_spnew1"><a name="09051322000049"><b>Mr. Redwood:</b>
 I think that latecomers should refrain from making comments that have already been made by hon. Members who have decided to take this rather more seriously. As you rightly reminded us, Sir Michael, it is an extremely serious issue for a very large number of businesses and constituents throughout the country. We have all been impressed by the energy of those who are desperately trying to save their industry and their local pubs. They have been to see us here in the Palace of Westminster, they have been to see Ministers, they have sent a great number of e-mails and personal correspondence, and they have often been to Members&#146; constituency advice surgeries. It well behoves anybody in the House not to try to turn this into some kind of knockabout but to see that it involves big issues about jobs, prices, communities and ways of life that matter a great deal to our constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="90512-0021.htm_para0"><a name="09051322000011">As we have heard&#151;I do not wish to bore the House by repeating it&#151;a point can be reached where an increase in taxation can suddenly tip over into doing far more serious damage. My worry is that we are reaching that point against the background of recession. It may well be that in more normal years there was agreement across the House that there needed to be a certain level of duty, or even an increase in duty, for health or revenue-raising reasons. However, against the background of great pressure on the economy, a squeeze on many people&#146;s incomes, a squeeze on company cash flow, and businesses experiencing difficulty in raising from the banks working capital or money for their wider purposes, the Government should pause to reflect on whether this is the appropriate moment to introduce such a tax increase and whether they have done a proper study of what impact it may have on jobs and individual businesses. We have already heard examples of small brewers who could be knocked sideways if demand fell too sharply, and we all know of pubs at risk in our own constituencies and in the wider country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="90512-0021.htm_para1"><a name="09051322000012">I am also concerned about the impact on prices. It is dangerous to be as cavalier as the Government appear to be about the inflation risk. One of the attractions of the Liberal Democrat amendment is that it is trying to create a pause in the rate of increase of this particular set of prices in our economy. I find it extremely worrying that at a time when output is falling precipitately, and when redundancies and unemployment are soaring, as we are tragically seeing again today, with about a quarter of a million extra unemployed so far this year&#151;an alarming development&#151;we still have price inflation, on the Government&#146;s preferred measure, of about 3 per cent. Although there is clearly a lot of deflation in the system, there is still quite a lot of inflation as well, part of which is on imports. That is certainly true in the drinks industry, because wines and so forth are imported from much stronger currency areas and the devaluation, along with the increased duty, is increasing price tensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="90512-0021.htm_para2"><a name="09051322000013">However, the price tension is not due to that alone; it is also due to the impact of Government action.

 Does the right hon. Gentleman not accept that the depreciation of the pound or the appreciation of the euro, however one likes to look at it, is actually of benefit to the economy? We are starting to see a turnaround in our chronic balance of trade deficit, and demand is being directed towards domestic producers of other things. That is helping employment and the economy.

 We must be careful not to make this a wider economic debate, and we have dealt with that matter in such debates. I have always said that devaluation should help domestic manufacture relative to overseas manufacture and should start to make some correction to the balance of payments. However, what we are concerned about this evening is the sectoral impact of a particular tax increase on the jobs and prosperity generated by the alcohol and entertainment industry. I am adding that point that inflation is also harmful, and there is a double whammy of inflation in the alcohol sector. That is coming partly through the sterling effect, to the extent that drinks are imported, but more importantly there is a direct inflationary impact from the measure that we are discussing this evening. We are also discussing the attempt to prevent future increases, at least for a period pending further review, as suggested in the amendment.</p>

 That is quite right, although it takes us into a wider, general economic matter that is not strictly the point at issue in the amendment. The issue that we must consider is the adverse impact of duty escalators on both jobs and prices. The two are related, of course. This is a time when people may be losing a week or two of work a month because a factory is partially closed. They may have lost overtime or one or two days&#146; work a week, or they may even be off work for three or six months because of the temporary closure of big factories, for example in parts of the motor industry. This extra price increase on something that they like to do for relaxation is not good news, and the Government might be underestimating the impact it could have on hard-pressed budgets.</p>

The industry has different components: it has the producers of alcoholic products and all the people involved in marketing, sales and distribution, but it also has those involved in hospitality and leisure who use alcoholic products as part of a wider offering to the public. That is the feature that has led so many hon. Members to be so passionate about the defence of their local pub trade and their local pubs, as important establishments in suburbs, communities and villages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="90512-0021.htm_para16"><a name="09051322000037">When she responds to this debate, I hope that the Exchequer Secretary will understand that the House is responding not just to the amendment before us, but to what lies behind it, which is a very big lobby indeed. That lobby is warning the Government that the industry is particularly exposed and that the Government&#146;s revenue-raising actions are increasing the agony that businesses are experiencing generally from the impact of the wonky monetary policy, the credit crunch, and the over-extension and then the sharp withdrawal of credit, all of which have characterised the unfortunate performance of the economy in the past three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="90512-0021.htm_para17"><a name="09051322000038">I hope that the Minister will remember to explain to the House a little more how her clause 11 operates, because that will stand part of the Bill if the amendment is not passed. I hope she agrees that the increases in the Bill are very large for an economy that, we are told, should be operating at zero inflation. There are also some big steps up in the duty on wine, which do not make a lot of sense to quite a lot of people trying to wrestle with what the Government are seeking to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="90512-0021.htm_para23"><a name="09051323000007">In general terms, the industry considers this year&#146;s rises bad news. They are particularly bad news for an industry that employs 10,000 people directly and 40,000 directly and indirectly in Scotland, and a total of 65,000 directly and indirectly in the UK. It is not only the whisky industry that will be affected but the drinks sector generally, which has already asked the Government to abandon the 2 per cent. above inflation tax escalator on alcohol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="90512-0021.htm_para24"><a name="09051323000008">That request has been based in part on the work done by Oxford Economics, which has looked at the effect of last year&#146;s 17 per cent. average leap in excise duty and at the implications of the four-year tax escalator. Its five-year study estimates that there will be about 75,000 job losses in the drinks industry. In the teeth of a recession, having a policy that is likely to lead to job losses is foolish. The study predicts that alcohol sales will drop by over 11 per cent. and that tax revenue from alcohol will be &#163;1.6 billion lower than the Treasury originally estimated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="90512-0021.htm_para25"><a name="09051323000009">For all those reasons, we need to find a better, fairer, evidence-based way of taxing alcohol. We simply cannot go on with the unfairness in the system that results in a half-pint of beer costing 23.06p in duty and a 125 ml glass 26.75p, while a 35 ml glass of whisky costs 31.7p in duty, especially when all those measures contain precisely the same amount of alcohol. That clearly demonstrates the unfairness in the way in which duty is levied on different forms of alcoholic drinks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="90512-0021.htm_para26"><a name="09051323000010">I have not called for the duty rises to be cancelled, although that would be very welcome. However, my amendment 12 calls for the evidence that would allow evidence-based policy making and for the Treasury to tell us by the time of this year&#146;s pre-Budget report how much duty is raised from each of the different kinds of alcoholic drink. The amendment also calls for the publication of an assessment of</p>
<a name="90512-0021.htm_brev10"><a name="09051323000097"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the level of alcohol liquor duty required to be levied on each type of drink on an equitable basis based on the alcohol content to generate the same revenue yield.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="90512-0021.htm_para27"><a name="09051323000011">We need that information in order properly to determine, on the basis of real evidence, how to tax alcohol fairly, across the board, and how to protect the vitally important Scotch whisky industry. Other Members will have their own industries, such as cider houses and breweries. We also need the evidence to ensure that, whatever we do, there are no unintended consequences. I am conscious of the pressures on the brewing industry and the pub trade, but also conscious of the unfairness when it comes to the duty levied on whisky.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="90512-0021.htm_para28"><a name="09051323000012">For all those reasons&#151;and ignoring the arguments that the Minister made last year about how difficult this might be and how Europe would not let us do it&#151;I think that it is reasonable to ask for an assessment of the duty taken on the different kinds of drinks, and of the level of duty that would be necessary to create equitable taxation in future. With that, I will sit down. I have heard a number of very long speeches today that went all round the houses and missed the point. I hope, Sir Michael, that people will be grateful for a short, concise speech.</p>

 Thank you, Sir Alan. It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie). I shall return to his amendment in due course, but I was greatly entertained and interested by his passionate defence of the Scotch whisky industry&#151;so much so that I thought that amendment 10 had actually been tabled by the Scottish National party. We are, of course, speaking to the Liberal Democrat amendment, which is designed to freeze spirit duty only, while allowing beer and cider duty to continue to rise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="90512-0022.htm_para0"><a name="09051323000015">It is also a pleasure to follow my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), who spoke, as always, with a great deal of sense. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s explanation of the duty figures and to her response to his question about the tipping point, the revenue-maximisation point and other issues facing the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="90512-0022.htm_para1"><a name="09051323000016">In speaking to his amendment, the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) recovered well after a difficult start, but it is worth repeating that the amendment says that he will freeze only spirit duties for three years, while he seems quite happy for the above-inflation increases to continue for wine, beer and cider.</p>

 I caution the hon. Gentleman about failing to see the wood for the trees. I made it extremely clear in my speech&#151;I do not think many would accuse me of not speaking for long enough&#151;that I am very keen to help those producing beer, cider, wine and other alcoholic drinks. If he feels that the amendment is not drafted satisfactorily, I regret that he has not tabled a better-drafted one, as I would not wish to let the Government off the hook by his splitting hairs on this issue, when it is very clear that I wish to represent alcohol producers as a whole.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point. Although I am relatively new to the Finance Bill, I did not believe that it was possible to table an amendment to an amendment, so I am not sure how I could have tabled an amendment to his amendment. It is important to be clear about what we are discussing and amendment 10 deals only with the spirits industry, but I appreciate the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman says that he actually means the whole industry. I will try to move on from that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="90512-0022.htm_para2"><a name="09051323000019">The only other thing I would say about the amendment is that it is also clear that no reduction in duty would be possible until such time as the report is presented&#151;a point made very ably by my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) and, albeit some hours afterwards, by the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink), who in his customary fashion has been in and out rather quickly. Having said all that and having listened to the speech of the hon. Member for Taunton, I agree with the great majority of what he had to say about the issues facing the industry.</p>

 As ever, my hon. Friend makes a telling point, dwelling on the history of many of these issues. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response about that Bill and its impact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="90512-0022.htm_para3"><a name="09051323000022">The amendment is wide-ranging and talks about reaching</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="90512-0022.htm_para4"><a name="09051323000023">I intend to speak around most of those issues this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="90512-0022.htm_para5"><a name="09051323000024">One of the main reasons for my speaking tonight is that I am going to outline why we voted against this year&#146;s rises in alcohol duties. We see them as blanket rises that hit all consumers, without making any attempt to curb problem drinkers. There are also significant holes in other aspects of Government policy. For example, while Labour&#146;s alcohol duty escalator appears still to exist, it does not seem to apply when the retail prices index is negative. We were told that the escalator was there to provide stability, but that stability went within a few months with the new duty rises in the pre-Budget report, and stability and certainty have been eroded further in the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="90512-0022.htm_para6"><a name="09051323000025">We must ask whether the RPI measure looks forward or backward. We must also ask what will happen to alcohol duty when VAT goes up next new year&#146;s eve as &#147;Auld Lang Syne&#148; rings out. Earlier, I think that we heard a concession from the Financial Secretary, who suggested that the change might be made in the early hours of new year&#146;s day rather than on new year&#146;s eve. A further question is whether the Government&#146;s huge duty rises are a result of health concerns or of a desperate effort to plug the gaping hole in the public finances, or perhaps a little bit of both. However, I thought that first we should conduct an examination of exactly what has happened over the last 14 months in relation to alcohol duties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="90512-0022.htm_para7"><a name="09051323000026">When the Government introduced their duty escalator at the last Budget, they raised duty by some 6 per cent. across the board. It rose again by 8 per cent. when VAT was reduced in the PBR, and we have a further increase of 2 per cent. across the board in this year&#146;s Budget. Over two Budgets and the intervening PBR, duty on a typical pint of beer has risen by 8p in a year. A bottle of wine now carries duty of &#163;1.61, compared with &#163;1.34 previously. That is an increase of 27p.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="90512-0022.htm_para8"><a name="09051323000027">Spirits are up. A bottle of gin carries 82p more duty, and a bottle of whisky carries an additional 86p&#151;although without the Government&#146;s embarrassing U-turn in the PBR, the amount would have been even greater. Cider and perry are also up, as is champagne&#151;which does have some impact on the Treasury, judging by last year&#146;s photographs of large-volume deliveries to it and to other Government premises on and just off Whitehall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="90512-0022.htm_para9"><a name="09051323000028">Let me first outline some of the current health concerns about alcohol and their relevance to duty and then to the problems facing the sector, before examining the Government&#146;s recent record and setting out some of the Conservative solutions.

responsible drinkers in the United Kingdom, but there are also about 3 million adults who have some form of alcohol dependency and another 8 million who have some kind of alcohol-use disorder. That is the picture among adults, but under-age drinking is a problem that is often highlighted as well. A tenth of final-year primary school children at least say that they drink regularly, and the number rises to 45 per cent. of 14 to 15-year-olds. I understand that, in this context, &#147;regularly&#148; is taken to mean at least weekly. A fifth of 10 to 15-year-olds say that they get drunk regularly. In 2005-06, more than 1,400 children under 14 were admitted to hospital in the United Kingdom as a result of conditions caused by alcohol abuse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="90512-0022.htm_para10"><a name="09051323000029">We all know that alcohol is a major contributor to crime and antisocial behaviour. Half of all violent crime is drink-related. It probably happens in every one of our constituencies, and it is probably happening now, at this late hour. One of the interesting aspects of being an inner-London Member of Parliament without a second home to return to in the evening is leaving this place after a 10 pm vote and arriving at Fulham Broadway tube station between 10.30 and 11 pm. The scene is not yet in full swing, but the thumping music makes the whole street vibrate. Drunken youths are already marauding, and on some occasions fighting has started. That is one of the many reasons why Hammersmith and Fulham council is clamping down on late licences, as far as it can under Labour&#146;s disastrous Licensing Act 2003. It was the first council in Britain to pay for 24-hour beat policing teams in both Fulham Broadway and Shepherd&#146;s Bush town centres.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. It is worth mentioning that the problems I have just outlined, and of which we are all aware, are not new problems, but problems that have been with us for some time. That does not abrogate the Government&#146;s responsibility to do something about them, however, and I shall outline how we might be able to use the duty regime to do something.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="90512-0022.htm_para12"><a name="09051323000033">There are, of course, other effects of alcohol abuse. Since the 2003 Act came into force, there has been a 25 per cent. increase in violent crime reported between 3 am and 6 am. I do not have up-to-date figures on the impact of alcohol on domestic violence, but we are all aware from our constituencies that there is a strong correlation. These are serious problems. It in no way downplays their severity to note that they involve a small minority of drinkers. It would also be wrong to put them entirely at the door of the industry, which is taking action of its own, although it could, and should, be doing even more.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. He makes the telling point that a well-supervised, well-staffed, professionally run licensed establishment will be able to look after such problems quite well. The real problems, of course, start to arise outside the establishment or later on, which is, again, something the industry has to consider.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="90512-0022.htm_para14"><a name="09051323000037">Contrary to popular perception, alcohol consumption is falling, and actually peaked a few years ago. The total amount of alcohol sold in the UK fell by 6 per cent. between 2004 and 2008. Consumption per head of pure alcohol per annum is down from a peak of about 9.5 litres in 2004 to about 8.7 litres today, although that is still above the figure of 7.5 litres for 1993. This is not to deny that there are problems in the UK with alcohol consumption, but it goes to show that the sands are shifting. This is not the occasion to digress into a full debate on the healthiness or otherwise of alcohol consumption, as we are, after all, looking at the effect on licensed premises, but we need to strike a careful balance between the interests of the great majority who drink in sensible moderation as against addressing the people who abuse alcohol and are responsible for mayhem and disorder in our town centres, not to mention issues such as domestic violence and the expense caused, to low-income households in particular, by dependency and addiction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="90512-0022.htm_para15"><a name="09051323000038">Beer consumption peaked in 1979, and since I left university in 1989 beer consumption in pubs has halved. I am not for a moment suggesting a link between those two facts, but that does put into perspective how quickly this sector has changed. This is not a plea to reject the zeitgeist and return to a golden age of cricket and warm beer in our local pub, but we need to recognise that the competitive environment facing pubs is, in many places, difficult.</p>

 As someone who admits to being a teetotaller, may I say that pubs could be much fairer by recognising that there are people who do not drink alcohol and by not charging the outrageous mark-up that they put on non-alcoholic drinks for those of us who like to go into pubs but do not want to drink alcohol? Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if we were to address such issues, we could change the whole debate?</p>

 I am not sure that I quite agree with that. There is a limit to how much soft drink prices can be regulated, and I would be slightly nervous about suggesting there should be such regulation. I share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s frustration, however; when I am out with my wife, who rarely drinks alcohol, she constantly talks about how expensive an orange juice is relative to the price of beer, in this country at least. That is a fair point.</p>

through the off-trade has risen from about 10 per cent. in 1979 to just under 50 per cent. today, and the trend is accelerating. The rate of decline in beer consumption overall, across both on and off-trades, which is clear over 30 years, is accelerating. According to the British Beer and Pub Association, between March 2006 and March 2007, consumption fell by some 600,000 barrels, between 2007 and 2008 it fell by 1.1 million barrels&#151;that is about twice the rate&#151;and between 2008 and 2009 it fell by some 2.2 million barrels. It seems that almost every year the rate of the deceleration of beer consumption doubles. We are down to a level where just 28.6 million barrels are consumed, across both the on and off-trades and covering all types of beer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="90512-0022.htm_para17"><a name="09051323000042">Meanwhile, wine consumption fell for the first time this year since records began. According to the World Health Organisation, in 2003 the UK&#146;s overall alcohol consumption level was only just above the EU average and was about the same as that of Switzerland and Portugal. The UK will have fallen further down that league table in the five or six years since. Again, that is not to say that this country does not have a problem with alcohol consumption, because it does, but it is worth remembering that consumption has decreased and the type of consumption is changing. These figures show that our problem is less related to overall volumes of consumption and more related to the types, patterns and, especially, the effects of alcohol consumption. In 2003, the UK&#146;s consumption per head was already lower than that of either France or Spain&#151;countries that many of us would view as having a more responsible attitude and approach to drinking in general. All that implies that the overall volume of consumption in this country is not necessarily the problem.</p>

Oxford Economics expects that these rises will</p>

hon. Members. There are some 57,000 pubs and bars in England and Wales, which, according to the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers, have a combined annual turnover of approximately &#163;25 billion, which is equivalent to about 2 per cent. of our GDP. More than 500,000 people are directly employed in the industry&#151;about a third as bar staff&#151;which is more than are employed in construction, agriculture and mining put together. According to ALMR, a third of pub revenue goes to the Exchequer in alcohol and gaming duties. Additional revenues are generated through VAT, PAYE and other local and national taxes, so the typical pub contributes about &#163;155,000 per annum to the Treasury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="90512-0022.htm_para21"><a name="09051323000048">However, the number of pubs is falling. More than 4,000 have closed since 2004, pre-dating the start of Labour&#146;s recession. The trend is now accelerating, with more than 3,000 of those closures taking place in the past two calendar years. What was a closure rate of five a week between 2004 and 2007 has become 40 a week in 2008. What was the weekly closure rate just a couple of years ago has become the daily closure rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="90512-0022.htm_para22"><a name="09051323000049">It would be unfair to blame alcohol duties exclusively for that trend. Labour&#146;s Licensing Act 2003 must also bear part of the blame, as must the increased competition from supermarkets and the smoking ban.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that today&#146;s debates will also affect those businesses? We have debated corporation tax for large and small businesses, and the VAT decrease and increase. The alcohol duty increase is just the last in the chain. By design or accident, there is a direct causal link with everything that we have debated today, and it is all coming together to affect this industry.</p>

A couple of weeks ago I was delighted to be hosted by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) and my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) to see at first hand how town and village pubs were coping. I say that as someone who represents an inner-London constituency. Perhaps I should get out a little more. One of the most striking aspects was being shown the entirety of the documentation that a pub operator or landlord needs to complete when opening, and again each year, even before a single pint is sold. According to the industry, publicans spend an average of eight hours a week dealing with paperwork, and one in five gives red tape as a reason for becoming uncompetitive. According to ALMR, which represents large parts of the pub and bar industry, the average running costs of a pub are some 51 per cent. of turnover, even before rent and the cost of sale are taken into account. Employment costs have increased&#151;</p>

According to the Oxford Economics study, some 31,000 people are employed in the UK in drinks manufacture. I shall try to relate this point to duty. Just over half are employed in producing beer, some 35 per cent. in producing spirits, 6 per cent. in producing cider and wine and the 6 per cent. remainder in producing other drinks. Much of that employment is in rural communities, where other jobs on offer are limited. It helps to sustain them, as my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) and others have noted. People involved in beer production in England and Wales are 50 per cent. more likely to live in a rural community than the national average for those in employment overall.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a powerful point, which highlights how much duty has risen in the past 14 months and the appalling effect that that is having on our breweries and pubs across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="90512-0023.htm_para3"><a name="09051323000074">Since 1997, under Labour, the following big breweries have closed down part of their operations in certain towns&#151;Brakspear, Ruddles, Morrells, Whitbread and Young&#146;s. Other names have disappeared entirely from the scene.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="90512-0023.htm_para4"><a name="09051323000075">How will the industry survive the recession? I do not have statistics for previous recessions, but I recall reading or hearing that the pub trade suffered a great deal but was still more recession-proof than some sectors. That might well no longer be the case: an interesting survey by YouGov showed the entertainment that households expected to cut down on as the recession bit into their budgets. The least affected things were TV subscriptions, gym memberships and the hiring of DVDs, but two of the three biggest losers were going to pubs and eating out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="90512-0023.htm_para5"><a name="09051323000076">The Oxford Economics study published in December 2008 examined the direct impact of the Budget and pre-Budget report measures on the pub sector in 2008-09. It also estimated the measures&#146; impact over the next five years, with the escalator in place. The study said that the cumulative loss thanks to the duty escalator in sales and economic activity would amount to 16.7 million barrels of beer, or 4.8 billion pints. It also said that more than 59,000 jobs would be lost in the beer supply chain, and that overall tax revenue, including duty, VAT and employment taxes, would fall by some &#163;79 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="90512-0023.htm_para6"><a name="09051323000077">Beer is part of Britain, and it is most popular among lower and middle income groups. Interestingly, people with manual or routine jobs drink less overall, but they drink 50 per cent. more beer than the managerial classes, and the figure is even higher for cider. The impact of the big duty rises has been felt in urban constituencies, but not as much as in the rural or suburban communities where pubs are more integral. That struck me most clearly a fortnight ago in the village of All Cannings outside Devizes. The King&#146;s Arms is the village&#146;s main amenity and it is in good health, but many other pubs are not. We need to be aware of that.</p>

It also caused big problems elsewhere, costing businesses a huge amount when making the necessary changes to prices. Industry sources estimate that the changes in autumn&#151;both the VAT cut and the duty changes in the PBR&#151;cost every pub or bar an average of &#163;570, which does not take into account any management or staff time involved.

Given the decline in alcohol consumption in this country since 2004, there is some evidence, albeit perhaps not conclusive, that that point has been reached. The hon.

That was most apparent in the pre-Budget report. Now, of course, Ministers claim that the increases in duty were offset by the cut in VAT. I will examine that claim in a moment, although hon. Members who remember the backtracking on whisky will already be sceptical.</p>

I have met wine producers and importers who, safe&#151;or so they thought&#151;in the knowledge that the Government had introduced a duty escalator to enable long-term decision making, had entered into contracts to supply wine to supermarkets and others at a set price. Producers&#146; and importers&#146; margins are so tight that every bottle they produced after the PBR was produced at a loss until the contracts expired months later, as they had not factored in the additional rise in duty in the PBR. As they were the ones who paid duty, they suffered. Meanwhile, they watched the retailers whom they were supplying charge less VAT, but not always a lower price.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="90512-0023.htm_para16"><a name="09051324000003">The Minister will understand that the claim that the duty increase for producers was offset is held in utter contempt in the industry. We have seen time and again that the Government&#146;s failure to consult, and their rush to implement duty changes, produced problems they did not foresee. To promise the industry a three-year horizon of stability, and then provide less than a week&#146;s notice of a major change only six months later, perhaps marks a new low in the Government&#146;s miserable record. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="90512-0023.htm_para17"><a name="09051324000004">The VAT cut offset was hardly that, anyway. The PBR suggested that the changes would leave the total VAT and duty on products &#147;broadly unchanged&#148;. I suppose that that depends on how broadly one defines the word &#147;broadly&#148;, but the whisky increases proved too broad for even Labour&#146;s tradition of semantic hair-splitting to spin away. The proposed rise of 8 per cent. in duty on spirits in the PBR had to be cut to 4 per cent. when the Government were forced to admit that they  <br>

had got their sums wrong. The Scotch Whisky Association, in particular, showed that the rise would have added 47p to a &#163;20 bottle of whisky. The muddle on wine duties that occurred at the same time was never resolved. The increase in duty was supposed to offset the decline in VAT. For wine, that was true only of bottles priced at &#163;6.07 or more, and 92 per cent. of bottles sold in the retail trade are priced at less than &#163;6. That meant that under the PBR, four out of five shoppers ended up paying more for their wine as a result of the duty changes and VAT changes combined. The position was not at all neutral for wine buyers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="90512-0023.htm_para18"><a name="09051324000005">The Government claimed that when they introduced the alcohol duty escalator, it would bring certainty about future duty rises. After the PBR blunder, this year&#146;s Budget has actually added to that uncertainty. Traditionally, the indexation element of any duty rise was linked to the retail prices index that prevailed in the September before the Budget. This year&#146;s increase applies the RPI forecast for the September following the Budget. Clearly, that dampens the rise in duty in this instance, but it would be helpful to know whether the Government see that as a permanent change in their methodology; if it is not, the promised certainty on those duties has been eroded yet further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="90512-0023.htm_para19"><a name="09051324000006">The uncertainty reached in the industry in the past year beggars belief; there have been hefty duty increases in two Budgets and in the intervening PBR, as well as the introduction of an escalator and a change in the RPI date used for its calculation. That totally throws out the whole certainty argument, which was introduced a year ago along with the escalator. The uncertainty wreaks havoc with pricing, contracts and overhead costs, not to mention the administrative costs of implementing the price changes such as those due on new year&#146;s eve. If duty is not put back down when VAT returns to 17.5 per cent., the industry will take another hit. If the escalator is 2 per cent. per annum, why is the industry in practice facing a total rise of 4.5 per cent. in this financial year? That is a critical question that Ministers must answer tonight. At the moment, Labour&#146;s escalator appears to contain no certainty whatsoever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="90512-0023.htm_para20"><a name="09051324000007">We need to look at what the purpose of alcohol tax is in the first place. After the pre-Budget report, the Exchequer Secretary said in a debate in Committee in January, when these duties were last raised, that taxation was a very blunt instrument with which to deal with a minority of drinkers and that in her view tax did not have a major role to play. She meant to attack Conservative policy, but we believe that the blanket duty increases have far less impact on health than targeted measures directed at problem drinks and problem drinkers. Her comments were also rather at odds with those of her colleagues in the Department of Health on duty. The Minister of State, Department of Health, the right hon.

 The hon. Gentleman is right to raise that interesting question. We still have the policy that we had last year. However, the calculation this year would be different. A revenue-neutral position looking at different percentages of beer would not be the same this year because of the background changes in the overall beer pricing regime.

Under those increases, problem and non-problem drinks alike went up in price. Since the last Budget, tax on beer has gone up by 8p a pint and tax on wine by 28p a bottle. It is worth pointing out that almost all wine consumed in this country is imported, so Labour&#146;s devaluation has added a 30 to 35 per cent. premium on top of that. Meanwhile, duty on a bottle of spirits has risen by about 47p on average.</p>

to reduce duties on lower-strength alternatives elsewhere. We should look at what has happened in Australia and Germany, where such approaches have been used to good effect. The Government should seriously consider introducing such reforms here, instead of using health concerns as a cover for a blanket tax rise for responsible drinkers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="90512-0024.htm_para6"><a name="09051324000028">There has been some controversy in this country about the German experiment on higher duty rates on alcopops, introduced on 1 July 2004. Like this country, Germany had a real problem with alcopops among teens. Those relatively high-strength drinks were particularly prone to getting youths drunk quickly; the sweet flavours camouflaged the high and bitter alcohol content. Many have said that the tax increases that the Germans introduced did not work, as youths simply switched to other forms of alcohol.</p>

I also studied the reports of the Bundeszentrale f1/4r gesundheitliche Aufklrung, the federal institute of health information, and the federal Government&#146;s own report about the effects of the alcopop tax law on the consumption of alcohol by youths aged 18 and about the market development of alcopops and similar drinks.

Labour Members&#146; criticisms of the changes during the debates on last year&#146;s Finance Bill were partly correct. There was a switch from alcopops to mixed drinks based on beer and wine, but let us look at the figures in terms of pure alcohol drunk. In the year following the alcopop tax rise, wine and beer-based drinks consumption by those aged 12 to 17 rose from 3.9 g per person per week to 5.3 g as a result. By contrast, there was a staggering fall in consumption of spirits-based drinks from 8.5 g per person per week to only 2.2 g. In other words, spirits-based consumption quartered, while wine and beer-based consumption went up by only 35 per cent. In terms of pure alcohol consumed, there was a net change from 12.4 g per week to just 7.5 g. Under the German tax change overall, alcohol consumption by those aged 12 to 17&#151;a very important part of the population whom we do not want to have drinking in general&#151;fell by some 40 per cent., which is a huge success.</p>

If duty is being imposed for health reasons, it should be based on units of alcohol, so duty on spirits should come down and duty on beers and wines should go up. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that spirits should be taxed more highly than beers and wines?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point. In general, as I have said, we are in favour of lower duty on lower-alcohol drinks. I do not want to get into more specifics about spirits.</p>

<p><a name="st_o511"><a name="09051324000038"><a name="90512-0024.htm_spnew15"><a name="09051324000063"><b>Stewart Hosie:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is conflating two different issues. The first is duty, and amendment 12 calls for the Government to assess what duty level would be required to have fair pricing based on alcohol content only. The second is minimum pricing, which is a retail issue designed to tackle binge drinking and antisocial behaviour. The two things are completely separate. We are talking about alcohol duty, which is what the amendment is about. Minimum pricing is completely unrelated.</p>

 I understand what the hon. Gentleman says, but it is still my understanding that if price and duty are kept frozen on whisky, they have to be raised on other drinks. I appreciate that he has a different view.</p>

We will therefore abstain if amendment 10 is put to the vote. Secondly, we believe that the pub and drinks industry is in some degree of trouble, thanks in part to various measures introduced by this Labour Government, duty being one of them. Thirdly, we believe that alcohol price, and therefore duty, can have an influence on drinking behaviour. It is clearly not the only influence, but duty and price can play a role in combating some of the negative  <br>

 We have had a debate that has been a bit like shadow-boxing, on amendments 10 and 12, which were tabled by the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party respectively. At least they had the courage to get their amendments on the Order Paper. We then had an extremely long peroration from the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands), who dealt with all the amendments at great length. He thereby proved that amendment 10, which is about doing research, is erroneous, because as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) pointed out, as a lot of the research already exists. The hon. Gentleman then said, after all that, that he would be abstaining.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="90512-0024.htm_para13"><a name="09051325000004">Amendment 10 would require the Government to produce a report on the impact of increases in alcohol duty on licensed premises and on employment in the alcohol sector. The Government do not support the amendment. One reason, which has been demonstrated at great length tonight, is that there is plenty of such information already available. As with all tax decisions, the Government will monitor the impact of alcohol duty changes, including on the industry.</p>

 Does the Exchequer Secretary believe that it is impossible to produce the sort of report that the amendment recommends because of the scope of the research? Leaving aside the argument about whether it is possible to distil the research and make it intelligible to Members, there must be Treasury modelling about the impact of changes in duty, specifically on employment and the other matters that the amendment covers. Will she make that modelling available to hon. Members by placing it in the Library?</p>

 Why does the Exchequer Secretary think that pub closures have increased so much in recent months?</p>

 There are many reasons why particular pubs might close. Some businesses were possibly never viable and we are also in the middle of difficult trading conditions, as the right hon. Gentleman pointed out. We cannot assume that alcohol excise duties have a direct relationship to the pub closures, as some have argued.</p>

<p><a name="st_o522"><a name="09051325000014"><a name="90512-0024.htm_spnew26"><a name="09051325000385"><b>Mr. Lindsay Hoyle (Chorley) (Lab):</b>
 Is it not fair to say that many pubs are in trouble because of pub companies charging high rents and because they are tied to buying the beer through those companies? The 2p can make a difference, but the real reason is the prices that the pub companies charge.</p>

<p><a name="st_o523"><a name="09051325000015"><a name="90512-0024.htm_spnew27"><a name="09051325000386"><b>Angela Eagle:</b>
 My hon. Friend is a distinguished member of the Select Committee on Business and Enterprise, and a report on the subject is due soon. I look forward to reading it. Clearly, the tie is important and it has been brought to our attention in much of the evidence that we have taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="90512-0024.htm_para17"><a name="09051325000016">The measures that we have introduced to support all businesses also support the British pub. They include enabling pubs to spread payment of this year&#146;s inflation uprating to business rates over three years. The business payment support service has already allowed 116,000 businesses to defer more than &#163;2 billion of tax, and that has benefited many pubs. There is improved access to finance for small businesses through the enterprise finance guarantee, which is now available for the first time to tied pubs. There is also support through low cost loans and advice on energy efficiency for small businesses, including many pubs, in order to make savings on their energy bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="90512-0024.htm_para18"><a name="09051325000017">There was much talk of the balance between the on and the off trade in the debate. Many hon. Members know that we cannot charge a different rate of excise duty for the same product if it is sold in a different context. We cannot discriminate by setting a lower duty for pubs than for supermarkets. When alcohol excise rates increase, pubs often put up their prices by 5p. The duty increases are 1p extra on beer this time round, yet the prices in many places are going up by 5p. That exacerbates the difference between the on and the off price of beer and causes difficulty.</p>

He did not seem to know that the national average cost of a pint is &#163;2.51. One can get a pint for &#163;3.20 at the &#147;Westminster Arms&#148; over the road, but the right hon.

Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) in respect of his amendment 12. Amendment 12 seeks to require the Government, before the 2009 pre-Budget report, to publish anticipated yields from alcohol duty and the estimated levels of duty, based on alcohol content, that would need to be levied to maintain that yield. Estimates from the pre-Budget report are available. In 2008-09, spirit duty is estimated to raise &#163;2.4 billion, wine &#163;2.7 billion and beer and cider combined &#163;3.4 billion. Many spirit products produced in the UK are exported and are therefore not subject to UK excise duty. For example, more than 90 per cent. of Scotch whisky is exported, and the level of Scotch whisky exports grew by 8 per cent. in 2008.</p>

 I am grateful to the Exchequer Secretary. She mentioned exports, but the unfairness of the British duty system, whereby spirits are taxed at a higher rate per unit of alcohol than wines are, means that when we complain about other countries unfairly discriminating against whisky in favour of their local brew, they can point to our unfair system. Why, therefore, can we not continue with the system that was in place when the Prime Minister was Chancellor, under which spirits duty was frozen?</p>

 We thought that, for fairness, it was right to have 2 per cent. across the board this time round, although I note that 90 per cent. of Scotch whisky is exported and that the level of Scotch whisky exports grew by 8 per cent. last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="90512-0025.htm_para1"><a name="09051325000025">European rules apply duty in direct proportion to alcohol content for beer and spirits, but the rules do not allow the same application to wine and cider, which accounts for some of the disparities that the right hon.

After all, it is well past closing time&#151;or at least the old-style 11 pm closing time. However, we must at least briefly examine the devastating impact of the Government&#146;s approach to pubs, breweries and other industries across the UK.

remote communities where alternative employment can often be difficult to find.

 My hon. Friend is making an important point. In my area and other parts of north-east Scotland, new distilleries are proposed, but they may be prevented from going ahead by this increase. The issue is not only losses to the Exchequer, but a threat to jobs at a time when unemployment is reaching record levels. This is a serious issue and if the Government really cared about jobs and employment, they would not be destroying jobs in one of our most important industries.</p>

illogical aspect of the present system is that spirits are taxed far more heavily per unit of alcohol that beers or wines. If alcohol were taxed on health grounds, surely the only logical way to tax it would be based on the units. The present Prime Minister, when he was Chancellor, had the policy of freezing the duty on spirits and allowing that on beers and wines to catch up. I am disappointed that that policy has not continued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="90512-0026.htm_para1"><a name="09051326000340">Various studies over the years have shown that the sale of spirits is very sensitive to price&#151;far more so than is the case with wine. A policy of reducing the tax on spirits and increasing that on wine to a comparable level would probably bring in more money for the Treasury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="90512-0026.htm_para2"><a name="09051326000341">Scotch whisky is the world&#146;s leading spirit drink. It can be produced only in Scotland, but it relies heavily on products produced throughout the whole of the UK. It is therefore bizarre that a product that is so important to the UK economy is taxed much more heavily than wines, most of which are imported. I doubt that any other country in the world discriminates against one of its own products in favour of imports in such a way. An unfortunate side effect of that is that it encourages other countries to impose unfair duties on Scotch whisky.</p>

<p><a name="st_o545"><a name="09051326000342"><a name="90512-0026.htm_spnew8"><a name="09051326000685"><b>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cotswold) (Con):</b>
 On a day when manufacturing trade has reduced by 0.1 per cent., the largest reduction since records began in 1948, is it not folly to be increasing the duty on whisky to such an extent when it is one of our key export industries? We rely on it and other key exports to get us out of recession and to create jobs.</p>

<p><a name="st_o546"><a name="09051326000343"><a name="90512-0026.htm_spnew9"><a name="09051326000686"><b>Mr. Reid:</b>
 I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. He makes an important point. Whisky is an important export and, as I was saying, increasing the duty in this country encourages other countries also to discriminate against Scotch whisky. That means that when British trade negotiators protest about others countries&#146; harsh treatment of the Scotch whisky industry, those countries have an easy riposte&#151;they just say, &#147;But your own country also discriminates against whisky.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="90512-0026.htm_para3"><a name="09051326000344">The Scotch whisky industry is very important to the entire economy. It employs more than 10,000 people directly and supports an estimated 50,000 further jobs through its spending on input products. It also provides a significant boost to our balance of trade. It is also an important local employer in remote areas where alternative employment is hard to find. For example, the many excellent malts produced in my constituency on the islands of Islay, Jura and Mull provide local employment. It would be very hard to find alternative jobs on those islands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="90512-0026.htm_para4"><a name="09051326000345">As a result of the Government&#146;s punitive actions, the product produced on those islands brings in large sums for the Treasury but only a small fraction of that money is returned to the islands to be spent on public services. If any hon. Members want to spend their holiday on Mull, they will certainly see the disgraceful state of the roads, although they will also see beautiful scenery. Those islands produced great revenue for the Treasury, but they do not see the return in public services.</p>

 Order. I am loth to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but we covered much of that ground earlier in the debate, when I do not think he was in the Chamber. He has probably given the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) enough to work on for the time being.</p>

<p><a name="st_o549"><a name="09051326000348"><a name="90512-0026.htm_spnew11"><a name="09051326000689"><b>Mr. Reid:</b>
 The price of whisky is going up, mainly because the Government keep on putting the duty up higher than the rate of inflation. We saw it in last year&#146;s Budget and back in December, and we are now seeing it again. A successful industry such as the Scotch whisky industry should be encouraged, not penalised by constant rises in duty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="90512-0026.htm_para5"><a name="09051326000349">The Government put forward two arguments for the duty increases&#151;health and the tax yield. However, if health was the reason, the tax per unit of alcohol would be the same for all beverages, with the result that the tax on whisky would come down and that on beers and wines would go up. As for the tax yield argument, there is a severe danger that increasing the duty will lead to a lower yield because of consumer resistance to buying at the higher price.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="90512-0026.htm_para6"><a name="09051326000350">The constant rises are likely to have a devastating effect on employment in the industry, so I urge the Committee to reject them tonight.</p>

 In the preceding debate, it was very disappointing that the Minister was unable to explain how clause 11 will work in terms of the duty rates, or what consequences she thought the changes would have for jobs and enterprise in the important businesses and sectors involved. She was also unable to give a forecast of how much more damage would be done. She was not even able to say what she thought was the cause of the big escalation in the number of pub closures in recent months, and she does not seem to have much idea of the impact that the measure will have on business in general.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="90512-0026.htm_para7"><a name="09051326000352">I am delighted that my Front-Bench team are inviting Conservative Members to vote against the duty measures tonight. If the Government had not spent so much on the banks, or if they were able to control their public spending better, they might not need to raise so much revenue in this rather clumsy way. This change is not the way to get businesses through or out of a recession, but it is deeply damaging to enterprise and prospects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="90512-0026.htm_para8"><a name="09051326000353">Some Labour Members have failed to speak up for their constituents at all, while others have treated it as a subject of some frivolity because it involves drinking. All of them should understand that many people in the business are hurting very badly, and that they are looking to the Government for help and a lead. However, we are seeing again tonight that absolutely no help is forthcoming.</p>

 I shall be brief, and my contribution will be along the lines of that made by the right hon. Member for Wokingham. Like all hon. Members, I have received a great many representations on this matter from individuals, pub landlords and brewers in my constituency. They have all made it very clear that they consider that increase in duty over and above the rate of inflation proposed in this clause will be detrimental to their businesses.</p>

What is more, it is having a considerable social impact on communities in towns, cities and villages right across the country.</p>

 Order. Again, I am not anxious to curtail debate, but I must explain that we are not now going over the amendments that we have had before. With great respect to the hon. Gentleman, he is in danger of doing that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o553"><a name="09051327000015"><a name="90512-0026.htm_spnew14"><a name="09051327000418"><b>Mr. Browne:</b>
 Thank you, Sir Michael. The amendment is widely drawn and there is scope for overlap, but I was seeking to bring my remarks to a close. The essential point is that the clause will raise revenue on producers, manufacturers and brewers of alcohol. That will damage both them and communities in all our constituencies. I hope that hon. Members of all parties will represent the interests of their constituents by voting against the Government on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="st_o554"><a name="09051327000016"><a name="90512-0026.htm_spnew15"><a name="09051327000419"><b>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</b>
 I declare an interest as chairman of the all-party wine group. Our group carried out a study of the effect of the Government&#146;s proposed duty increases and the escalator. Our conclusion was that jobs and investment would be lost and that revenues would reduce over time, not meet the Government&#146;s revenue targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="90512-0026.htm_para10"><a name="09051327000017">Whether we are talking about the increase in duty on wine, whisky or beer, we have to recognise that we live in an increasingly international world. Hong Kong, by reducing its duty to zero, is taking from London the market in wine&#151;selling and cellaring&#151;that has been here for centuries. The Government are doing themselves huge damage with the duty increases. They are reducing investment in the industries affected, reducing the number of jobs and reducing the tax take they receive because they are reducing consumption of wine and whisky. On every count, the measures are counter-productive.</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes a good point. What the Government are doing makes no sense. If it increases unemployment, reduces investment, reduces consumption and therefore the tax take, what on earth is the point of increasing duties well above the rate of inflation? I shall oppose the clause.</p>

 On 8 August 2006, 25-year-old Toby Tweddell set off to work along the M62 near Liverpool. On the way, a lorry ploughed into his car, and as a result of the accident Toby died. The lives of his family and friends were devastated: his fianc&#233;e Jenny, parents Monica and Nic, his uncle, my constituent Seb Schmoller, and many others. It was a dreadful day, too, for Colin Wrighton, the lorry driver who killed Toby. He had fallen asleep at the wheel of his vehicle, which crashed into a line of cars. Colin Wrighton had seen his doctor just five months earlier complaining of tiredness. Tests to find out whether he was diabetic returned negative, and he was told he was probably suffering from stress.<i> </i>The medical profession&#146;s failure to diagnose sleep apnoea and refer Colin Wrighton to a consultant in sleep medicine meant that he has had to come to terms with the awful result of the accident that he caused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="90512-0027.htm_para10"><a name="09051327000354">Toby Tweddell&#146;s family were left asking questions, such as whether it was a freak accident or something more common. They asked questions about why drivers fall asleep at the wheel, about sleep apnoea and about why this relatively common condition is so poorly diagnosed, leaving road users at risk of injury and death. The family discovered that in the four months from October 2007, at least four cases came before UK courts of drivers of large goods vehicles accused of causing death by dangerous driving. The incidents killed nine people. All four LGV drivers were suffering from sleep apnoea, but that was diagnosed only after these terrible accidents. The family&#146;s research has led them to conclude that there is a systemic failure to take sleep apnoea and its consequences seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="90512-0027.htm_para11"><a name="09051327000355">Sleep apnoea is a sleep disorder in which the upper airway repeatedly closes, causing people to wake up briefly in order to breathe. People with sleep apnoea wake many times an hour; their pattern of sleep is disrupted, leading to tiredness and sleepiness during the day. Research has shown that someone deprived of sleep has the same impairment of reaction time and judgment as someone who is over the drink-drive limit. One study calculated that people with severe sleep apnoea are between six and 15 times more likely to be involved in a road traffic accident.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="90512-0027.htm_para12"><a name="09051327000356">Sleep apnoea is also highly correlated with being overweight. The lifestyle of lorry drivers means that many are significantly overweight&#151;they lead a sedentary lifestyle, keep unsocial hours and have unhealthy diets. A study of lorry drivers showed that only 11 per cent. had a body mass index of less than 25, that just over 38 per cent. had body mass indexes of between 25 and 30, which is considered to be overweight, and that 50 per cent. had body mass indexes of more than 30, which is considered to be obese.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="90512-0027.htm_para13"><a name="09051327000357">Britain&#146;s leading sleep experts believe that nearly one in six lorry drivers may have sleep apnoea&#151;that is nearly 80,000 of the nearly 500,000 LGV drivers. Sufferers from sleep apnoea tend to under-report difficulties when driving, perhaps for fear of losing their licence and livelihood. Identification of sleep apnoea is now relatively  <br>

easy. Sufferers are provided with a continuous positive airway pressure machine, or CPAP. A mask that blows air into the airways is placed over the nose during sleep. Sufferers breathe normally, but the slightly higher pressure of air in the nose helps keep the upper airway open. Almost all drivers suffering from the condition can be back at work very soon after obtaining effective treatment. Successful treatment improves their quality of life as well as that of their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="90512-0027.htm_para14"><a name="09051327000358">Following the inquest into the death of Toby Tweddell, Coroner Sumner took the unusual step of issuing a rule 43 report to the Lord Chancellor&#146;s Department.

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="90512-0027.htm_para18"><a name="09051327000362">The Department for Transport responded to the coroner&#146;s request in November 2008, arguing that current arrangements for the control of sleep apnoea are adequate.

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="90512-0027.htm_para23"><a name="09051327000368">Those questions do not adequately identify sleep apnoea sufferers. The DVLA should look again at how these forms can identify that there may be a possible diagnosis of sleep apnoea. One option would be a requirement that the driver&#146;s body mass index be calculated and for the doctor&#146;s attention be directed to the higher incidence of sleep apnoea among obese people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="90512-0027.htm_para24"><a name="09051327000369">While some major businesses in road and passenger transport take sleep apnoea seriously, I am not aware of any example of a company routinely testing its drivers. I have been working with my constituent, Seb Schmoller, and sleep disorder experts to set up a trial with a responsible employer to screen and test their employees. Discussions are at an advanced stage with the Co-operative Group. I am convinced that this process will demonstrate the value of screening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="90512-0027.htm_para25"><a name="09051327000370">The Department for Transport needs to tighten the requirements for identifying potential sufferers of sleep apnoea through requiring regular screening of public service vehicle and large goods vehicle drivers as part of the licensing process. Furthermore, it should be a requirement on road haulage and passenger transport operators for them to have screening processes in place. The Department for Work and Pensions, in dialogue with the Health and Safety Commission, has to ensure that the Health and Safety Executive plays a much more prominent role in relation to work-related fatal road traffic accidents and their prevention. It has responsibilities for minimising work-related death and injury, and powers to insist on action by employers to prevent risks to non-employees&#151;that is, road users at risk from drivers suffering from sleep apnoea. In particular, the HSE should consider whether there is a need to introduce legislation, if necessary on a European basis, on compulsory testing of professional drivers for sleep apnoea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="90512-0027.htm_para26"><a name="09051327000371">Employers have duties to those other than their employees, as stated in the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. Section 3(1) says:</p>
<a name="90512-0027.htm_brev13"><a name="09051327000410"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It shall be the duty of every employer to conduct his undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not in his employment who may be affected thereby are not thereby exposed to risks to their health or safety.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="90512-0027.htm_para27"><a name="09051327000372">The Department of Health also needs to ensure that those involved in the diagnosis of sleep apnoea are well briefed about the problem, its symptoms, and its serious implications. Consideration should therefore be given to making it a responsibility of doctors to report their diagnosis to the DVLA, rather than that being solely the responsibility of the driver.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="90512-0027.htm_para28"><a name="09051327000373">I know the Minister believes that the incidence of road traffic accidents caused by sleep apnoea is low. The Metropolitan police has told me that it believes that more accidents have been caused by sleep problems than have currently been identified. The introduction of post-accident assessment&#151;a system of fast-tracking drivers involved in serious road traffic accidents to assessment of the possibility of their having sleep apnoea&#151;would assist in getting more accurate data.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="90512-0027.htm_para29"><a name="09051327000374">Before I finish, I pay tribute to all the people who are working hard to address this worrying situation: Toby&#146;s fianc&#233;e Jenny, and his family, Nic, Monica and Seb; Professor Jim Horne and Louise Reyner from the sleep research centre at Loughborough University; Dr. John Shneerson, from Papworth hospital; Dr. Dev Banerjee from Birmingham Heartlands hospital; Dr. Stephen  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="90512-0027.htm_para34"><a name="09051327000380">We at the Department for Transport are very concerned about the contribution of driver tiredness to casualties on our roads. Our research suggests that up to one fifth of crashes on motorways and other main roads may be caused by drivers falling asleep at the wheel. Driver sleepiness could be caused by modern lifestyles preventing people from getting enough rest, and aggravated by shift working, especially when combined with monotonous types of driving. Besides a lack of adequate rest, some medical conditions may cause drowsiness and increase any normal tendency to sleepiness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="90512-0027.htm_para35"><a name="09051327000381">The usual medical cause for excessive sleepiness, however, is obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, which occurs most commonly, but not exclusively, in overweight individuals.

All drivers must, by law, inform the DVLA if they develop a medical condition, including a sleep disorder, which may affect their ability to drive safely. Medical inquiries are then undertaken to establish whether those drivers should retain their licences. If the condition is diagnosed, effective treatment is available, as described by my hon. Friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="90512-0027.htm_para37"><a name="09051327000383">Drivers should be reassured that they will normally be allowed to continue driving, once satisfactory control of the condition is achieved. I emphasise that, generally, satisfactory control can be achieved very quickly. In only a week or two of treatment, most people comment on how much better and more refreshed they feel.</p>

Friend&#146;s specific question, I assure her that the DVLA is looking at making its guidance notes for doctors more explicit to highlight the importance of sleep apnoea. However, the DVLA must have reasonable grounds for believing that somebody is suffering from a relevant disability. It cannot initiate medical investigations of fitness to drive unless there are reasonable grounds for believing that there is a relevant disability. The DVLA cannot screen for undiagnosed conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="90512-0027.htm_para39"><a name="09051327000385">Investigation of symptoms, diagnosis and treatment are matters for a doctor. As in the case that we are considering, there are, unfortunately, individuals whose symptoms have not been recognised, and have therefore not been treated. Some drivers also press on when they feel tired and unwell. We aim to manage the problem by improving the range of information to drivers, and especially to the medical profession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="90512-0027.htm_para40"><a name="09051327000386">There are circumstances in which doctors can inform the DVLA of any concerns, and they have a professional obligation to report a driver who is still driving against medical advice. The DVLA publication, &#147;At a Glance Guide to the Current Medical Standards of Fitness to Drive&#148;, includes a section on sleep disorders, specifically mentioning sleep apnoea. The Department&#146;s publication, &#147;Fitness to Drive: a guide for health professionals&#148;, also includes a chapter on sleep disorders.</p>

In response to my hon. Friend&#146;s question, the Department also attends the Health and Safety Executive&#146;s road distribution action group&#146;s sub-group on fatigue. We are working with the HSE, unions and employers on the extent of fatigue generally among commercial vehicle drivers, and on how to address it with employers and drivers. That includes writing articles for industry journals.</p>

It provides an &#147;At a Glance Guide&#148;, which is aimed at medical professionals but is also available to the general public. The DVLA&#146;s animated message in its local offices specifically suggests that individuals mention OSA when seeking medical advice. The DVLA&#146;s senior medical adviser is in close contact with the British Sleep Society about OSA and other sleep disorders and driving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o514"><a name="90512-0028.htm_para3"><a name="09051327000391">There is already a system whereby the police can notify the DVLA when they suspect that a medical condition of any kind is relevant to a driving-related incident. Some 3,500 such reports are made annually, covering a range of medical conditions. Those reports are treated as a high priority and are always investigated.  <br>

Most relate to ordinary and not commercial licence holders. The Department is trying to improve the police notification system further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o515"><a name="90512-0028.htm_para4"><a name="09051327000392">In conclusion, I appreciate the Tweddell family&#146;s concern that their son was tragically lost in spite of all the measures that we have in place and the fact that they would want to improve them. I can assure the House that we keep under constant consideration the various practical ways in which we can ensure that road safety is not compromised by people who are not fit to drive. The House knows that reducing the casualty toll on our roads is a priority. Our current strategy has improved road safety significantly, reducing the numbers of deaths and serious injuries by 36 per cent. over the past decade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o516"><a name="90512-0028.htm_para5"><a name="09051327000393">But eight deaths a day is still appalling. It is too many and we need to make our roads safer still. &#147;A Safer Way&#148;, the consultation document that was launched last month, proposes a new approach to road safety, ambitious new casualty reduction targets and a number of new measures to assist in achieving those targets. It also proposes a long-term vision to make Britain&#146;s roads the safest in the world once again. I encourage all those who are interested in road safety to read the document and to join in the debate. I also look forward to meeting my hon. Friend and her colleagues in due course.</p>
