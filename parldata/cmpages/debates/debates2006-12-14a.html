He is absolutely right that the Government, business and individuals cannot crack the problem acting on their own. The Government have to take a lead, not least by getting their own house in order. Business must make a contribution, and there is now cross-party support for the fact that nearly half the country&#146;s greenhouse gas emissions are covered by the European Union emissions trading scheme, which is a positive development. Individuals can play an important part, too, and that is why I have led the debate about personal carbon allowances and so-called carbon credit cards, which could help individuals to see how they can make a contribution that will help the environment and themselves.</p>

It is a shame that the hon. Member for Calder Valley has left the Chamber, as she asked a rather good supplementary question, and I was disappointed by the Secretary of State&#146;s reply. We want to be helpful to the Government in moving towards a low-carbon economy, and we want him to be ambitious. Perhaps I should clarify: we know that he is ambitious, but we want him to be ambitious about climate change. Why will he not reconsider his opposition to including annual targets for cutting carbon in the climate change Bill?</p>

Far from committing the Conservative party to annual targets, it said that they did not make sense and proposed targets for five years or longer. In that Bill, the Conservatives avoided a reference to annual targets. The hon. Gentleman says that he is a great advocate of annual targets. However, in various interviews, he has said that there should be not rigid annual targets but a rolling programme of targets, so he does not even believe it himself.</p>

I know that the Secretary of State is keen to play catch-up on the environment, and here is a fantastic opportunity to catch up with annual targets or be left behind and continue to be as ineffective as the Chancellor clearly wants him to be.</p>

When the international community considered targets in the late 1990s, it specifically rejected annual targets on the grounds that five-year budgets were a far more effective way of recognising the differences that can arise year on year. I remind the hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) that he had a good opportunity, when he presented his much trumpeted Bill in November, to include measures that favoured annual targets, but he refused to do so. As the Prime Minister showed during the Queen&#146;s Speech debate, at that time there were four different Conservative positions on annual targets. Last week&#151;</p>

It is significant that the Kyoto protocol opted for five-year targets in carbon budgets, and the European emissions trading scheme, too, uses that measure. The attempt to create a division where there is none is not sensible. I was not able to finish my reply to the hon.

A maintenance safety backlog was cleared to the tune of &#163;42 million, and there was a maintenance backlog of &#163;280 million that we have brought back down to &#163;119 million. That is the extent of the investment that the Government have put in. There have been impacts on other Departments&#146; priorities&#151;I mentioned the Olympics earlier. That will continue.

It is not the case that British Waterways has borne the brunt of the reallocation of &#163;200 million in the Department. The in-year cut, which is only to the grant-in-aid, not the organisation&#146;s total income, is 6.6 per cent. If he considers that as part of the total income, he will realise that the figure is just over 1.5 per cent. of the organisation&#146;s budget. The reallocation was felt throughout DEFRA, and other organisations, which do not have the same resources and capacity to attract external funding, had in-year cuts of 10 per cent. and more. To say that British Waterways bore the brunt is wrong. I understand the tremendous support that British Waterways enjoys because of its regeneration work throughout the country. We have shown that we value it through our investment. I stress again that we have invested &#163;524 million in it since we have been in office.</p>

However, the statement that I made on 7 November was clear about the timetable for improvements and the way in which we would use the partial payment mechanism from mid-February for the cases that were not receiving full payments. The most important thing that he can say to his constituents is that the new chief executive of the RPA, about whom I expressed confidence in my statements in the summer, is getting a grip of the organisation, is determined to put it on track and, above all, is determined to make sure that we do not make promises that we cannot deliver.

The Secretary of State mentioned the governance of the RPA, so will he reflect on the proposal that I made about four years ago that the organisation should be customer-led in its processing activity, as opposed to being part of a civil service function as it is now?</p>

Some of those rules have been put in place in quite a detailed way to ensure that, right around Europe, payments are only made on a satisfactory basis. There is a balance to be struck between the sort of regulations by which we want other countries to have to abide in making such payments, and our own confidence that light-touch regulation is needed here.

I am sure that the Secretary of State knows, however, that neither the Commission nor the European Parliament can stop it, so he will get his voluntary modulation. In that light, and on the assumption that he knows by now how much money he will get from the Chancellor, can he explain why he has not yet submitted his rural development plan to the Commission?

The ideas being developed were first trailed in the energy review and we continue to discuss them.

We are following the issues in York and its surroundings carefully. The most important thing that we can do is to ensure that the demand side has a clear bias towards biofuels and other such products. For example, the initiative in respect of the road transport fuel obligation&#151;including the guarantee on 5 per cent. of forecourt sales being from biofuels by 2008, with an aim of doubling that figure&#151;is the sort of signal that we can best give to ensure that we get the right pull through on those important new technologies.</p>

deficits in NHS trusts were the result of poor financial management locally. Yet the Health Committee report on NHS deficits, which was issued earlier this week, makes it clear that some of the blame lies at the centre. It said:</p>

Another example, which is also quoted in the press release, is a question to ask the Secretary of State how many suicides have taken place among deployed UK personnel in Iraq, Afghanistan and so on. That answer is also given. It looks as though included in the 1,000 questions are a number of questions that were withdrawn before the due date for answer, quite a large number that were transferred to other Departments and then answered, quite a number that, consistent with the policy of all previous Governments, were grouped for answer with other questions, and quite a number of questions that were answered, but were not updated on the database.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="61214-0004.htm_para15"><a name="06121474000184">I also notice not quite a claim, but an insinuation in the press notice that the information came from &#147;the independent&#148; House of Commons Library. In fact, it came from researchers in the right hon. Lady&#146;s office trying to make use of the database of the House of Commons Library and failing lamentably in that endeavour. All that I can say is that we have been generous to a fault with the Opposition. The amount of money that we have ensured should be paid to the Opposition has gone up from &#163;1 million or so when we were in opposition to over &#163;6 million&#151;and this is the result of that investment. If ever there was a part of British civic society showing a failure in terms of value for money it is the Opposition research departments and the kind of people who work for the right hon. Lady.</p>

She asked about the important report on NHS deficits. I do not doubt that it will, in due course, be the subject of debate, either on the Floor of the House or in Westminster Hall. That is a matter for the Liaison Committee to determine. I will just point out that report says:</p>
<a name="61214-0004.htm_brev6"><a name="06121474001001"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Poor local management is also to blame. For all the added costs imposed by the Department of Health, it is undeniable that the NHS has had a lot more money to spend. Surpluses can be found in PCTs and trusts with a low per capita funding. Deficits exist in trusts with a high per capita funding.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="61214-0004.htm_para17"><a name="06121474000186">The right hon. Lady went on to ask me two other things. One was about corrections. Ministers are always assiduous in ensuring that corrections are made. If she wants to know why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence took time to issue a correction, as he did yesterday in a letter to you, Mr. Speaker, which has been made available to Members on both sides of the House, it is because&#151;I know this because I have also gone into it in detail&#151;the changeover in the separation allowance for the armed forces, which was begun three years ago and approved by the Armed Forces Pay Review Body, was immensely complicated. There were, with the same pot of money, some winners and losers. The briefing was that even for those who had lost out&#151;those who had experienced a reduction in separation allowance&#151;the bonus payments would more than offset that. That was overwhelmingly true, but it was not the case for some examples that took a long time to come through. When my right hon. Friend made the original announcement about the bonus, he was wholly unaware&#151;he had good reasons for this&#151;of changes to the separation allowance.</p>

However, I say to him and to the House that what we need in relation to change in the Post Office is a grown-up debate on the fact that there have been changes, not caused by anyone in the House or directly by anyone outside, but resulting from the internet, which have dramatically changed the use made of the Post Office. The hon.

I am today publishing the Government&#146;s proposals in a consultation document, copies of which will be available in the Vote Office in the usual way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="61214-0006.htm_para3"><a name="06121474000289">First, let me set out the background to the proposals that we make. There are 14,300 post offices in the UK, of which 480 are Crown post offices owned by the Post Office and 13,820 post offices are operated by postmasters and mistresses as private businesses. Historically, branches have been located where the sub-postmaster has chosen to set up business, rather than as a result of a strategic decision by the Post Office. The result is that in some places many branches are competing for the same customers, which is why the Post Office will take a more active role in ensuring that the right post office in the right place&#151;something the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters supports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="61214-0006.htm_para4"><a name="06121474000290">But the big problem is that people are simply not using post offices as they once did. Some 4 million fewer people are using post offices each week, compared to just two years ago. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The market in which the post office network operates has changed beyond recognition in the past 10 to 15 years. Traditionally, the post office was the place&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

<p><a name="st_o186"><a name="06121474000291"><a name="61214-0006.htm_spnew25"><a name="06121474001277"><b>Mr. Speaker:</b> Order. The best advice I can give the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) is to let the Secretary of State make his statement and let a rebuttal go from the Opposition Benches. We will then take questions. There is no point interrupting a Minister while he is making a statement.</p>

<p><a name="st_o187"><a name="06121474000292"><a name="61214-0006.htm_spnew26"><a name="06121474001278"><b>Mr. Darling:</b> Traditionally, the post office was the place where people went to post a letter, to pay their utility bills and to collect their benefits. Many still do, but increasingly people choose to send an e-mail or text, they pay bills by direct debit or internet banking, and they pay for their tax disc online and have pensions or benefits paid into their bank accounts. Of the 11 million pensioners in this country, 8.5 million have their pensions paid into a bank account. In fact, most people making a new state pension claim choose to do so in this way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="61214-0006.htm_para5"><a name="06121474000293">Inevitably, that has taken its toll on the Post Office. Last year the Post Office lost &#163;2 million a week. This year the figure is &#163;4 million. It is not surprising that both the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters and the Select Committee on Trade and Industry have recognised that the present situation is, to use their word, &#147;unsustainable&#148;. So change is needed. Of the 14,300 businesses, only about 4,000 are commercially viable. Many never can be, nor should we, realistically, expect them to be.</p>

That is why we will continue to support a national network of post offices, and we are able to back them with the money that they need. The Government have invested more than &#163;2 billion since 1999 to support the network. That has included &#163;500 million for the  <br>

Horizon programme, which provided computerised banking to all post office branches. I can tell the House that the Government will provide up to &#163;1.7 billion until 2011 to support the Post Office, to support the network and to pay for restructuring to provide a firm basis for the future. The annual subsidy will remain in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="61214-0006.htm_para7"><a name="06121474000295">Let me now turn to my proposals. We propose to introduce new access criteria for the postal services to ensure a national network. The access criteria will include provisions to protect customers in deprived urban areas and remoter rural areas. Details of the criteria covering rural and urban areas are set out in the consultation document, but I can tell the House that nationally, 99 per cent. of the population will be within 3 miles of a post office. This will mean the restructuring of the network of Crown and other post offices. The Post Office will consult widely before taking a decision on its proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="61214-0006.htm_para8"><a name="06121474000296">The Post Office will also provide services in different and more imaginative ways better to serve its customers&#146; needs. The way in which postal services are provided will also change. Government support will enable the Post Office to open at least 500 new Outreach locations to provide access to services for smaller and more remote communities, using mobile post offices and post offices within other locations such as in shops, village halls, community centres, or in travelling mobile vans. In some cases they will be able to deliver services directly to people&#146;s homes. The Post Office is also determined to provide new services for its customers, particularly financial services. It is, for example, now the market leader in foreign exchange provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="61214-0006.htm_para9"><a name="06121474000297">As a result of these changes, we expect that about 2,500 post office branches will close. However, the remaining network of around 12,000 will still have more branches than the entire UK banking network. After discussion with the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, the Government have decided to provide compensation to those leaving the Post Office, based on a 28-month remuneration package.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="61214-0006.htm_para10"><a name="06121474000298">The Government want to devolve greater responsibility for local decisions and to provide greater flexibility for local funding decisions. We will therefore consider what role local authorities in England and the devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland might play in influencing how the postal services are best delivered in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="61214-0006.htm_para11"><a name="06121474000299">The Government intend to consult on these proposals, and the consultation will end in March. It is intended that the restructuring proposals will be implemented over an 18-month period starting in the summer of next year. The Post Office will ensure that it puts in place procedures to consult on restructuring proposals as widely as possible, providing people, including right hon. and hon. Members, with an opportunity to make representations and suggestions&#151;in relation to outreach provision, for example.</p>

The Government remain committed to allowing people to get their pension or benefit in cash at the post office if they choose to do so, and a range of accounts available  <br>

at the post office make that possible. The current Post Office card account contract ends in March 2010. I can tell the House that the Government have decided that they will continue with a new account after 2010. It will be available nationally and customers will be eligible for the account on the same basis as they are now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="61214-0006.htm_para13"><a name="06121474000301">European Union procurement rules leave us with no option but to tender competitively for this product, and we must ensure that best value for money for the taxpayer is achieved, but the Post Office is well placed to put in a strong bid given the size of the network and the access criteria that we are now introducing. In addition, cash will be available at the post office through some 4,000 free-to-use ATMs, which are being introduced across the network, as well as a range of interest accounts. Those will be attractive to the general public as well as those Post Office card account users who choose to build up balances on their card account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="61214-0006.htm_para15"><a name="06121474000304">The statement is both disappointing and wrong. It will cause fear and anxiety to people, often the most vulnerable, in every part of the country. It will destroy many good businesses simply because the Government do not have a long-term vision for the future of the post office network. Does not the Secretary of State recognise that if the local post office closes, often the last shop in the village closes as well, and that a van visiting for a couple of hours a week is no replacement for a post office that is open full-time? Of course, the Government have form on this issue. About 4,000 post offices have already closed under this Government; taken with today&#146;s statement, that means that in 10 years of Labour Government we will be losing more than one third of the post office network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="61214-0006.htm_para16"><a name="06121474000305">The Government&#146;s decision on the Post Office card account is welcome. Indeed, it is what Conservative Members have been calling for since the Government announced their intention to scrap it. I am glad that the Government have yet again responded to ideas put forward by Conservative Members and changed their mind on this issue. It is important that the new Post Office card account scheme is genuinely available to existing customers and that the application process should not be unnecessarily complex. However, the Secretary of State said that the contract for the new account may not go to the Post Office. Can he tell the House how many more post offices will have to close if the Post Office does not win this vital contract?</p>

the Government are denying them in today&#146;s statement, which is based on how many post office closures the Secretary of State thinks that he can get away with, not a real business case or an understanding of what consumers, especially the most vulnerable in our society, want and need. His vision is to have fewer post offices providing fewer services to fewer people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="61214-0007.htm_para1"><a name="06121474000307">The statement leaves many questions unanswered. When does the Secretary of State expect to publish a full list of the branches that are to close? Does he expect closures to be made disproportionately in rural areas? How will the process of selecting branches to be closed be carried out? Will the Post Office identify the branches to close, or will it allow sub-postmasters to volunteer for closure? How has the number of 2,500 been reached? Is it true, as reported in the press, that the Post Office wanted to close 7,000 of the 14,000 sub-post office branches? Allan Leighton and Adam Crozier are doing a remarkable job in trying to turn around the Royal Mail, but the Government appear to be determined to make them the fall guys for their own lack of vision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="61214-0007.htm_para2"><a name="06121474000308">The Secretary of State says that compensation will be paid where a post office closes. Can he confirm media reports that a sum of up to &#163;70,000 is being considered? Does he anticipate continuing uncompensated closures? Will there be local consultation about possible closures? What will a local community have to prove to avert a closure? Indeed, will it have any say at all? What will the situation be if someone wants to reopen a post office that has been closed as part of this process or wants to open up a new one nearby? Would they be allowed to do so? He says that the annual subsidy will remain in place. Will that be at the same level as now for every year until 2011? Does the figure of &#163;1.7 billion that he announced include compensation to those postmasters who close their post offices, and if not, how much extra will be made available for the compensation package?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="61214-0007.htm_para3"><a name="06121474000309">We accept that Government and business must deliver their services in the most cost-efficient way, but the Government seem content merely to manage the decline of the post office network when they should be trying to bring new business opportunities to it. They should be announcing that they will allow post offices full access to working with carriers other than the Royal Mail. They should be announcing that they will work with local councils to encourage them to offer more council services through post offices. They should be doing more to give post offices the flexibility to offer a much wider range of business services than they envisage. They should be acting to prevent the Royal Mail from poaching businesses away from sub-post offices by undercutting the prices that they can charge for postage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="61214-0007.htm_para4"><a name="06121474000310">While the Government fail to come forward with policies to give post offices a better future, the Prime Minister blames it all on the customer. How can he say that, when it is his Government who have taken away &#163;168 million of business from post offices this year?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="61214-0007.htm_para5"><a name="06121474000311">The statement is a missed opportunity for the post office network, but worse than that, it is a tragedy for those who depend on it and the communities that will lose a vital piece of their economic and social structure. It brings us no closer to a sustainable post office network; as a result, we are destined to more years of uncertainty, decline and dissatisfaction.</p>

Gentleman has been reading about these matters for the past week, he seems singularly unprepared for today. I am bound to say that I am confused. He seems to be saying at one and the same time that no post offices should close and that 7,000 should close, which is what he says the Royal Mail wanted. He must be aware that post offices have been closing for years. During the time that his party was in office, 3,500 post offices closed in a completely haphazard way with no help being given to enable them to restructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="61214-0007.htm_para6"><a name="06121474000313">Let me deal with one fundamental point. It is a matter of fact that, for various reasons, people&#146;s shopping habits and banking habits have changed&#151;for example, they are using the internet more&#151;and that is affecting every single business in the land. It is completely irresponsible simply to ignore that and hope that it will go away. People had the option of paying their benefits or pensions into a bank account during the Tory Government years as much as they have had that option during the years that we have been in power. As more and more people get bank accounts, they are asking that their money be paid into them. It is our job to respond to that and to support the Post Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="61214-0007.htm_para7"><a name="06121474000314">Let me make another point to the Tories. I said today that we are ready to put &#163;1.7 billion into the Post Office. If the hon. Gentleman&#146;s position is that there should be no closures, he has to tell us where he would find the additional money to go into the network, especially given that his party is committed to &#163;20 billion-worth of tax cuts, as well as unfunded, uncosted spending commitments across the board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="61214-0007.htm_para8"><a name="06121474000315">The hon. Gentleman raised several specific matters, which I shall tackle. I agree that we, along with the Post Office, must do our best to get more business into the Post Office. That is why the new chief executive is doing more to get additional financial services business into the Post Office. I have already mentioned foreign exchange, which is extremely important business. I agree&#151;and said in my statement&#151;that we should encourage local councils to do more business through post offices if they can. Our commitment today to continue with the Post Office card account will go a long way towards encouraging people to use post offices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="61214-0007.htm_para9"><a name="06121474000316">The hon. Gentleman asked about consultation. There will be a consultation for three months on the principles that I set out. After that, assuming that we decide to proceed, the Post Office will determine the post offices that need to be in the network. It must be for the management of the Post Office to decide about the appropriate network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="61214-0007.htm_para10"><a name="06121474000317">The hon. Gentleman asked about those who volunteer to go. We believe that many postmasters and mistresses want to go. The consultation document makes it clear that the Post Office will try to match those who want to leave the service with its rationalisation of the network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="61214-0007.htm_para11"><a name="06121474000318">Let me emphasise to hon. Members that the Post Office has a problem and it is up to the Government of the day to try to help manage it. We are willing to do that and we have the means to do it. That is the difference between us and the Opposition.</p>

He also knows that the consultation will be perceived by the 4 million people who signed the petition&#151;and the many millions who did not, but want to keep their post offices open&#151;as nothing more than something that will be listened to but ignored.

The problem that the Post Office faces is that many people who used to go to the post office to cash their giros, get their pensions and so on are choosing to do things differently. Another example is renewing tax discs on cars. People can choose to do it in the post office or online. Choice is right but the fact that the Government are making &#163;1.7 billion to support the network shows our determination to maintain a national network, which will have 12,000 branches&#151;more than the total of all the bank branches in the country.</p>

Why is he keeping Post Office Ltd under the control of the Royal Mail Group? He says that there are plans for new parcel pick-up services linked to mail order companies. That is great if it happens.

Will he therefore explain why he has failed yet again to make a final decision on the draft Royal Mail package that was produced more than seven months ago? Is not the truth that he will not stand up to pressure from the unions and Labour Back Benchers, and that he rejected the idea of an employee share ownership trust, which Liberal Democrats and Royal Mail management proposed, because of how it would look for the Chancellor when he needs some votes?

Obviously, we will do as much as we can to help the post office, but people&#146;s use of local shops is a wider problem.

I would certainly like that to be the case, although I think that he will accept that it is inevitable that in consultations it is difficult to guarantee that we will please everybody all the time.

The Post Office looks at postal districts, and I am pretty sure that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency is but one of them. He will know better than I do&#151;it is some time since I last visited Caithness&#151;that many small communities there are some distance from a post office.

This statement is another stage in the decline in rural services that we have witnessed in the past 10 years. The Secretary of State has got this the wrong way round. He rightly talked in his statement about the need for more services and access to more business in post offices, but he couches that in terms of &#147;the Post Office&#148; dealing with such matters centrally. Should he not be setting individual postmasters and postmistresses free through a much freer contract, so that they themselves can use the entrepreneurial spirit that he rightly espouses to get more business, in order to make their businesses viable? Only then should he make any necessary closures. Announcing closures before he gives postmasters and postmistresses that freedom is completely the wrong approach.</p>

Total landings of fish from UK vessels have increased for the second year running. In 2005 they had a value of &#163;571 million, up by 11 per cent. from 2004. I am also pleased to say that exports have also risen to &#163;925 million, an increase of 4 per cent. from 2004.</p>

I am sure that the sympathy of the whole House goes out to all the families who have suffered those tragic losses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="61214-0009.htm_para5"><a name="06121474000435">Fishing is part of our heritage and an important source of one of the healthiest foods. It provides jobs for more than 12,000 fishermen and many more in the ancillary and processing sectors. Many communities rely on it. Fish stocks are limited, but they are a valuable and renewable resource. Managed effectively, fisheries can be sustainable and profitable. But, if we get the balance wrong, we can cause irreversible damage to marine ecosystems and economic damage to those communities that rely on fisheries. So we need to get our focus and our balance right.</p>

On Friday 3 November, <i> The Times</i> had a whole-page article explaining that we were over-fishing and that the common fisheries policy&#151;under which we throw back dead fish if quotas have been exceeded&#151;is not working.

decisions and put the size and capacity of our fishing industry better in line with the health of the stocks, and what is happening in international waters on the high seas, where there is serious over-fishing that is often unregulated and illegal and rules&#151;where they exist&#151;are not very well enforced. The reports to which he refers will be the global reports that point out that if we do not act urgently, the danger is that the majority of the world&#146;s commercial fish stocks will be seriously depleted, if not extinct, within that timeframe. However, in the UK and the European Union, whatever one thinks of the functioning of the common fisheries policy, we do at least have a policy, a system of enforcement and of total allowable catches and quotas. We are able to get to grips with the problem, although I would not go so far as to claim that all stocks in EU waters are fished at sustainable levels. However, around the UK coast, most are. That is why in Brixham, for example, we have had, if not a record year, a good year of fish landings and incomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="61214-0010.htm_para2"><a name="06121474000451">As I was saying, there are many conflicting demands on our seas and they need to be managed more effectively. We are therefore also bringing forward a marine White Paper to give us a modern framework that will take us towards our sustainable development goals, streamline regulation and make our marine laws more effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="61214-0010.htm_para3"><a name="06121474000452">We need to take account of the very diverse range of interests in our marine environment. For example, sea anglers make a significant contribution to the UK economy, but their interests have not always been sufficiently recognised in fisheries management. We have therefore tried to make sure that their interests are better represented on inshore fisheries management bodies, for example, and we are currently working closely with recreational sea angling interests to produce a sea angling strategy for England. Again, that strategy will appear in the new year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="61214-0010.htm_para4"><a name="06121474000453">Although landings and incomes have been good this year, many of our fish stocks are still in a fragile state. We need to ensure that compliance is maintained if we are to safeguard stocks for future generations. Already, the introduction of the registration of buyers and sellers in 2005 has helped us to ensure compliance with quotas, and it has also boosted fish prices by reducing illegal landings. It was strongly resisted by some in the industry&#151;and even some hon. Members&#151;but is now widely welcomed as one of the best things to have happened to the fishing industry for some time. That shows that it is right for politicians to have the courage of their convictions and take difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions in the long-term interests of our fishing industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="61214-0010.htm_para5"><a name="06121474000454">I am also heartened by the increasing collaboration between fishermen and scientists. In particular, the fisheries science partnership is helping to improve the standard of scientific data produced and to make that data more relevant to the issues that directly concern the industry. In the past year, moreover, the Department has made available money from its own budget to help individuals and the regional advisory councils to develop their ideas on improved fisheries management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="61214-0010.htm_para6"><a name="06121474000455">I announced in June this year that modernised sea fisheries committees will deliver improved management of fish stocks and the marine environment in coastal waters out to six miles, while keeping the important local input to decision making. We will equip the SFCs, through the Marine Bill, with the management tools to achieve healthy fish stocks and sustainable coastal waters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="61214-0010.htm_para7"><a name="06121474000456">Just as climate change can be effectively tackled only at international level, so the protection of marine resources needs concerted global effort. The UK continues to have a leading role in promoting international sustainable fisheries. We recently helped to secure a UN agreement to end destructive trawling of the sea bed over the next two years. We have also been working with the international regional fisheries management organisations to deliver sustainable fisheries across the world&#146;s oceans. Illegal fishing in international waters is a key challenge to proper fisheries management, and we are implementing the proposals of the high seas task force&#151;which I chaired&#151;on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.</p>

hon. Gentleman&#146;s own fishermen are reporting seeing a growing number of young codlings in the North sea. There remains strong evidence&#151;at the moment, the balance is that the North sea still lies perfectly within the range of growth of cod populations&#151;that there is potential for cod recovery. Although it is absolutely right to study these issues carefully and to take climate change into account when we adopt our fisheries policy, I am not yet in a position to go down the road that the hon.

My fishermen are also confirming the same reports of seeing young codlings being caught, but does the Minister accept that if we have a 14 per cent. reduction in the total allowable cod catch, it will mean an increasing number of fish recruited to the stock being discarded? Surely that is not in anyone&#146;s interest.</p>

It is the job of ICES scientists to provide advice based on their scientific research, but it is then the job of the Commission, its own advisers and Ministers to come to a balanced view in the light of the mixed fisheries in the North sea. If ICES advice for a zero cod catch had been implemented in the North sea in any one of the last three years, it would have been completely devastating for the UK industry. It would have meant that fishermen could not go out and fish for haddock, prawns and other stocks that are in a very good shape because of the drastic measures on cod. We need to take tough decisions on cod and we may need to take some tough and painful decisions on cod next week, but it does not make sense either in the short or the long term to go for a zero catch on cod because of the devastating impact on the fishing communities in some Members&#146; constituencies.</p>

Direct comparisons between RSA and commercial fishing are difficult&#151;one is a sport; the other an extractive industry.

An overarching issue confronts the recreational and commercial sectors: the need to stop over-exploiting inshore fish stocks and to develop conservation programmes to improve the quality and quantity of fish in the sea. Regrettably, a year after our previous annual debate on fisheries, our fishing industry still looks as fragile and vulnerable as ever. The Government and the EU have not yet succeeded in striking the balance between the environment and the economic needs of British fisherman. An atmosphere of gloominess and pessimism has once again descended over our fishing communities, as they await the outcome of the December Council and their future for the next 12 months.</p>

There must not be a repeat of that this year, because all of Britain&#146;s fishing industries deserve to be taken seriously and deserve a strong voice. The Minister must make sure that Britain gets its fair share of sustainable stocks. Fishermen have already seen their total landings fall by over 50 per cent. since the 1960s and a third of their colleagues lose their jobs since 1997, and further losses simply might not be sustainable for the communities that rely on them.</p>

If he decides that the science is wrong, how will he ensure that the scientific advice is correct in future? We must have credible science, and if the Minister thinks that it is credible and accurate, he should, as we are so often told, take the scientific advice. However, if it is wrong, should he not agree with the fishermen, particularly those who want larger total allowable catches? It is not possible to disagree with the scientists and disagree with the fishermen. Either the fishermen are right, because they know what they are discarding, or the scientists are right, because their models work.

Just imagine how much extra value could be added to the economy if discards were prevented, or the impact that that could have on the sustainability of our fish stocks, or how much fish meal that would provide for farmed fish. I must congratulate the industry on the significant improvement in relation to illegally landed black fish. The industry has made great progress. With that under its belt, let us hope that 2007 becomes the year that discards are tackled.</p>

We have already seen numerous studies examining discards and I hope that the Minister will stick to the commitments laid out in his Department&#146;s 2006-07 marine and fisheries business plan, which states that the Department plans to:</p>

Over the last year, I have had the privilege of meeting representatives from the fisheries industry and the environmental lobby. Despite their often opposing views, they all agree that the current policies for fisheries management are not working, and discards have highlighted that more than anything else. The current policies are bad for the environment and they are bad for the fisheries industry.

It is that slowly grinding process of reform and change that is in need of a catalyst and the Government, sadly, are not providing it. The UK needs to show stronger leadership, but under Labour we have not been getting it, and our fisheries and marine environment lose out. Whether the Minister wants to include fisheries in a marine Bill or not, it is still essential that policies designed to protect the marine environment are integrated with those designed to make use of its economic resources. Indeed, in last year&#146;s debate, the Minister himself highlighted the importance of a marine Bill to the marine environment, stating:</p>
<a name="61214-0011.htm_brev6"><a name="06121474001014"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;One reason a marine Bill is so important is that it will enable us to take an overall, holistic approach to the management of our marine environment.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 7 December 2005; Vol. 440, c. 880.]</p>

Today I asked the Minister when we might expect the marine Bill and he told me that it would be before the next general election. The date keeps rolling back. In the absence of Government action, private and social enterprise and public demand are filling some of that vacuum, with some success.

I want to take the opportunity to outline the good and the not so good, and also the opportunities for Fleetwood&#146;s future&#151;I was going to question the hon. Gentleman on that last point. I tell the Minister that I will start with the not so good, which is the catching side of the industry. That links directly to his points about quotas and the December Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="61214-0012.htm_para3"><a name="06121474000532">Sadly, the numbers of fishermen and vessels in Fleetwood have declined. The Minister said that there are now more fish to catch, but unfortunately there are not as many fishermen in Fleetwood as there were to go out and catch those fish. The document on fishing possibilities for 2007, which was issued by the Commission, proposes yet more cuts in the quotas for the Irish sea, with a 25 per cent. cut for cod, a 15 per cent. cut for haddock, a 15 per cent. cut for sole and a 68.17 per cent. cut for whiting, although I am assured that no one goes out to catch whiting any more. However, it also proposes a welcome 15 per cent. increase for plaice and recommends that the arrangement for nephrops should remain the same.</p>

However, there is still no recovery in cod stocks. Fleetwood fishermen have faced slashed quotas, a reduced total allowable catch, a seasonal closed area at spawning time and extensive technical measures. Even under the programme, as I said earlier, large amounts of cod are caught as by-catch by beam trawlers. I am thus pleased that the Commission is examining the cod recovery programmes again to try to analyse why we have not seen the recovery in cod for which we hoped. The fishermen accepted those harsh measures because they  <br>

hoped that they would lead to a sustainable industry for the future. When the Irish sea cod recovery programme is taken into account as part of the reviews, I urge the Minister to consider the change in circumstances from when the programme was first introduced and to listen to the concerns of the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="61214-0012.htm_para5"><a name="06121474000534">As these reviews are driven by science, we must make every effort to ensure that the science is correct and the uncertainties are few. The fishermen and the scientists need to agree so that they will be prepared to work together and believe in each other. As the Minister said, there is not a happy history of that. There should be an opportunity to move forward with fishermen and scientists working in partnership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="61214-0012.htm_para6"><a name="06121474000535">The Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers Organisation has produced a radical proposal for 2007 that would incentivise the involvement of fishermen in data collection on stocks through the provision of extra days at sea. I will take a few minutes to outline that programme because it could be a way forward for fishermen and scientists to work together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="61214-0012.htm_para7"><a name="06121474000536">The purpose of the scheme is to secure a dramatic improvement in the quality of data on catches and discards and to make that data available to scientists and managers, in a real-time series, with the objective of ultimately contributing to accurate and credible stock assessment and advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. That would also greatly improve voluntary co-operation between fisheries scientists and the industry. Those participating in the programme would be rewarded with some concessions on days at sea, albeit with an understanding that there should be no overall increase in effort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="61214-0012.htm_para8"><a name="06121474000537">The programme has three elements: a fisheries self-sampling scheme with participation among Irish sea fishermen that is as wide as possible; enhanced observer coverage and discard sampling of Irish sea fisheries, with the result that the self-sampling should be more accurate; and an examination of alternative management measures to reduce discarding and the fishing mortality of cod, including the promotion of more selective gears.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="61214-0012.htm_para9"><a name="06121474000538">The new programme has been put to the Commission by the North Western Waters regional advisory council. It has the full support of fishermen, fishery administration and scientific institutions of England, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. If we are ever going to move forward on science and co-operation with fishermen, this is our opportunity. I thus urge my hon. Friend the Minister to examine the proposal closely and support it.</p>

As has been the case for catching, the size of the fish processing sector in Fleetwood has reduced substantially over the past two decades, but there has been greater stability in recent years.

new, dedicated fish park on vacant land to the south of the docks. The &#163;4.84 million project would comprise a new fish auction facility, a new small processor block, a new fish waste facility, a new recycling facility, serviced sites for large processors and all the associated infrastructure. Several possible funding options have been identified, although much more still needs to be done. The project offers real hope for the future and for Fleetwood fish merchants, who have shown that they are energetic and competitive and that they want to revive and expend their businesses. The Minister has visited Fleetwood merchants and seen for himself what they are doing. I hope that when the hon. Member for Leominster visited Fleetwood, he saw that although the catching side has declined, the processing side is gaining strength. There is a lot of optimism that that is a way forward for the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="61214-0012.htm_para12"><a name="06121474000541">There is widespread recognition of the high-quality, fully traceable fish and value-added products that originate from Fleetwood merchants. Some of the processors supply national supermarket chains and national food service distributors. Through wholesale and retail markets, they supply a catchment area comprising up to 18 million people. The fact that much of the fish that they sell is fully traceable is even more important now, as more supermarkets and customers want information about the sourcing of fish from sustainable species. We have all seen the Greenpeace campaigns and the adverts in supermarkets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="61214-0012.htm_para13"><a name="06121474000542">Those products, supplied daily, are now being sold in supermarket chains throughout France, Spain and Italy, as well as to importers from western Europe. Although there are now fewer boats in Fleetwood dock, a lot of lorries laden with fish leave the town every day to supply markets in this country and in the wider world. In addition, value is added to hundreds of tonnes of non-quota species by initial processing before export to destinations in the far east by a processing company that the Minister has visited. That company has just ended a far east marketing promotion: it exhibited at the Chinese fishing exhibition, as well as in Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore. Through that promotion, it has attracted interest from potential customers in Singapore, Dubai, India, Japan and Taiwan. I feel as though Fleetwood is now the centre of the world, never mind the centre of the north-west fishing industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="61214-0012.htm_para14"><a name="06121474000543">One of the local initiatives by fish processors is to take advantage of the fisheries science partnership to market and develop a fishery of a non-quota species, razorfish, in the Liverpool bay area. We are also now witnessing in the larger processors and merchants an influx of younger people to fisheries management. They are seeking to develop a long-term, sustainable and competitive industry by utilising the maximum sustainable yield of the present European fisheries management structure, coupled with supplies from abroad. Therefore, just as I urge the Minister to do what he can to support the catching side, I urge him to recognise the importance of the onshore fishing industry&#151;the processing side.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="61214-0012.htm_para15"><a name="06121474000544">That leads me to the European fisheries fund and the new processes for that funding. I understand that the EFF has five priority areas, but the bulk of the money will be allocated under axis 4, which relates to &#147;sustainable development of fisheries areas&#148;. I am told  <br>

that the original proposal was for EFF money to be administered through regional development agencies, with the amount each RDA received being based on the regional economic strategy, and for priorities for funding also to be regionalised and based on the RES. However, by my recollection, the fishing industry does not even appear in the Northwest Development Agency&#146;s RES.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="61214-0012.htm_para16"><a name="06121474000545">I am pleased to be told now that the EFF could be administered in the same way as the financial instrument for fisheries guidance&#151;centrally through DEFRA. I hope that the Minister can clarify that detail and explain further how axis 4 is to be interpreted. Is funding to be made available for redevelopment in fisheries-related areas, for example, for the redevelopment of the Fleetwood market and processing facilities proposed in the Poseidon report; or will funding be available only for developments away from the fishing industry? I hope that my hon. Friend will also consider how RDAs recognise and support the fishing industry. The Northwest Development Agency does an excellent job in a range of areas and is supporting the regeneration of Blackpool, but it does not recognise the fishing industry in Fleetwood. Perhaps it needs to be reminded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="61214-0012.htm_para17"><a name="06121474000546">Finally, I shall comment on the impact on fishing activity of the development of offshore wind farms. A meeting of the North Western and North Wales sea fisheries committee reported:</p>
<a name="61214-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="06121474001017"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The wind farms will disproportionately affect the local UK inshore fishing industry through loss of accessible fishing grounds. The effect on the larger fleet and vessels from other EU member states will be negligible because they have unrestrained access to more productive areas of the Irish Sea. The further loss of inshore grounds, piled on other pressures on the industry, is likely to make some local vessels uneconomic to operate.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="61214-0012.htm_para20"><a name="06121474000549">I have had meetings with both the developers of the Barrow wind farm, which is already established, and the companies proposing new wind farms on Shell flat, which is just offshore off Fleetwood and Cleveleys. I have copied to my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Environment, Marine and Animal Welfare letters on the subject that I have sent to the Minister for Energy. Fleetwood fishermen have been trying for a long time to reach an agreement on compensation in relation to the Barrow wind farm.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="61214-0012.htm_para21"><a name="06121474000550">I wonder what happened to the discussions held by FLOW. Did it reach any conclusion on setting the ground rules for dialogue between offshore wind farm operators and the fishing industry? Increasing numbers of energy operators are applying for consents for offshore wind farms, so more fishing communities across the UK will need to consider the impact of such developments on their fishing effort. It is important that there are basic ground rules that everybody knows how to work under, because increasing numbers of wind farms are being proposed for the north-west coast, on the Irish sea. That is where my local inshore fleet targets fish, so we need to sort out the problem.</p>

The issue is not only compensation, but proximity of access, because a wind farm is very different from an oil rig. One can understand the reason for an exclusion zone around an oil rig, but not around a wind farm. Fishermen need to be able to fish very close to the wind farms, which take up a large area.</p>

<p><a name="st_o349"><a name="06121474000552"><a name="61214-0012.htm_spnew6"><a name="06121474001440"><b>Mrs. Humble:</b> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. There is a good deal of debate about whether fishing vessels can go in and out, between the turbines. On the one hand, I am told by the developers that the turbines are set far enough apart for fishing vessels to go between them, and that the base of the turbines will form reefs where fish will congregate. On the other, fishermen tell me that it would be dangerous for them to go in and out of the turbines. I do not know who is right&#151;all I know is that they disagree. We ought to have a discussion on the subject, because I am sure that the Government will give more consents, and although I approve of renewable forms of energy, we must take into account the impact that any such consents will have on the fishing industry. That is yet another reason why I am looking forward to the marine Bill, when it appears. A lot of people think that the seas are empty, but in fact they are very busy with fishermen, ferries and, increasingly, wind farms.</p>

<p><a name="st_o350"><a name="06121474000553"><a name="61214-0012.htm_spnew7"><a name="06121474001441"><b>Mr. Salmond:</b> The hon. Lady makes an interesting point, but is there not a distinction between near-shore wind farms, which can pose a substantial nautical risk, particularly if they are adjacent to a harbour entrance, and deep offshore wind farms on very large seas? In either case, would it not be right to introduce a procedure under which loss of access claims could be properly processed, so that the fishing industry does not lose out to such developments, as some might argue that they have lost out to oilfield developments?</p>

<p><a name="st_o351"><a name="06121474000554"><a name="61214-0012.htm_spnew8"><a name="06121474001442"><b>Mrs. Humble:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes two points. On his point about the location of wind farms, there is one at Barrow, on the fishing grounds of the Barrow and Fleetwood fishermen. There are proposals for two much larger ones further offshore, but those sites are on fishing grounds, too, and importantly they are on a busy ferry route between the UK and Northern Ireland. A lot of maritime traffic uses exactly the areas on which it is proposed to site the two large wind farms. There is an issue about location, but I agree with him that we need clear rules about compensation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="61214-0012.htm_para22"><a name="06121474000555">One of the problems for the inshore fishing fleet is that because the vessels are under 10 m in length, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs does not require them to keep detailed records of their catches, their landings and the value of those landings. For that reason, it is difficult for them to prove either that they fish in an area in which the wind farm is to be developed, or the value of the catch that will be lost to them if they are no longer allowed to fish in that area. When I speak to the developers, however, they say that if they are to pay compensation, they must have proof of loss of earnings, like any commercial company. That is a complex issue, but it cannot be ignored, and it has to be placed in the context of our wider debates about the fishing industry, quotas, and the sustainability of the industry and of fish stocks.

wind farms are perhaps not directly relevant to what the Minister will debate in the Council of the European Union in December, but it is still an important subject to fishermen, so I hope that he will take it into account.</p>

May I begin by expressing my admiration for the many fishermen who daily risk their lives to feed the nation, and by paying tribute to the 15 fishermen who lost their lives in the past year? Like the Minister and the hon. Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin), I represent a landlocked constituency. I am not sure, however, how far the tidal waters extend up the Exe, or whether they reach Exeter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="61214-0012.htm_para23"><a name="06121474000561">Our debate is concerned not just with commercial fishing but recreational fishing, which is enjoyed by more than 4 million people in England and Wales every year, and is thus probably the nation&#146;s favourite outdoor participation sport. The annual economic activity associated with angling is estimated to be worth &#163;2.75 billion, and the sport employs about 20,000 full-time and part-time workers. Having highlighted the important contribution of recreational fishing to our economy, I pay tribute to the excellent work of Dr. Stephen Marsh-Smith of the charitable Wye and Usk Foundation in my constituency, which seeks to restore the ecology, environment and fisheries of those two famous salmon and trout rivers by making them more attractive and accessible to fish so that they can reach their traditional spawning grounds, which the foundation has also sought to improve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="61214-0012.htm_para24"><a name="06121474000562">In business questions, I asked the Leader of the House whether time could be allocated before the EU-Norway negotiations for a parliamentary debate on the Government strategy in those negotiations. As TACs for the North sea are effectively set at those talks and, indeed, 50 per cent. of the total value of the Scottish fleet decided, it would be useful if the Minister would make clear on the Floor of the House his advice to the Commission on those important negotiations. Cod will rightly dominate the negotiations next week. The Commission is expected to reduce the cod quota in the Celtic sea by 35 per cent., by 25 per cent. in the Irish sea and off the western approaches, and by 14 per cent. in the North sea. Those cuts may be supplemented by cuts in days at sea for all sectors catching cod. What will the Minister do in Brussels to represent UK fishing need, and will he emphasise that it is time for other member states to take on their share of the burden?</p>

Friend will be aware that this is the third year of closure for the Trevose ground, which is a significant spawning ground for cod and many other species, particularly during the early part of the year. Instead of basing our efforts to control stocks with sustainable fishing entirely on TACs and days at sea, I hope that the Minister will endorse efforts to ensure that the Trevose closure continues year after year, because it appears to be working.</p>

All the while, there has been no substantial recovery or evidence of recovery in cod stocks. The Minister knows that fishermen&#146;s groups lobbied hard for a review of the cod recovery plan, which has been granted for next year&#151;a move that I welcome. What does he think of the idea floated by such groups that because of the impending review, we should ask for a roll-over of current arrangements until we know where we stand with the cod recovery plan?</p>

While greater protection has been given to the countryside through the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and the Commons Act 2006, no such provision has been made for the marine environment. Good stewardship of our seas and their natural resources is vital to the continued sustainability and future prosperity of our fisheries. Furthermore, the proposed Bill was supported in all parts of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="61214-0013.htm_para2"><a name="06121474000567">As the Government are consulting for a second time on that important legislation, will the Minister reconsider the role that fisheries might play in marine conservation and in the Bill? We would all agree that it is impossible to differentiate between environmental marine concerns and fisheries, just as it is impossible to draw a distinction between farming affairs and concerns for wildlife. Sustainable fisheries and the protection of the marine environment must go hand in hand. It is impossible to address one concern while neglecting the other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="61214-0013.htm_para3"><a name="06121474000568">Too often, the complaint is made that the science that we use to inform our decisions in negotiations is not sound, and is more concerned with making immediate political headlines than with the long-term sustainability of fish stocks and the fishing industry. Every year for the past five years the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas has advised that the cod fisheries in the North sea, west of Scotland and the Irish sea be closed to restore stocks. Those arguments cause concern among the fishing communities across the UK.</p>

The FSP has been an innovative and highly successful initiative which, alongside work carried out by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science in Lowestoft, has complemented the work done by ICES. We would all agree that a scheme that seeks to involve fishermen with the scientific process that dictates our political decision making should be maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="61214-0013.htm_para6"><a name="06121474000571">Other concerns expressed to me by those from the FSP were that delays could be caused by Ministers deciding which research projects should be carried out. I seek the Minister&#146;s reassurance that whoever makes those decisions, they are made in a timely manner, and that any delays in decision making will not result in future cuts to the partnership&#146;s budget.</p>

Advice that was previously released in October is to be made available in June, allowing adequate time to consult all the regional advisory councils and other stakeholders before the Commission produces its formal proposals later in the year. Can the Minister clarify which stocks of interest to the UK fishing industry will benefit from the release of scientific data being brought forward?</p>

What are the Minister&#146;s views on the excellent work done so far by the RACs? Will he outline any plans that his Department may have to give the councils greater autonomy in their decision making? Unlike the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats do not want to withdraw from the common fisheries policy and believe that we are better in than out. Fish do not recognise international borders. If we want to be involved in fisheries negotiations with other European countries, we cannot afford to pull ourselves out of the CFP.</p>

The Liberal Democrats&#146; original policy, which was put forward in the early 1990s, proposed regional management committees and wanted the regional advisory councils to develop in that way. I understand that the Minister and the European Commissioner are keen to encourage policy in that direction too. My hon. Friend will share my disappointment that Conservatives who engaged in this debate in years gone by scoffed at that idea, because fishermen now consider it to be one of the single most important developments in fisheries management and one of the most useful tools available to them.</p>

It is vital that RACs are given sufficient time to respond properly to Commission proposals, as they will be putting the decisions reached in Europe into effect on the front line. What plans does the Minister have to involve them more in the European phase of the negotiations?</p>

The people on the front line need to be told of the plans for the coming year more than a mere 10 days before the changes will be put into effect. There is no time for them to develop plans, to make representations, or to make their views known on the changes that they will have to work hard to enforce. Will the Minister clarify the way in which the changes to the release of scientific advice will have an effect on the role of the RACs?</p>

Our fishing industry should be supported and encouraged to gain more value from the stocks that remain available to it. While the Minister will say that we have a highly successful fishing industry, the figures speak for themselves: 6,000 British fishermen have lost their jobs since Labour came to power, more than 1,000 vessels are no longer in action, and total landings are down in quantity and market value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="61214-0013.htm_para12"><a name="06121474000581">Will the Minister give the House his view on fisheries industries also becoming value added businesses where fish is landed in local ports and, as much as possible, processed by local processors? That has massive benefits for local employment as well as ensuring that seafood retains its place as a regional cuisine and cutting down on all-important food miles. In farming, hundreds of new initiatives nationwide have made use of local shops, box schemes and other ways of capitalising on raw products. That engenders a huge amount of consumer enthusiasm for local produce. I can see no reason why that thinking should not be extended to the fishing industry. In the south-west we already have an excellent project, &#147;Invest in Fish South West&#148;, which aims to lead to a stakeholder-developed regional strategy for fisheries management in south-west waters and consults organisations as diverse as fishermen&#146;s federations, non-governmental organisations and retailers. What more does the Under- Secretary believe that the fishing industry could do to profit further from the increasing demand for local, sustainably sourced, healthy food?

Nets with technical adaptations such as sorting grids and escape panels are fundamental to reducing by-catch. Mixed fisheries for haddock and whiting, and some nephrops fisheries are especially worrying because of the high cod by-catch. Fleets in those fisheries should be required to introduce more selective gear immediately. Financial support should be forthcoming from member states and the Commission to assist in implementing such measures. By-catch and discarding is not a new problem and selective gear is  <br>

widely recognised and available as the solution, but there is a lack of political will to implement its use. In the light of the Commission&#146;s review of technical measures to reduce discards, will the Under-Secretary give his views on what he deems to be the difficulties with enforcing such measures throughout UK fleets?</p>

The North sea is often harsh and unforgiving. Over the years, countless fishermen from Hartlepool have lost their lives trying to make a living for themselves and their families. Sadly, fatalities continue. Earlier this year, Edward Bissell&#146;s empty fishing boat, &#147;Bonny Lass&#148;, was found by rescue teams. On the same day as last year&#146;s fisheries debate, town fisherman Stephen Horsley, part of a long-standing Hartlepool family who have fished off the coast for generations, was saved from the sea by lifeboats after his boat sank off the coast. The danger that the fishermen face to make their living and the bravery shown by rescue teams are awesome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="61214-0013.htm_para16"><a name="06121474000586">I also take the opportunity to mention the bombardment of Hartlepool. On 16 December 1914&#151;we are two days from the anniversary&#151;Hartlepool became the first place on the British mainland to be attacked by German ships in the first world war. More than 100 people, including fishermen returning from their early morning catch, were killed during the bombardment. The North sea has presented danger to the people of the north-east in many ways.</p>

However, there is a small and intense fishing community with great characters and traditions and I am determined, during my time in the House, to ensure that it goes from strength to strength. I therefore want to use my speech to set out the challenges for the fishermen in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="61214-0013.htm_para18"><a name="06121474000588">Two principal and related aspects are the levels of stocks, as other hon.

Pretty much everybody agrees that cod stocks, certainly in the mid North sea, have been falling at a dramatic rate over the last few  <br>

decades, although there is some debate about the nature and location of the replenishment of cod stocks. I agree with the striking points that the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) made in his contribution to last year&#146;s debate, namely that spawning grounds with immature cod must be identified and protected for the long-term future of the industry as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="61214-0013.htm_para19"><a name="06121474000589">A move to multi-year agreements on quotas should be seriously considered. It is difficult for any business to try to plan on a one-year basis, but it is especially difficult for sole traders such as fishermen. I do not believe that data and evidence for future fish stocks are so volatile and unreliable that a multi-year agreement could not be negotiated. A three-year rolling agreement on quotas, even it were to be reviewed on an annual basis, would make it easier for fishermen to plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="61214-0013.htm_para20"><a name="06121474000591">I think that the fall in cod stocks has been caused not by overfishing but by long-term environmental pressures. The North sea appears to be getting warmer, and cod stocks find colder waters more conducive. The supply of plankton on which they feed is also moving north, largely because of the need to find cooler waters. There seems to be evidence that cod stocks are moving north largely because of the environment. That is positive news for Scottish fishermen but provides greater challenges for those on the north-east English coast who make their living from cod.</p>

Gentleman rightly points out, they are in ever-decreasing numbers. If the European Commission keeps restricting effort in relation to other species because of that perhaps natural phenomenon, it will be bad news for everybody. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="61214-0013.htm_para21"><a name="06121474000594">The move to colder climates is seeing cod replaced by more diverse types of fish. Fishermen in my patch tell me that there is a massive supply of shellfish, of which they could catch a much larger amount than they are allowed at present. That could provide a decent living for them without comprising the long-term sustainability of the stock. I hope that the Minister will push for better shellfish quotas in negotiations with the EU, and I was pleased by his opening remarks in the debate.</p>

Off the north-east coast, there is a growing supply of non-traditional fish species such as tope, sea bass, pollock, brill and turbot. A number of Mediterranean swordfish have even been caught off Hartlepool in the past 12 months. Such developments provide a significant opportunity for diversification away from traditional cod fishing towards other stocks, which could provide local fishermen with an alternative income stream with higher margins.</p>

the development of recreational charter angling. Over the past 10 years, the Hartlepool marina has become one of the leading centres of maritime excellence in the north of England. It is a great place from which to explore not only the north-east coast but the tourist delights of Northumberland, Durham and York. I am keen to extend that success to the traditional Headland fishing community.</p>

The recreational charter angling sector provides a great opportunity for communities such as the Headland, and could be part of a co-ordinated tourist and visitor package for Hartlepool.

Boats from foreign countries are entering our waters and fishing blatantly, often running up a British flag, which causes a great deal of anger among local fishermen. There is a perception among my constituents that our regulatory regime is complied with by British boats in a strong and robust manner, but that other countries are perhaps not so diligent. Will the Minister outline in his response what action he plans to take to ensure that a level playing field is refereed consistently, so that British fishermen are not unduly penalised by such illegal practices?</p>

I do not have a great deal of information about that&#151;there is an awful lot of rumour and conjecture about it at the moment&#151;but I am worried that exploitation of workers in the fishing industry might be taking place in the north-east, despite the remarkable efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith) over the past couple of years.

Therefore, I would like to see much greater involvement and consultation carried out between fishermen working in the industry and the body charged with regulating the industry in my area, the North Eastern Sea Fisheries Committee.

proposing to impose upon the fishermen whom I represent. Two of the major fish stocks providing revenue to the fishermen I represent are ray and bass. I wish to speak specifically about measures applied to those species by this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="61214-0014.htm_para4"><a name="06121474000611">When I visited A. J. Fisheries of Appledore and the fishing centre there, it was explained to me that there had been a singular error in interpretation of some of the facts, as a result of which the Government appear to be about to apply, or have already applied, a maximum landing length for skate and ray. I know that there has been considerable concern about the depleted stocks of skate and ray in the North sea and that there has been a Greenpeace campaign in relation to skate&#151;which, I should add, impacted very severely on many fishermen around the country&#151;but I am told that that was based to some extent on a misunderstanding, and I will be grateful if the Minister provides clarification on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="61214-0014.htm_para5"><a name="06121474000612">The type of ray that is abundant in the North sea is the common skate. I have brought into the Chamber an illustrative aid to show the Minister&#151;</p>

The common skate is the species that I understand to be at risk; that is the skate that is abundant in the North sea. However, there is a fundamental difference between the common skate and the thornback ray and the spotted ray, which are both native to the Bristol channel. Those types of ray are the source of the greatest catch for fisherman in the north Devon and Torridge fisheries whose fishermen I represent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="61214-0014.htm_para6"><a name="06121474000615">I am informed that there is no shortage of thornback ray or spotted ray, but the proposal is for the Minister to apply an 85 cm maximum landing length, and that will cause a major problem for the fisheries in my constituency. I am told that&#151;I apologise in advance, as I may use inaccurate terminology&#151;current trawlers tend to wing the ray while they are still at sea. Their fishermen will prepare it, bring it back and land it already winged because that is the economical way of doing it. The Minister&#146;s new rule will require them to land the ray whole. That will lead to all kinds of changes to the manner in which they process the ray: they will no longer be able to do what I have described on board so they will have to find space and facilities to do it onshore. It will also add to the economic cost of processing ray. Indeed, I am told that it is likely to add 25 per cent. to the cost, which is enough to turn their current profit into a loss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="61214-0014.htm_para7"><a name="06121474000616">Landing whole and gutted ray severely increases the costs for vessels and processors.

I would be grateful if the Minister could either provide clarification today on that point, or produce evidence to suggest that that interpretation of the facts is wrong if he thinks that that is the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="61214-0014.htm_para9"><a name="06121474000618">There is another problem, which applies not only to the fishing of ray in the Bristol channel but also to the fishing of bass. These domestic measures apply only to British fishermen. As I understand it, they are intended to be conservation measures applicable to the 12-mile limit, but the fact is that every day in the Bristol channel, foreign vessels with greater capacity than any of the smaller trawlers and fishing vessels in the North Devon fleet fish right up to the six-mile limit. I have written to the Minister about this issue, so he may be aware of it&#151;I know that he questions some of the evidence&#151;but there is no doubt that huge vessels are operating there. I point out for the benefit of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams), in particular, that I have evidence that a Belgian beamer-turned otter trawler with an 883 kW engine is fishing, by historic right, up to six miles off the coast of Wales&#151;and of the south-west&#151;and is landing some 600 boxes of fish at a time, largely, as I understand it, into Welsh ports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="61214-0014.htm_para10"><a name="06121474000619">What is the point of telling British fishermen that they cannot land ray under 85 cm if a Belgian trawler of that size and capacity is able to cruise along the six-mile limit hoovering up ray of any size and land them in a British port? It is obvious why the fishermen of North Devon and Torridge are saying to me, &#147;What are our Government trying to do? They are tying our hands behind our backs and doing precious little to stop foreign vessels from hoovering up fish right on the six-mile limit.&#148; Moreover and as the Minister has said several times today, fish respect neither international boundaries nor six-mile limits. A shoal 100 yd inside the six-mile limit can be the same shoal that the Belgian trawler is hoovering up a few yards outside that limit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="61214-0014.htm_para11"><a name="06121474000620">One can understand the sense of grievance and injustice that hard-pressed fishermen in Torridge and north Devon express to me when they see that phenomenon daily, weekly, monthly, annually, without apparent action from the Government. That is the situation regarding ray&#151;a species that is in abundance in the Bristol channel and is not threatened. This maximum landing length has been applied to it because of a mistake of identification; the truth is that another species&#151;skate&#151;in the North sea is threatened and depleted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="61214-0014.htm_para12"><a name="06121474000621">I point out with considerable diffidence, knowing that some experienced anglers are here today representing angling interests, that the same point applies to bass. The angling lobby has applied a great deal of pressure regarding bass landing sizes. However, bass is another staple of the north Devon fishing industry, and once again the Government have chosen to impose a maximum landing size. If I am not mistaken, the Minister has decided on a 40 cm maximum landing size. Why has he chosen that limit? Just a few weeks ago, the Welsh Assembly Minister with responsibility for such matters decided on a  <br>

different limit&#151;a 37.5 cm maximum landing size. How can the science in Wales be so different from that in England? The waters that the fishermen whom I represent are fishing are precisely the same ones as Welsh fishermen are fishing. This situation will doubtless cause some resentment and tension between Welsh and Devonshire fishermen, although they are working together to resolve the problem. If the limit is 40 cm in England and 37.5 cm in Wales, the risk is that Welsh fishermen&#151;</p>

correct me. However, those French vessels will not be subject to the minimum landing size rule. Given that the fishery that I represent has made great efforts to devise a system for maintaining its sustainability, the sense of grievance and injustice is plain when one talks with the fishermen. They see the French and Belgian trawlers, which have a much greater capacity than their vessels, hoovering up fish and landing 600 boxes a time in Welsh ports. Those boxes are full of bass and ray. What will my fishermen think of a Government who impose that impediment on them? With regret, I have to say that there has been some talk of judicial review of the 40 cm limit. I urge the Minister to take cognisance of the very real concern that the Government&#146;s rules are damaging the fishery that I represent.</p>

They have made enormous strides towards making the fishery there sustainable, and they have changed their tackle and upgraded their gear so that juvenile fish can escape.

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="61214-0014.htm_para21"><a name="06121474000643">It is an improving situation for a highly attenuated industry, which we need to rebuild, but just because things are improving I do not resile in any way from my position on the common fisheries policy. I am sorry if the Conservative party is resiling from it and I am sure that the SNP will not. We would be better off controlling our own destinies. The CFP is, frankly, no policy with which to handle the situation. It produces the crazy anomalies that the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox) mentioned in respect of their effect on the fishermen of north Devon, and it proposes blanket measures on the basis that one measure covers any situation when it does not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="61214-0014.htm_para22"><a name="06121474000644">Quotas are an implicit part of the CFP and they lead automatically to discards. Discards increase as quotas fall. It is not a sensible way of handling fishing policy for the whole of the EU waters. It inevitably leads to more by-catching. It leads to blanket measures such as the cod recovery programme, with its associated cuts, and to cuts in catches for other species associated with cod.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="61214-0014.htm_para23"><a name="06121474000645">I start with cod because it has become almost a symbol for what the Commission wants to do to fishing&#151;control it. The cod recovery programme is heavily backed by the Commission&#146;s environmental department, which has put its oar in and made the programme totally inflexible. In my view, it is totally inadequate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="61214-0014.htm_para24"><a name="06121474000646">The cod recovery programme needs revision and change. The EU-Norway talks, which generally determine what will happen at EU Council meetings, predicted a 14 per cent. cut. I see in <i> Fishing News&#151;</i>so it must be true&#151;that the Commission is adhering to its hard line on a 25 per cent. cut, which would be disastrous. I hope that the Minister will fight the good fight and not be moved by all the environmentalists who are lamenting in advance the death of cod, when that is not on the agenda. Those environmental panics are damaging to sound, continuous, steady judgment in the fishing industry. I also hope that he will not be moved by European pressures, because Europe tends to respond to such environmental panics.</p>

You cod killer!&#148; It has just gone too far. Cod is not in danger of extinction. I do not know what the future will be, but neither does the Commission. The situation is very different in the North sea from that in the Irish sea, which tells me that common measures are not a good idea. I do not know whether cod stocks will recover. We do not know how much of the decline in cod stocks is due to global warming and the stocks moving further north because the whole sustaining environmental support mechanism is not responding well to global warming. As the waters warm, there is less sustenance for the cod. Is that the case, or is it not the case? I do not know, but the Commission does not know either.</p>

the entire east coast fishing industry and stopped cod fishing altogether. That is no basis for effective management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="61214-0015.htm_para1"><a name="06121474000649">We must ask what the Commission means by the footnote suggestion that cod should be a by-catch only species. What does that mean? What would be the consequences? Is it a serious proposal, or is it not? I ask because there are not many targeted cod fisheries left, but one of them is off the Yorkshire coast. That targeted cod fishery is small but important to those people who are involved in taking the cod. We need to know what the Commission is proposing by the mention of a by-catch only species. It is seems clear that the cod recovery programme 2002 was conceived in haste and is unrealistic. It assumes that nothing will change unless there is an annual increase rate and spawning stock recovery, which is not happening. Without that annual increase, further reductions are triggered. It is based on a panic attitude in Europe&#151;again, in ignorance of whether or not global warming plays a part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="61214-0015.htm_para2"><a name="06121474000650">Evidence from Greenland&#151;where there has been a substantial fall in cod stocks, but where they are now recovering&#151;shows that this could be a cyclical thing. The way in which stocks are recovering indicates that cod, being a fecund fish, recovers fast once the recovery begins. That could happen in the North sea. Indeed, evidence shows that it is already beginning in the North sea. That is more reason to oppose the Commission&#146;s proposal. Incidentally, with Greenland stocks, it is more reason for the Government to fight to retain our 2.9 per cent. share. Although small, that share of east Atlantic cod is crucial to the Humberside fishing industry, and it is guaranteed by the European economic area agreement. I am sure that the Minister will fight to retain it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="61214-0015.htm_para3"><a name="06121474000651">Given the state of doubt about the argument, I welcome the North sea regional advisory council&#146;s symposium, which is proposed for next year. The Commission itself should be holding that symposium. It will bring together world experts to tell us what the situation is and what the prospects for cod are. Until then, we do not have a real, scientific, intellectually credible basis for our judgments. In default of that and with the evidence from the North sea, I hope that the Minister will fight the proposals made in July for a 25 per cent. cut to the total allowable catch for cod and cuts in associated species, which <i> Fishing News </i>tells us that the Commission is sticking to. That is the position that should be taken, as the regional advisory councils wanted. He should demand a roll-over in relation to cod.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="61214-0015.htm_para4"><a name="06121474000652">As the Minister does that, I hope that he will try to end the perverse incentive in relation to the days at sea limitation. A reduction in that context will accompany the 25 per cent. reduction. The limitation means that those using bigger meshes, which are used for catching cod and haddock, are penalised. Those using bigger meshes should get more days at sea, but in fact more days at sea are given to those using meshes between 70 and 99 mm. That is crazy, because those small meshes catch more immature cod and haddock and therefore damage the stock. Why should those using smaller meshes have the incentive of more days at sea than those using larger meshes? It seems ridiculous. It is certainly anomalous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="61214-0015.htm_para5"><a name="06121474000653">The Commission proposes that quotas should be slashed in relation to other stocks, when the scientific advice is unclear or absent and when the TAC has not been fully caught by the nation state. I am talking about dabs, flounder, turbot and, in particular, North sea whiting, which is crucial to our industry in Yorkshire and Humberside. All of them are small catches, but their value to the ports involved is large. Why should quotas for those species be cut in the way that the Commission proposes? That is a perverse incentive to catch 100 per cent. of a small quota on the grounds that, &#147;If you don&#146;t use it, you lose it.&#148; The quota should be rolled over in the same way as it is for other stock. I hope that the Minister will resist those proposals for cuts, particularly the whiting cuts. Whiting seems to be in abundance in the southern North sea and it is becoming very important. I hope that he will also try to ensure that the by-catches&#151;particularly in edible stocks&#151;from industrial fishing, which are at a low ebb because of the eel and pout difficulties, will be transferred to our edible catch quotas so that they can be caught and eaten, instead of being destroyed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="61214-0015.htm_para6"><a name="06121474000654">The east coast industry has compensated for the decline of white fish by turning to lobsters and shellfish. We have been having problems with French vessels off Flamborough Head. I do not propose that the Minister should send a gunboat&#151;much as I would love him to. The NFFO has reached an agreement with 10 of the French fishermen that that friction will be ended, but two of the 10 vessels, which are run by skippers who were described to me by east coast fishermen as &#147;nutters&#148;, are not abiding by the agreement that their eight colleagues have reached. I hope that fishery protection, which usually stays clear of these arguments, can be used when such depredation is being carried out by maverick fishermen who are not part of the agreement. I make that point for the east coast.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="61214-0015.htm_para7"><a name="06121474000655">Let me make a few further points, having withdrawn the provocation to cause my friend, the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), to intervene. Why have the Government dropped decommissioning? It is still necessary, and having spent &#163;226 million on it, this seems a daft time to claim that it is not a good use of public money. The Minister and the Department have indicated that the money is being put back into fishing. In many cases it is, but decommissioning extinguishes both a vessel and a licence. If a fisherman who is decommissioning holds further licences and puts money into them, it is no great problem, because the number of vessels fishing and the number of licences is being diminished. Opportunities for other fishermen are created by decommissioning, so I fail to see why we have stopped it. If the problem is not the money that is available due to the Department&#146;s problems with agricultural payments, what is the real problem?</p>

wind farms are very different. If vessels were prepared to do so, they could achieve close access. Wind farms cover huge areas, so the spaces in the farms could be made available for vessels to access. I hope that the Minister will argue against the different view that the Department of Trade and Industry takes on this point.</p>

Fishermen are seeing the virtues of organisation and arguments that are based on research and evidence. The RACs represent a fundamental way in which that can be provided. I am grateful for the support that they have been given, but ask that it be strengthened so that they can become the agencies for the education and consolidation of the industry that we all want them to be.</p>

I think that the new Conservative Member, the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox), who made a detailed speech&#151;the one that settled the bass issue&#151;should be drafted on to that review immediately, because whatever else may be said about him, his grasp of the detail of the industry is impressive after so short a period.</p>

In the early years of these debates, the Government Benches&#151;the Conservatives were in government then&#151;were crowded with MPs representing points all round the coast. All of them were deeply frustrated with their Government&#146;s policy, but they were there, none the less. Nowadays, with the exception of the hon.

This should have led to a reasoned debate with stakeholders and a sensible, measured set of first proposals.

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="61214-0015.htm_para20"><a name="06121474000675">I want to make three points to the Minister, the first of which relates to the impact of climate change on what is happening to the cod species. On many occasions, the Minister has tried to typify my contributions on the subject as a &#147;sod the cod&#148; approach, but I have never advocated that approach and never will. My point, and the point made by many fishermen&#151;and, increasingly, marine scientists&#151;is that cod should not be regarded as the only species in the sea. It is not the only template by which to judge our entire fisheries policy. In a mixed fishery, the obvious problem with pursuing a cod recovery plan as the central plank of fisheries policy is the fact that the related species are also affected by the reduction in effort. There will be a sub-optimal, less than ideal position, as regards the fishing effort applied to the species. It is a paradox that when one species is in very short supply, it affects other species in much more plentiful supply. The decline of cod in certain areas has resulted in a vast increase in other species, and an illustration that I have given before, and will give again, is that of the Fladden grounds. When I first contributed to these fishing debates, the Fladden was known as a shrimp fishery. It was an important fishery, particularly for the Fife fleet, but it was not a fishery of substantial value. Now, those grounds, off Arbroath, are one of the most lucrative fisheries for prawns&#151;or Scottish langoustines, as we must and should call them now&#151;in the whole of Europe. It is a vast fishery. The decline of cod, which predates on prawns and nephrops&#151;langoustines&#151;has resulted in a substantial expansion of its prey, which have become the dominant species.</p>

The Minister will argue, as would the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, that progressive negotiations have increased the prawn quota. However, it has been increased from a low as a result of the reduction in effort in the cod recovery plan and the fact that cod is the species that we measure. We have missed opportunities in the  <br>

nephrops fishery, despite those hard-won increases. There is a similar story on haddock. Those who argue that over-fishing is the most important reason for the decline in cod stocks have never been able to answer an obvious question. If it is just a question of over-fishing why, in a mixed fishery, is the haddock stock at a 30-year high and the cod stock at an all-time low? If it was merely a question of fishing effort, how could those two phenomena co-exist? There has never been a satisfactory explanation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="61214-0015.htm_para21"><a name="06121474000678">A reasonable answer has emerged to explain why, in some parts of the North sea, particularly the southern part, as several hon. Members have said, cod is in short supply. The academic research was published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs itself. The marine climate change impact partnership report is of fundamental importance, and it is outrageous that it should not yet have had an impact on decision making on cod. If, indeed, some parts of the North sea are devoid of cod as a result of climate change, no amount of instruction from the Minister for Local Environment, Marine and Animal Welfare or the European Commission will persuade the cod to reoccupy those areas if they do not want to do so. We cannot regulate the cod. They will move according to their food supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="61214-0015.htm_para22"><a name="06121474000679">That may not be the full story, and other factors may need to be taken into consideration. Given the Minister&#146;s concern for the environment, and the Government&#146;s new-found enthusiasm for tackling the impact of climate change, it is difficult to understand why they do not accept that that is part of the reason or why they have failed to assimilate into the cod recovery plan efforts to develop and progress a mixed fishery. Those are serious matters, and they deserve to be taken seriously.</p>

Members, even Scottish Secretaries should just occasionally attempt to answer the question and engage in the issue, as well as pursuing their own political points. In many of our debates, from various quarters of the House, and again by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby, the question of the common fisheries policy has been raised. Those who argue, as an experienced Conservative&#151;the hon.

If our fishermen believe that they, and they alone, are pursuing conservation measures effectively, but that other fishermen from other fleets are not pursuing those conservation measures, it is not just a question of adding to the problem. It is a question of undermining the incentive to conserve in the first place.</p>

Scotland becomes independent, we shall be within the European Union. We will inherit the same treaty obligations as this Government and previous Governments have signed. We will inherit the ones that we like, and we will inherit the ones that we dislike. That position has been confirmed by Lord Mackenzie-Stuart&#151;in work commissioned by the Conservative party, incidentally. It has been confirmed by Emil Noel and Ma(r)tre De Roux&#151;virtually every major authority on EU legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="61214-0016.htm_para6"><a name="06121474000690">The question is whether we can negotiate to reassert natural control in terms of the fisheries policy of the European Union. First, is that desirable? I say it is. The Conservatives used to say it is. They are currently in limbo. Secondly, can it be done? We would have to establish whether there was support from other Europeans for such a policy. I therefore turn to the proceedings of the Fisheries Committee of the European Parliament of 11 January 2005&#151;a committee across the member states, which overwhelmingly passed an amendment to remove exclusive competence over fisheries from the putative European constitution, indicating a substantial measure&#151;a wave&#151;of dissatisfaction with the results and consequences of the common fisheries policy across the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="61214-0016.htm_para7"><a name="06121474000691">Shamefully, this Government have never chosen to make fisheries a priority so that we could base our negotiations on such a position; indeed, no British Government have done so. The right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) the former Conservative leader who now speaks so eloquently from the Back Benches, made that point well during the election campaign, assuring us that if he became Prime Minister, he would be prepared to veto the European constitution on the basis that fisheries would not be an exclusive competence. I hope that once the Conservatives&#146; policy committee finally comes to a conclusion, similar resolve is shown by the current Conservative leader as was shown by his predecessor.</p>

conduct they have accorded a priority to fishing that has never been pursued or shared by any United Kingdom Government that I have experienced. We had substantial evidence for that, which sent shockwaves through the fishing community, when the 30-year rule unveiled documents from 1970 and 1971 about negotiations on going in the then European Community. A civil servant commenting on his own Government&#146;s policy said that in light of Britain&#146;s wider European interests, &#147;they&#148;&#151;Scottish fishermen&#151;&#147;are expendable.&#148; I can assure the hon. Member for Great Grimsby that when he seeks to establish residence and full nationality in Scotland after independence so as to continue his fight for the fishing communities, he will find a Government in Scotland who will never pursue a policy of regarding fishermen or fishing communities as expendable and will seek to assert national control as the most efficacious way of running our fisheries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="61214-0016.htm_para10"><a name="06121474000696">The Minister is known not only for his expertise in fishing but for a range of responsibilities. I said earlier that climate change had become a preoccupation of the Government. He will have been made aware of the situation in south-west Scotland whereby Scottish langoustine caught fresh in Scottish waters are being sent to Thailand to be packaged, returned to Scotland, and then sent to Europe and to other export markets. The company concerned is a well-known, substantial company with several interests across the fishing industry. I make no comment other than that it raises important questions in terms of reconciling policy on fishing with policy on climate change. After all, that round trip generates many hundreds of tonnes of apparently unnecessary carbon. Given the Minister&#146;s interest in these issues, and the absence of the constituency MP for that area, has he examined that issue and come to any conclusions? Does he believe that other aspects of Government policy, for example on carbon trading, will help us to a position whereby we get the maximum value added out of our fresh fishery?</p>

When I attended the fisheries exhibition in Brussels earlier this year, the matter was explained to me in enormous detail, with marketing charts, which proved the case that operating and trading as &#147;Scottish langoustines&#148; gained a perceptible increase in the perceived value of the product. The product was worth more when it was described as &#147;langoustines&#148; instead of &#147;prawns&#148;. &#147;Scottish langoustines&#148; gave it an even higher premium in the market. That is exactly the sort of route that the industry should follow to maximise the value added element of our products.</p>

I was approached by an English fisherman who said, &#147;Our pelagic industry is Dutch owned; much of our flatfish and roundfish industry is Dutch and Spanish owned. The French have major ownership.&#148; He also said that, 30 years&#151;almost to the day&#151;after the Deputy Prime Minister declared victory in the cod war for Britain, an Icelandic company bought up the last remaining English deep-sea fishing rights. He was finding it difficult to get figures, but estimated that perhaps 20 per cent. of the English fishery remained in the hands of English companies or coastal communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="61214-0016.htm_para14"><a name="06121474000704">The alarm bells rang because the position is much better in Scotland, where we own approximately 70 or 80 per cent. of the fishery. We want to maintain that. We do not want to be in a position whereby we not only lose historic rights but historic family businesses have their quotas removed. The route that the Minister appears to intend to take on individual transferable quotas would inevitably result in the concentration of the fishery in few hands. Given the respective power of much of the fisheries interests that have already swallowed up much of the English fishing entitlement, they are in a beneficial market position to accelerate swallowing up not only the rest of it but much of the Scottish fishing entitlement, too. I should like the Minister, who has always responded to my points reasonably over the years, to say that he understands that we are considering not only an industry but communities. Part of the vibrancy of the fishing industry is that its economic impact reverberates through local communities, because boats are family share-owned and companies are often locally owned. That is one of the great engines of growth in our rural communities. We have not had much of that growth in recent years, but if ownership was taken away, and if the structure was further undermined and destroyed, we would not have any at all. I hope that the Minister will reassure me that he understands that as he tries to find a way forward in his management policies.</p>

great respect for my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), who says that cod are not in danger of extinction, that he does not know whether cod stocks will recover, that global warming might have something to do with it, and that the cod might have gone north. However, nobody seems to be able to find the cod. One possibility is that we have caught them and eaten them. I am told that stocks have fallen in Greenland, so they are not hiding there. Wherever they are hiding, we do not seem to be able to catch them.</p>

A similar television survey in the Sound of Jura suggested that the nephrops population has been fairly stable for the past five years. Surveys in sea lochs with important creel fisheries also suggest a widespread distribution of nephrops. Without a doubt, nephrops stocks are healthy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="61214-0017.htm_para14"><a name="06121474000756">Investigation has also shown that by-catches of cod when fishing for nephrops are low in the west of Scotland. There is, therefore, no reason for any reduction in TAC or fishing effort. The west coast TAC has not been fully fished out this year, but I hope that the Commission will not use that as a reason to reduce next year&#146;s TAC. That would be illogical, because it would punish fishermen for fishing moderately instead of making an all-out effort to catch the whole TAC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="61214-0017.htm_para15"><a name="06121474000757">Despite the healthy stocks of nephrops, there is a serious threat to the prawn fleet, which is the proposed 25 per cent. reduction in days at sea. That proposal has no scientific foundation. The scientific surveys have shown that the nephrops stocks are healthy and that the cod by-catch is very low. Therefore, I urge the Minister to fight vociferously against that proposal in Brussels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="61214-0017.htm_para16"><a name="06121474000758">In the spring, when there is a concentration of spawning cod in the Firth of Clyde, the spawning area is rightly closed to fishing to preserve stocks, so there is no justification for a further cut in days at sea. The Minister must ensure at the Fisheries Council that there is no cut in days at sea for the nephrops fleet and that the nephrops TAC is set at a level no lower than this year&#146;s.</p>

interests. We heard an interesting contribution from the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox), but all hon. Members who care about the aquatic environment will be interested in a wonderful book by <i> The Daily Telegraph&#146;s</i> environment correspondent, Charles Clover, called &#147;The End of the Line&#148;. Vivid and eye opening, it argues that our passion for fish is simply unsustainable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="61214-0017.htm_para17"><a name="06121474000760">Seventy five per cent. of the world&#146;s fish stocks are now fully exploited or over fished. The most popular varieties risk extinction in the next few decades. The problem with commercial fishing is that fish are a wonderful source of protein, for poor countries&#146; swelling populations and&#151;because they are generally better for us than meat&#151;for health-conscious gourmets in richer places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="61214-0017.htm_para18"><a name="06121474000761">As our appetite for fish has grown, so has our ability to catch them. Modern gadgets such as sonar, global positioning, systems plotters, sea mapping software, echo sounding, radio beacons and bathymetric generators enable today&#146;s vast fishing boats to find and catch their prey as never before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="61214-0017.htm_para19"><a name="06121474000762">Some types of fish, such as prawns and salmon, can be farmed, but industrial fishing remains largely a matter of hunting down prey&#151;what Charles Clover calls &#147;fish mining&#148;. That is an apt term, as commercial fishermen now haul fish out much faster than they can replenish stocks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="61214-0017.htm_para20"><a name="06121474000763">As my hon. Friend the Minister noted earlier, the global outlook is extremely bleak. In many places, certain species may never recover, but some fisheries policies have been proved to work. Mr. Clover suggests that we opt for independent management, long-term transferable quotas, marine reserves and, above all, much greater openness. Ideally, that openness can be achieved by satellites and the internet revealing what every boat is doing. In other words, Mr. Clover is arguing for a Marine Bill&#151;or probably a Marine Bill-plus. If hon. Members are short of Christmas reading, I strongly recommend &#147;The End of the Line&#148; as a stocking filler.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="61214-0017.htm_para21"><a name="06121474000764">I want to focus on issues related to freshwater fisheries, especially in the context of today&#146;s welcome announcement by the Minister that the Government are to implement the bulk of the recommendations of the salmon and freshwater fisheries review carried out in 2000 by Professor Warren and her committee. The history of fisheries legislation, especially in respect of freshwater fisheries, is somewhat chequered. A previous Government commissioned the 1961 Bledisloe report, but anglers had to wait 14 years for the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975. We have had to show great patience in the six years since the Warren review, but the Government are to be commended for halving the time that it has taken them to respond.</p>

I am also grateful to the Atlantic Salmon Trust, The Salmon and Trout Association, and the Fisheries and Angling Conservation Trust. They have made representations to the Minister, who has  <br>

had the good grace to listen. They have presented a powerful case for new legislation on salmon and freshwater fisheries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="61214-0018.htm_para1"><a name="06121474000766">Fish are a key component of a healthy, freshwater ecosystem. Their presence in our rivers and lakes shows that water quality is good and that aquatic and waterside habitats are thriving. The return of salmon to rivers such as the Tyne and now even the Mersey, and the presence of fish in many other once heavily polluted waterways, demonstrates how successful efforts to clean up the damage caused by industrialisation can be affected. In rural areas, fish are sensitive to diffuse pollution from agriculture and other sources and declines in fish numbers are often a good indication of wider environmental problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="61214-0018.htm_para2"><a name="06121474000767">Efforts to conserve and improve the aquatic environment are vital to the health of fish populations, as they are for other aquatic forms of life. However, fish differ in one significant respect: they are also an important recreational resource. There are some 3.5 million to 4 million anglers in England and Wales, making angling one of the largest outdoor participation activities. Salmon, sea trout and eels are exploited for food both legally and, sadly, illegally. Those factors give fish an economic and social significance that mark them out, but they also impose threats that other types of life form do not face. For those reasons, freshwater fisheries have long been subject to specialised legislation. Legislation dates largely from the 19th century. Although it has been updated from time to time, its main elements remain unchanged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="61214-0018.htm_para3"><a name="06121474000768">I want to draw attention to six specific areas of concern that a new fisheries Bill, or new fisheries legislation enacted through regulation or secondary legislation, could deliver. Climate change in itself could, and probably will, lead to major changes in freshwater habitats. Regulators need to be able to respond to those changes and to have powers to introduce restrictions on fishing in extreme drought conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="61214-0018.htm_para4"><a name="06121474000769">Moving fish from one water or even one part of the country to another can threaten biodiversity by displacing native with introduced species. We all know about the trouble caused by the American signal crayfish in running water&#151;almost the length and breadth of England, if not farther abroad. Existing powers to control such movements are, quite frankly, inadequate and more comprehensive powers are needed. That was a central recommendation of the Warren review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="61214-0018.htm_para5"><a name="06121474000770">Salmon and sea trout stocks are still subject to commercial exploitation in net fisheries. I congratulate the Minister on successfully helping to negotiate the buying out of the Irish drift nets and action on the North sea drift net fishery, but where stocks are threatened, regulators need clear powers to reduce exploitation to safe levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="61214-0018.htm_para6"><a name="06121474000771">The eel may not be particularly fashionable. It is exploited commercially and eel stocks are now in a critical state, having fallen by more than 90 per cent. in recent years. Under existing regulation, there is absolutely no control over fishing for eels. The wildlife trusts have introduced otters into many of our river catchments. That is to be welcomed in some ways, but in others it should ring alarm bells because the eel is the  <br>

staple diet of otters. Without eels in our rivers, the otters will start to predate on indigenous species and migratory fish species.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="61214-0018.htm_para7"><a name="06121474000772">Fish thefts have been much in the news&#151;and not just thefts from European workers who are not used to our tradition of catch and release, which has caused problems and threatens community cohesion in some areas where urban fishing is important. Fish thefts also take place for commercial reasons. A specimen carp can be worth more than &#163;10,000; a carp of about 20 lb will attract an asking price of about &#163;10,000 or even &#163;15,000. The current penalty for fishing without a rod licence is &#163;2,500. The current penalty for stealing fish under the Theft Act 1968 is &#163;200. What sort of deterrent is a &#163;200 fine to gangs of fish rustlers who are in it for commercial gain?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="61214-0018.htm_para8"><a name="06121474000773">Many freshwater fish migrate in river systems. Those fish are not just trout, salmon or sea trout, but other fish moving from one area of a river to another at different times of the year to seek spawning beds. Those movements are often hindered by obstructions, such as redundant dams, mills or weirs. The Environment Agency needs new powers to tackle such obstructions.</p>

It is appropriate now, several years down the track, that my hon. Friend the Minister is able to implement that. It may have taken six years, but I congratulate the Government on delivering on an electoral promise if only by a slightly different route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="61214-0018.htm_para12"><a name="06121474000777">The greatest threat to angling comes from the destruction of the aquatic environment through loss of habitat, pollution or the excessive abstraction of water.

In fact, a syringe was plunged into the arm of one of the anglers. The Lancashire constabulary was nothing short of pathetic. Those characters were apprehended by the fishery owner.

With the new laws that enable action to be taken and criminal charges to be brought against those who seek to disrupt angling or other lawful activities, whether in the urban environment or in the countryside, it is important&#151;I want to put it on record&#151;that the police use the powers that Parliament has given them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="61214-0018.htm_para25"><a name="06121474000790">I will turn to the broader issues facing our fisheries and the sport of angling, which depends on healthy fisheries for its survival. Anglers have undoubtedly been a major custodian of the aquatic environment for at least two centuries. Fisheries management maintains and improves habitats on behalf of anglers with the knock-on benefit that what is good for fish is invariably good for other wildlife dependent on the aquatic environment. Although angling is reliant on fisheries, the part played by the sport in managing aquatic habitat should still be officially recognised by the Government as bona fide conservation. We heard earlier from other Members that at least 3.5 million people fish in freshwater and the sea each year. That means that we are delivering an economic benefit estimated at about &#163;3 billion&#151;a significant proportion of which relates to remote rural communities, where other income can be hard to find. Angling, therefore, is of enormous economic benefit, as well as sporting value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="61214-0018.htm_para26"><a name="06121474000791">More recently, there has been recognition of the benefit that angling can bring in relation to policies on crime prevention and social exclusion. Angling is a healthy outdoor recreation with a proven ability to take participants away from an increasingly frantic lifestyle and relieve the stress of modern living. Angling has proved to be an excellent conduit for inspiring disadvantaged and vulnerable youngsters to become involved in a healthy pastime and to learn respect for living creatures, with the result that significant numbers of those youngsters can be turned away from crime and drug dependency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="61214-0018.htm_para27"><a name="06121474000792">I pay particular tribute to a constituent of mine, Les Webber, who set up Angling Projects in Wraysbury, just outside London. His angling resource centre is used by the Metropolitan police, youth groups, and groups of teachers who are responsible for children who are at risk of school exclusion. Many young people have benefited from the tireless efforts of Les and his team of volunteers. I also pay tribute to Mick Watson, who has been seconded from the Durham constabulary and runs Get Hooked on Fishing in the north-east, in Bishop Auckland. He is dealing with kids from ex-mining communities&#151;kids who live in communities where the recidivism rate is monstrous and where there is a huge dependency on drugs and crime. The vast majority of kids who have gone through Mick Watson&#146;s projects have managed to find jobs and turn their lives around, and have benefited from the introduction to the sport.

That was the point of my involvement in the debate. I specifically said that I understood that the fishing industry has an enormous impact on particular communities in Britain, but we have to be responsible. I take on board what the hon. Gentleman says about fishermen in his constituency. In fact, I have been to his constituency, and I met fishermen there, went fishing with them, and spoke to them about the difficulties that they face. I am aware of the issues, but communities other than the fishing industry community ought to be represented in the debate.</p>

<p><a name="st_o452"><a name="06121474000823"><a name="61214-0019.htm_spnew8"><a name="06121474001543"><b>Mr. Carmichael:</b> As I said, I do not depart from that point of view in any way, shape or form. There has been a lot of optimism in this debate, and that is perhaps reflected in the rather thin turnout of Members from some parties. It is perhaps just part of my character, but I find optimism difficult to come by, and I find it difficult to share a lot of the optimism that is around today. The industry is in a much stronger condition that it has been in recent years, but the task facing the Minister when he goes to the December Council next week will be one of the most difficult that he has faced in recent years, and the reason for that is the difficult hand that he is given to play, following the EU-Norway negotiations last month. I briefly want to consider how that position came about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="61214-0019.htm_para6"><a name="06121474000824">The European Commission has played an unhelpful role in the debate, and there appears to be particular tension at the moment between the directorate-general for fisheries and maritime affairs, or DG fish, and the environment DG. My particular concern relates to the role of the latter, which seems to have intervened in a fairly cack-handed manner, without speaking to the regional advisory councils, industry groups or the communities concerned. As a result of that, the Commission went into the EU-Norway negotiation with an initial demand for a 25 per cent. reduction in the total allowable catch for cod. Given that the United Kingdom, the North Sea regional advisory council and all the industry bodies were looking for a roll-over, that was sheer madness. It is not new for the United Kingdom or the industry to be ignored in the debate, but it is new for the regional advisory council to be totally ignored, and it must surely concern us all. As everyone has said, it is  <br>

still very early days for the regional advisory councils, and to treat them in such a way undermines their standing in the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="61214-0019.htm_para7"><a name="06121474000825">As for the 14 per cent. cut that is now proposed, I told the Minister why that cut would be important earlier. He referred to the good year class of 2005, and I must say that I have heard the same said by fishermen in both parts of my constituency, time and again. I am told that an increasing number of young codlings have been caught in nets, and that they are to be found in many parts of different fisheries, but the consequence of a 14 per cent. reduction in the TAC for cod will be that although the fish are there, and although they will still be caught, there will be more discards than ever. The opportunity presented by the 2005 year class risks being lost, and that should concern us all. It is immensely frustrating for me to see the potential for a breakthrough, at last, in spawning stock and biomass for cod, only for that potential to be thrown away because the Commission takes an irrational position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="61214-0019.htm_para8"><a name="06121474000826">The situation is so serious that if it is apparent in the Council next week that there is no workable solution to the problem, the Minister should press the case for a reopening of the EU-Norway negotiations. Frankly, we cannot pass up the opportunity before us, because it may not come again for another 10 or 15 years, so he should not allow the Commission&#146;s irrational position to throw away the good work and the sacrifice that has been made, particularly by the Scottish white fish fleet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="61214-0019.htm_para9"><a name="06121474000827">On effort control, may I stiffen the Minister&#146;s resolve? We have heard that the initial proposal is for boats that operate with a mesh size in excess of 120 mm, there should be a 25 per cent. cut in the days available to them. I do not understand&#151;perhaps the Minister can explain&#151;how the same boats would be allowed a mere 8 per cent. cut if they were prepared to sign up to administrative penalties sanctions. That suggests that the Commission&#146;s proposals have more to do with the administrative convenience of those involved in fisheries enforcement than with the conservation of stocks. If there is a reduction from 163 days, which is the current allocation to white fish boats in my constituency, to 125 days, we will be left with an industry that is not sustainable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="61214-0019.htm_para10"><a name="06121474000828">On monkfish, a crucial species to the Shetland fleet, I again entreat the Minister to demonstrate real resolve. The monkfish working group of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries suggested in the mid-year proposal a 10 per cent. increase in the quota. That was blocked by the full Committee. The industry has presented the data on monkfish and the UK has supported it in the past. When the stocks are there, surely the case for an increase is unanswerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="61214-0019.htm_para11"><a name="06121474000829">We have already seen an 80 per cent. uptake of this year&#146;s quota for monkfish, after we carried over 10 per cent. of the TAC from the previous year. That will clearly not be available to us, and there is a damaging prospect that towards the end of next year boats in my constituency will have to tie up early because they will have exhausted their quota, unless the Minister is able to get the available 10 per cent. for them. The fish are there. In a well managed and sustainable fishery, surely the fishermen should be allowed the opportunity to catch them.</p>

It suggests that because of a change in water temperatures, it might be impossible ever to get the cod back into the mid and south North sea.

relatively small. However, it is absolutely essential to the well-being of my constituency in terms of its effects on tourism, onshore jobs and the overall economy. In fact, were it not for the fishing industry, why would anyone go to the port of Rye or the old town of Hastings for that day out or weekend away? Hastings&#146; fleet of 29 beach-launched fishing boats is the largest in the UK. It might sound pretty small, but it is big in terms of that sort of operation. About 65 fishermen are directly employed, as well as about 600 people in the wider sphere. Most importantly, those small fishing boats do exactly what the Government say should be done. They are wholly sustainable. In 2004, the Cabinet Office strategy unit&#146;s report, &#147;Net Benefits&#148; said:</p>
<a name="61214-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="06121474001044"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The overarching aim of fisheries management should be to maximise the return to the UK of sustainable use of fisheries resources and protection of the marine environment.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="61214-0019.htm_para18"><a name="06121474000837">A year ago, Hastings was officially recognised as being one of the few ports carrying out that aim. Hastings fishermen were accredited by the Marine Stewardship Council as having an eco-friendly fleet as regards three species&#151;Dover sole, herring and mackerel. That means that the small boats working out of the port are confirmed as working in a sustainable way that does not damage stocks and is environmentally sound in maintaining a healthy marine eco-system. As the Sea Fish Industry Authority has said:</p>
<a name="61214-0019.htm_brev1"><a name="06121474001045"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Hastings is as near a perfect fishery as can be devised.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="61214-0019.htm_para19"><a name="06121474000838">So here we have perfection that is likely to disappear if nothing happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="61214-0019.htm_para20"><a name="06121474000839">The problem is simply that there is not enough catch. We can argue about whether we get our fair share of the overall European pot, and I have sympathy with those who believe that we do not. My local fishermen are always telling me that they blame Ted Heath and the Conservative Government because in 1973 we gave up 88 per cent. of the waters for just 12 per cent. of the total allowable catch. However, that is history. What matters now is how we deal with the quota that we have. The amazing fact, which people do not seem to acknowledge, is that although about 50 per cent. of the manpower&#151;it is still generally manpower&#151;in the fishing industry is in the under-10 m sector and about 50 per cent. is in the over-10 m sector, 96 per cent. of the allowable catch goes to the over-10 m sector and just 3 per cent. to the under-10 m sector. That is crazy and unfair. It causes problems in industries such as that in Hastings and Rye, where the fishermen simply do not get their fair share.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="61214-0019.htm_para21"><a name="06121474000840">In the south-east&#151;Hastings is on the south coast&#151;the position is even worse. Of all the 339 licensed fishing vessels in the area, 315, or 93 per cent., are in the under-10 m sector. That sector also accounts for approximately 83 per cent. of the work force. Despite that, the allocation in the region is: for plaice, 78 per cent. for the over-10 m sector and 22 per cent. for the under-10 m sector; for cod, 69 per cent. for the over-10 m sector and 31 per cent. for the under-10 m sector, and for sole, 62 per cent. for the over-10 m sector and 38 per cent. for the under-10 m sector. It is crazy that 80 per cent. of the work force get, on average, less than 30 per cent. of the take. That is wrong. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to consider the unfair allocations carefully. The Prime Minister kindly said that he would bring the matter to the Department&#146;s attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="61214-0019.htm_para22"><a name="06121474000841">Other things can be done. One of the problems is that fishermen who leave the over-10 m sector frequently buy dormant licences from the under-10 m sector and move into it, sharing the small and diminishing proportion of the available quota, thus making the position worse. The bottom line is that my fishermen in Hastings and Rye are being asked to survive on quotas that produce &#163;80 to &#163;100 a week. They will not survive for another year if that continues. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="61214-0019.htm_para23"><a name="06121474000842">I wish my hon. Friend the Minister well in the EU negotiations and I hope that there will be greater quotas. Of course, we need to be sensible, but there are cod, and other species are available to be caught. However, there must be a fair distribution of the quotas between all sectors in the fishing industry. It would make little difference to stocks if the share for the under-10 m sector was doubled but it would make all the difference to the viability and survival of the industry, which is so important to the wider economy.</p>

My constituency of Angus has a long history of fishing through the ports of Arbroath and the smaller communities along the coast up to Montrose. That history is reflected in the fact that Arbroath and Montrose have two of the oldest lifeboat stations in the country. That shows the huge dangers in fishing that other hon. Members mentioned throughout the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="61214-0019.htm_para24"><a name="06121474000844">In my area, the main catch has always been haddock, nephrops&#151;I cannot get into the new way of calling them &#147;langoustines; I cannot get my tongue round that&#151;and crabs. Sadly, in the past 30 years, much of the industry has gone. I find myself in a similar position to the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Michael Jabez Foster), because few boats work out of Arbroath. There were about five at the last count but, when I was young, it was a bustling fishing port with a large fish market. All that has gone and what is left teeters on the brink because of the annual anxiety about quotas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="61214-0019.htm_para25"><a name="06121474000845">We have heard about proposals for a cut of up to 25 per cent. in nephrops, which would be disastrous for the local industry. I understand that there is meant to be a roll-over of the total allowable catch in the North sea and on the west coast because there is no new science this year. It is due in 2007. However, an argument has developed between committees about the proposed reduction. I urge the Minister to oppose any such reduction in the talks next week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="61214-0019.htm_para26"><a name="06121474000846">The same applies to monkfish. Again, there is talk of a decrease, against advice, when there should have been an increase in TAC. As the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) said, it is an important fishery. I urge the Minister, on behalf of Scottish interests, to resist any decrease.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="61214-0020.htm_para0"><a name="06121474000847">The annual wrangling over quotas oppresses fishing communities every year at this time. I understand that there are proposals to change the system, with some TACs being agreed earlier in the year but others continuing to be decided in December. My understanding is that most of the stocks that affect  <br>

<notus-date day="14" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>14 Dec 2006 : Column 1112</b><br>
Scottish fishermen will still be dealt with in December, so the annual depression up to Christmas will continue as we await the outcome of talks. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="61214-0020.htm_para1"><a name="06121474000848">I also urge Members to remember that it is not just the fishing industry that is important but the onshore industry that backs it up. Angus still has a buoyant fish processing industry, which produces a great deal of fish for supermarkets and other outlets up and down the country. The famous delicacy from my area is the Arbroath smokie, which can be bought in many London supermarkets. Again, that industry depends on the supply of haddock, which, as we have heard time and again, is in danger from the proposed cut in the cod by-catch. If that is put into effect, much of the industry will go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="61214-0020.htm_para2"><a name="06121474000849">I was interested in the comments of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry) and her proposal for a moratorium on fishing. She never answered the question posed by the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Michael Jabez Foster) about what fishermen were to do during such a moratorium. I urge her to consider what happened to the herring industry. In Scotland and the north of England, there was once a buoyant herring industry. People used to move around the coast following the herring. Because of difficulties with stocks, however, the industry was closed down and never recovered. When the herring came back, no one was left to fish it. We should therefore be careful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="61214-0020.htm_para3"><a name="06121474000850">My hon. Friend the Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) dealt with the question of the role of climate change at some length. I do not intend to repeat what he said, other than to urge the Minister to ensure that such important research is fully taken into account before any more damage is inflicted on an important Scottish industry. I hope that he will take that far more seriously than the Secretary of State for Scotland seems to take it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="61214-0020.htm_para4"><a name="06121474000851">Fishing communities are increasingly cynical about the scientific evidence produced by ICES, which, as we have heard, has for the fifth year in succession asked for no cod to be caught. Year after year, our fishermen have argued that cod are moving north. The new scientific evidence, which has been alluded to, seems to back that up. Certainly, there seems to be plenty of cod in the waters around Iceland and the Faroes. Perhaps the problem is not with the cod so much as with climate change. As most people recognise, however, the effect of climate change on the eco-systems of the sea is a complex matter, and it is vital that that is investigated fully. There is no point in continuing with a recovery plan if there is no chance of the cod coming back, as seems to be the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="61214-0020.htm_para5"><a name="06121474000852">I repeat the point that I made last year: haddock is suffering from efforts to save cod. If one goes into any supermarket in London, one will find loads of cod for sale, from cod nibbles to fish fingers to whole cod. I appreciate that some of that might be imported cod, and not from local sources, but if more effort was made to encourage people to eat more sustainable fish such as haddock, some of the problem might be tackled. I would be wary of some of the big supermarkets&#146; efforts to claim that they are only getting fish from sustainable stocks. A few years ago, there was a movement towards hoki as an alternative, but I understand that the hoki  <br>

<notus-date day="14" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>14 Dec 2006 : Column 1113</b><br>
industry completely collapsed as well, and one rarely sees hoki these days. Again, we should be careful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="61214-0020.htm_para6"><a name="06121474000853">There is plenty of evidence that the North sea contains lots of haddock. It is the main fishery for Scottish fishermen, and it is imperative that it is not imperilled because of an obsession with the cod by-catch, without taking into account the important new evidence on climate change. I appreciate that the Minister wants to wind up, so I shall conclude on that point.</p>

Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry), who took a lot of stick from the old sea dogs of these fisheries debates from the past and, I hope, the future. But I found her speech refreshing, because these debates are, inevitably I suppose, dominated by Members who represent mainly commercial fishing interests. Generally, they want me to go to Brussels next week and bring back more fish for their fishermen. There are more than 20 other Fisheries Ministers from around the European Union who I imagine are being asked to do exactly the same by their MPs. That is one of the reasons why we are in the mess we are in, and why our European and global fish stocks are in such a mess. I am afraid that there are inevitable political pressures for short-term gains that result in long-term pain. Although I did not agree with everything that my hon. Friend said, I hope that she will continue to research the subject and attend these debates. It was important that the voices of the people that she represents, who are deeply concerned about fish stocks in our waters and internationally, were heard. She certainly ensured that that was the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="61214-0020.htm_para7"><a name="06121474000855">I was also pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter) spoke up on behalf of the recreational fishermen in fresh water and at sea because theirs is another voice that traditionally has not been heard loudly in these debates. As my hon. Friend rightly said, they make an enormous contribution in overall terms to the economy and to conservation. They are fishermen and conservationists, which is where we want to try to move the whole of our fishing industry. My hon. Friend went through a list of issues that he hoped would be addressed by the secondary legislation that we announced today in response to the independent Warren review of 2000. I can assure him that all of those&#151;movements of non-native invasive species, salmon and trout protection, eels, blockages to spawning, feeding grounds and fish thefts&#151;will be addressed in the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="61214-0020.htm_para8"><a name="06121474000856">My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West and several other hon. Members said that we should have an early marine Bill. I want to see such a Bill as early as we can possibly get one, but I also want a Bill that is well thought out and will stand the test of time. Most hon. Members who know about this area appreciate that this country is trying to do something&#151;by taking an holistic approach to marine management&#151;that no other country has tried to do. We are trying to do that against a devolutionary backdrop, which is complex. This is the first piece of major legislation that the Government have attempted to get on the statute book with such far-reaching devolutionary complexities and repercussions. Inevitably that involves a lot of discussion with colleagues  <br>

Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) has probably been one of the hardest hit in recent years in terms of its commercial catching sector. I shall endeavour to go to the Council next week to see whether we can get some of the things she asked us to try for. We are proposing the scheme on data collection to the Commission formally and we hope to get support for that. I was very pleased to hear about the health and stability of her processing sector, which I have visited during the past 12 months, and particularly about her shellfish sector exporting all around the world. No decisions have yet been made on the points that she raised on the European fisheries fund, but we will consult about them next year and I hope that she will respond in due course.</p>

Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) and others&#151;about wind farms. One of the reasons why we desperately need this new marine legislation is so that we can resolve some of the potential conflicts in the marine environment more quickly and ensure that if fishermen are adversely affected they are at least properly compensated and proper space is allowed for them to continue their activities, because it is inevitable that we will need more renewable offshore energy. I hope that that issue can be resolved in the marine Bill.</p>

He suggested that it was time that pressure was put on other countries. We achieved progress on that at last year&#146;s Fisheries Council; the hit that we took was less than those taken by the types of fisheries operated in other countries. There is recognition at the European Commission that the UK has taken the biggest hit in terms of cod recovery, and in respect of the amount that we have reduced our fleet by&#151;two thirds in the case of the white fish fleet. We will certainly make the same arguments again; when the proposals are finalised and negotiated, we will make the point that we think that we have already contributed more than anybody else. However, it is wrong to suggest that other countries have not taken pain as well; the industries of Denmark,  <br>

the Netherlands and Ireland have. But the hon. Gentleman is right that there needs to be a level playing field.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="61214-0020.htm_para12"><a name="06121474000864">We will argue for a roll-over for cod because of the review and the state of the 2005 year class. However, I have to say that I would be being pretty optimistic if I were to allow myself to think that we will get that, given the recommendations made by the Fisheries Council and the pressure that it is under from the Environment Directorate-General.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="61214-0020.htm_para13"><a name="06121474000865">I have already dealt with the marine Bill. On funding, we will have to see what happens in the 2007 comprehensive spending review, but as long as I have been in my current job at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs I have done my best to argue the case for the marine and fisheries bit of the Department, and if the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire looks at some of the figures for the past few months he might notice that I have argued with some success on that front. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right about the regional advisory councils, and I was grateful for the thanks of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby for the financial support that we have been giving them. Contrary to the many predictions that were made by some in the industry and some in this House that they would be a talking shop, they are playing a meaningful role. As I said at that time, if they can prove themselves by offering good and sensible advice, they might be able to accrue more powers to themselves, particularly as we move towards the common fisheries policy review in 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="61214-0020.htm_para14"><a name="06121474000866">Since my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) entered the House he has become a doughty champion of the fishermen in his constituency, and he made a number of very good points. He spoke about the three-yearly deals on some species. There are already long-term management plans for some species, and a new rule was recently introduced that only in exceptional circumstances should the tax and quotas go up or down by more than 15 per cent. That was an attempt to introduce for the sector a little certainty and the possibility of long-term management. That is one of the reasons why we have achieved more stability than previously in the last two or three years, and we shall certainly try to get the Commission to stick to that.</p>

Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), raised climate change, and I addressed that in an earlier exchange. I hear what people say about the role of climate change in respect of cod in the North sea, and I know that there is a natural tendency in the industry to grasp on to that as a reason why cod has declined. But let me read from the recent report that the hon. Gentleman referred to, because he did not refer to all of it. It states that:</p>

Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey) has also written to me. I should be very happy to receive a delegation&#151;from both Members, if the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon does not mind discussing with a neighbouring Member of Parliament the issues that he raised today. We are aware of the position regarding species of ray, and we are trying to get the Commission to distinguish between the various species, so that his Bristol channel fishermen are not hit in the way that he fears. Consultation is currently under way, so we have some time to address the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="61214-0020.htm_para19"><a name="06121474000871">The hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon also raised the issue of the minimum landing size for bass that we announced earlier this year. The counter-argument was put by my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West, who, in making the case for what we are doing, wished that we had gone further. As he said, 42 cm is the size at which most female bass start to spawn, so if we allow them to grow to that size we will get not only more but bigger fish. As I said in my introduction, in the short term that will involve some pain for certain fishermen, particularly inshore fishermen in the south-west. However, just as with the registration of buyers and sellers, in the medium to long term they will benefit from the increased landing size and the increased number of bass in exactly the same way as recreational fishermen. We carried out a long public consultation, based on research, which showed that the vast majority of the beneficiaries will be our own fishermen, because the bass that are caught are moving within our own waters&#151;even within the six-mile area to which other fishermen do not have access.</p>

Our information is that there is no evidence of fishing activity by any Belgian vessels over 220 kW converted to twin otter trawling within 12 miles of the north coast of Devon and Cornwall, with the exception of one vessel in excess of 221 kW that fished with twin otter trawls for four hours in the six to 12 mile zone off the coast of Devon. The same vessel also fished for 48 hours to the north of Lundy island in the outer belt toward the end of June. The major Belgian effort in the Celtic sea occurs outside the 12 mile zone, between Cape Cornwall and Milford Haven. However, if the hon. and learned Gentleman has more up-to-date information than that, I should be happy to look at it. </p>

Friend the Member for Great Grimsby was keen to put lead in my pencil and to ensure that I do not take my eye off the ball in Brussels next week; as always, I shall try to reflect the former and not to do the latter. I take on board the points that he made about the recommendations on tax and quotas. He is absolutely right to say that, in cases where quotas have not been fully taken up in the previous year, it does not make sense to reduce the quota as a result. As he said, that introduces an incentive along the lines of, &#147;If you don&#146;t use it, you lose it.&#148; We may have some success in persuading the Commission of that argument, but we shall have to wait, as we usually have to do, until we see its first compromise proposal next Tuesday. My hon. Friend may also be interested to know that we have already defended the 2.9 per cent. figure as part of the EU-Norway agreement.</p>

Member for Banff and Buchan. He pointed to the contrast between the more optimistic analysis of the state of the industry that I gave and the briefing that he had been given by the Scottish Fisheries Federation. I suspect that that is because it was briefing him on this debate in advance of the Council negotiations and, as he knows as he has been doing this for a long time, the recommendations that are made initially tend to be quite tough and we do not usually end up in the same place. Indeed, I would not expect anything less from the Scottish Fisheries Federation. It will of course brief the hon.

At the same dinner, his chief executive, Bertie Armstrong, said that there was a new optimism in the air. I hope that the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para0"><a name="06121474000879">The hon. Gentleman also asked about ITQs. The term has been a source of some confusion because of the different ways in which ITQ systems operate around the world. The change programme that we are undergoing in our quota management system has focused on the objective of giving fishermen the benefits associated with individual quota holding. Detailed options are still being explored, but our current thinking supports a market-based approach with real-time tradeability of quotas. Our present fixed quota allocation system has many of those features already. We could get into a theological discussion about ITQs, but I hope that most people would accept that real-time tradeability is what we need if we are to put our fishing industry on a sustainable basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para1"><a name="06121474000880">The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) raised several of his constituents&#146; concerns about west of Scotland nephrops and days at sea. I hope that we will be able to improve the present proposal on both those issues, as indeed we managed to do last year, and that the significant increases in nephrops that we achieved last year are not reduced. Indeed, I hope that there will be room for further improvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para2"><a name="06121474000881">I was pleased that the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) recognised the increased strength of his industry. I remember reading in a recent edition of <i> Fishing News</i> that 80 new jobs had been created in the industry in his constituency in the past year, which is a sign of its strength. He is right to raise concerns about the conduct of the EU-Norway talks. I made our concern about that plain to the Fisheries Commissioner in my last telephone conversation with him. I am not sure that it would be sensible to torpedo the whole thing at the Fisheries Council, but it is a question of balance and I will have to take a judgment at the time. On monkfish and herring, I hope that we can achieve some improvement on the original proposals from the Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para3"><a name="06121474000882">I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye (Michael Jabez Foster) got to see my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister yesterday, and I am sure that he told my hon. Friend that the Government are reviewing the distribution of fish quotas in consultation with the industry. That includes representatives from the under-10 m vessels from his constituency and other areas of the country. Although he is right that they get only some 3 per cent. of the UK&#146;s quota, they get more than 20 per cent. of the cod and plaice quota in the English channel and, for around 80 per cent. of their total landings by value in Hastings, fishermen are not restricted by quotas or catch limits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para4"><a name="06121474000883">Last but not least I come to the hon. Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin). At least he had the grace to admit that his party did not yet have a policy, but it will, he said, produce a menu. That menu is long overdue and I look forward to receiving it soon so that we can have a proper debate about fisheries policy. He painted a rather gloomy picture, but his legs were cut off at the knees by the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen)&#151;perhaps I should call him my hon. Friend&#151;who told him that the fishermen of Brixham were very optimistic, that his local port was booming and&#151;</p>

<h3 align="center">Serious Fraud Office Investigation</h3>
<a name="ordayhd_18"><a name="61214-0021.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="06121474001076"><h5 align="left">6 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o461"><a name="06121474000886"><a name="61214-0021.htm_spmin0"><a name="06121474001552"><b>The Solicitor-General (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</b> May I first express my thanks to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to make a statement on this matter at this time? This statement relates to the investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into BAe Systems plc, and concerns payments made in relation to the al-Yamamah programme with Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para6"><a name="06121474000887">This afternoon, the SFO announced that it was discontinuing the investigation. Its statement reads as follows:</p>
<a name="61214-0021.htm_brev0"><a name="06121474001050"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Director of the Serious Fraud Office has decided to discontinue the investigation into the affairs of BAe Systems pc as far as they relate to the al-Yamamah defence contract. This decision has been taken following representations that have been made both to the Attorney-General and the Director concerning the need to safeguard national and international security.</p>
</ul><a name="61214-0021.htm_brev1"><a name="06121474001051"><ul><p class="tabletext">It has been necessary to balance the need to maintain the rule of law against the wider public interest. No weight has been given to commercial interests or to the national economic interest.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para7"><a name="06121474000888">Given the intense interest in this issue, and its market sensitivity, the Attorney-General decided to inform Parliament of the decision this afternoon, and to give a further brief explanation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para8"><a name="06121474000889">The SFO has divided its investigation of these matters into three periods. The first period, which has been termed phase 1, runs from the mid-1980s to the date that the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 came into force. That Act extended the existing law of corruption to the bribery of overseas officials. The view of the SFO in relation to those payments is that no prosecution should be brought before the coming into force of the new Act. That is a view with which the Attorney-General concurs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para9"><a name="06121474000890">The other phases concern the period after the new Act came into force. Phase 2 covers payments made about the time of the termination of the arrangements under which payments had previously been made by BAe. Phase 3 covers a longer period in which, at the moment, there is little hard evidence that payments were made. In the SFO&#146;s view, there is no guarantee that the investigation would lead to prosecution, and there are real issues to be determined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para10"><a name="06121474000891">In order to complete the investigation, significant further inquiries would be necessary that, in the SFO&#146;s judgment, would last a further 18 months. Accordingly, the SFO has concluded that, in those circumstances, the potential damage to the public interest that such a further period of investigation would cause is such that it should discontinue the investigation now. The Attorney-General agrees that there are considerable uncertainties that a prosecution could be brought. Indeed, his own view goes somewhat further: having carefully examined the present evidence, he considers that there are obstacles to a successful prosecution so that it is likely that it would not, in the end, go ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para11"><a name="06121474000892">As for the public-interest considerations, there is a strong public interest in upholding and enforcing the criminal law, in particular against the international corruption that Parliament specifically legislated to prohibit in 2001.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para12"><a name="06121474000893">In addition, and as is normal practice in any sensitive case, the Attorney General has obtained the views of the Prime Minister and the Foreign and Defence Secretaries as to the public-interest considerations raised by the investigation. They have expressed the clear view that continuation of the investigation would cause serious damage to UK-Saudi security, intelligence and diplomatic co-operation, which is likely to have seriously negative consequences for the UK public interest in terms of both national security and our highest-priority foreign policy objectives in the middle east. The heads of our security and intelligence agencies and Her Majesty&#146;s ambassador to Saudi Arabia share that assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para13"><a name="06121474000894">Article 5 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions precludes the Attorney-General and the SFO from taking into account considerations of the national economic interest or the potential effect on relations with another state&#151;and they have not done so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para14"><a name="06121474000895">Hon. Members will understand that further public comment about the case must inevitably be limited in order to avoid causing unfairness to individuals who have been the subject of investigation or any damage to the wider public interest. It is also appropriate that I should add that the company and individuals involved deny any wrongdoing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para15"><a name="06121474000897">Will the Solicitor-General confirm that the decision to discontinue the investigation was made by the director of the Serious Fraud Office and not by anybody else? Secondly, can he amplify a little on the way in which the phases in the investigation were divided. In particular, will he explain a little more the impact of any investigation in so far as it related to events before the passing of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001? As I understand what he has said, it is effectively that no criminal offence would have been committed prior to the coming into force of that Act in any event.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para16"><a name="06121474000898">As to phases 2 and 3 of the investigation, which the Solicitor-General identified, will he amplify or make it clear that the obstacles to a successful prosecution lie, as I understand his statement, in the nature of the case itself rather than in any public interest considerations&#151;a matter on which he placed considerable emphasis? Will he also reassure the House that in so far as public interest considerations have been taken into account, it is the director of the SFO himself who has taken them into consideration in coming to his overall decision?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para17"><a name="06121474000899">Finally, the Solicitor-General will be aware&#151;he has made it clear&#151;that the company and individual deny any wrongdoing, yet it is clear from the occurrence of the investigation and the Solicitor-General&#146;s points that there appears to be a potentially difficult area of interpretation&#151;let me put it that way&#151;of what may fall inside or outside the scope of criminality as determined by Parliament&#146;s passing of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.

clear in future what is in conformity with the law and what is not, will the Government look carefully into providing guidelines or other explanations so that the sort of problem that may have arisen post-2001 does not occur again? If it does occur again, it must be quite clear to any company or any individual transgressing the Act that prosecution will follow.</p>

Gentleman both for the way in which he has responded to the statement and for his compliments to the Attorney-General, which I will pass on to him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para18"><a name="06121474000901">The decision was taken by the director of the Serious Fraud Office. There were discussions with the Attorney-General and myself, but during those discussions, the director informed us that he had a view in relation to the issue. That view was his view. He told us that yesterday. He wanted to reflect on it further overnight, and he confirmed it to us about midday today. We have therefore taken the decision that we should inform Parliament of that view as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para19"><a name="06121474000902">The hon. Gentleman asks me to amplify some of the issues in relation to the phases of the investigation. He is right to say that the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 is an important dividing point. It is arguable whether the corruption of foreign officials was an offence before the 2001 Act, and it would be unsafe in this context to undertake a prosecution. It is unlikely in our view that one would be successful. On that phase, a clear view has been formed therefore that a prosecution is not likely to succeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para20"><a name="06121474000903">On the obstacles that relate to phase 2 and indeed, to some extent, to phase 3 of the investigation&#151;those are the periods after the 2001 Act has come into effect&#151;there are various legal issues, quite complex ones in relation to principle and agency, and in relation to how a prosecution might be undertaken and in what circumstances, given the nature of the Government in Saudi Arabia. We would have to take those into account, and they might affect the ability of a prosecution to succeed. There are also various issues in relation to the evidence. I have indicated in the Attorney-General&#146;s statement that some of the payments that were made immediately post the coming into effect of the 2001 Act may well have been made in particular circumstances that would not justify a prosecution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para21"><a name="06121474000904">On subsequent matters, it is clear that there is very limited information or evidence in relation to the third phase, and there is a particular problem in that obtaining that would take a very long time in our view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para22"><a name="06121474000905">On the public interest, the hon. Gentleman asks me whether it was the director of the Serious Fraud Office who took those issues into account. I can confirm that it was the director. Of course the Attorney-General and, indeed, myself also subsequently considered whether we concurred. On the public interest, we certainly concur. On the evidence issues, the Attorney-General formed a view, which was that he thought that there were some serious problems in respect of the likelihood of a long-term prosecution being undertaken in any event.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para23"><a name="06121474000906">Finally, the hon. Gentleman makes a very good point: we ought perhaps to look at how we better advise companies in relation to what are some difficult  <br>

and complex issues. He will understand that we have had little time since making the decision to consider his point&#151;indeed, he has put it to me this evening. We will have some discussions with the Department of Trade and Industry on how we might best perhaps guide companies, and perhaps come back to him later, to find out whether we can deal with some of the issues that he has quite rightly identified.</p>

Will the Solicitor-General confirm several points in relation to the burden of his statement? The first is that the inquires have not been completed&#151;indeed, they may potentially have up to 18 months to run. The second is that the balance of probabilities test, which is always the proper test, has not yet even been applied in relation to whether there is a more than 50 per cent. chance of conviction in this case. The third is that, in a case involving a &#163;20 million slush fund allegation in relation to a &#163;10 billion Eurofighter contract with Saudi Arabia, the public interest judgment has been arrived at after representations by the Saudi Government to the British Government and our ambassador in Saudi Arabia, and from our ambassador, our Prime Minister, our Foreign Secretary and our Secretary of State for Defence to Law Officers and the Serious Fraud Office. The director of the Serious Fraud Office is having to balance the public interest within hours or days of the most heavy pressure and advice from a foreign Government, as well as from the head of the Administration in the United Kingdom.</p>

Even if it would have been difficult to go back before 2001 and 2002, when the Act came into force, should not all activities since 2002, at the latest, be investigated to a conclusion? That would give confidence that when we vote for something and say something in this Parliament, we mean it and we do not change our minds when there are suddenly political difficulties. Will the Solicitor-General confirm that there was an ultimatum from the Saudi Government, that they mentioned 10 days for us to make a decision and call off the investigation, that they told us that if we did not, they would not continue with conversations&#151;indeed that they have stopped talks already&#151;and that the British Government are clearly influenced by the fact that the French want to compete for the contract?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para25"><a name="06121474000909">Lastly, whatever the answers to those detailed questions, is not the truth that the balance between the rule of law and the public interest&#151;in a country where we have already made one recent decision that is arguably against the rule of law: to invade a foreign country&#151;must be that we stand by the rule of law and that our defence industry stands by it so that it is not just seen to be acting without corruption, but is in no way able to be suspected of acting with corruption?

defence policy is that we act according to the rule of law, and that investigators investigate to a conclusion and are allowed to make an unpressured decision about whether a company, however important&#151;and however important our international interest&#151;has broken the law. Is that not the key point and have not the Government clearly failed on that today?</p>

<p><a name="st_o465"><a name="06121474000910"><a name="61214-0021.htm_spmin2"><a name="06121474001556"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> I object to the tone of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments in relation to the implication that the director of the Serious Fraud Office has somehow made a political decision. He has made a judgment based on the rule of law and the balancing test that he is required in law to use in relation to the public interest and the prosecution of a case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para26"><a name="06121474000911">The hon. Gentleman asked me a number of questions and I will try to deal with each of them. It is the case that the director and, subsequently, the Attorney-General and I, had to balance the issue of national security, and the damage that might be caused to national security if we took a particular decision, against the importance of dealing with the serious allegations that were made. There is also the fact that the investigation of those allegations could take 18 months and that during that period considerable damage might be caused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para27"><a name="06121474000913">At the end of the 18 months, it might well have been likely&#151;indeed, the Attorney-General reached the view that there were obstacles to a successful prosecution&#151;that in any event, no prosecution would have taken place. In such circumstances, weighing the importance of national security in this case against the allegations, the 18-month period and the fact that there would have been no guarantee that a prosecution would have taken place at the end of the 18 months, a proper decision had to be made by the director of the Serious Fraud Office. I would defend both the way in which he made that decision and the decision that he made. The public interest requires the director of the Serious Fraud Office to make a balanced judgment&#151;he has done that. He is independent and he has made his decision in accordance with the rule of law and his obligations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="61214-0021.htm_para28"><a name="06121474000914">The hon. Gentleman seems to take the view, for various reasons of principle, that no matter the consequences or the damage to national security, he would favour continuing the investigation. I have to tell him that I support the decision of the director of the Serious Fraud Office and the Attorney-General. This is a matter not of political difficulties, but of making proper decisions according to the rule of law.</p>

Will he tell me what steps will be taken to advise the Ministry of Defence, as the United Kingdom partner in the negotiations with the Saudi Arabian Government on defence contracts involving Eurofighter Typhoon, of the conclusions that have been reached? Will a similar communications exercise be conducted with the Saudi Arabian Government? Will he confirm that the outcome of the announcement that he has made vindicates the statement of BAE Systems that it had conducted its business relationships correctly? Will he also say&#151;</p>

That suggests that the most important point that the Government need to address is that raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve). Will the Solicitor-General reiterate that we need a thorough review of the way in which this law is operating? If national security is to have a bearing on the activities of the Serious Fraud Office in this field, that should be much more clearly stated as such. The Serious Fraud Office should not be tempted to go on these fishing expeditions unless it is absolutely clear that prosecutions are both likely and in the national interest.</p>

He pejoratively described the investigation as a fishing expedition. I do not take that view, having had detailed briefings from the SFO team that has looked into the matter.

Therefore, when he had the information, he was able to make the appropriate balancing tests that are required of him under the law and under the obligations of a prosecutor.

I am very grateful to Mr. Speaker for selecting this as the topic for the Thursday Adjournment debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="61214-0022.htm_para7"><a name="06121474000945">I shall speak briefly about Christian churches in this country, their fabric and their survival. I make no apology for that. This is a Christian country and we are approaching one of the greatest of the Christian festivals. In 10 days, churches throughout the land will be full of those who have come to celebrate Christmas. I am delighted about that, and I am sure the Minister, too, is delighted, as a former chorister of some distinction in one of our cathedrals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="61214-0022.htm_para8"><a name="06121474000946">In a fortnight, people will go to church in unprecedented numbers. Many of them may go at Easter and many may go at the harvest festival in the autumn. They are what I would call festival Christians, and I make no criticism of that. Many of them will go, as I had to go today, on sadder occasions, to funerals, which is why I am wearing this tie, or on more joyful occasions, to weddings and baptisms. Most of those who go have little knowledge of how our churches are funded. Successive research has shown that many people who regard the parish church as an extremely important landmark and a focal point in town or village think that it is sustained financially out of the rates or the taxes, or by Government funds of one sort or another. I hope that in a fortnight&#146;s time many of them will dig deeply into their pockets, because although these are public buildings&#151;the most important public buildings in our country, in many ways&#151;they receive very modest help from central Government, and that indirectly.</p>

When the millennium was approaching, I urged my Government&#151;and then, as it got closer and we had a change of Government, the Minister&#146;s Government&#151;to forget the dome and to set up an endowment fund to ensure that throughout this century we would not need to worry about the survival of our churches&#146; fabric. However, both Governments decided to have the dome and probably spent &#163;700 million more than they would have done had they followed my suggestion, but there we are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="61214-0022.htm_para10"><a name="06121474000948">I have a long history of involvement in this matter. The first private Member&#146;s Bill that I introduced in this House way back in 1971&#151;the Historic Churches Preservation Bill&#151;had as its aim getting state aid for historic churches. At that stage, it was not available in any form. In 1976, when that campaign was nearing a successful conclusion, I published a book called &#147;Heritage in Danger&#148;, which focused on those churches and other threats to our built heritage and our natural environment.</p>

compliments to those who were responsible. Since then, we have had the creation of English Heritage, the creation of the lottery and, under this Government, a Chancellor who for the first time has recognised the burden of VAT on those who have to pay towards the restoration of historic buildings. Although they still have to pay it, which is quite a problem, he has created a scheme whereby it is almost entirely reimbursed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="61214-0022.htm_para12"><a name="06121474000950">That is very good and it should be put on the record, but we still have a great problem. We have in this country 16,000-plus churches of the Church of England, more than 13,000 of which are listed, 2,750 or more Roman Catholic churches, only 10 per cent. of which are listed&#151;although if one looks at the wonderful book that English Heritage has produced over the past few weeks called &#147;Glimpses of Heaven&#148;, one realises how many more Roman Catholic churches should be listed&#151;and slightly more than 3,000 non-conformist churches and chapels, about 20 per cent. of which are listed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="61214-0022.htm_para13"><a name="06121474000951">The problem is that the existing grant schemes are heavily oversubscribed. English Heritage estimates that the shortfall over the next five years could be as much as &#163;500 million. That is why it has launched an extremely splendid campaign called &#147;Inspired!&#148; to draw attention to the importance of our parish churches, in particular, but religious buildings of other denominations too, and has asked the Government to provide over the next five years a sum of &#163;26.5 million, which works out at&#163;8.8 million a year, to allow it to conduct a number of studies into how best we can tackle the problem and ensure the survival of those buildings into the next century and beyond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="61214-0022.htm_para14"><a name="06121474000952">English Heritage is not asking for, and I am not asking for, the Government to take over responsibilities for religious buildings. I am, and always have been, implacably opposed to that, because it takes away a sense of local pride, patriotism and ownership. If one goes to some of the great churches of France, where the state has responsibility, one sees that they are wonderfully presented and preserved, but we all know the musty smell that greets us when we enter some lovely but small and obscure churches in French villages, where there is no local responsibility and therefore no incentive to run campaigns to raise funds. Such campaigns often bring a community together, as I know from experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="61214-0022.htm_para15"><a name="06121474000953">I am a great believer in trusts. I am president of the Staffordshire county trust and vice-president of the Lincolnshire&#151;the county of my birth&#151;county trust. Through bicycle rides and other fundraising efforts, those trusts raise money to preserve our historic heritage of churches. That is tremendously important and should be encouraged, not discouraged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="61214-0022.htm_para16"><a name="06121474000954">It is also important to encourage those who go to church at Christmas and during the great festivals to dig deep into their pockets. More churches should erect graphic boards, pointing out what it costs to maintain and run a church. Anything that is old, lovely and fragile is expensive to maintain. Year in, year out, the small and sometimes dwindling congregations find that cost a genuine imposition. Demographic change and population movements have led to many parishes having small congregations. There has also been a falling-off in the ordained ministry. Whereas, in my youth, it was normal for a village to have its resident  <br>

vicar or rector, that is now the exception rather than the rule. Many of those men and women are responsible for not only two but sometimes five, six and even more churches. They need lay help, which they receive, but they have to do far more than simply raise money to maintain the fabric.</p>

I should like to think that the Minister recognises that I am not making a party political point. His party has the honour of providing the Government of the moment; I hope that mine might in the near future. However, whether or not that happens, the problem remains. I want a greater recognition of the problem, building on the achievements to which I referred&#151;the introduction of state aid, the creation of English Heritage and its funds and the lottery.

Their crosses have long since been bent or broken off; the dome with its peeling paint reveals its rusty rib cage; weeds grow on the roofs and in the cracks of the walls... People have always been selfish and often evil. But the angelus used to toll and its echo would float over the village, field and wood.

However, if we do not identify those buildings properly, and ensure that they are fully utilised, for a variety of purposes but primarily for worship, and if we do not all play our part, voluntarily and individually, but above all through this place and in government, that will be their fate. How could we say that we lived in a civilised nation if we allowed the village churches of Norfolk or Lincolnshire, the Somerset towers and the churches at the heart of many of our country towns and big cities to crumble into ruin?</p>

a meeting of the all-party arts and heritage group and the all-party historic churches and chapels group, a Labour peer, whom I will not name, and who pronounced firmly that he was not a believer, also committed himself completely to the cause of keeping those buildings up. The chairman of the historic churches and chapels group, the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)&#151;I hope that he will soon be restored to health and back among us&#151;is a self-proclaimed atheist but shares the affection that I believe that the Minister has, that I have and that I hope that my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="61214-0023.htm_para4"><a name="06121474000962">Let me associate myself with the remarks that the hon. Gentleman has made. He and I share a love of churches and of choral music: we were together only last week at a Friends of Cathedral Music event in the House. He therefore knows that the topic is close to my heart. I am glad that we have an opportunity to discuss the matter in the House, following last week&#146;s worthwhile debate in another place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="61214-0023.htm_para5"><a name="06121474000963">During my time in this post, I have been pleased to visit a good number of churches in an official capacity. I am also pleased that one of the first things that I was able to do was to convene a Church Heritage Forum, in which I heard at first hand from denominational representatives and heritage specialists what they saw as the issues facing churches in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="61214-0023.htm_para6"><a name="06121474000964">We should not need to remind ourselves of all the reasons that our churches, cathedrals and other religious buildings are so significant to communities. Their contribution to the nation&#146;s heritage is unique, with some dating back more than 1,000 years, and they are witnesses, one could say, to the changing generations of this country. As the hon. Gentleman has indicated powerfully, they act as a spiritual home for many people across the country. They are therefore key to our sense of place and belonging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="61214-0023.htm_para7"><a name="06121474000965">As those buildings have been passed down through the generations, it now falls to us as the current guardians to ensure that they are in a good state to be passed on to those who follow us. The hon. Gentleman is therefore right: while we have seen some successful and iconic advances, particularly in our urban churches, a real challenge exists in rural areas such as Norfolk and Oxfordshire. We all need to work together to preserve our rural churches and find new uses to contribute to those buildings, because of the challenges presented by falling congregations. I was at a Churches Tourism Association conference three weeks ago and heard of how churches are planning for new uses. Part  <br>

of that is putting church tourism on a firmer footing&#151;just one of many growth areas where new initiatives are being developed and new audiences sought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="61214-0023.htm_para8"><a name="06121474000967">People attached to churches, particularly in rural areas, perform a variety of vital activities and services: supporting elderly people, providing child care, counselling or advice. They help to hold communities together. A major piece of research funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs recently confirmed that. We know that this is taking an innovative turn also, with churches hosting post offices, village shops, farmers markets and even cashpoint machines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="61214-0023.htm_para9"><a name="06121474000968">We are not just talking about services of a social nature, but many cultural activities such as musical events, drama or art exhibitions. We know that the churches are, in line with the &#147;Building Faith in our Future&#148; agenda, looking for new ways to engage with local communities. We need to find new uses for churches that will help, in the longer run, to preserve the fabric by bringing in new streams of funding, new people and new partnerships. Churches matter to more people than just churchgoers; let us plug in to the wider support for churches that already exists in the nation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="61214-0023.htm_para10"><a name="06121474000969">As churches look to engage more with communities, perhaps by adapting buildings to make them more welcoming or user-friendly, the Government are keen to help by reducing the administrative burdens of such works. Under the ecclesiastical exemption, the major denominations are already exempt from the need to obtain listed building consents for works. It is a system that works well in protecting the nation's historic church buildings, partly due to the wide range of knowledge and expertise represented in the denominations' own systems, most of which is given voluntarily.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="61214-0023.htm_para11"><a name="06121474000970">Further to that, the Government have been reviewing the way in which we protect all our historic buildings. The heritage protection review, which will shortly be the subject of a White Paper, will, among other measures, streamline those consents regimes that still apply to churches. It fact it will make the system that applies to all historic buildings more simple, more flexible and more open. Churches will be able to opt in to heritage partnership agreements. Those could remove the need for repeated applications for certain types of work that either crop up regularly, or will be needed at separate sites within, say, a diocese. New listing descriptions for churches will help congregations to understand what is significant about their own specific building when considering proposals for development or change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="61214-0023.htm_para12"><a name="06121474000971">Owning any historic building brings responsibilities and burdens and that is certainly true of looking after a church. We need to recognise the costs of caring for a building that serves not just the local congregation, but the local community. The church is also likely to be the oldest and most intricate building in the area. Many churches are in a vulnerable state. That is not just a fabric maintenance issue; it is also about the size and resources of congregations. Many churches have just a handful of adult worshippers, each perhaps managing a number of voluntary positions within the church and community.</p>

looked like, why it becomes vulnerable and which areas of the country are most likely to be affected. Like any historic building, the church needs people who are dedicated to its maintenance. Let us not underestimate the importance of people&#146;s loyalty and love for their buildings. The work of the many volunteers up and down the country is beyond value. People sometimes look to the situation in other countries, where Governments perhaps take a more direct role in funding of church buildings, but as the hon. Gentleman suggested we can tell when such buildings have lost the love and the sense of ownership that helps to keep other buildings going.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="61214-0023.htm_para14"><a name="06121474000973">The hon. Gentleman also set out the legal responsibilities for the maintenance of church buildings; they clearly lie with national and local church bodies. However, I can say that, no matter on whom the legal responsibility lies for the upkeep, the Government do have a role to play and they have been helping. I am glad that he acknowledges that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="61214-0023.htm_para15"><a name="06121474000974">The listed places of worship grant scheme has given out over &#163;50 million since 2001, and over 8,500 buildings have benefited. Earlier this year the Government showed that they had listened to the churches&#146; concerns, and added professional fees and repairs to some fixtures and fittings to the scope of the scheme. In relation to that problem, we continue to negotiate in Europe to be able to offer permanently reduced VAT on church repairs. The joint English Heritage and Heritage Lottery Fund scheme has paid out almost &#163;90 million, and over 1,000 buildings have benefited. Cathedrals have received &#163;42 million since 1991, and dedicated support is continuing. For three years the Wolfson Foundation is generously matching the English Heritage contribution. The Government, with a &#163;3 million annual grant, remain the majority funder of the Churches Conservation Trust, which cares for the most significant of our redundant churches. I am very pleased that, following negotiations, the Heritage Lottery Fund last week committed to continue to support churches for the foreseeable future, with a &#163;20 million fund for 2007-08 and a dedicated places of worship scheme until 2013. Let me at this point also pay tribute to the work of the county historic churches trusts for all the hard work that they have put in to providing grant funding for churches&#151;and I should point out that the hon. Gentleman is president of the Staffordshire trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="61214-0023.htm_para16"><a name="06121474000975">I welcome the launch earlier this year of the English Heritage &#147;Inspired!&#148; campaign, which echoed the need for a partnership approach that I had already picked up from my Church Heritage Forum late last year. The campaign recognised that the Government could not be expected to plug the whole of what is seen as a funding gap. It put forward five &#147;solutions&#148; that would help to manage the size of the future repair bill and build capacity among the churches to help address current and future issues. The solutions are sensible plans of action, and they would certainly make a difference. Some of them are already being put in place by English Heritage, and the results are good. Timely maintenance will, of course, prevent more costly repair in the long run. I am pleased that English Heritage has already been piloting church maintenance programmes in London and Suffolk, and from next year it will do so in Gloucester.

circuits or synods would certainly make a difference. Congregations could be supported in identifying repair priorities and opportunities for alternative use, and a more strategic vision for alternative use across an area could be developed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="61214-0023.htm_para17"><a name="06121474000977">Some of the &#147;Inspired!&#148; solutions are themselves inspired by pockets of good practice in different areas of the country. Last week in another place we heard calls for better access to information on the range of help available. We are looking at whether there might be a role for Government in making sure that the guardians of all our listed religious buildings are able to tap into the expertise that is available.</p>

It is, of course, central to all the Government&#146;s historic environment policies. I should like to put on the record my appreciation of its valuable work, a sentiment that I was able to pass on personally to the commissioners only yesterday. However, although I am sympathetic on the funding issue the hon. Gentleman will understand that I am unable at this time to commit to any increases in Government support for English Heritage as we are about to enter a comprehensive spending review period.

these issues ought to bear in mind the suggestion of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, which questioned in its summer report whether there might also be a greater role for denominations in funding local teams to carry out some basic maintenance and survey functions among their own churches. That seems a good idea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="61214-0023.htm_para19"><a name="06121474000979">Part of ensuring the future of all historic churches is making sure that there are those with the appropriate skills to do the technical work in a historically faithful way.
