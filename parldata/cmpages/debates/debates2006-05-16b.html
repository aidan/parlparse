yesterday to explain her absence and I am grateful to them for their
understanding.</p><p><a name="06051658000028">Cancer

Hodgson:</b> I welcome the fantastic progress in reducing
cancer waiting times through the dedication and commitment of health
service professionals and the extra investment in the NHS. However, is
the Minister aware that cancer waiting times after first treatment
remain a problem for all cancers, including prostate and bowel cancer,
that the waiting times for endoscopy and colonoscopy have been a
problem in the past and that, if the bowel cancer screening programme
is to be successful, it is important that sufficient resources are put
in
place?</p><p><a name="06051658000030"><b><a name="06051658000254">Ms

absolutely agree. The problems that are due to follow-up treatments
often involve radiotherapy. We have done a lot to improve radiotherapy
provision. Of course, if it is a first treatment, it counts in the
waiting times anyway, but there are unacceptably long waits for the
second stage of treatment in certain parts of the country, so we have
been increasing the number of radiotherapy staff, both in post and in
training. We have been making better use of existing staff and new
investment in radiotherapy treatment facilities. For example, the
number of linear accelerators has increased by about 50 per cent. There
is some way to go, but I can assure my hon. Friend that we take this
very seriously. We are doing what we can to improve the situation, but
that is against a background of increased improvements over a number of
years.</p><p><a name="06051658000031"><b><a name="06051658000255">Michael
Gove (Surrey Heath) (Con):</b> The Minister will be aware of
the direct threat to the upper gastro-intestinal cancer unit at Frimley
Park hospital in my constituency, not least because I have written to
her Department three times to request a meeting on behalf of Surrey,
Berkshire and Hampshire MPs, and three times I have been told no. In
the last letter that I received from the Minister of State, Department
of Health, the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint), I was told
that a review of that decision would not be pre-empted, but I
discovered the day after the letter was sent that interviews were
taking place and decisions being made that explicitly pre-empted that
review. Why cannot we have a meeting to ensure that that vital service,
which contributes so much to health in the south-east, does not face
imminent
dismantling?</p><p><a name="06051658000032"><b><a name="06051658000256">Ms
Winterton:</b> We must be absolutely clear about the process
that takes place when we consider changing some of the cancer
facilities. This is a classic example where cancer networks must look
at some of the improving outcomes guidance, which shows that putting
some of the cancers together in specialist centres actually saves
lives. There is very clear evidence for that, and in a sense to ask for
political interference would be wrong in a process that should be
looked at very closely by those involved in the networks, which include
clinicians, patient groups and representatives of the NHS. It is
important that the review proposals are looked at very closely by the
networks involved, and that process takes place for very good clinical
reasons.</p><p><a name="06051658000033"><b><a name="06051658000257">Jessica
Morden (Newport, East) (Lab):</b> I, too, welcome the decrease

forgotten when we allocate

Winterton:</b> My hon. Friend is right to say that it is
important that some of the high-profile cancers are not given more
attention than some of the less well known ones. That is why we
constantly review things. That can be done through the clinical cancer
networks and through the guidance that is issued by the Department in
conjunction with the profession to make sure that the very best care is
available for patients who suffer in some of those

in excess of &#163;15 billion. Meanwhile, Westmoreland general
hospital&#146;s coronary care unit in my constituency faces an
uncertain future because of deficits that pale in comparison to those
overspends. Will the Minister commit today to a full, independent,
technical and financial audit of the project to ensure that public
money is spent on the public&#146;s
priorities?</p><p><a name="06051658000038"><b><a name="06051658000262">Andy
Burnham:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that this is
indeed a major investment in the national health service. However, in
contrast to NHS projects of the past, payment will be made only when
the project is delivered. When the project is delivered, it will go
further in improving patient care in the NHS. It will deliver more
benefits to patients. I have looked at the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
websites, where I read:</p><a name="06051658000242"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Local MP Tim Farron is
leading national calls for an independent

the self-appointed leader of the national debate on this important

technology has been NHS Direct. Chorley was the pioneer of NHS Direct,
but we found out today that the Chorley centre is about to close, along
with Bolton and Preston. Who is in charge of the Department&#151;the
Ministers or the chief executive? There is something wrong when people
in Preston and Bolton who are being made redundant may be allowed to go
to a new site, yet the people of Chorley have not been given the same
assurance. Why not? [Hon. Members: &#147;Hear,

success of NHS Direct, which is dealing with a huge volume of calls
this year&#151;6.8 million. However, I recognise the concerns that my
hon. Friend has raised and I understand why he is expressing them,
given the news that has been put out today. NHS Direct has to take
decisions to make sure that it can offer a sustainable service, given
that it is handling an increasing volume of calls and dealing with in
excess of 9 million internet inquiries every year.

information service at the Royal London Homeopathic hospital&#151;the
Complementary and Alternative Medicine Specialist Library. I have no
doubt that he will have been fully briefed about that. That new
service, which is extremely important and is backed by the Government,
has one problem: many of the therapies provided by that one-stop shop
are not yet available on the NHS. What is he going to do about that and
what is he going to do about the alternative therapies that are
available on the health service, such as homeopathy, which Nye Bevan
used, but which is not widely understood or known about in parts of the
country?</p><p><a name="06051658000043"><b><a name="06051658000266">Andy
Burnham:</b> I am well aware of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
long-standing interest in these matters. Without a shadow of a doubt,
he must have a glass raised to him at the Holland and Barrett annual
shareholders meeting each year. I am not trivialising his interest and
he raises an important matter, so I will examine it in respect of the
IT systems and the other issues that he raises and write to
him.</p><p><a name="06051658000044"><b><a name="06051658000267">Margaret
Moran (Luton, South) (Lab):</b> Is the Minister aware that
many Labour Members believe that the national programme will be
transformatory for the health service, especially due to electronic
prescribing and care service records? Will he ensure that IT systems
are compatible and, in that context, investigate the Luton and
Dunstable hospital and the Royal Free hospital? Electronic records have
to be taxied between those two hospitals because of the mismatch of
electronic data links. Will he ensure that there is compatibility so
that we have a better patient
service?</p><p><a name="06051658000045"><b><a name="06051658000268">Andy
Burnham:</b> My hon. Friend makes an extremely important
point, and perhaps the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim
Farron) would do well to listen to it. The programme is being procured
at a national level exactly to ensure that we get value for money with
the systems and so that the systems are compatible. A key benefit of
the new system will be that a patient&#146;s record will be instantly
available to a clinician wherever that patient presents in the NHS. I
am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that that will be an enormous
step forward that will end some of the paper chase that goes on in the
NHS. It is a clear expression of why the system will deliver
improvements to patient care and value for
money.</p><p><a name="06051658000046"><b><a name="06051658000269">Mr.
Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b> I welcome the
Minister to his first Health
questions.</p><p><a name="06051658000047">The
Minister got right to the point about the IT system when he said that
it was about delivery. The NHS needs an electronic patient record, but
can he 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 833</b><br>explain why it is more than two years late? The NHS also needs
electronic prescriptions. According to the Government&#146;s targets,
some 600,000 prescriptions should be transferred electronically each
day, but the figure is in fact only about 13,000. The opportunity to
make electronic bookings should mean that there are some 250,000 such
bookings a month, but in fact there are only 20,000 a week. Can the
Minister explain why the delivery about which he talks has so far
failed lamentably on the Government&#146;s own
targets?</p><p><a name="06051658000048"><b><a name="06051658000270">Andy
Burnham:</b> I am grateful for both the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s welcome and his broad recognition that modernising
the national health service in such a way is the right thing to do.
Rather than claiming that there has been no delivery, I can tell him
that more than 1 million prescription messages have been issued via the
new system and that 325,000 hospital appointments have been booked
electronically. A key aspect of the way in which the programme is
working is that the NHS pays only when the service has been delivered.
The NHS has thus learned from past IT procurement and is doing the
right thing by paying only when benefit is released to the service. I
hope that the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues will support that
approach.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06051658000017">NHS

Minister of State, Department of Health (Caroline Flint):</b>
Investment of &#163;1 billion in pay reform, including for
nurses&#146; pay, has delivered a high earnings growth of 2.8 per
cent. between October 2004 and October 2005. We have agreed a 2.5 per
cent. pay uplift for 2006-07, which will again deliver strong earnings
growth this year. This is a good deal for nurses. A newly qualified
nurse will earn &#163;19,166, which is a 55 per cent. rise since
1997. I believe that that compares favourably with a newly qualified
primary school teacher earning
&#163;19,161.</p><p><a name="06051658000051"><b><a name="06051658000273">Mr.

per cent. increase since 1997 and that the salary is just more than
&#163;19,000. A specialist nurse gets &#163;23,000, so will the
Minister outline whether &#147;Agenda for Change&#148; will give
newly qualified nurses the opportunity to go on to that higher salary
band?</p><p><a name="06051658000052"><b><a name="06051658000274">Caroline
Flint:</b> My hon. Friend raises an important point.
&#147;Agenda for Change&#148; is about completely transforming the
way in which the pay bands operate to ensure that there is equal pay
for equal value and, importantly, to give nurses the opportunity to
progress up the scale. A senior specialist nurse can earn up to
&#163;31,000 and the salary for a nurse consultant rises up to
&#163;60,000. Part of &#147;Agenda for Change&#148; is job
evaluation so that the skills and knowledge of individuals are examined
and people can acquire skills and knowledge in order to move up the pay
band.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 834</b><br><p><a name="06051658000053"><b><a name="06051658000275">Daniel
Kawczynski (Shrewsbury and Atcham) (Con):</b> Macmillan nurses
at the Royal Shrewsbury hospital earn &#163;5,000 less although they
are on the same pay grade as similar nurses in Wolverhampton, which is
just 15 miles away. We are concerned that, within such small regional
areas, there is such a large difference in pay, with a possibility of
poaching. What can the Minister do to reassure me on
that?</p><p><a name="06051658000054"><b><a name="06051658000276">Caroline
Flint:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman raised that point
in the Opposition day debate last week. He should understand that, for
the first time, there is a pay band that covers both nurses and
non-medical staff. Key to that is the job evaluation. He should be
asking at local level about the skills and knowledge that are required
of Macmillan nurses in one trust as opposed to another. We do not have
regional pay scales, but the purpose of &#147;Agenda for
Change&#148; was to have that job evaluation. Key to his point is the
need to see what is expected of Macmillan nurses in one area and
whether that is different from another area, and to take up the issue
locally. That is important in defining what pay nurses of different
types get in the
area.</p><p><a name="06051658000055"><b><a name="06051658000277">Mr.
David Anderson (Blaydon) (Lab):</b> What we just heard was
good news, but is it good news if people looking for jobs do not have
access to the benefits of &#147;Agenda for Change&#148;? Has the
Minister had any discussions with the unions or the employers about the
possibility of setting up a national redeployment, training and
relocation scheme? Hopefully, that would address the point raised by my
hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) and mean that no one who
wants to stay in the NHS has to leave
it.</p><p><a name="06051658000056"><b><a name="06051658000278">Caroline
Flint:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that question. He is
absolutely right. I am pleased to say that NHS Jobs, which acts as a
billboard for vacancies in the health service&#151;a couple of
hundred jobs for nurses are on the board currently&#151;will provide
exactly what he says, which is a redeployment service for those who may
find themselves without a job as changes take place in hospitals. I
reassure him that, where trusts talk about job changes or losses, there
might be some compulsory redundancies, but that would be a last resort
and kept to a minimum. It will mostly be a case of freezing posts and
making less use of agency and temporary staff. I am pleased to say that
NHS Jobs will look at redeployment
opportunities.</p>

included on the list of the six key national NHS priorities specified

key principles for financial management for health trusts for this

have taken place in spending on mental health services&#151;an
increase of something like &#163;1.6 billion over the past five
years. Also, if we consider what happened last year, again, 11 out of
84 trusts reduced planned expenditure. They were going to spend
&#163;384 million more than they spent the year before, but in fact
they spent &#163;368 million. That means that overall expenditure on
mental health has increased. It is clear, through the targets that have
been set and the local delivery plans, that the actions we have adopted
contributed towards that increase in mental health spending. Mental

of the many changes made under the Government to the delivery of mental
health care is the greatly increased emphasis on care in the community.
In Berkshire, I believe that the spending figure is about
&#163;200,000 less than was going to be spent, so it is not quite the
same as what he suggested. I will look into his point, but I understand
that the figure is about 0.1 per cent., because the overall budget is
&#163;77 million. There have been improvements in his area, and I

when we looked at planned and actual expenditure last year, the
difference was &#163;16 million, but that does not mean that overall
expenditure did not increase on mental health services. It did, and it
has done so consistently in the years since the national service

it is due to break even in 2006-07, but it has been forced to make cuts
and close that ward purely because of the financial deficits that
affect the rest of the NHS in Shropshire.
Why?</p><p><a name="06051658000067"><b><a name="06051658000289">Ms

Gentleman said, the trust will break even this year, so I am not
certain why he said that that in-patient ward will be closed.
In-patient wards are often closed because services are provided in the
community, thus reducing the need for in-patient beds. That may be the
case in his constituency, or some of the patients may be transferred
elsewhere because that is more appropriate. However, he should accept
that in some instances&#151;I will, of course, look at the point that
he made&#151;those decisions are made for good reasons, as the fact
that there are teams in the community may mean that there is less need
for in-patient beds.</p><p><a name="06051658000068"><b><a name="06051658000290">Steve

disappointed tomorrow, when <i>Pulse</i> magazine brings to Parliament

this time last year the Secretary of State was 80 per cent. out on the

figure of &#163;620 million, he ought to come to the House and tell
us the actual unaudited figures at the year-end, rather than
speculating on the basis of six-monthly figures. The consequences of
that, and of paying off such deficits, are apparent across the country.
Job losses were announced at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust on

the operating framework said in January&#151;that every organisation
must plan to recover their deficits from 2005-06 and balance their
books this year? Or is it, as the Secretary of State told me in April,
that every organisation with an overspend must improve this year, and
that by the end of the financial year, monthly expenditure should be
covered by monthly income? Those are two completely different financial
regimes. Which is it?</p><p><a name="06051658000110"><b><a name="06051658000328">Andy

decisions are being made on the ground in his constituency and others,
the purpose of those is to get the NHS into a stable position so that
it is living within its means. There are not widespread redundancies
across the piece&#151;as I have mentioned, many parliamentary
colleagues have a surplus in their health economy. The problem is
focused on the 7 per cent. of NHS organisations that are bearing the
vast majority of the deficit. On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question
about financial control, he knows that we are putting turnaround teams
into those trusts specifically to help those organisations bring
themselves back to financial balance by the end of this year. The
answer could not be clearer: we are taking the difficult decisions

health service. In 2004, that figure increased by 4,692, to 32,738,
which is an increase of 17 per cent. Those figures do not include
retainers and registrars who represent a potential pool of about 3,000
GPs.</p><p><a name="06051658000113"><b><a name="06051658000331">Joan
Ruddock:</b> I welcome my hon. Friend to his new position.
That national picture is reflected in Lewisham, where we have but four
vacancies, compared with 20 in 2002, and recruitment is going well
thanks to Government support. Will he ensure, however, that the
Government monitor the retention of those GPs, giving extra support to
PCTs should it prove necessary? Will he also ensure that patients
benefit from increased GP numbers by getting better access to
out-of-hours services?</p><p><a name="06051658000114"><b><a name="06051658000332">Mr.
Lewis:</b> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. The news from
Lewisham is good. She is right, however, that it is essential that we
maintain the successes made in GP recruitment, especially in
disadvantaged and inner-city areas. That is why we have focused and
targeted resources on supporting PCTs in those areas, especially with
regard to recruitment and retention. We know that it has not always
been easy to attract GPs into some of our most disadvantaged
communities. I also agree that it is essential to ensure that
improvements in primary care facilitate enhanced access to primary care
services in every community.</p><p><a name="06051658000115"><b><a name="06051658000333">Dr.
Andrew Murrison (Westbury) (Con):</b> I welcome the Minister
to his new duties. The National Audit Office tells us that up to 1
million people in England can no longer rely on out-of-hours services
from a GP that they took for granted in 1997, despite the figures
quoted by the Minister and a 22 per cent. overspend on out-of-hours
services. What is he doing about PCTs such as Harrow, Burntwood,
Lichfield and Tamworth, Eastleigh and Test Valley South, North
Bradford, New Forest, Richmond and Twickenham and Sutton and Merton,
which the NAO says are unable to guarantee patients&#146; access to a
GP at night and at weekends?</p><p><a name="06051658000116"><b><a name="06051658000334">Mr.
Lewis:</b> The transition to the new GP contracts, in terms of
out-of-hours services, has on the whole been smooth. That was actually
confirmed by the recent National Audit Office report. As for the areas
where there are difficulties, we need to examine them with the relevant
primary care trusts, and ensure that out-of-hours services are
available to patients in those communities where that is appropriate.
However, the suggestion that the new contracts have led overall to a
deterioration in out-of-hours services is not backed up by the very
report to which the hon. Gentleman referred.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 845</b><br><h3 align="center"><a name="06051658000023">Health (Patient/Public

changing the forums only two years after their introduction will be yet
another prime example of the Government&#146;s permanent revolution
of our NHS, which generates a lot of huffing and puffing from Ministers
but delivers very little to the
public?</p><p><a name="06051658000120"><b><a name="06051658000338">Ms
Winterton:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that it is
important to have good patient and public involvement in local
decisions about health care, especially as some 80 per cent. of the
budget is now devolved to local level. The reason we want to change the
current system of patients forums is that many people in them felt that
not enough resources were going to the front line. They felt that they
would be able to do more if they had more control at local level, and
if there was more accountability. For example, they wanted to work more
closely with overview and scrutiny committees. We shall be presenting a
great many ideas that I believe will lead to improvements in this
important
area.</p><p><a name="06051658000121"><b><a name="06051658000339">Andrew
Gwynne (Denton and Reddish) (Lab):</b> I believe that public
participation is key to ensuring that the NHS delivers the quality
services that local people want. The advent of foundation trusts has
provided more opportunities for the views of local people to be sought
through those new structures, but what consideration has been given to
strengthening public involvement in the direction and provision of
primary care services at that very local
level?</p><p><a name="06051658000122"><b><a name="06051658000340">Ms
Winterton:</b> My hon. Friend is right: public participation
is certainly one of the keys to ensuring that there is accountability
at local level, and that local people are involved in decision making.
That is one of the reasons why we wanted to consider the new
structures. As there is a stronger role for primary care trusts in
commissioning and as there are fewer PCTs, it is important to ensure
that there are good local networks involving not only individuals but
local organisations and local authorities in some of that local
decision making.</p><p><a name="06051658000123"><b><a name="06051658000341">Mr.
John Baron (Billericay) (Con):</b> I suggest that the

the system of community health councils with a system that is not
working. Patients forums have cost &#163;12 million more to run, and
staff turnover is very 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 846</b><br>high. The Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health was
introduced, only for the Government then to announce its abolition. The
total cost of that was &#163;100 million. Last year the Government
scrapped their plans for reform, and now there is speculation that
patients forums themselves will be
abolished.</p><p><a name="06051658000124">Given that
confusion, will the Minister assure the House that the expertise built
up by forum volunteers will not be lost in the latest round of
Government changes, and will she do her best to get a grip on the
shambles?</p><p><a name="06051658000125"><b><a name="06051658000342">Ms
Winterton:</b> The difficulty that we experienced with the
CHCs was that they offered services in different ways. Some would offer
complaints services, for instance, while others would not. That is why
we set up a whole new structure, including the patient advice and
liaison service in local trusts, the Independent Complaints Advocacy
Services to deal with complaints, and patients forums to consider
patient and public involvement at local
level.</p><p><a name="06051658000126">We will be
looking further into how to improve the current system, as people
working in patient forums have identified some difficulties,
particularly the problem of ensuring that resources are spent at local
level. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that that is exactly why we set
up the expert panel&#151;to ensure that we improve in future by

Care Trusts and Ambulance
Trusts</h3><h5 align="left"><a name="06051658000249">3.32
pm</h5><p><a name="06051658000131"><b><a name="06051658000347">The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Andy Burnham):</b>
With permission, Mr. Speaker, and in the unavoidable absence of my
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, I should like to make a
statement on primary care trusts and NHS ambulance trusts. Detailed
information for each area has, for the convenience of hon. Members,
been placed on the Board since 1
pm.</p><p><a name="06051658000132">In my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State&#146;s written statement of 18 October
2005, she explained that strategic health authorities had been invited
to submit proposals to the Department of Health on how to streamline
SHAs and strengthen primary care trusts. Four clear criteria
underpinned that exercise: the need to improve health and reduce
inequalities; to strengthen the PCTs&#146; commissioning function; to
improve co-ordination with social services through greater
coterminosity between PCT and local authority boundaries; and to
deliver at least a 15 per cent. reduction in management and
administrative
costs.</p><p><a name="06051658000133">In the
intervening period, SHAs have consulted local people, staff and
clinicians, partners in local government and a range of other local
stakeholders on the proposals for SHAs, PCTs and ambulance trusts. Many
right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House have offered
their views and I am very grateful to them. After local consultations,
SHAs submitted their reports and recommendations to the Department. An
external panel, established to advise Ministers on the proposals, has
since met to consider in detail each proposal for PCTs and SHAs. After
receiving its advice, we announced on 12 April that the numbers of SHAs
would reduce from 28 to
10.</p><p><a name="06051658000134">Ministers have now
considered the recommendations and the panel&#146;s advice on PCTs. I
can now inform the House that the number of PCTs will fall from 303 to
152, and that the new organisations will be established on 1 October
2006. The population covered by each PCT will rise from an average of
around 165,000 at present to an average of just below 330,000.
About70 per cent. of the new PCTs will be coterminous with
the boundaries of local authorities with social services
responsibilities, which compares with about 44 per cent. of PCTs that
are currently coterminous with their local
authorities.</p><p><a name="06051658000135">In some
areas, concerns have been expressed that larger PCTs could lose a
locality focus and divert resources away from deprived areas or that
smaller PCTs could lack commissioning power. We acknowledge those
concerns and have sought to strike a careful balance between those
conflicting demands. In response, we propose that four general
conditions be applied: first, that all PCTs retain and build on
partnership arrangements; secondly, that a strong locality focus must
be retained and, where necessary, that local structures should be put
in place; thirdly, that all PCTs must deliver their share of the 15 per
cent. management cost saving, strengthen commissioning and ensure
robust management of financial balance and risk; and fourthly, that the
new PCTs and SHAs 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 850</b><br>should consider how any further conditions relating to issues that arose
during the consultation could be
applied.</p><p><a name="06051658000136">In some
areas, the new proposals differ from those suggested by the SHA and the
external panel. Having taken into account all the evidence and sought
local consensus wherever possible, we have judged that in those
circumstances, the alternatives could better satisfy the
&#147;Commissioning a Patient-led NHS&#148; criteria and have the
best possible chance of
success.</p><p><a name="06051658000137">On PCTs as
providers of services, let me restate the then Secretary of
State&#146;s clear commitment to the House on 25 October 2005. She
said that</p><a name="06051658000243"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;district
nurses, health visitors and other
staff&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051658000138">delivering
clinical services</p><a name="06051658000244"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;will
continue to be employed by the PCT unless and until it decides
otherwise.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 25 October 2005;
Vol. 438, c. 152.]</p></ul><p><a name="06051658000139">Our
aim in making these changes is to benefit both patients and taxpayers.
Fewer, more strategic PCTs will be better placed to ensure effective
commissioning of services for patients, and to support the development
of practice-based commissioning among GPs and other primary care staff.
Patients will receive the right care and treatment in the right place,
and at the right time. The taxpayer will see the release of &#163;250
million worth of savings annually, through the merging of back-office
functions and a reduction in administrative costs, for reinvestment in
front-line services from 2008-09. That could pay, for example, for
roughly 50,000 heart operations or major improvements in services for
people with long-term conditions, especially older people. The changes
will also build stronger partnerships between the NHS and local
government.</p><p><a name="06051658000140">The
reconfiguration of PCTs is the first stage in strengthening the
commissioning function. The next stage is a development programme for
all PCTs, which will ensure that they are strong, confident
organisations fit for driving forward the NHS reforms that we are
implementing.</p><p><a name="06051658000141">On
ambulance trust reorganisation, in June 2005 the Government accepted
the recommendations set out by Peter Bradley, our national ambulance
adviser, in the review entitled &#147;Taking Healthcare to the
Patient: Transforming NHS Ambulance Services&#148;, which set out a
vision for ambulance services. In future, they will provide more care
in the home and more treatment at the scene, give better advice to
patients over the telephone and ensure faster response times to save
more lives. The review made it clear that in order to ensure that
ambulance trusts have the right strategic capacity, infrastructure and
staff to deliver these improvements in patient care, there should in
future be fewer, larger ambulance trusts. These changes will enable
standards within the new trusts to be levelled up to those of the
best.</p><p><a name="06051658000142">In her written
statement of 14 December 2005, my right hon. Friend the then Secretary
of State set out our intention to consult and to ensure that the
benefits outlined in the ambulance review can be fully realised.
Following this consultation, the Secretary of State has now decided
that from 1 July 2006, most of the existing 29 NHS ambulance trusts
will merge into 12, with separate management arrangements for the Isle
of Wight. For now, Staffordshire ambulance service will 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 851</b><br>remain a separate trust, working in partnership with the new West
Midlands ambulance service, but will eventually merge at a later
date.</p><p><a name="06051658000143">Feedback from
most areas was supportive of our proposals. However, we have decided to
address the public&#146;s concern that local responsiveness and
flexibility could be lost through having larger trusts by requiring
ambulance trusts to ensure that their services are meeting the needs of
all localities and populations within their boundaries. Those changes
should mean more investment in front-line services as trusts identify
savings in back-room functions; improved patient care through providing
an opportunity to raise the standard of the service provided by all
trusts to the level of the best; better emergency planning, with
greater capacity and the capability to respond to major incidents of
all kinds; more integrated services; and better career opportunities
for</p><p><a name="06051658000144">staff.</p><p><a name="06051658000145">Changes
of this kind are inevitably difficult. We have not sought to impose a
single blueprint on the NHS; instead, we have listened carefully to
representations from all Members and from local communities and
organisations. Wherever possible, we have responded positively to them.
We have one aim above all: to deliver better health care to patients. I
commend this statement to the
House.</p><p><a name="06051658000146"><b><a name="06051658000348">Mr.
Stephen O'Brien (Eddisbury) (Con):</b> I thank the Minister
for providing me with a copy of his statement in advance, and for
putting local information on the Board for the use of hon.
Members.</p><p><a name="06051658000147">Since Labour
came to office, there have been seven reorganisations of the NHS
already, and today&#146;s pair are the eighth and ninth. Under the
cloak of words such as &#147;modernisation&#148; or
&#147;reform&#148;, this is change for change&#146;s sake. Has
the Minister any idea of the effect that the reorganisation has on
staff morale, and on the ability to retain the good? It means that
underperformers inevitably will be recycled into similar jobs in the
new organisations. It causes instability among clinical
staff&#151;doctors, nurses and allied professions&#151;and inflicts
uncertainty and inefficiency in the NHS supply chain. Above all, is he
aware that it leaves patients wondering where they feature in it
all?</p><p><a name="06051658000148">The Government
have form, however. They never allow anything to settle and bed
down&#151;much to the consternation of the hard-working people trying
to deliver the front-line patient services. In Government, as in all
walks of life, the addiction to constant structural change is a well
known technique deployed by those who did not get it right the first
time&#151;or the second, third, fourth, fifth or sixth times.
Imposing another restructuring and a further reorganisation is a great
wheeze to put through changes in a bid to avoid accountability and to
keep running ahead of
mistakes.</p><p><a name="06051658000149">The mounting
job losses in the NHS show that the Government are no longer lulling
the public, whose trust in the Government, not least in respect of the
NHS, has plummeted. Let us look at why the Government have felt
impelled to announce yet more changes to the
NHS&#151;</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 852</b><br><p><a name="06051658000150"><b><a name="06051658000349">The

O'Brien:</b> Indeed, it does say it here, because that is what
I wrote.</p><p><a name="06051658000152">First, let us
look at ambulance trusts. Peter Bradley&#146;s review concluded that
there should be fewer of them, but that they should be larger, yet no
evidence for that major change was contained in the report, or made
available since. Ministers then decided to reduce the number of
strategic health authorities to align with their obsession with
regions, notwithstanding the electorate&#146;s rejection of the idea
in the north-east. With sleight of hand, Ministers have used the
reorganisation as an excuse to reduce the number of trusts to 12, and
then they have ducked the flak by suggesting that that was Peter
Bradley&#146;s idea and recommendation all along. Will the Minister
therefore undertake to place in the Library of the House any evidence
that relates specifically to claims that creating large trusts will
lead to improvements in patient care?</p><p><a name="06051658000153">How does the reorganisation
achieve closer integration of all the emergency services? Will the
Minister explain how a north-west regional ambulance service will
integrate better with the newly merged Merseyside and Cheshire police
force&#151;a merger that will be carried out in the teeth of maximum
hostility and objection? How will it integrate better with contingency
planning in Cheshire, or with the Cheshire fire service&#146;s move
to sub-regional control rooms?</p><p><a name="06051658000154">Will the Minister comment on
proposals to reduce control room numbers by co-aligning them with the
police and fire services? The House should bear it in mind that in
Warwickshire, for example, the fire service responds to some 3,000
emergency calls a year, whereas the ambulance services respond to some
100,000.</p><p><a name="06051658000155">Who is
co-ordinating the reorganisation across Government? Co-ordinated is the
last thing that it is&#151;perhaps the Deputy Prime Minister has been
devoting his time to this matter recently. It is shambolic,
inconsistent centralising by an arrogant Government who claim to listen
but who choose not to hear the views of those who work on the front
line and who know
best.</p><p><a name="06051658000156">The official
consultation on ambulance trusts lasted from the middle of September
last year to near the end of March this year, yet the NHS appointments
commission sent out letters on 30 January&#151;in the middle of the
consultation period&#151;asking for nominations for men and women to
chair the new NHS ambulance trusts. The question arises&#151;was not
the decision therefore a foregone
conclusion?</p><p><a name="06051658000157">I have had
a letter from Roger Moore, the chief executive of the appointments
commission, in which he stated that the recruitment
began</p><a name="06051658000245"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;at the
request of the Department of Health&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06051658000158">I am pleased that concerted work by MPs
across Staffordshire and by the shadow health team, supported by huge
amounts of work by the people of the county, has caused Ministers to
backtrack on axing Staffordshire ambulance service for up to two years.
That 24-month period was set out in the handout on the Board in the
Members&#146; Lobby, but not in the statement. That is a classic
fudge, as it puts Staffordshire ambulance trust in the departure
lounge. 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 853</b><br>However, will the Minister give the House an assurance that unless the
west midlands service is brought up to the standard of Staffordshire
there will be no hint of a merger, whether in two years or
beyond?</p><p><a name="06051658000159">Given
today&#146;s statement, any right-thinking person is entitled to
regard the Government&#146;s consultation as a sham. Constant change
will undermine what has already been achieved; for example, by turning
round the East Anglian ambulance trust. The Buckinghamshire and
Northamptonshire service is about to complete the process of splitting;
now they will have to go through the upheaval of being merged
again.</p><p><a name="06051658000160">We are not
against the restructuring of PCTs per se&#151;[Hon.
Members: &#147;Ah.&#148;] The Under-Secretary of State
for Health, the hon. Member for Bury, South suggests that the whole
statement was about PCTs; clearly he was not listening, as much of it
dealt with ambulance trusts. On PCTs, as distinct from ambulance
trusts, we are not opposed to restructuring, but we have always said
that future functions need to be defined before such restructuring
takes place.</p><p><a name="06051658000161">In 2002,
the Department of Health abolished the 11 regional offices of the
former NHS executive and about 100 health authorities. Today, the
Government are bringing back that map. Has the Minister estimated the
cost of that U-turn, which takes us back to the position four years
ago? He may talk of the Secretary of State&#146;s clear commitment in
October 2005 about the functions of PCTs, yet three months before that
the DOH was equally clear, in &#147;Commissioning a patient-led
NHS&#148;, when it called for PCTs to become</p><a name="06051658000246"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;patient-led and commissioning-led
organisations with their role in provision reduced to a
minimum&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051658000162">by
2008. The Secretary of State backtracked on that commitment, without
reassessing whether the proposed structures would be fit for purpose.
Now, no one is
clear.</p><p><a name="06051658000163">As the Health
Committee said in January, when it attacked the Government&#146;s
indecision,</p><a name="06051658000247"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we are
appalled at the continuing lack of clarity about whether or not PCTs
will eventually divest themselves of provider
functions.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051658000164">The
Department of Health&#146;s NHS operating framework for 2006-07,
published on 26 January, offered little further clarity,
stating:</p><a name="06051658000248"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Where
PCTs do continue to provide services, they will need to put in place
clear governance procedures that ensure that there is no undue
influence from the provider side on commissioning
decisions.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051658000165">Will the
Minister detail how 15 per cent. management cost savings can be made
when the Government are calling for each PCT to have two sets of
managers&#151;one for commissioning and one for direct
services?</p><p><a name="06051658000166">The problem
for the Minister is that all this restructuring has gone on without
putting in place the necessary precondition for its having a realistic
chance of success: defining the future functions of PCTs. Will the
Minister tell us how many PCTs are predicted to be direct providers of
services in two years&#146; time? New organisations can hardly be
expected to deliver unless and until they have clarity of
purpose.</p><p><a name="06051658000167">In his
statement the Minister said that in some cases the new proposals differ
from those suggested by the strategic health authorities and the
external panel. Will 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 854</b><br>he tell the House how many PCTs the expert panel proposed should be
created overall; and will he publish in full the panel&#146;s advice
so that we can see to what extent the Government arrived at different
decisions and the implications of the
variations?</p><p><a name="06051658000168">The
Government seem only now to be waking up to the cost of the
reconfiguration and the redundancies that go with it. Can the Minister
confirm that the estimated cost of this latest round of NHS
reconfiguration, which will merely take us back to where we were four
years ago, will be &#163;320 million? Will he also confirm that at
&#163;250 million&#151;the figure he gave in his
statement&#151;the savings will be less than the cost? Is he
confident even of that amount, or was the Health Committee right when
it said that savings of between &#163;60 million and &#163;135
million were nearer the mark? Are those estimates gross or net, given
the cost of the redundancies that will be inevitable to deliver on that
Government
promise?</p><p><a name="06051658000169">What is the
time scale? The House is entitled to have that crucial information in a
year when the Government&#146;s financial control of, and credibility
with, the NHS is shot to pieces and the NHS is in confusion and plunged
into at least 10 months of uncertainty and chaos at PCT level. This is
no way to run an NHS.</p><p><a name="06051658000170"><b><a name="06051719002580">Several
hon. Members
</b><i>rose&#151;</i></p><p><a name="06051658000171"><b><a name="06051658000351">Mr.
Speaker:</b> Order. The Opposition spokesman took longer than
the Minister. I do not want to see that practice
continued.</p><p><a name="06051658000172"><b><a name="06051658000352">Andy
Burnham:</b> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and in that long speech,
I will seek to pick out the points of substance that there
were.</p><p><a name="06051658000173">There is no
confusion. Our aim overall is to improve patient care. That is what we
are in business to do, and I can tell the hon. Gentleman without fear
of contradiction that patient care is improving. Patients are not
waiting for more than six months for in-patient treatment. On
the whole, they wait a maximum of 13 weeks for an out-patient
appointment. There is clear evidence of progress. That is what guides
our changes; it is what guides these changes, so I can assure him that
there is no confusion on our part at
least.</p><p><a name="06051658000174">The hon.
Gentleman says that this is change for change&#146;s sake. I point
out to him that the NHS changes; it is different from what it was in
2000. We have an ambitious programme of reform to drive through in the
NHS. We want to ensure that people can choose where they are treated
and that the wait for that treatment is short, once the full reform
programme is introduced. That will require strong commissioning
throughout the NHS. It will require people cleverly commissioning
services and using their organisational strength. That is why we are
making these changes. He will know that some changes have begun, and
some of the changes that we have formalised today have already begun to
take shape.</p><p><a name="06051658000175">On
ambulance trusts, the hon. Gentleman claims that we have an obsession
with the regions&#151;far from it. He asks what the connection is
with other emergency services. Surely, it makes sense to ensure that,
at regional level, there is the contingency capacity to deal with major
events and that capacity is planned 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 855</b><br>regionally. I hope that he agrees that there is some logic in doing
that. He claims that there is no support, but Peter Bradley&#146;s
proposals commanded strong support from within the ambulance service,
particularly because they clearly focused on the professional
development of those who work in the service, thus giving them the
ability to shape ambulance services in
future.</p><p><a name="06051658000176">The hon.
Gentleman claims that we have not listened. Clearly, if he looks at the
proposals for PCTs that we are publishing today, he will see that
precisely the opposite is the case. We have indeed listened hon.
Members&#151;not just Labour Members, but Opposition Members,
too&#151;and we have taken on board those concerns. He asks where the
proposals differ and whether we will put the evidence in the Library. I
would be happy to do that, but the reason why we have taken those
decisions and listened to those representations from hon. Members on
both sides of the House is that we want a consensus of support for the
new organisation, because it is our judgment that the organisation will
have the best chance of success if it is underpinned by strong
community support. That is exactly why we have done
that.</p><p><a name="06051658000177">The hon.
Gentleman asks me whether we will detail where the cost savings can be
made. There will be one-off costs in relation to the exercise, but the
savings will come year on year. As for the timetable, we expect that
the savings from the exercise&#151;some &#163;250 million a
year&#151;will be realised by 2008. That, of course, will be a
recurrent saving for front-line
services.</p><p><a name="06051658000178">There is a
logic and coherence to our proposals, and the hon. Gentleman talks of
incoherence and confusion among Government Members. I put it to him
that the Conservative party&#146;s policy at the last general
election was to take about &#163;650 million from so-called NHS
bureaucracy, as defined by the James review; coupled with that was the
patient&#146;s passport, which would have taken money from the health
service. What kind of organisational chaos would the combination of
those policies have
created?</p><p><a name="06051658000179"><b><a name="06051658000353">Steve
Webb (Northavon) (LD):</b> I thank the Minister for advance
sight of his
statement.</p><p><a name="06051658000180">The
Government abolished health authorities four years ago and created
primary care groups and primary care trusts, and they are now merging
them back together to create health authorities. Were the Government
right to abolish health authorities, and are they right to recreate
them? Is that what the Minister is telling the House? Or did they make
a mistake four years ago, and will he admit that to the
House?</p><p><a name="06051658000181">Can the
Minister provide evidence of where the&#163;250 million
cost saving will come from, given that the Select Committee on Health
was very sceptical that savings on that scale could be achieved? He did
not answer the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman&#146;s question
about the number of redundancies that are implied by a &#163;250
million annual saving. How many people will lose their
jobs?</p><p><a name="06051658000182">On responding to
local consultation, I thank the Minister for listening to some very
effective lobbying from the west of England, which has resulted in 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 856</b><br>keeping PCTs coterminous with social service authorities. I welcome that
fact, because I was sceptical that the Government would listen on that
point. I assume that he already knows that I was pressing for that. I
also welcome the fact that, following recent political trends, the
south-west of England has turned from blue to orange.</p><p><a name="06051658000183">On coterminosity, the Minister
said in his statement that about 70 per cent. of PCTs will be
coterminous. Is there a limit to that, or will he go further? What is
the restriction on having 100 per cent. coterminosity and having real
integration of health and social services? How far will the Government
go?</p><p><a name="06051658000184">What are the
promises of PCTs that have been abolished worth? Many of my colleagues
are worried that, although they have been promised things by existing
PCTs about new community services, the successor bodies may well say
that they are not bound by the promises of the predecessor bodies. Can
the Minister give us an assurance that, when an existing PCT has made a
promise, the successor bodies will honour that promise?</p><p><a name="06051658000185">Finally, on the ambulance trust
mergers, what confidence can people living in rural areas have that the
very large ambulance trusts will not inevitably concentrate on urban
centres? Whereas small trusts could respond to local circumstances,
larger ones may neglect rural areas to hit their performance
targets.</p><p><a name="06051658000186"><b><a name="06051658000354">Andy
Burnham:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his constructive
response. In the course of his remarks, he made the point that we have
listened. The hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) would have done
well to take that point on board. We are not recreating health
authorities; the building blocks are the same. The exercise has shown a
range of interest in and commitment to primary care trusts around the
country. People seem to be attached to them. The changes are not
happening everywhere. In my area, in Greater Manchester, the building
blocks will largely remain the same&#151;as they will in London.
Experience has shown that there is a PCT size that is more effective in
commissioning good quality patient care. We are making the changes in
that respect and ensuring that the NHS is able to use its strength at
local level to drive up quality for patients.</p><p><a name="06051658000187">The hon. Member for Northavon
(Steve Webb) mentioned coterminosity. I am in full agreement with him
on that point. I have long believed that there needs to be much closer
working between the national health service and social services at a
local level. I fully support such moves, including even pooled
budgets&#151;that kind of approach. I hope that the proposals will
pave the way for much greater joint working. There are examples around
the country where that working is close. The greater level of
coterminosity allows those partnerships to be built. The level is
around the mid-70 per cent. mark. We have to strike a balance
between representations from local Members and not creating bodies that
are too big to do the job. We have sought to manage those tensions. We
have produced a significant increase in the number of PCTs that are
coterminous with their social services departments. That will be a
positive step forward for patients and particularly for older people in
those regions.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 857</b><br><p><a name="06051658000188">There will, of course, be
redundancies as a result of the exercise, but we made it clear at the
election that we would be clear about reducing unnecessary NHS
bureaucracy. There should be savings made in merging back-room
functions, where that can be done, but at the same time we do not want
to diminish the power of PCTs to be effective commissioners for their
communities. Today&#146;s proposals strike that
balance.</p><p><a name="06051658000189"><b><a name="06051658000355">Mr.

listening to the views of the many local people who campaigned in large
numbers to retain Darlington&#146;s primary care trust. Does he agree
that his statement is a sure sign that, in the future, we will need to
strengthen still further the working arrangements between not just
health and social services, but housing services, so that more

changes that he made as Secretary of State for Health. I am grateful
for his comments about listening. We have indeed listened. I know that
strong representations were made by him and others in the north-east
region. As I said to the hon. Member for Eddisbury a moment ago, it was
right that we listened to those representations because we want the
organisations to command solid local support. I am pleased that we have
achieved some success in my right hon. Friend&#146;s
area.</p><p><a name="06051658000192">My right hon. Friend made a
point about housing. When we consider coterminosity, we all think about
social services, but he is absolutely right to say that we can think
more widely about links with councils and consider the provision of
adequate housing and leisure and cultural services to local populations
so that we can really begin to understand how to make people more
active. All those possibilities are opened up by greater coterminosity

welcome the Minister&#146;s decision to call it Heywood, Middleton

ties are extremely important and am pleased that Heywood has been
recognised in the name of my hon. Friend&#146;s PCT. As I said in
reply to the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker), it is crucial
that the new organisations serve all parts of the areas that they cover

The exercise, for all its difficulties&#151;I recognise that there

not within the region&#146;s local government boundaries. We have
listened to my hon. Friend&#146;s concerns, and we have made an
exception, as we recognise that people in the area lean towards the
north-west for health care. However, he is right that that exception
does not challenge the other structures that have been put in place to
improve services on the ground.</p><p><a name="06051658000216"><b><a name="06051658000376">Dr.

improvements to the NHS in recent years, so I make no apology for them.
However, the hon. Gentleman will know that we have reduced the number
of targets and have set fewer priorities, as we need to focus on our
true priorities. It is the new PCTs&#146; job to ensure delivery of

continued improvement in NHS patient care, and I fully expect the new

leading practice to develop good services at community level. It is a
priority for everyone, wherever possible, to deliver services away from
the hospital setting and closer to the patient&#146;s home. I fully
endorse that as the way forward, and I applaud the work on the ground
in her area. Within the new structure, we are introducing
practice-based commissioning. That change will put power in the hands

services are most effectively provided. He would be the first to
complain if local priorities were overridden from the centre by targets
or central diktat. It is right that at local level people should be
able to create the kind of health service they want. Through foundation
trusts we want to give local people much greater ownership, control and
say over how their hospitals provide services. Ultimately, that is the
way in which local people and local communities will have their say

be made as a result of the changes will be directly released for
patient care. That is the very reason we are making the changes. We
must achieve a balance so that an organisational structure is the right
size and is not unnecessarily duplicating back-office functions. Where
savings are released, they will be ploughed back into patient care at

Competing demands must be balanced in reaching the right judgment.
Those demands are local focus, responsiveness to local need, a
commissioner who has the weight and the power to drive a good bargain

those things, 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 863</b><br>coterminosity with social service providers so that we can get joined

opposite directions and it is difficult to get them into balance. That

size and shape in a particular locality. We have sought to do the best
we can to manage the competing priorities. I am pleased to say that in

the health service in her area. She has run a good campaign and has
expressed her concerns extremely well. We have said that a merger
should be the eventual goal, and I am happy to give her the assurances
that she seeks on the operating structures of the two services. My

The Minister must have seen a business case to convince him that his
decision is right. Will he assure the House that the details will be
placed in the Library, so we can all understand where the resources
will come from and be sure that good services, such as Lancashire
ambulance service, will not be drained of resources to prop up those

put into the public domain any information that we can to show the
basis on which those decisions were taken, but he knows that the
structure proposed by Peter Bradley commanded strong support within the
ambulance service. People want to be part of a service that can invest
its resources in front-line services and in improving the professional
development of its staff. A unified ambulance service in the north-west
will lead to an improved level of service for his constituents and for
mine. I hope that we can share that information, but, as I have said,
it is vital that residents across the north-west can look forward to
service improvements as a result of the changes. However, the right

crucial test in judging changes to an ambulance service is, first, that
the service is viable and, secondly, that it is providing a safe
service to all the residents in the area. Those are the guiding
principles on which any further changes will be made. As I said to the
hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack), any further
change would be about ensuring that service standards could be further
improved. We recognise the improvements in service standards that
Staffordshire has reached; that is why we are happy to make the

and commercial
development.</p></ul><p><a name="06051680000008">The House
has not yet created a mechanism for declaring a non-interest. However,
I should like to make such a declaration. As the chairman of a water
company, I ought not to be keen on restricting the amount of water that
can be sold. As we have seen from today&#146;s newspaper headlines,
however, we are facing a serious water shortage arising from a wide
range of reasons. Because of global warming, our precipitation level is
now lower, and the precipitation arrives in much more concentrated
amounts. It therefore runs off the land into the rivers and out to sea
much more quickly than before.</p><p><a name="06051680000009">There is no doubt that we face
real difficulties relating to our water supply. This comes as a
surprise to people abroad, who think of Britain as a nation in which
water is ever-present. I was in Paris on Monday, and a senior official
there commented that he was now convinced about global warming largely
because it appeared that it no longer rained in Britain. That might be
an unusual, French way of looking at the issue, but it underlines the
seriousness of the situation.</p><p><a name="06051680000010">This is not a party political
comment, but I was surprised to discover that there is no statutory
reason why anyone building an estate or a commercial building, for
example, should ascertain in advance that the water supply and sewerage
infrastructure for the site will be adequate. He will want to know that
connection is possible, but he does not need to ascertain whether the
system will bear the additional weight of his development.</p><p><a name="06051680000011">The Government are proposing to
bring 750,000 more people into the Thames Gateway, yet, as far as I can
discover, they have made no direct assessment of the ability to provide
either a water supply or sewerage facilities for those new homes. Let
us take the town of Ashford as a further example. At first, it was
proposed to build a significant number of new houses there. Only when
the local authority was able to prove that neither the water supply nor
the sewerage infrastructure would be adequate was that number cut very
substantially. Throughout the country, development goes ahead without
those fundamental questions being asked.</p><p><a name="06051680000012">When introducing the
sustainable communities document, the Government failed to discuss
water at all with anyone. Several years of consideration of that
document had taken place before formal discussions were conducted with
Water UK or anyone else. That shows how unimportant water has been
either in the psyche of the nation or in the Government&#146;s
understanding.</p><p><a name="06051680000013">It is
interesting that Members of all parties represented in the House are
among the supporters of this ten-minute Bill, including nationalist,
Liberal, Conservative and Labour Members. Among them are those who hold
shadow responsibility and who have 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 869</b><br>until recently held Government responsibility for environmental matters.
One of the reasons for that is the divorce between what was the Office
of the Deputy Prime Minister and is now the Department for Communities
and Local Government&#151;I am one of the few who can remember that
distinction&#151;and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs. Since the sidelining of DEFRA, so that it no longer has a
direct influence and control over these matters, issues such as water
have become much less important than the aggrandisement of what was the
Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p><p><a name="06051680000014">I want to make sure that the
seriousness of the current situation is brought home to the nation. To
build without being able to provide water or sewerage facilities, often
in areas that will also be plagued by flooding, is sheer folly. One of
the things that many of our constituents do not understand is that we
can have both drought and floods in the present circumstances. We can
have a shortage of water and yet be plagued by a damaging excess of it.
We must therefore start&#151;and continue with
retrofitting&#151;with the new homes, office and factories being
built. Unless we ask the fundamental questions, which the Bill seeks to
ensure that we do, we shall not get the right answers. If we do not ask
whether there is enough water for such homes, we only have ourselves to
blame when such homes get constricted because of drought and water
scarcity regulations.</p><p><a name="06051680000015">Of course, that would entail an
important role for the water company and the Environment Agency, which
would together produce that assessment. If a water company says that it
can provide water for a new development, that gives the owner of a new
house or commercial premises a clear, bankable indication that he can
carry on his home or commercial life without interruption. The fact
that the Environment Agency will have to support that will ensure that
there is a proper implied contract for the owner of a new home or
commercial premises. At the moment, the day after a family moves into a
new home, the local water company can say, &#147;Frightfully sorry,
but we haven&#146;t got enough water for you.&#148; I hope that
that does hot happen, but the situation is becoming increasingly sharp
and difficult.</p><p><a name="06051680000016">It is
not possible to overestimate the state of our water supplies. Three
local water companies are 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 870</b><br>considering or asking for planning permission for desalination
plants&#151;in this country, Britain&#151;which we thought were an
unfortunate necessity in the middle east and beyond. That is one of the
immediate effects of climate change. Given the inadequacy of the
Government&#146;s response to climate change, that will get worse,
not better. Unless we take these practical, simple measures to ensure
that such matters are highlighted, we will not be able to defend future
generations from a water shortage that will leave them in a position
that we never thought would be experienced in Britain in 100 years.
Standpipes for much of the south and centre of Britain are something

Christopher Chope (Christchurch) (Con):</b>
On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I have just collected from the
board a letter from the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office, the
hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. McFadden), dated 16 May,
in which he says that during yesterday&#146;s Report stage debate
there was a discussion about the power in new clause 1 to remove or
reduce burdens. It is reported in columns 782 and 783 of
<i>Hansard</i>. He
says</p><a name="06051680000074"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;At the
beginning of the debate on the same Bill in the chamber today, I shall
provide further clarification on this specific
point.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051680000026">I hope that the
Minister will have an opportunity to make that clarification now, so
that we can reflect on it before we reach Third Reading later
today.</p><p><a name="06051680000027"><b><a name="06051680000085">Mr.
Deputy Speaker (Sir Michael Lord):</b> I have seen the letter
to which the hon. Gentleman refers. I am sorry to disappoint him, but
my advice is that it would not be appropriate for the Minister to make
such statements at this point in the proceedings. There are other ways
in which he may do
so.</p><p><a name="06051680000028"><b><a name="06051680000086">Mr.
Chope:</b> Further to the point of order,Mr. Deputy
Speaker. Would you be prepared to indicate when it might be appropriate
for the Minister to make the clarification available, so that we have
it before the start of the Third Reading
debate?</p><p><a name="06051680000030"><b><a name="06051680000087">Mr.
Deputy Speaker:</b> There are a number of ways in which the
Minister may do that. I cannot go through them all now, but clearly
this is not the point at which he should do it. Matters have moved on
since the measure was first debated in the Chamber, but there are ways
in which this can be done, which the hon. Gentleman can discover for
himself and of which the Minister will also be
aware.</p><p><a name="06051680000006">New

Harper:</b> New clause 2 aims to inject a shot of transparency
into the Bill. It provides for a report on the operation of the Act. It
follows recommendation 2 of the Regulatory Reform Committee&#146;s
report on the Bill, which
stated</p><a name="06051680000075"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
reaffirm the recommendation of our predecessor Committee that
Departments should be assessed on their progress in removing
unnecessary regulations and controls and not simply on their progress
in simplifying measures. We recommend
accordingly.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051680000037">Transparency
is something on which we all agree. Allowing the greatest possible
visibility for a process encourages good government and sound
decision-making; allowing decisions to be made behind closed doors in
Whitehall has the potential, as we all know, to have the opposite
effect. Deregulation and better regulation are such important agendas
that we must shine the light of scrutiny into the dark recesses of
departmental decision-making.</p><p><a name="06051680000038">In the Committee debates, in
which I participated, the Minister was very proud of the
Government&#146;s agenda. He said on 2
March:</p><a name="06051680000076"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As a
Government, we have committed ourselves to one of the most radical
regulatory reform packages anywhere in the
world&#148;.&#151;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A, </i>2
March 2006; c. 125.]</p></ul><p><a name="06051680000039">and he
specifically talked about the culture change that he wished to
inculcate in Whitehall. It seems to me that the best way of doing that
is to ensure that as much 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 873</b><br>light as possible is shone on the measures in the Act in respect of
reducing regulations and burdens on business.</p><p><a name="06051680000040">The Regulatory Reform Committee
suggested that one of the key reasons why the regulatory reform orders
introduced under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 had been far from
successful was because of the lack of political will within Whitehall.
The Committee claimed that low political importance was attached by
Ministers and civil servants to propose areas ripe for regulatory
reform as compared with bringing new legislation before the House. As
the Minister acknowledged in Committee, a culture change in Whitehall
is necessary and it should not be viewed as preferable for civil
servants and Ministers to pin their careers on creating regulations and
legislation rather than tidying up existing rules and scrapping
obsolete or disproportionate burdens. Indeed, the latter is of far
greater benefit to business than the former.</p><p><a name="06051680000041">The new clause would help to
bring about the necessary culture change. It would require the
Secretary of State to publish an annual report and lay it before
Parliament, which would provide the opportunity for the House to debate
what Ministers would view as the Government&#146;s success in
reducing burdens. The report would detail what orders had been made and
to what effect; what burdens had been removed, what simplified and what
other progress had been made. The Government would therefore have to
set out in stark detail exactly how deregulatory or regulatory it has
been. That should provide a strong incentive for Ministers to encourage
and prioritise measures that deregulate and reduce burdens on business,
rather than the opposite, which seems the case at the moment.</p><p><a name="06051680000042">I shall deal now with new
clauses 7 and 24. New clause 7 is effectively a sunset clause, which
suggests sunsetting the Bill after five years. We make too little use
of post-legislative scrutiny in the House and in this country, although
we are getting better at employing pre-legislative scrutiny. The new
clause would represent an important step forward in allowing Parliament
and interest groups to input into legislation before it is finalised.
We do not do enough to monitor the effectiveness of laws after they are
on the statute book. A sunset clause is one form of post-legislative
scrutiny; it is clearly not desirable for all legislation to include it
because the increased work load on Parliament would be prohibitive. In
certain cases, however, there is a clear argument for having sunset
clauses, particularly for important and controversial legislation.
Control orders immediately spring to mind. Sunset clauses can allow
Parliament to look again at legislation and see if it wants to bring it
back into force.</p><p><a name="06051680000043">As
an alternative, new clause 24 is not a sunset clause, but a renewal
clause, providing a separate option for increasing post-legislative
scrutiny of the Bill and the Government may find it more amenable.
Under the new clause, part 1 of the Bill, the most important part, must
be brought before Parliament for reapproval or rejection at least every
two years.</p><p><a name="06051680000044"><b><a name="06051680000091">David
Howarth (Cambridge) (LD):</b> I welcome the hon. Gentleman
back to our consideration of the Bill, as we missed him yesterday. Will
he confirm that neither of his new clauses will have the effect of 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 874</b><br>sunsetting any of its legislative provisions? All they would do is to
sunset the power to make the orders. One would have to go a little
further to achieve the end, which I believe both his party and mine
share, of sunsetting the majority of new
regulations.</p><p><a name="06051680000045"><b><a name="06051680000092">Mr.
Harper:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention,
and for what I think was a compliment. Unfortunately, I was unable to
take part in yesterday&#146;s debate on the Bill because I had
already organised a full day&#146;s meeting of a number of
veterans&#146; organisations, at which we discussed very important
policy matters. The hon. Gentleman is quite right: the new clauses
would affect simply part 1 of the Bill and would not cause any measures
passed under the Bill to fall. If Members want to achieve that
objective, they will need to make further
changes.</p><p><a name="06051680000046">The advantage
of new clause 24 is that it would allow Parliament regularly to
reassess the effectiveness and proportionality of the part 1
order-making powers without creating an insurmountable hurdle to the
Government&#146;s better regulation agenda. It would also provide an
excellent opportunity to reassess just how successful the Government
have been. In Committee, Members and the Minister referred many times
to the 2001 Act being something of a disappointment in practice, saying
that it had not been as successful in allowing deregulation as they had
hoped. It would therefore be sensible to use this Bill to put on the
statute book provisions compelling Ministers to come to the House more
regularly, so that we do not have to come here yet again in four or
five years&#146; time&#151;under a different Administration,
hopefully&#151;to discuss another Bill to reduce the burdens on
business.</p><p><a name="06051680000047"><b><a name="06051680000093">Mr.
David Heath (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b> May I set at rest
the mind of the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)? I am quite
sure that I speak for my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (David
Howarth) when I say that his earlier comment was a compliment, rather
than an attempt to deprecate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s absence. We
genuinely missed the hon. Gentleman, who made a valuable contribution
in Committee and has made another one today in introducing these new
clauses, dealing as they do with transparency and openness. They also
make an at least crude attempt to apply a degree of post-legislative
scrutiny to this part of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06051680000048">In the spirit of
openness and transparency, I would have liked to have had a letter in
similar terms to the letter referred to earlier by the hon. Member for
Christchurch (Mr. Chope). I am little surprised to learn that Liberal
Democrat Front Benchers were not accorded that courtesy on this
occasion; perhaps the letter is somewhere in transmission at this very
moment. One would usually expect to be copied into correspondence
dealing with the substance of a
Bill.</p><p><a name="06051680000049">As the hon.
Member for Forest of Dean correctly said, new clause 2 requires that a
report be made by the Secretary of State on the Bill&#146;s
operation. Previous deregulatory legislation&#151;indeed, all sorts
of legislation&#151;has not lived up to its expectations. For
instance, one of my continuing criticisms is the raft of Home Office
legislation, to which I referred in yesterday&#146;s debate. Large
parts of it were described as urgent matters that needed the
House&#146;s attention and 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 875</b><br>which were absolutely crucial to the well-being and safety of the
population&#151;however, years later they still have not been
implemented. If such provisions are urgently needed and vital to public
safety, one has to ask why they have not been implemented.</p><a name="06051680000070"><p>Similarly, in dealing
with this legislation we are entitled to ask, after a period, what the
Government have done with this power. Have they used it effectively? Do
we have a programme of deregulation, or is the power being used in
abeyance as a reserve power&#151;as with the change to Standing
Orders in order to implement Law Commission reports, to which reference
was made yesterday&#151;rather than to achieve the objectives that we
and the Government share? I therefore think that new clause 2 has a
great deal to commend it.</p><p><a name="06051680000050">I come now to the issue of
sunset clauses. In his intervention, my hon. Friend the Member for
Cambridge was right to distinguish between the powers that lapse as a
result of a sunset clause and the orders introduced under those powers.
If the Bill becomes an Act, Ministers may be tempted to argue against
its renewal on the ground that we would thus be left defenceless
against overburdensome legislation and regulation. However, that
argument would be spurious, as there is nothing in this and other new
clauses in the group that would cause the regulations or the
deregulation made under the powers contained in the Bill to be
annulled. They would merely enable the House to consider whether
assurances given by the Government during the Bill&#146;s passage had
been implemented in practice. They would allow us to determine whether
promises had been kept and the Bill&#146;s purposes adhered to, and
to ascertain whether we had the sort of deregulatory programme and the
lack of excess that the Government have assured us all along was their
intention.</p><p><a name="06051680000051">That is a
modest ambition. In one way, it might be a desirable concept to sunset
all regulations from their origin, but that might run the risk of
causing administrative chaos. We understand the complexity of the
drafting required to produce a satisfactory response, but the lapsing
of a power would not create immediate difficulties. The new clause
means that the Government would be required to come back to the House
and say to hon. Members, &#147;This is how we have used this power.
You have seen it in action, and will understand that it was used
entirely properly and for its intended purpose. It has worked well, and
we ask the House to renew it.&#148; Alternatively, the House could
say to the Government, &#147;You told us that you would use the power
for one purpose, but in fact you have used it for quite another&#148;
or, &#147;You told us this power was needed urgently, yet you have
not used it at all.&#148; The new clause would enable the House to
have control of what the Executive want to
do.</p><p><a name="06051680000052">I would always
argue that the legislature should have control of what the Executive
do, especially in respect of the procedures of this House. More than
anything else, the Bill is about those procedures. It is therefore
entirely appropriate for Parliament to decide whether a power is
working satisfactorily, and I am happy to lend my support to the
suggestions made by the hon. Member for Forest of
Dean.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 876</b><br><p><a name="06051680000053"><b><a name="06051680000094">Andrew
Miller (Ellesmere Port and Neston) (Lab):</b> I have some
sympathy with what the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)
said, given that he rightly referred to recommendations in the Select
Committee report, but I should like to propose a better way than new
clause 2 to achieve the sort of reporting that he
described.</p><a name="06051680000071"><p>The
Select Committee looked at this matter long and hard. Yesterday, I
referred to the table in the report showing how long orders float
around some Departments. We are not at present competent to deal with
that or to instigate investigations to determine why it happens. The
existing Standing Orders do not allow us to summons a Secretary of
State and ask why an order has been floating around for weeks and
months. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s objective would probably be better
achieved by building a more robust approach into the Standing Orders of
the Regulatory Reform Committee or its successor body so that we can
investigate why such failures have occurred, rather than by introducing
a reporting function, which would result in the type of report that is
normal in such circumstances. I am being gentle because I have read
reports from Administrations of both my colour and
his.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051680000080">5 pm</h5><p><a name="06051680000054"><b><a name="06051680000095">Mr.

Djanogly:</b> Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I was referring
to the Committee.</p><p><a name="06051680000057">Was
there any discussion in the Committee of the proportion of time spent
by Departments on deregulation or regulation, and should that be a
matter for review?</p><p><a name="06051680000058"><b><a name="06051680000098">Andrew
Miller:</b> We looked specifically at the history of the then
27 orders that had been dealt with and, with the limited information we
had, tried to ascertain why delays occurred in some Departments. We
found that we could report on the facts of a delay, but that we could
not investigate the reasons, so if it is the will of the House I should
like the opportunity for my Committee to act like a normal Select
Committee and inquire into the workings of a Department by, for
example, periodically inviting its Secretary of State to answer
questions.</p><p><a name="06051680000059">The sunset
clause proposed by the hon. Member for Forest of Dean would take us
back a long way. The Better Regulation Executive produced a paper,
&#147;A Bill for Better regulation: Consultation Document&#148;,
which acknowledged that the powers in the Regulatory Reform Act 2001
are &#147;constitutionally ground-breaking&#148;, noted that the
review had &#147;identified many 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 877</b><br>positive aspects&#148; in the process and described where further
improvements could be made. The danger of introducing a sunset clause
is that we could throw the baby out with the bathwater. I have some
sympathy with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s suggestion that there should
be a review of the process&#151;indeed, of all
legislation.</p>

  <p><a name="06051680000060"><b><a name="06051680000099">Mr. Harper:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that remark. New clauses 7 and 24 are very much either/or provisions. New clause 7&#151;the sunset clause&#151;may go a little too far, but new clause 24, which provides an opportunity for renewal after two years and would not automatically put an end to the whole Bill, might be more to his liking.</p><a name="06051680000072"><p><b><a name="06051680000100">Andrew Miller:</b> I realise that the hon. Gentleman could not be in the Chamber yesterday, but I expressed then my fear that the existence of the process he describes in new clause 24 would create inertia in some Departments that would worsen the chances of advancing the regulation process. I think that he and I&#151;and, indeed, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)&#151;share the desire to deregulate constructively wherever possible, but I want to find solutions that will not create that inertia in Departments. I therefore urge the hon. Member for Forest of Dean to move away from either of those concepts.</p><p><a name="06051680000061">My hon. Friend the Minister and I have not spoken about this subject&#151;he has had to absorb rather a lot from me in a very few days&#151;but I will throw another googly at him and suggest that perhaps it might be sensible for the Government to give a commitment to allow an opportunity, either on the Floor of the House or through my Committee or the other relevant Committees, to hold periodic discussions on the active working of such legislation. If we are to get it right and make it work in all our interests, we need such a mechanism. On the one hand, I do not want to create a situation that allows any excuse inside any part of the Administration to slow down the process, but on the other, I do not want a process that over-complicates the situation for those outside the House who are trying to understand what is necessarily a pretty complex process.</p><p><a name="06051680000062"><b><a name="06051680000101">Mr. Harper:</b> The hon.

I agree that five years is a long time. Certainly, a serious review of such mechanisms ought to be conducted within the lifetime of a Parliament because this is an important issue&#151;and leaving aside all the bluster of yesterday, there is an earnest desire on both sides of the House to make some progress.</p><p><a name="06051680000068"><b><a name="06051680000104">Mr. Charles Walker (Broxbourne) (Con):</b> How would a periodic review be timetabled?

We want to raise that profile higher. We do not want to create any excuse for people to say, &#147;Ah, well, we ought to put that one on ice because the sunset clause is triggering a review process in a few weeks&#146; time.&#148; That is my concern. With those few remarks, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can make the kind of comments that I have suggested, with a view to ensuring that the spirit of the two points that we have addressed can be dealt with sensibly and constructively.</p><p><a name="06051691000003"><b><a name="06051691000720">The Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office (Mr. Pat McFadden):</b> I do not feel that there will be a great difference between us on this subject. There is a lot of sense in what was said by the hon. Members for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) and for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) and by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller). We agree about the need for review and the need to examine how the measures in the Bill will operate. The hon. Member for Forest of Dean asked me about previous assurances. With regard to new clause 2, I am happy to repeat the Government undertaking made in Committee that a Minister of the Crown will report to the House on the operation of the Bill no less than five years after enactment.</p><p><a name="06051691000004">Of course I support the notion that the Government should constantly be looking to see how well their reforms are working. We are already taking action in that regard. The Government have proposed an amendment requiring that explanatory documents for all orders made under new clause 19 should include an assessment of the extent to which the order removes or reduces burdens.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 879</b><br><p><a name="06051691000005"><b><a name="06051691000721">Mr. Charles Walker (Broxbourne) (Con):</b> The Minister said &#147;no less than five years&#148;.

That is why the Government set up the panel for regulatory accountability, and why there are regulatory reform Ministers in each of the main regulatory Departments&#151;and a Better Regulation Commission keeping an eye on them all.</p><p><a name="06051691000010"><b><a name="06051691000725">Mr. Walker:</b> Will the Minister give way?</p><p><a name="06051691000011"><b><a name="06051691000726">Mr. McFadden:</b> I am afraid that I would like to make some progress.</p><p><a name="06051691000012">Departments are currently reviewing their regulations and drafting simplification plans, which include measures to reduce administrative burdens on business. Those will be published in the pre-Budget report later this year. The Better Regulation Commission will review the simplification plans that Departments and some independent regulators are preparing. The review will occur while the plans are in final draft form and before they go for clearance by the panel for regulatory accountability. The important thing is that Departments are already obliged to report on their better regulation work as part of their annual reports. They have been required to do that for the past two years. We would expect departmental Select Committees to report on those annual reports as appropriate.</p><p><a name="06051691000013"><b><a name="06051691000727">Mr. Djanogly:</b> Is not the Minister rather missing the point?

Gentleman that the reason behind the Bill is that we must make greater progress than has been made under the 2001 Act. My point is that the Bill will not be the only measure, and that efforts are being made to achieve simplification. Although I agree that we should be open to reviewing orders, I believe that it would be unnecessarily prescriptive, and indeed unnecessary, to include that provision in the Bill.</p><p><a name="06051691000015">As hon. Members will be aware, one of the main aims of the Bill is to provide a power to remove unnecessary burdens. To include yet another requirement in addition to those that I have already discussed could be argued to be contrary to the spirit and the purpose of the Bill&#151;as I am sure at least some hon. Members will agree.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 880</b><br><p><a name="06051691000016"><b><a name="06051691000729">Mr. Andrew Love (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op):</b> As a former member of the Regulatory Reform Committee, I agree with my hon. Friend about the prescriptive nature of new clause 2. However, with the increasing prominence of the idea of deregulation, if we are to show the political will to achieve deregulation and if we are to avoid the culture of Whitehall overcoming what we are trying to achieve, regular transparent reports to Parliament are a necessary reality.</p><p><a name="06051691000017"><b><a name="06051691000730">Mr. McFadden:</b> My hon.

Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston.</p><p><a name="06051691000018">New clause 7 is a sunset clause. It would be inappropriate at this moment to set an arbitrary date for the expiry of part 1 of the Bill. Such a sunset clause would set a date on which the Act would certainly come to an end. The safeguards in the Bill and the rigorous parliamentary scrutiny that any proposal will undergo are robust. It would not be wise for us to introduce the uncertainty that a sunset provision would bring&#151;although I am sure that we all relish the thought of going through this process again in five years.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051691000711">5.15 pm</h5><p><a name="06051691000019"><b><a name="06051691000731">Mr. Heath:</b> Of course we would love to have another go, because this has been such fun. May I bring the hon. Gentleman back to the reporting procedure? He is the Minister responsible not only for this aspect of deregulation but for better government practice. I made a suggestion yesterday&#151;when speaking to amendment No. 75, I think&#151;that was not really responded to: irrespective of statutory requirements, it would be good practice for Ministers who wish to introduce orders under the procedure to explain why they cannot use primary legislation to achieve the same effect. That would be a way of preventing Ministers from adopting a lazy attitude and thinking that the procedures in the Bill would provide an easy way of legislating, although they could draft a perfectly proper Bill, and ought to be using primary legislation.</p><p><a name="06051691000020"><b><a name="06051691000732">Mr. McFadden:</b> Some people who have examined the procedure that will emerge when the Bill is enacted do not think that it will be an easier process than primary legislation. It might be a more appropriate procedure on occasions. There may well be more consultation and debate on, and scrutiny of, some regulatory reform orders than would be the case for individual clauses in primary legislation, so we should not be prescriptive.</p><p><a name="06051691000021">In Committee, the former Minister spoke of the need for a culture change across government. The approach that we need to take is one of partnership, with regulators and the regulated working together. What message would we be sending the business community, charities, the voluntary sector and public sector organisations affected by the Bill if we said that the deregulation scheme that it created would be killed off automatically after five years? I return again to the comment made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston about the pressures on Departments. Departments will be less likely to invest a  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 881</b><br>ot of resources in pursuing reforms if they might not prove possible in the end. The culture change that we want should offer certainty about, and confidence in, methods of delivery.</p><p><a name="06051691000022">People should be able to rely on primary legislation. They should know that if the Bill is passed, it is there to last. We want to avoid a situation in which those who are regulated by an order do not have confidence in its provisions. I hope that the orders will deliver wide-ranging reforms, as has already happened under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005.</p><p><a name="06051691000023"><b><a name="06051691000733">Mr. Heath:</b> The Minister is straying into exactly the fallacy against which I warned earlier. The Conservative new clauses would bring no uncertainty to orders that have already been made, but would simply mean that the order-making process would have to be reviewed. The Minister&#146;s remarks are thus completely irrelevant to the proposition before him.</p><p><a name="06051691000024"><b><a name="06051691000734">Mr. McFadden:</b> We have said that there should be a review in no more than five years. However, we are not prepared to sign up to a sunset clause that would automatically bring the Bill to an end. We want Parliament to pass a power in which it has confidence, and that being the case, it should have confidence in that power for the future.</p><p><a name="06051691000025">As I said, the Government have given an undertaking that a Minister of the Crown will report to the House on the operation of the Bill within five years of enactment. There is nothing in new clause 7 to ensure that orders made under part 1 would remain in force, if that is the intention. If they did not, everything done by means of them, including amendments to primary legislation, could be repealed. I can only assume that the intention is for existing orders to remain in force. However, unless there is an express provision to that effect, we cannot be free from doubt. That is why we had a &#147;saving&#148; provision to make it completely clear that when we repeal the 2001 Act, orders made under it will continue in force. Similar amendments were tabled when the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 and the 2001 Act went through Parliament, and, specifically, the Conservative Administration resisted them during the passage of the 1994 Act.</p><p><a name="06051691000026"><b><a name="06051691000735">Mr. Kenneth Clarke (Rushcliffe) (Con):</b> Can we just clarify one thing? The Minister contradicted himself in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker), but I hope that he eventually corrected his slip of the tongue. On the undertaking to report to the House, the Minister confirmed that the report would appear in &#147;not less&#148; than five years. He seemed to be reassuring us that nothing would be embarked upon with undue haste&#151;but my hon. Friend was trying to press him to say that he was undertaking that a report would be given in not more than five years&#146; time. The Minister appeared to return to that idea later, but will he clarify what he meant?</p><p><a name="06051691000027"><b><a name="06051691000736">Mr. McFadden</b><i>rose&#151;</i></p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 882</b><br><p><a name="06051691000028"><b><a name="06051691000737">Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. May I just clarify the fact that that was an intervention on the Minister and that the Minister has not quite finished? Is that right?</p><p><a name="06051691000029"><b><a name="06051691000738">Mr. Clarke:</b> It could be taken as a speech, in reply to which the Minister could apply for leave to speak again.</p><p><a name="06051691000030"><b><a name="06051691000739">Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> I think that we will take it as an intervention.</p><p><a name="06051691000031"><b><a name="06051691000740">Mr. McFadden:</b> I am happy to confirm that the commitment is to report within five years.</p><p><a name="06051691000032"><b><a name="06051691000741">Mr. Love:</b> I was a little disappointed by the Minister&#146;s comments on new clause 2. As I said, although I do not propose to support it, because its terms are too prescriptive, there is considerable merit in the recommendation by the Select Committee on Regulatory Reform for regular parliamentary scrutiny of what the Bill achieves.</p><p><a name="06051691000033">I have two major reasons for thinking that. They are based on experience. First, I served on the Select Committee for about two to two and half years, although it felt a great deal longer. One of the things that would have made our work much more effective was greater transparency with regard to the lack of political will in Departments to achieve the objectives set out in legislation.</p><p><a name="06051691000034">There is no doubt that one way to gain the attention of politicians and civil servants is to have transparency and a regular report to Parliament that allows us, the media and the public to know what is going on. That is important because deregulation has become a much higher political priority for everyone. We are constantly chided by the Opposition for our failures in deregulation, and we continually make commitments to do better. Looking back at the historical record, it is clear that previous Governments have not done that well, either; we all remember the &#147;bonfire of the regulations&#148; in the early 1990s. It behoves all of us in Parliament to create the conditions whereby we can succeed. The Bill does many things, but it does not achieve proper parliamentary scrutiny&#151;I am talking about scrutiny in this Chamber&#151;of what is being achieved.</p><p><a name="06051691000035">The second consideration, as I said in an intervention, is the culture of Whitehall. It is undoubtedly the case that the priority both for politicians and for civil servants is creating new regulations and new laws. One becomes a Cabinet Minister by passing laws; one becomes a permanent secretary by assisting Ministers in passing laws. We need to try to create incentives to do away with laws as well as to create them. This measure is a small mechanism, but it is probably the only way in which we can change the culture of Whitehall and create a better opportunity to do away with regulation.</p><p><a name="06051691000036"><b><a name="06051691000742">Mr. Harper:</b> The hon. Gentleman spoke about how Ministers&#146; performance is assessed. To achieve a culture change, we must shift our focus from the introduction of new Bills and legislation to deregulation and the removal of burdens from business. We must focus, too, on sound administration, and on paying attention to  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 883</b><br>the need to get the operation of Acts of Parliament correct before rushing to introduce yet another Bill.</p><p><a name="06051691000037"><b><a name="06051691000743">Mr. Love:</b> I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s suggestion. I could add that much of the legislation passed by the House has not been properly thought through, as it has not been subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny and other mechanisms. Perhaps Parliament and the Government should consider passing not quite as much legislation, but making sure that the legislation that does proceed through the House is better thought through.</p><p><a name="06051691000038">We should consider what straightforward measures we can take in the Bill to try to change the culture and make politicians and civil servants sit up and think before they carry on with their duties. I believe that an annual report to Parliament detailing progress under the Bill would assist that process a great deal.</p><p><a name="06051691000039"><b><a name="06051691000744">Alison Seabeck (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab):</b> My hon. Friend makes a fair point. The Bill facilitates the sensible use of the order-making process, and we need to turn orders from the ugly ducklings of legislation into the swans. At the moment, the culture favours the introduction of Bills by Ministers and civil servants, but with the good use of orders we can change that culture.</p><p><a name="06051691000040"><b><a name="06051691000745">Mr. Love:</b> I agree.</p><p><a name="06051691000041">The Minister has repeated an argument made in Committee that the requirement for an annual report to Parliament would impose an additional burden on Departments. I accept that that is generally true, but benefits would accrue from the work done by Departments to meet the priority imposed by Parliament, and thus help to change the culture. There is a great deal of merit in the proposal for an annual report. The report would be relatively straightforward to produce, but would give Parliament an opportunity to comment on the success of the Bill, or otherwise. We should remember that the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 and the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 both failed to achieve our objectives. If the Bill is to succeed, an amendment requiring an annual report would be helpful.</p><p><a name="06051691000042"><b><a name="06051691000746">Mr. Harper:</b> I am pleased that the new clause has been welcomed by Members on both sides of the House. In Committee, the Government said that they had the most ambitious deregulatory agenda in the world, so I would expect them to welcome the opportunity both to submit an annual report to the House setting out their achievements in reducing burdens on business and to discuss that with Members. Because Ministers would be forced to come to the House to report on progress every year, the proposal gives them a tool for insisting that civil servants take action. The Minister appeared to welcome new clause 2 in principle, when he said that the Government needed to report to the House more frequently than once every  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 884</b><br>five years, but he did not give any concrete commitments.

Djanogly:</b> This important group of amendments seeks to
introduce similar changes to clauses 14, 15 and 16, which outline the
procedure that would apply when an order is to be made under the
negative resolution procedure, the affirmative resolution procedure or
the super-affirmative resolution procedure. One of our long-held
criticisms of the Bill is that it lacks adequate safeguards for the use
of its fast-track order-making powers, which many people believe will
abolish our constitutional longstops. The Bill has widely become known
as the &#147;abolition of Parliament
Bill&#148;.</p><p><a name="06051691000567">We
supported the Government&#146;s amendments to part 1 of the Bill
yesterday, following their stated intention that the Bill would deal
only with deregulation. However, we made it clear that our overall
support would depend on the introduction of further safeguards. The
introduction of a procedural veto to the Bill, which would be exercised
either by the Houses of Parliament or by Select Committees, was one of
the primary mechanisms recommended by my hon. Friend the Member for
North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) and me on Second Reading, as a
means of introducing such safeguards.</p><p><a name="06051691000568">For that reason, an amendment
to clause 16 was tabled in Committee. It would have required an order
to have been withdrawn or amended if an amendment to the order had been
agreed by one or both of the Houses of Parliament or by the relevant
Committees of either House. The amendment would have granted Parliament
the power to insist on amendments to the order which, if not accepted
by the Minister, would have to be withdrawn. The Minister would then
have to start the process all over again.</p><p><a name="06051691000569">The Conservatives were,
admittedly, far from being the only ones calling for a parliamentary
veto on the use of the procedures in the Bill. The Liberal Democrats
have done the same, and I noted with interest the reports of the
Regulatory Reform and Public Administration Committees, among whose
recommendations was a call for an amendment to the Bill to provide
scope for an effective veto.</p><p><a name="06051691000570">Our support for the insertion
of the procedural veto into the Bill meant that we welcomed the then
Minister&#146;s announcement in Committee&#151;I see him in his
place today&#151;that he would introduce a parliamentary veto on the
use of the procedure. The Conservative party welcomes the
Government&#146;s amendments on the statutory veto as a significant
step in the right direction. It is accepted in most quarters that the
Bill requires adequate safeguards so that it is

discard Parliament. The amendments are meant to carry through the
Government&#146;s pledge to build in a veto over an order for the
relevant Committees of both Houses of Parliament. However, the
amendments fall far short of introducing the robust and firm veto that
we would expect to see inserted in such an important and
constitutionally significant Bill.
</p><p><a name="06051691000571">Our concerns were
heightened when we read the wording of the amendments. The Minister
needs to explain exactly what the amendments entail. A Select Committee
of either House may recommend that the relevant draft order should not
be proceeded with. That recommendation, however, can be discarded if it
is rejected by a resolution of the relevant House. Furthermore, when
making such a recommendation, the Committee must have considered a
range of factors, including those listed in clause 3. Our primary
concern is that the conditions imposed on the relevant Committee, by
which it is able to exercise such a veto, are excessive.</p><p><a name="06051691000572">The primary difference between
the Government&#146;s amendments and the amendment tabled by
Conservative Members in Committee and now in new clause 5 is that the
Government&#146;s proposals allow for the veto to be exercised only
by a Select Committee, whereas our proposals allow for a veto by either
the Committee or the Houses of Parliament. I note that the Procedure
Committee, which recently produced an insightful report on the Bill,
recommended that the power of veto should be exercised</p><a name="06051691000703"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;outside the Committee as well as
within it&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06051691000573">While the Government&#146;s
amendments allow both Houses to become involved in the process, they do
not contain an automatic right of veto. If either House is unhappy with
an order, it cannot veto it until a Committee has acted. The Procedure
Committee&#146;s report noted that there was no need for the Bill to
include a power of veto exercised beyond the Committee. It recommended
that the mechanism by which the House of Commons exercised the veto
should rest on House of Commons procedure. Is the Government&#146;s
failure to empower Parliament by including an automatic veto in the
Bill a result of that recommendation? If so, what steps will be taken
to amend the House&#146;s procedure to ensure that it possesses a
veto and that the mechanics are fully in place? More urgently, why will
the Government not accept that this is a matter of great concern to
Opposition parties and other Members who have voiced concerns and deal
with the matter now, setting out the balances and stating the powers in
the Bill?</p><p><a name="06051691000574">While the
Opposition are concerned about the lack of a parliamentary veto under
the Government&#146;s amendments, we are also concerned that a
Committee could have its veto overridden by a resolution of the
relevant House. According to the wording of the Government&#146;s
amendments, the veto of a Select Committee, which the Cabinet Office
proudly proclaimed in its press release on 4 May, is effectively
nothing more than a recommendation. The difference between a veto and a
recommendation is obvious and needs no further explanation. Were a
Commons Committee to recommend that no further proceedings were to take
place, is it not likely that the Government 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 894</b><br>would simply use their majority in the House to overrule it? Would not
that negate completely the introduction of the veto?</p><p><a name="06051691000575">If the Government have their
way on this set of provisions, how will Parliament be able to ensure
that the more contentious issues are dealt with in the Lords, where the
veto is not capable of being vetoed by majority party
votes?</p><p><a name="06051691000576"><b><a name="06051691001237">Mr.
Greg Knight (East Yorkshire) (Con):</b> The Government deserve
credit for listening to representations and giving ground in some other
areas, but does my hon. Friend accept that in this area they have
failed to meet the assurances given by the previous Minister, the hon.
Member for East Renfrewshire (Mr. Murphy), to the Procedure Committee?
Is he aware that on 7 February this year, told the Procedure
Committee:</p><a name="06051691000704"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;so our
commitment is very clear, that we will not seek to do anything which is
highly controversial. The Select Committee will make a judgment on that

Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Part of the
problem is that the Government have been consistently late in
responding to comments made in Committees and in producing draft
clauses for review. We have been treating Report, to some extent, like
Second Reading because we have not seen the clauses to comment on
them.</p><p><a name="06051691000579"><b><a name="06051691001239">Mr.
Kenneth Clarke:</b> My hon. Friend is making sound points in
criticising the adequacy of the veto offered. Will he reflect on
whether a veto is totally reassuring? As my right hon. Friend the
Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) just pointed out, the former
Minister repeatedly gave assurances in various forums that nothing that
was controversial would be taken through in this way. I take that to
mean that a substantial number of Members of the House saying that a
measure should be subject to the parliamentary process should be
adequate to stop the procedure being used. If all that is offered can
simply be overridden by the working majority of the Government of the
day, very controversial measures could be taken through using this
simple, scarcely parliamentary procedure. Just a bare majority of
Members of the House of Commons would make sure that an unsuitable
process was used to override a significant section of public and
parliamentary opinion.</p><p><a name="06051691000580"><b><a name="06051691001240">Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My right hon. and learned Friend makes an
important point. Were the matter concerned to be dealt with in the
Lords, where the veto is more likely to be effective, I can imagine
Ministers moaning and groaning that unelected Members of the House of
Lords should not concern themselves with administrative or deregulatory
issues. As a result, we could be caught in a cleft
stick.</p><p><a name="06051691000581"><b><a name="06051691001241">Mr.

said was entirely in line with the new clause that we shall discuss in
this group, which my hon. 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 895</b><br>Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) and I tabled and which I
believe the hon. Gentleman has set his mind against. It is no good him
saying that his right hon. and learned Friend has made an important
point if he disagrees with the fundamentals of it when it comes to a
vote.</p><p><a name="06051691000582"><b><a name="06051691001242">Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I will come on to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
new clause, which has its problems, although, as he will hear, I
believe that it merits further discussion.</p><p><a name="06051691000583">We believe that the best course
of action is to follow through the spirit of Government amendment No.
46. However, that amendment needs improvement to allow the veto to be
exercised by either of the Houses or by Committees. I shall now deal
with the point made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr.
Heath) about new clause 14, as I know that he wants me to address
it.</p><p><a name="06051691000584">The Liberal
Democrats&#146; new clause 14 seeks to grant the House a statutory
veto over orders introduced by virtue of this Bill. It suggest a novel
alternative to relying on the recommendations of a Select Committee,
already burdened and restricted in its freedom of action by the
factors, as set out in the Government amendments, that must be
considered when rejecting a draft order. That alternative is that a
parliamentary veto may be exercised by a quorum of at least 10 per
cent. of the House. The new clause also contains a safeguard of its
own, in that those exercising their veto must encompass more than a
single parliamentary party. That would prevent a single political group
from rejecting the Government&#146;s measures on purely partisan
grounds. It has been suggested that an order introduced under the Bill,
which, if we are to believe the Government&#146;s words, would relate
only to deregulation and Law Commission proposals, should be stalled by
a parliamentary veto only if it is controversial. If that is the case,
the order should be presented to Parliament in the form of primary
legislation.</p><p><a name="06051691000585">I agree
that new clause 14 would in practice mean that only controversial
measures would be vetoed, and I understand the spirit of it. However,
it goes too far by setting a precedent in other areas of procedure.
Issues such as what should be a relevant percentage and entrenching
minority rights would need a much wider
review.</p><p><a name="06051691000586"><b><a name="06051691001243">Pete
Wishart (Perth and North Perthshire) (SNP):</b> The hon.
Gentleman mentioned minorities. I think that the Liberal
Democrats&#146; new clause has its merits, in that the minority
parties would be included. The hon. Gentleman is more than aware that
we are not included on all Select Committees. In fact, we are on very
few of them. That means that we would have no say in any veto. The
Liberal Democrat proposal would allow us at least an opportunity to
participate.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051691000713">6

ability to participate. I do not think anyone is saying that he cannot
participate in the 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 896</b><br>progress of legislation. We maintain, however, that establishing a veto
has significant implications for the flexibility of the way in which
the House works, and would require a full
review.</p><p><a name="06051691000588"><b><a name="06051691001245">Sir
Robert Smith (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD):</b> The
hon. Gentleman told the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire
(Pete Wishart) that he had demonstrated the ability of minority parties
to exercise this right in the Chamber. The point is that the
Government&#146;s procedures require them to exercise it in a Select
Committee. We are trying to enable the whole House to influence what
happens to procedure. Members of a Select Committee are, by their
nature,
select.</p><p><a name="06051691000589"><b><a name="06051691001246">Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. I
gave some time to his party&#146;s proposal because I think there
could be some merit in it, but I also think that we need a full, much
wider review than it proposes.</p><p><a name="06051691000590"><b><a name="06051691001247">Mr.
Kenneth Clarke:</b> The difficulty is that we cannot reflect
fully in the time before the Bill leaves the House of Commons. I find
myself in the slightly embarrassing position of supporting what the
Liberal Democrats have said. At a meeting, the hon. Member for
Cambridge (David Howarth) and I urged that view on the then Minister,
and I think that it has considerable merit.</p><p><a name="06051691000591">Of course I accept that we
cannot normally allow minority vetoes on the processes of the House or
on ordinary parliamentary procedure, but yesterday I accepted new
clause 19&#151;reluctantly, as did my hon. Friend&#151;as a step in
the right direction. I was prepared to allow some flexibility in
abandoning parliamentary procedure for non-controversial measures.
Surely, though, if 65 Members say that a measure merits being subject
to the full parliamentary process, it is not a non-controversial
deregulatory measure. If we were in office, I would take the view that
even if the 65 were shell-backed left-wing members of the Labour party
with a stray Welsh Nationalist added, they would be entitled to the
full parliamentary process, and to be allowed to veto a short-cutting
of the whole parliamentary procedure, which we are all prepared to
contemplate only in the case of genuinely non-controversial
deregulatory
measures.</p><p><a name="06051691000592"><b><a name="06051691001248">Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I hear what my right hon. and learned
Friend says. It is an interesting debate. According to company law, 10
per cent. of members can call an annual general meeting but cannot
scrap a resolution. The percentage figure would need to be reviewed
carefully in the context of the way in which the House works. Let us
not forget that these proposals were presented to the House a matter of
days ago. I respectfully suggest that to say that there should have
been or could have been adequate time is not realistic, but, as I said
to Liberal Democrat Members, I do not discount it as an argument, and
it may be followed up in the other
place.</p><p><a name="06051691000593"><b><a name="06051691001249">Andrew

difficulties with the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr.

<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 897</b><br>he would accept that all motions before the House tabled by Back
Benchers must have equal status. According to his logic, the House
would be forced to debate any early-day motion that attracted more than
65 signatures. That would tie down parliamentary time to an impossible
degree.</p><p><a name="06051691000594"><b><a name="06051691001250">Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important
point, if only in saying&#151;as I think I have been
saying&#151;that a good many of the issues will need to be examined
in the round. It is not just a question of slapping down a clause and
saying &#147;Isn&#146;t that a great idea? Let us put it into
legislation.&#148; The Minister might even agree with me about
that.</p><p><a name="06051691000595"><b><a name="06051691001251">David

Howarth:</b> The problem that new clause 14 at least attempts
to solve is precisely the question of what counts as controversial for
the purpose of a choice between the procedure proposed by the Bill and
ordinary legislation. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has read the
report of the Committee proceedings. During those proceedings, his hon.
Friend the. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) suggested that if one
Member objected, the matter would be controversial and should be
treated as a Bill.</p><p><a name="06051691000598"><b><a name="06051691001254">Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman has made the same
point again. He has heard what I have had to say. I shall move on now,
but I think the Minister has received the message that Members would
like to hear his
views.</p><p><a name="06051691000599"><b><a name="06051691001255">Mr.
Chope:</b> Does my hon. Friend now accept that there may well
be scope for common ground between all Opposition Members, so that when
the Bill goes to the other place an amendment along these lines will be
able to command common support among Liberal Democrats and
Conservatives, and receive applause when it returns to the House of
Commons?</p><p><a name="06051691000600"><b><a name="06051691001256">Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I think that the matter should be seen in
a wider context, and in that context I cannot answer my hon.
Friend&#146;s question. What I can say is that our party will discuss
it with our noble
Friends.</p><p><a name="06051691000601">Another of
our concerns is that the amendments severely restrict the period during
which the Committee&#146;s veto can be exercised. Amendments Nos. 46
and 50 allow for the exercise of the veto in the negative and
affirmative resolution procedure respectively only after a 30-day
period commencing with the day on which the draft order is laid before
Parliament. That means that the period during which the veto may be
exercised is limited to just 10 days.</p><p><a name="06051691000602">While I understand the time
limit, I wonder on reflection whether there is really a need to prevent
a Committee from exercising its veto in the first 30 days following the
laying of a draft order before Parliament. Perhaps the Minister could
explain. In any event, we look forward to hearing the debate on the
issue, particularly the debate on amendment (a), which was tabled by
members of the Procedure Committee.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 898</b><br><p><a name="06051691000603">Amendments Nos. 54 and 55 allow
for the veto to be exercised under the super-affirmative procedure only
during the period between the moment when the Minister lays a statement
before Parliament detailing representations made on the draft order and
the moment at which the order is voted on in both Houses and therefore
approved. It is unclear how long the gap between the two events is
estimated to be. Is it not feasible that they could occur within a
matter of days of each
other?</p><p><a name="06051691000604">We are also
concerned about the conditions that must be met for a recommendation
from a Committee to be valid. They appear onerous, and may provide the
Government with a simple excuse to reject a Committee&#146;s
recommendation rather than resorting to an attempt to defeat the
recommendation in the
House.</p><p><a name="06051691000605">The factors
listed in clause 3 that a Minister must take into account when
introducing an order are essential. They provide a valuable safeguard,
one of the few originally contained in the Bill before widespread
criticisms forced the Government to back down. For that reason it is
right that the Minister must consider those factors, but is it
necessary for a parliamentary Committee&#151;consisting, I am sure,
of competent and respected parliamentarians&#151;to have to take
account of the same factors and more?</p><p><a name="06051691000606">The changes to the Bill
announced recently by the Cabinet Office are vital from a
constitutional viewpoint. They will help to prevent a Government from
abusing the Bill and from being able to amend any legislation on the
statute book, but imposing conditions on a Committee of Parliament that
is carrying out its function of holding the Executive to account and
preventing abuses of power is surely unnecessary and over-restrictive.
Do the Government not consider a parliamentary Committee sufficiently
responsible to make a wise enough decision on a draft order introduced
under the Bill? For that reason we tabled amendment (b) to the
Government&#146;s amendments Nos. 50, 54 and 55, calling for the
removal of subsections (2B), (4B) and (6B). We believe that such
changes would create the robust and flexible veto that so many
constitutional experts believe is vital to ensuring that the Executive
do not abuse the power conferred on them by the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="06051691000607">Our concerns about the
Government amendments appear to be shared by the Procedure Committee. I
note that it has also tabled amendments to all the Government&#146;s
amendments relating to the statutory veto, calling for the omission
from amendment No. 46 of proposed new subsections (2B) and (2C) and the
corresponding subsections in amendments Nos. 50, 54 and 55. They would
allow a Committee of either House to recommend that no further
proceedings be taken in relation to the draft order. There would be no
factors to consider and the onerous conditions imposed on the Committee
by the Government amendments would cease to exist.</p><p><a name="06051691000608">I shall now discuss our further
amendments to the Government amendments, which would prevent a Minister
from tabling a draft order for a period of two years if the same or
similar order had been vetoed by the relevant Select Committee. A
two-year moratorium has been imposed on altering the regulatory reform
order, but no such standstill period is contained in the proposals. I
noted with interest that such a moratorium 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 899</b><br>was also recommended in the Regulatory Reform Committee&#146;s report.
It was aimed at preventing a Minister who has just had an order vetoed
from laying a similar order before Parliament.</p><p><a name="06051691000609">In recent years, we have seen a
growing culture in which the Executive ignore the will of Parliament
or, should I say, the people. Certainly, we see that happening in the
European Union with underhand plans, now being implemented, to bring in
by stealth elements of the failed constitution. In the UK, we see it in
the Government bringing in their regionalisation plans&#151;whether
it be through primary care trust mergers, about which we heard earlier
today, or in respect of the police&#151;despite losing heavily in the
north-east referendum. Our amendments are aimed at stopping that move
towards legislation by stealth and regurgitation of failed
plans.</p><p><a name="06051691000610">An important
point about the statutory veto concerns the make-up of the Committee of
either House charged with reporting on the draft order. It is unclear
in the Bill what type of Committee it should be. Is there to be a
permanent Committee, charged with reviewing all orders issued under the
Bill? If so, I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the Procedure
Committee&#146;s conclusion that parliamentary scrutiny of draft
orders should not necessarily be in the hands of a single Committee
responsible for all orders, as in the Bill, but be discharged by
whatever Committee has the relevant subject expertise, including the
departmental Select Committee. Will the Minister clarify which
Committees the Government envisage undertaking those crucial
roles?</p><p><a name="06051691000611">The
Conservative party believes that the exercise of this veto, which was a
central plank in the Government&#146;s effort to placate the fears of
opponents of the Bill and was recommended by both the Public
Administration Committee and the Regulatory Reform Committee, should be
far more flexible than is envisaged in the amendment. The opinion of a
Select Committee charged with reporting on a draft order laid before
Parliament under the Bill should carry more force. The should be a less
restrictive time period for the exercise of the Committee&#146;s
recommendation, and fewer conditions should be imposed on the exercise
of that
recommendation.</p><p><a name="06051691000612"><b><a name="06051691001257">Andrew
Miller:</b> I think this is the first time, Madam Deputy
Speaker, that you have had to listen to our long and complicated
debates on the Bill, so welcome to the Chair. To make it even more
complicated, as the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) was
speaking, my glasses fell apart, so I shall have to ask the Minister to
hold my notes a little further away until my spare glasses
arrive.</p><p><a name="06051691000613">Both in
partnership with my fellow members of the Select Committee and
subsequently in exploring practical ways forward, I have carefully
considered the matter of the veto. I was certainly left with the
impression, as reinforced by the Chairman of the Procedure Committee,
that we were not being offered a qualified veto and I have discussed
with Ministers where that would leave us. I have expressed to my hon.
Friends privately and put it on the record that I am uncomfortable with
the Government&#146;s amendment, so I 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 900</b><br>am anxious to listen to the views of the Chairman of the Procedure

amended his amendments further in respect of the two-year
rule.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051691000714">6.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06051691000614">What powers
does the Minister envisage the Committee having? That is the most
important issue. The Secretary of State said in a letter of 11
May&#151;I referred to it yesterday and confused the hon. Member for
Huntingdon&#151;that the statutory veto was not &#147;a blanket
veto&#148;. There may be good technical reasons for that. I am not a
lawyer, but am always prepared to listen to them. Often one has to
listen to them at length; I do not want to disparage the profession of
the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe(Mr. Clarke),
but he might be happier with a bigger Bill.</p><p><a name="06051691000615">I am more interested in the
practical ways of how the House deals with its business. That issue was
raised by the Liberal Democrat MP, Brian Cotter, in 2001. In the Second
Reading debate on the Regulatory Reform Bill 2001, Brian Cotter, then
the Liberal Democrat Member for Weston-super-Mare, asked the then
Minister, the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer),
to explain what he meant about a ministerial undertaking. The
undertaking given has proved to be mighty effective; only 27 orders
were dealt with through the process in the last Parliament. The reason
is probably that a ministerial undertaking given to the House is an
absolute one.</p><p><a name="06051691000616">If the
Parliamentary Private Secretary would like to pick up my glasses from
over there&#151;I have just seen them through the corner of my
eye&#151;I would be extremely grateful, especially as the next part
of my speech is written in micro-dot. What a wonderful service we get
here. That&#146;s better, I can read my notes now. The ministerial
undertaking given is, I think, a very powerful vehicle. I would like to
establish clearly and unambiguously with the Minister whether he is
prepared today to restate that ministerial undertaking. I cite what the
then Minister said when he gave
it:</p><a name="06051691000705"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;First, I
am happy to confirm that the order-making power will not be used for
large and controversial
measures&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06051691000617">we have
already debated
that.</p><a name="06051691000706"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Secondly,
the Government would not proceed with an order against the
Committee&#146;s wishes.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report, </i>19
March 2001; Vol. 365, c.
117.]</p></ul><p><a name="06051691000618">No qualifications there;
it was said clearly that the Government would not proceed against the
wishes of the Committee. If the Minister can today, irrespective of the
partial statutory veto, give a similar undertaking, that would make a
forceful point. As I look around at hon. Members in their places who
have been or are Ministers, I know that they realise that such an
undertaking would be of very considerable
significance.</p><p><a name="06051691000619"><b><a name="06051691001258">Lynne
Jones (Birmingham, Selly Oak) (Lab):</b> A ministerial
undertaking is no substitute for stating something in the Bill.
Government amendment No. 46 includes no such statement; in fact, the
restrictions on the use of the so-called veto are so great that it is

let them continue along a particular course. That has proved an
effective mechanism; that said, I would prefer to adopt an approach in

Government&#146;s extraordinary proposal is to impose a statutory bar
on what a Select Committee of this House can do. The hon. Gentleman is
asking the Minister to assert that he will not use two thirds of the
provision, which seems absurd. The only way that the Minister could
make that binding is to be the only Minister involved with it, and to
stay in office for ever, which is unlikely. If he has no intention of
using the provision, why on earth include it in the Bill?

ministerial undertakings is that they are regarded as binding only on
the Government of whom the Minister in question is a member. Leaving
aside the history of ministerial undertakings not being adhered to by
some Governments&#151;and although I am sure that, if we took office,
we would be impeccably deregulatory and simultaneously sensitive to the
procedures of the House&#151;the fact is that many undertakings given
by the present Government would not be regarded as binding on successor
Governments. I envisage that in 10 years&#146; time, ministerial
undertakings will be regarded as somewhat irrelevant. Indeed, that is
why we did not accept assurances&#151;given constantly by the
previous Minister in response to complaints&#151;that the original
Bill would not be used in the way that it plainly allowed for if
someone stuck to the
law.</p><p><a name="06051691000624"><b><a name="06051691001263">Andrew

restating of the undertaking to which I have referred would be more
than a nuance and would shift the ground, albeit
slightly.</p><p><a name="06051691000625"><b><a name="06051691001264">Sir

trying to come from, but under the previous regime, a Committee could
communicate its concern and the Minister could then invoke his

am going to that sometimes proves a little difficult. In practice, I
would expect a Committee of this House to make use of the potential
veto at any stage up to the point at which the order in question is
issued; I would not want to insist that it be used only when the draft
order is published.</p><p><a name="06051691000627">Let us consider the following
example. An innocent-looking draft order affecting London museums met
with the approval of the original consultees and, at first glance, of
my predecessor Committee. But when it went out for broader public
consultation, a legitimate authority expressed reservations and
demonstrated to the Minister in question that an error had been made
and that it was not appropriate. So one needs the power to exercise the
veto at any stage, with or without statutory restrictions. Such a view
is based on the undertaking given by the then Minister on Second
Reading of the 2001
Act.</p><p><a name="06051691000628"><b><a name="06051691001266">Mr.
Greg Knight:</b> Surely the point is this. We were given a
ministerial undertaking on 7 February and what we need now is not a
second one, but the delivery of the first. That can be done today if
the Minister accepts the Procedure Committee&#146;s
amendments.</p><p><a name="06051691000629"><b><a name="06051691001267">Andrew
Miller:</b> As I said earlier, I have some sympathy with the
views of the authors of those amendments, which provide a more clinical
way of dealing with this issue. However, it seemed to me appropriate at
least to explore this idea and to invite comments from the Minister, in
order to help inform our proceedings. I understand where the right hon.
Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) is coming from, but I have yet
to hear the Minister explain why the veto was drafted in this way,
rather than according to the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s
understanding, which is based on evidence given to his
Committee.</p><p><a name="06051691000630">I turn to
the amendments standing in my name and that of my hon. Friend the
Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck) relating to the
two-year rule. Essentially, they are probing amendments that seek to
discover what will happen when a Minister is hell-bent on introducing
an order, despite opposition from a Committee of the House. Clause 16,
which deals with the super-affirmative resolution procedure, clearly
sets out the reporting procedure. There are mechanisms that enable
Ministers to tweak and amend an order in the light of discussions with
Committees of both Houses, and with public bodies and individuals. So
what starts as a draft order is not necessarily the final text. It may
be amended or qualified in writing, or the body or organisation for
which it is promulgated may make appropriate assurances. Yesterday, I
gave the example of the assurance given to both Houses by the chairman
of the Forestry Commission that satisfied the concerns expressed by my
Committee.</p><p><a name="06051691000631">Those
possibilities are available in the tweaking process, but what happens
if the Minister says that he will keep coming back even though the
Committee does not like what he says? First, the parliamentary business
managers would not be terribly enamoured of 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 903</b><br>that and the Minister would not survive for long without being ridiculed
for trying to repeat the same mistake over and over
again&#151;</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051691000715">6.30

designed to elicit an explanation from the Government of when it would
be sensible, in the lifetime of a Parliament, for a Minister to bring
back to the House an order that a Select Committee had decided was not
suitable for regulatory reform. Under what circumstances would the
Minister consider that appropriate?</p><p><a name="06051691000635">I am trying to break these
complex legal issues into simple and practical procedures that would
allow hon. Members to do our job and examine the work of the Executive
in an effective manner. The work of the Regulatory Reform Committee
would be strengthened if Conservative Members bothered to turn up, as I
noted previously to the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly), but
that is a matter for him to deal with.</p><p><a name="06051691000636">An effective mechanism is in
place, but we are trying to make it stronger so that it can deal with
the enhanced powers set out in the Bill. I hope that my comments will
inform that debate, and I look forward to the response from my hon.
Friend the Minister. That, in turn, will help the House to determine
the best way
forward.</p><p><a name="06051691000637"><b><a name="06051691001270">Mr.
Heath:</b> I am intrigued by the notion expounded by the hon.
Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) that ridiculing
Ministers causes them to be sacked. In my experience, they get promoted
or retain their salaries when their jobs are taken away. However, he
clearly knows more about that than
I.</p><p><a name="06051691000638">We are dealing with
one of the three most important elements in the Bill. Yesterday, I set
out the three ways to secure some safety with the proposals. I said
that that could be done by prescription of what could be dealt with by
the Bill, by proscription of what could not be so dealt with, and by
protection&#151;that is, using the safeguards available to the House
to influence the use of procedure.</p><p><a name="06051691000639">This group of amendments is
entitled &#147;Parliamentary veto&#148;, but that is an unfortunate
misnomer. A better alternative might be &#147;Parliamentary
caveat&#148;, as we are certainly not talking about Parliament
vetoing what the Government propose. We have heard a great deal about
the value of ministerial assurances and a Select Committee of the House
was assured, right at the start of our consideration of the Bill, that
there would be a Select Committee veto on proposals. The former
Minister, who is now Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform,
originally thought that that mechanism was already in the Bill. It was
gently pointed out to him that that was not the case, but he seemed to
retain that 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 904</b><br>misapprehension even as the Committee stage began. Eventually, he
promised that it would be brought in
later.</p><p><a name="06051691000640">The tenor of
the Government&#146;s response to the quite proper criticism of the
Bill voiced by hon. Members of all parties has been that the Select
Committee structure would have primacy in the procedural arrangements.
It therefore bodes very badly for the exercise of the powers in the
Bill that Ministers are not prepared, even now, to accept the
recommendations of the Procedure Committee or of the Regulatory Reform
Committee. The members of those Committees have great knowledge of
these matters, but their proposals were not adopted by Ministers when
they put forward their amendments.</p><p><a name="06051691000641"><b><a name="06051691001271">Mr.
Oliver Heald (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> Does the
hon. Gentleman agree that it would be a fine thing to trust our Select
Committees with the responsibility that he describes? If Ministers are
not prepared to do that, they should say so. They gave the impression
early on that they were prepared to trust the Select Committee with the
responsibility, so can he understand why they will not do so
now?</p><p><a name="06051691000642"><b><a name="06051691001272">Mr.
Heath:</b> I do not understand anything about the
Government&#146;s approach to the Bill. They have been dragged,
kicking and screaming, to the realisation that they could not get
through their entirely preposterous original proposals. They are in
full retreat, making concession after concession, but even now they do
not seem to understand the basic principles that underlie the many
criticisms levelled at the Bill from many quarters, and so are unable
to respond to them adequately.</p><p><a name="06051691000643">The Government do not propose a
Select Committee veto on procedure. It is transparently obvious that
the most that Select Committees can do is to make a recommendation in
that respect. I emphasise that we are not talking about a veto on an
order itself, as Ministers could always use an alternative procedure to
bring forward an order if the original procedure were rejected. They
could use for that purpose the primary legislation that in normal
circumstances would be the proper vehicle for introducing an order and,
in turn, that would mean that an order would be properly scrutinised by
this House and the other place.</p><p><a name="06051691000644">That alternative was always
open to Ministers, but the idea was to institute a fast-track procedure
that would avoid that level of scrutiny before an order went into a
Statutory Instrument Committee. No controversial measure was to have
been put through the fast-track procedure, but the proposal under
consideration would allow a Select Committee to consider an order only
under a very constricted time scale. The result would be that that
Committee would not be able to consider an order for too long, or to
listen too carefully to the voices from outside the House. The few hon.
Members serving on the Select Committee concerned would be able to make
a recommendation, but that could be overruled by an order of the
House.</p><p><a name="06051691000645">In those
circumstances, what would the motion put before the House contain?
Would it allow a proper debate and give people an opportunity to
express their 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 905</b><br>concerns and say why they did not consider the fast-track procedure
appropriate? Of course it would not. The matter would be dealt with at
the end of the day in a business motion requiring a negative or an
affirmative resolution of the House, and if anyone had the temerity to
say no it would be pushed through on a deferred Division on a Wednesday
afternoon. I would bet my life that the Government would have their way
because no one would know about any of the arguments why they should
not.</p><p><a name="06051691000646">What
considerations can a Select Committee make in even making such a
recommendation? Can it follow its instincts? Can it listen to the
advice that it was given? No, it cannot. The proposals from the
Minister lay down the limited range of criteria that the Committee can
use in coming to a conclusion. It is improper to constrain a Select
Committee&#146;s considerations in that way. I know of no
circumstances in which Ministers have tried by statutory means to
restrict the activities of a Select Committee of the
House.</p><p><a name="06051691000647"><b><a name="06051691001273">Andrew
Miller:</b> That is why I wanted to explore whether it would
be better to address the problem through a different route. It is a
real issue and we have to deal with it, but I want to find the best
solution.</p><p><a name="06051691000648"><b><a name="06051691001274">Mr.
Heath:</b> I understand that the hon. Gentleman is trying to
reach the right outcome, but I do not share his optimism that an
assurance from Ministers on the Treasury Bench that they will not apply
what is clearly laid out in statutory form in their proposals would
have any value whatever. The Select Committee would be very constrained
in the criteria that it could use to determine whether the procedure
was right. It is transparently obvious that if a Minister did not like
the result of the Select Committee&#146;s considerations, he would
overrule it in the House. There is nothing in the provisions to stop a
Minister behaving in that way. Even if the excellent new Minister on
the Treasury Bench was absolutely determined that he would not use the
provisions in that way, I do not believe that the writ of the
Parliamentary Secretary to the Cabinet Office&#151;or is it to the
Duchy of Lancaster, I am not sure of the exact title?&#151;would run
to the Home Secretary or to the Secretary of State for Constitutional
Affairs.</p><p><a name="06051691000649"><b><a name="06051691001275">The

Bench.</p><p><a name="06051691000650"><b><a name="06051691001276">Mr.
Heath:</b> I may be underestimating the Minister, but I have
seen dodgy procedure from past Home Secretaries and I do not believe
that a Home Secretary would listen to a junior Minister in the Cabinet
Office. No assurances from the Treasury Bench will hold
water.</p><p><a name="06051691000651">For that
reason, if the Government press ahead with the proposals in their
amendments Nos. 46, 50, 54 and 55, it is essential that we amend them
today to remove those appalling restrictions on the latitude allowed to
Select Committees in undertaking their work, both in terms of time and
the criteria they must use to assess whether an instrument is
appropriate for the fast-track procedure.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 906</b><br><p><a name="06051691000652"><b><a name="06051691001277">Mr.
Kenneth Clarke:</b> I think that I am correct in saying that
if a Select Committee was contemplating a recommendation that the
process should not be used it would almost certainly be advised by its
Clerk that it was not able to make such a recommendation unless it
addressed the terms of the legislation. It would be open to the
Committee to make a recommendation only if it could demonstrate that it
was complying with the conditions put on it. If the Select Committee
decided as a matter of parliamentary principle that the process was not
appropriate it would receive professional advice from the Clerk that it
was not in a position to make a recommendation on that
basis.</p><p><a name="06051691000653"><b><a name="06051691001278">Mr.

right. Such statutory constraints on the exercise of a Select
Committee&#146;s discretion are unique, but it is clear that, as the
hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones) said earlier, most,
if not all, of the good reasons for assessing that an order was
inappropriate for the accelerated procedure would be declared ultra
vires. We would have the absurd prospect that a Select Committee
decision was justiciable&#151;reviewable&#151;on the basis that it
had not followed criteria set down in statute in reaching its decision.
When has a Select Committee ever been bound by statute, and justiciable
in the courts, in the exercise of its discretion? The suggestion is
preposterous.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051691000716">6.45

Committee would not be able to veto it because it would have to go
through exactly the same hoops as the Minister? As we know, tax cuts
are not covered by that process so it is not a real protection in the
circumstances outlined by my right hon. and learned

I, too, shall call the hon. Gentleman my hon. Friend in this matter. He
is right. Anything within the terms of the order, and that the Minister
has correctly assessed as within the terms of the order, must be so in
the view of the Select Committee because it has to apply the same
criteria. Therefore, any political judgment on the essential question
of what is controversial means nothing in the context of the provision.
We were told at the start of the Bill&#146;s proceedings that it
would not be used for anything controversial. Then, the Government
elevated the threshold slightly and said that it would not be used for
anything &#147;highly&#148; controversial. I hope that we have now
gone back to &#147;controversial&#148;.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 907</b><br><p><a name="06051691000659">Unless we make the necessary
amendments, the whole measure will be meaningless. If the opportunity
arises, I shall press hard my amendment (c) to Government amendment No.
46, because removing those constraints is crucial to the work of Select
Committees. Even if that were achieved, we would still have the
problem, alluded to in a short debate between the hon. Member for
Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) and most of his hon. Friends on the Back
Benches, who did not agree with him, about a genuine parliamentary
veto.</p><p><a name="06051691000660">A Select
Committee has a Government majority. If the purpose of the safeguard is
to ensure that something that is deeply controversial to a section of
the House&#151;whether on the Government Benches or
elsewhere&#151;is not put through a fast-track procedure, a simple
majority in a Select Committee with a Government majority will not do
the job, however assiduously the Committee may attempt to do its job.
With the best will in the world, its members may not be aware of the
local implications of an order put through by that process that might
be deeply controversial. The procedure can be used not only for general
public Acts, but for local Acts. The Regulatory Reform Committee or its
successor might be completely unaware of a particular local Act, not
because Members had not done their research properly, but because there
was a burning political issue&#151;we are, after all, politicians,
which is why we are sent to this place&#151;of which they were
unaware because none of them was from that
area.</p><p><a name="06051691000661"><b><a name="06051691001283">Andrew
Miller:</b> If I might correct the hon. Gentleman, that is why
we have a consultation process. That is why the order relating to
London museums, to which I referred earlier, was dropped. The
consultation process identified an error relating to a local matter,
which would certainly not have been an issue in Burnley, the
constituency of my predecessor as
Chairman.</p><p><a name="06051691000662"><b><a name="06051691001284">Mr.

Committees to try to deal with such issues, but as we all
know&#151;certainly those of us with local authority
backgrounds&#151;often there will be no response to a consultation
and the matter appears entirely benign, until it is implemented. Then
everybody says, &#147;Why didn&#146;t you ask us? Why didn&#146;t
you consult us? Why didn&#146;t you allow our objections to be
heard?&#148; Of course there was the opportunity, but no one asked
the right person at the right time about their
problems.</p><p><a name="06051691000663">I want to
make it clear that we do not suggest the sort of process in new clause
14 from our partisan point of view. We deliberately set the threshold
beyond what the Liberal Democrat party has in the House. I do not think
that 10 per cent. is an unreasonable figure. If 10 per cent. of the
House feel strongly about something, the voice of those hon. Members
should be heard, because that subject is controversial by definition.
If that 10 per cent. comprise at least two parties represented in the
House, it is clear that no simple mechanism on behalf of one party for
political advantage is involved.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 908</b><br><p><a name="06051691000664">I believe that if those
circumstances apply, it is right that that should apply a brake to the
procedure. Let us remember that it would not be a brake on the order.
The order can still be translated into primary legislation and go
through its normal course of action. It is not a question of a minority
party preventing legislation; it is simply suggesting that the
legislation must be scrutinised. There are Liberal Democrat Members,
Conservative Members and Members from the minority parties who very
clearly understand the merits of that
case.</p><p><a name="06051691000665"><b><a name="06051691001285">Mr.

challenge the view of a Select Committee, and most certainly that of an
Executive with overweening power, but I am very concerned indeed about
the second part of his proposal because there is a quaint and
long-standing belief that Members of Parliament are individuals who
speak for themselves and their constituents, based on an assessment of
the problem. If he and the Liberal Democrats go down the road of
suggesting that any measure in the House must have the support of more
than one party, it is a very slippery path
indeed.</p><p><a name="06051691000666"><b><a name="06051691001286">Mr.

was a criticism when we first suggested such a proposal that to allow
one party effectively to block a parliamentary procedure was
inappropriate, because that should require a greater degree of
consensus. That is precisely why we suggested the provision. I find it
slightly odd that we now hear a quibble from the other direction,
suggesting that such things should be in the hands of a single party,
but perhaps that could be debated later. However, the proposal has
considerable merit in terms of parliamentary procedure. Simply because
we do not do it now is not a good enough reason to say that we should
not do it in the future.</p>

procedures on numbers. The next step after that would be to say that we
have entrenched majorities for constitutional matters. It would then be
a different kind of Parliament, and it may be a good one, but to make
that change&#151;which would have huge significance
constitutionally&#151;piecemeal would be the wrong thing to
do.</p><p><a name="06051691000669"><b><a name="06051691001288">Mr.
Heath:</b> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but I simply
do not agree with him. We need to set a precedent occasionally. We are
discussing an entirely novel procedure, to which a brake needs to be
applied, and we have suggested a good brake. That view is clearly
shared by the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr.
Clarke), who chairs the august body in the Conservative party that is
working on exactly these matters. His opinions should carry some weight
among Conservative Members.</p><p><a name="06051691000670">We ought to send a signal
today, which is why, given the opportunity, I will press new clause 14
to a Division this evening, and I will do so content in the knowledge
that it would serve the interests of Back Benchers, minority parties
and those who would not otherwise have the opportunity to make their
voice heard&#151;and who ought to be heard, either in a Select
Committee or a Statutory Instrument Committee&#151;at a later stage.
My worry about leaving the issue to another place, as I think the hon.
Member for Huntingdon intimated, is that Members of the House of Lords
will be very cautious indeed about expressing an opinion, because it is
quintessentially a House of Commons matter.</p><p><a name="06051691000671">My worry is that they will
simply not feel able to make the necessary intervention. That is why
tonight&#146;s debate is so important&#151;it may be our last
opportunity to make it clear that the procedure that the Government
propose will not do. If the Bill is passed today by a Government
majority, I do not believe that it will come back to us&#151;I wish
it would, but my fear is that the other place will feel inhibited about
intervening in House of Commons business for all the reasons that we
know, and therefore it will not come back to us for reconsideration.
Therefore, tonight is make-your-mind-up time about whether we accept
the very flawed mechanism that the Government
propose.</p><p><a name="06051691000672"><b><a name="06051691001289">Mr.
Greg Knight:</b> I only want to correct what I think was a
slip of the tongue. The hon. Gentleman said that he wanted to divide
the House on new clause 42. I presume that he meant amendment No.
46.</p><p><a name="06051691000673"><b><a name="06051691001290">Mr.
Heath:</b> I referred to new clause 14. I think that the right
hon. Gentleman, who is the Chairman of Procedure Committee, misheard
me, but I am grateful to him for intervening because it is important
that the discussion of these procedures is not only intelligible but
audible. So I repeat that I wish to seek a Division on new clause 14.
We had very important debate yesterday. This is the important debate
today, because if we get this wrong the procedure, albeit not quite so
open-ended as before the Government amendments were accepted yesterday,
will nevertheless be too open-ended for the comfort of any hon.
Member.</p><p><a name="06051691000674"><b><a name="06051691001291">Dr.
Tony Wright (Cannock Chase) (Lab):</b> There is, of course, a
slight gap between the way in which we talk 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 910</b><br>about Parliament and how it operates, and perhaps we ought to confess to
that, in the interests of people who listen to our debates and read the
reports of them. That was caught quite nicely by the casual remark of
my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew
Miller), the Chairman of the Regulatory Reform Committee, when he said
as an aside that the Conservative members of that Committee do not turn
up. I do not say that to make a trivial party point of the kind that we
are prone to make; I say it only because we are talking about the great
powers that should live within our Select Committees and how important
it is that their will should prevail, and we then go on to talk about
the glories of Parliament itself. Yet that is suddenly pierced when we
see the reality of how such things
work.</p><p><a name="06051691000675">It is rather
amusing in a way to watch the Opposition parties failing to agree on
what would be appropriate for Parliament to do in the
circumstances&#151;whether it is better that a Committee should
decide, whether the whole House should decide, or whether a percentage
of the House should decide, all of which ideas depend on different
versions of what Parliament is and how it operates. However, it is
quite a perverse argument to suggest that the House itself should not
decide on a matter before it. That argument is being put, because the
House is governed by parties and inbuilt majorities. That is true; it
is how our system works&#151;but it is odd to pick away at that
system in one little segment without acknowledging the fact in our
wider deliberations.</p><p><a name="06051691000676">That is a curious proposition,
because anyone looking at it from the outside would think it a rather
sensible procedure for the whole House&#151;the Commons bit of
parliamentary sovereignty&#151;to exercise its power, so that it can
constitutionally trump whatever a part of the House might decide. That
would seem the constitutionally proper arrangement. Indeed, that is
precisely how we proceed in the entirety of our business. To
acknowledge publicly that we do not want to proceed in that way, as is
being argued, is to give the game away, in a sense, about how this
place operates. If we are going to do that, we should at least follow
the argument through and give the whole game away, and not pretend that
we can just give a little bit of it away.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051691000717">7 pm</h5><p><a name="06051691000677">I take this area of the Bill
and the amendments seriously. They are crucial. As the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) just said, we are talking about one of
the most objectionable bits of the first incarnation of the Bill. It
was right to say that it would become less objectionable, or
unobjectionable, only if an effective veto were put into the Bill to
provide a mechanism to enable us to say, &#147;It is not appropriate
to use this mechanism for this purpose,&#148; and for that view to
prevail.</p><p><a name="06051691000678">The question
is: have the Government have inserted such a mechanism? The answer is:
partly. We have, perhaps, a qualified veto. We have a recommendation
power. However, if it is a veto, it could be argued that we have a
provision to veto the veto. Then we are back to the arguments that I
have just described about how Parliament works. Parliament can
collectively decide what to do&#151;but we know that in reality, that
can subvert the mechanism that we think we have 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 911</b><br>established to do a job for us. As has been said, we are talking about a
Committee that has a Government majority anyway, so why do the
Government need the reassurance of a veto on the veto when they have
inserted a procedure that, on the whole, is thought to be
satisfactory?</p><p><a name="06051691000679">There
may be disagreements about the mechanisms being recommended, but what
unites everybody who is contributing to this discussion is the
proposition that we want a strong rather than a weak veto. We want an
effective veto, rather than an ineffective one. We are entitled to look
to the Government to provide assurances about what is going to happen
in the days to come to deliver that effective veto, so that this whole
area of concern about the Bill is comprehensively removed. That is my
main point.</p><p><a name="06051691000680">I have one
further point on a matter that has been raised already&#151;trying to
specify the grounds on which the qualified veto can be exercised by a
Committee. Government amendments Nos. 46, 50, 54 and 55 insert that
qualified veto, but they also set out the only grounds that a Committee
may properly take into account when deciding whether to exercise that
veto. Including in the Bill in that way the grounds on which a
Committee may make a decision is entirely new. Previously, that has
always been a matter for Standing
Orders.</p><p><a name="06051691000681">There are two
difficult alternatives: either the courts will have the power to review
proceedings in Parliament, or the limitation is entirely ineffective
because the courts would hold that power without an express provision
overriding article 9 of the Bill of Rights. They have no power to
examine a Committee&#146;s reasoning, because to do so would be to
&#147;impeach or question&#148; proceedings in Parliament. It is
constitutionally extremely peculiar to invite the courts to review
judicially the validity of parliamentary decisions. That is why a
number of the amendments&#151;including one tabled by me&#151;seek
to remove those parts of the veto provision.</p><p><a name="06051691000682">I hope that when he replies,
the Minister will assure us that the concerns being expressed about the
effectiveness of the veto will be addressed, and that he will reflect
further and deliver a veto that will be strong rather than weak, and
effective rather than ineffective. I hope that he will reconsider
whether it is necessary, or indeed constitutionally desirable or
possible, to specify the grounds on which a Committee of the House can
exercise its power.</p><p><a name="06051691000683"><b><a name="06051691001292">Mr.
Greg Knight:</b> I rise to speak about Government amendment
No. 46 and amendment (a) to it, which is in my name and the names of
other members of the Procedure Committee. Amendment (a) is a
cross-party amendment, although I am aware that some members of the
Committee see it as a probing amendment, while others feel very
strongly about it. Government amendments Nos. 46, 50, 54 and 55
introduce the Committee veto that we have been discussing in respect of
the orders under the Bill.</p><p><a name="06051691000684">The Procedure Committee
recommended that a veto should be added to the Bill, so I give the
Government one cheer for delivering the veto. However, in introducing
that veto they have only partly met their commitment to the Committee,
because they have 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 912</b><br>sought to define the grounds on which the veto can be exercised. I have
serious concerns about that on two grounds. First, as has been said by
the hon. Members for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) and for Cannock
Chase (Dr. Wright), it raises the possibility that the courts might be
encouraged to examine how a Committee reached a decision, and whether
it did so properly. That would be clearly contrary to the accepted
understanding of article 9 of the Bill of Rights, as the hon. Member
for Cannock Chase said. It could draw the courts into areas that they
have hitherto been at pains to avoid.</p><p><a name="06051691000685">Secondly, and most importantly,
the grounds themselves are narrowly defined and certainly do not live
up to the Government&#146;s previous undertaking that no order would
be proceeded with if the relevant Committee judged that it was an
inappropriate use of the powers under the Bill&#151;for example,
because the matter was controversial. I refer Members to my
Committee&#146;s first report of this Session&#151;HC
894&#151;and evidence pages 17 and 18. We received evidence from the
Minister who was then at the Cabinet Office, the hon. Member for East
Renfrewshire (Mr. Murphy), who gave at least three ministerial
assurances on this matter&#151;or perhaps I should say one
ministerial assurance that was repeated three times.</p><p><a name="06051691000686">The hon. Gentleman was
unequivocal about the veto. In answer to questioning, he
said:</p><a name="06051691000707"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;so our commitment
is very clear, that we will not seek to do anything which is highly
controversial. The Select Committee will make a judgment on that and
the Select Committee can veto any recommendation from a
minister.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051691000687">During the
same evidence session, he went on to
say:</p><a name="06051691000708"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Ultimately,
the sanction that select committees have is, &#145;It doesn&#146;t
feel right. You have overstepped what we anticipated and we are not
willing to give our consent to this going forward either in the way you
propose&#146;, so it should not be a negative, it should be an
affirmative order or it should be super-affirmative, &#145;or it
should not go ahead at
all&#146;.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051691000688">Later, he
returned to the scope of the veto and, referring to what the Committee
could do, he said:</p><a name="06051691000709"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;so
they can either move it up one, or move it up two in fact, so they can
move it from negative to super-affirmative, or indeed they could just
say, &#145;We don&#146;t think this is suitable at all for this
committee&#146;, and we are back to the drawing board to seek an
alternative way of implementing the
order.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051691000689">There was no
mention of restrictions on the use of the veto, which are now before
us.</p><p><a name="06051691000690">My
Committee&#146;s amendment, and others, would remove the definition
of the grounds for the use of the veto, thus leaving open the
possibility that an additional veto, which could be exercised outside a
Committee, could be introduced by Standing
Orders.</p><p><a name="06051691000691"><b><a name="06051691001293">The
Minister for the Cabinet Office (Hilary Armstrong):</b> It
might help the House if I remind the right hon. Gentleman that the
evidence that he is citing was given before the amendments to limit the
powers with regard to the orders were tabled. The Government have been
very careful to limit those powers in the manner for which the House
asked through the Select Committees that examined the matter. They
simply linked the veto to the new restricted powers. Part of the almost
circular argument that we are having is that although we have agreed
the limit on the powers, it is said that the powers are now so narrow
that the veto 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 913</b><br>must be widened. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman understands what
the Government were trying to do. During this debate,
yesterday&#146;s debate on narrowing the powers is being forgotten.
The Government tried to link the veto to the new definition of the
powers.</p><p><a name="06051691000692"><b><a name="06051691001294">Mr.
Knight:</b> I am not sure that that is a valid point. The
powers in the Bill may well have been narrowed, but that has been done
only in line with what Ministers said the purpose of the Bill would be
anyway. Ministers have introduced provisions that achieve what they
told us, through assurances, that the Bill would be used for. I do not
accept the point that the right hon. Lady is
making.</p><p><a name="06051691000693">We do not want
to widen the veto, but we think that it should be exercised as was
indicated by the former Minister when he gave evidence to the Procedure
Committee: if a measure is controversial&#151;although controversy is
outwith the scope of the veto&#151;a Committee should be able to veto
it. That would not stop the Government getting their legislation
through. As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said, we are merely
suggesting that we should be able to say to the Government that the
fast-track procedure is not appropriate in a specific case, so the
measure should be subject to greater scrutiny. With the greatest
respect to the right hon. Lady, she did not make a valid point at
all.</p><p><a name="06051691000694">If the Government
are not ratting on a promise, they are certainly guilty of backsliding
on an unequivocal ministerial assurance given to a Select Committee of
the House. I hope that we will be able to vote on amendment (a) to
Government amendment No. 46. Quite simply, the House should not put up
with
this.</p><p><a name="06051691000695"><b><a name="06051691001295">Alison
Seabeck:</b> As a member of both the Regulatory Reform
Committee and the Standing Committee that considered the Bill, I am
generally pleased by the progress that has been made. However, I still
have concerns about this group of amendments, especially Government
amendments Nos. 46, 50, 54 and 55. Those concerns have been voiced with
greater knowledge and expertise than mine by my hon. Friends the
Members for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) and for Cannock
Chase (Dr.
Wright).</p><p><a name="06051691000696">Although the
Regulatory Reform Committee&#146;s special report, which has been
much quoted, has, it appears, provided the basis for many of the
revisions that have been made to the Bill, no further amendment has
been made to one or two aspects. However, there is still a case for
both this House and another place to consider those aspects. That is
why I have put my name to several amendments tabled by my hon. Friend
the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston.</p><p><a name="06051691000697">In my view, and in that of the
Regulatory Reform Committee and the Public Administration Committee, it
is preferable that after an order has been laid, no draft order to the
same effect, or any which, although it has been reworded or modified,
would have the same effect, should be laid within two years. The veto
as it stands does not bring with it the two-year moratorium that the
Regulatory Reform Committee felt was appropriate as a matter of course.
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will again consider proposing
further changes, which could be brought forward in another place, to
introduce such a measure.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 914</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06051691000718">7.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06051691000698">The Regulatory
Reform Committee felt that the demand for a two-year breathing space
did not expect more from Ministers than at present, as they already
voluntarily respect that rule. However, in the interests of our peace
of mind, and with regard to possible abuse by future Governments and
Ministers who are not so well disposed or responsible as the present
incumbents, this matter demands further ministerial
consideration.</p><p><a name="06051691000699">Unless
a Committee&#146;s veto was overturned by the House, the Committee
would have significant powers&#151;although, as hon. Members have
said, its precise role is not exactly clear. The hon. Member for
Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) raised concerns too, so I hope that the
Minister will clarify the time scale in which the veto must be
exercised, because it is 10 days in the case of Government amendment
No. 54, but a less specific period in the case of Government amendment
No. 55.</p><p><a name="06051691000700">There appears
to be no scope for a formal veto if the real problem is an order being
categorised as controversial or inappropriate. Members of the Standing
Committee will recall that we could not get a clear definition of those
terms, despite the then Minister&#146;s best efforts to provide
reassurance. The Bill is thus narrower than the informal undertaking
that has been respected since the introduction of the Regulatory Reform
Act 2001. Will the Minister confirm whether such an undertaking remains
on offer this time? If not, will he consider including it more formally
in the Bill?</p><p><a name="06051691000701">The
Minister&#146;s predecessor said to the Public Administration
Committee:</p><a name="06051691000710"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to get the
veto provision correct will take a great deal of work and thorough
consideration&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06051691000702">There has
been a great deal of thorough consideration, but we may still have work
to do to ensure that the Bill meets the concerns raised in the House
today. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will not rule out
amendments that would insert the two-year restriction, following the
gentle and friendly probing of Labour
Members.</p><p><a name="06051719000060"><b><a name="06051719002581">Mr.
Kenneth Clarke:</b> I almost stopped trying to catch your eye,
Madam Deputy Speaker, because I agreed with everything said by my hon.
Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) when he moved new
clause 5 and everything said by my right hon. Friend the Member for
East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) and the hon. Members for Somerton and Frome
(Mr. Heath) and for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright). On these questions of
parliamentary procedure, we are Members who are usually brought
together across the Floor in such discussions. I speak only to
underline the importance of the points that are being made for the
benefit of those in another place. The general understanding outside is
that the Government have made a substantial retreat, and it might be
felt that the worst problems have somehow been solved and that there is
not a great deal left to do. Unless the Minister makes an extremely
generous response to the debate, I hope that Members of another place
will examine seriously whether we are adequately reassured by what has
been done.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 915</b><br><p><a name="06051719000061">I regard the Bill as dangerous
because we are talking about circumventing the ordinary parliamentary
processes of considered debate and judgment and using instead a
fast-track procedure that might have broad application. I am prepared
to take the risk of passing such a Bill because of my enthusiasm for
deregulation. I have no reason to doubt the bona fides of either
Minister who has handled the Bill in detail because both genuinely
endeavoured to have as wide a Bill as possible so that they can deliver
deregulatory measures. I look forward to reading the reports and
finding out what has been delivered. I think that the Minister will be
contending with the culture of Westminster and Whitehall, but I hope
that his good intentions will produce something worth
while.</p><p><a name="06051719000062">We need the
strictest safeguards when introducing a procedure that can further
reduce the use of the proper parliamentary process for potentially
difficult subjects. As my right hon. Friend the Member for East
Yorkshire said, we should hold the Government precisely to the
undertakings that the former Minister gave. I thus echo everything that
has been said about the Select Committee having the right to exercise a
veto at its own discretion, bearing in mind the concern that we have
all expressed that the procedure should not be used to circumvent
parliamentary procedure when a significant body of interest is entitled
to be heard.</p><p><a name="06051719000063">I have
to say&#151;this is about the only note of dissent that has arisen
between any two Members who have spoken, because we have not yet heard
the ministerial reply&#151;that I have never been completely
reassured by the Select Committee veto. Select Committees have an
in-built Government majority. A year or two ago, the House was given
the opportunity to reconsider the way in which Select Committees are
appointed because of concerns that the powers of ministerial and Whips
Office patronage were being brought to play in appointments to Select
Committees. I do not want to discuss whether that is still true, but
the danger is only too obvious&#151;and it might recur. At present,
there is a great deal of patronage. We are lucky that such good
Chairmen as the ones who have spoken have emerged from the process.
Nevertheless, there is an in-built Government majority.</p><p><a name="06051719000064">The undertakings that were
given from the outset were outlined in a precise quotation from my
right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire. We were reassured that
the full parliamentary process would be used for any controversial
procedure. In my opinion, that means giving an adequately large
minority the opportunity to have their views heard and debated, and to
insist that an important change goes through the correct
process.</p><p><a name="06051719000065"><b><a name="06051719002582">Mr.
Walker:</b> Is my right hon. and learned Friend concerned that
the Government could lean on the more ambitious and younger members of
the Select Committee to ensure that they come round to the
Government&#146;s way of thinking, although that would go against the
rules of the
House?</p><p><a name="06051719000066"><b><a name="06051719002583">Mr.
Clarke:</b> The hon. Member for Cannock Chase gave some candid
views on how the House works in reality. We should be careful about too
much candour, 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 916</b><br>but I have not the slightest doubt that Governments of all complexions
use the process to which my hon. Friend refers if a Select Committee
looks like it will be too difficult. There is, of course, a political
process behind that, which we all realise has to be borne in
mind.</p><p><a name="06051719000067">I reiterate my
belief that if a substantial body of opinion in the House wishes to
insist on the full procedure, it should have the opportunity of doing
so. I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon for putting
him in a slight difficulty, but I have no way of getting out of this
because I shared a platform with the hon. Member for Cambridge (David
Howarth) from which we advocated such an idea. In the end, that is the
only satisfactory reassurance we can have.</p><p><a name="06051719000068">The Liberals have been quite
generous in putting the limits they propose beyond their reach as a
single party. I am not sure why one of the three major parties of the
House should be prevented from having a full parliamentary procedure if
it so wishes, but I agree with my Front-Bench colleagues that that
would involve much wider considerations, including the whole question
of who determines what we debate on the Floor of the House and how we
do it. That needs to be addressed.</p><p><a name="06051719000069">I continue to hold the view
that the one thing that will be completely beyond the control of the
Government is stopping 10 per cent. of the Members of the House
indicating, in some formal fashion, that they believe that the full
process should go ahead. If we can get 10 per cent. to insist on that,
it means that there is some interest, with which I probably profoundly
disagree, that is entitled to have the full parliamentary process
before the legislative machinery is changed.</p><p><a name="06051719000070">My hon. Friends are worried
about precedent. One of the most common arguments used by the civil
service and others against deregulation is the precedent that might be
created if we reopen something. Precedent has to be approached with
caution. Let me make it clear: I do not think that the proposal
establishes any precedent for allowing a minority to block legislation
that has gone through the legislative process. It sticks in our craw
when we have lost a measure by one vote, but one vote is sufficient in
this place for the majority to overrule the minority. However, we must
go through a process before that conclusion can be reached. I do not
see precedent being created because of the unique nature of the Bill.
We are talking about altering primary legislation by a process that
cuts out all the ordinary legislative process precisely because of the
need for speed and to avoid delay, and because we are so keen on
deregulation.</p><p><a name="06051719000071"><b><a name="06051719002584">Dr.
Tony Wright:</b> Was not the right hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s reference to the political factors the key
consideration? Surely if the relevant Select Committee, with, as we
keep saying, a Government majority, recommended that it was not
appropriate to use the order-making power for the purpose proposed, and
if the Government nevertheless sought to overturn that by using their

to make that recommendation has to be removed. If the Select Committee
makes a recommendation exercising a discretion and a political judgment
that the process is unsuitable, I accept that it would be a bold
Government indeed who went ahead with the change, although the point
made was valid: we are not talking about the Government having to
expose themselves to a full debate on the Floor of the House or some
particular process to get their resolution through. We have now reached
a stage at which half the time votes on orders and procedures have been
reduced to a ritual part of the process of the House. If we are talking
about the reality, the change would probably be decided by a deferred
Decision on Wednesday, as I think the hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome said. If we are being indiscreetly candid, probably a very high
proportion of the Members of Parliament ticking the piece of paper
would not bother to inquire closely exactly what subject they were
voting on. It is too trivial a procedure to override such a
change.</p><p><a name="06051719000073">I do not

doing her best, with all these concessions, to sort out a rather
miserable process that she inherited. I acknowledge all that. However,
my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire precisely and
brilliantly responded to her main point. The undertakings were given by
a Minister who said that the Bill would be used for only narrow
purposes. I shall not go back to yesterday&#146;s debate, but I do
not believe that the Bill as it stands has narrowed the scope of the
powers to the scope described by the former Minister. It allows for far
more than ordinary deregulation. That must be looked at
again.</p><p><a name="06051719000076">I hope lots of

reasons to block deregulatory measures and upset the

the reassurance that if a big body of opinion wants something debated,

not wish to bring to the Floor of the House things that they want to
debate. I do not often feel the frustration that a left-wing member of

Bench, but there were times during the Iraq war when I was slightly
impatient about the opportunities we had, the timing of the debates and
the form of the motion proposed through the usual channels to be
debated on the Floor of the House. On deregulatory matters to do with
forestry and the licensing of vendors of game, one might often find
that the two Front Benches and the usual channels do not have the
monopoly of the views of every hon. Member about what the proper

  <p><a name="06051719000079">I do not understand why Ministers are being so cautious. I have not doubted their good will because when I debated this matter with the previous Minister I believed him, and when I listen to these Ministers I believe them when they say that they have no intention of undermining Parliament and they intend to deregulate only on non-controversial measures. They give us every assurance that it has never crossed their minds to introduce politically controversial measures that might upset a significant minority or to avoid proper debate by taking it through their proposed process. I still cannot understand why the Government will not include that in the Bill, as they would bind all their successors&#151;and not just themselves&#151;if they did so. They are receiving advice from someone in the Department who does not share their deregulatory enthusiasm or who has a sneaking hope that one day a Government will get stuff through Parliament quicker and with less inconvenience. Why do the Government keep tabling late and mealy-mouthed amendments that do not live up to their undertakings? My praise for their deregulatory intentions would be followed by praise for their sensitivities to sentiments in the House if they tabled amendments&#151;alternatively they could accept the amendments tabled by the Conservative spokesmen and by the Liberal Democrats&#151;and include in the Bill something that they have been telling us since they first introduced it. I do not understand their reluctance to do so.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051719002567">7.30 pm</h5><p><a name="06051719000080"><b><a name="06051719002590">David Howarth:</b> I agree with every word that the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) said, and I do not intend to add to his contribution. I shall, however, make a few points that have not been made in our debate.</p><p><a name="06051719000081">Our debate has focused on two amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) that I am happy to support. Amendment (c) to Government amendment No. 46 removes from the Government&#146;s so-called veto&#151;it is not, in fact, a veto&#151;the requirement on the Committee to consider various things under clauses 2 and 3. New clause 14 attempts to provide a genuine parliamentary veto. I wish to make only one point about amendment (c). Yesterday, the Government were keen to tell us that their judicial review of ministerial discretion did not require the insertion of the word, &#147;reasonably&#148;, in the Bill. That creates a problem, as what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. The word, &#147;reasonably&#148;, does not appear in Government amendment No. 46, but &#147;considers&#148; does. That leaves scope for judicial review, as long as the problem of the Bill of Rights is overcome, as the hon. Member for Cannock Chase(Dr. Wright) said.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 919</b><br><p><a name="06051719000082">The Government should therefore say categorically in reply to the debate that they do not intend the amendment to override provisions in the Bill of Rights that forbid the courts from interfering with what happens in the House. However, as the hon. Gentleman said, if they say that that statutory form of words is not intended to have legal effect, why have they introduced the provision, as there does not appear to be an enforcement mechanism? They are therefore left in an obvious dilemma: either they add words to the statute that do not have any effect, or they must do what should always be done in the circumstances&#151;if one does not want words to have effect, one leaves the matter to convention or to the Standing Orders ofthe House, which are not justiciable. I fail to see why the Government have not taken that route.</p><p><a name="06051719000083">My main argument concerns new clause 14. The procedural protections against the misuse of the Bill are still required, because yesterday changes were made to the purposes for which the Bill can be used and to the subject matter to which it can apply. It can no longer be used to change itself, or to change the Human Rights Act 1998. However, we did not debate a far more important restriction&#151;the proposal that the Bill should not be used to change any of the country&#146;s constitutional arrangements. We did not discuss that amendment, so it is possible to use the Bill for those purposes. Yesterday, we examined the example of changes to trial by jury, which is not protected by the Human Rights Act. The Bill could be used to make dramatic changes to that right, and it is still possible to reform local government using an order under the Bill. There is therefore a great need for procedural protections, which is why we have proposed such protections in new clause 14 in addition to the so-called Committee veto, which, as everyone knows, is not a veto.</p><p><a name="06051719000084">The only argument against our proposal is that it will set a dangerous precedent. That argument suggests that we should not do the right thing now for fear that our slightly dim successors will not be able to tell the difference between the problem that we face and the problem that they face. Nevertheless, new clause 14 is not a departure, because there are such mechanisms, albeit with a slightly different construction, in Standing Orders. Standing Order No. 92 deals with what happens when a Bill has been considered by a Second Reading Committee or by the Scottish Grand Committee. The Report stage could take place in a Special Committee or in a Scottish Grand Committee. Standing Order No. 92 says that if a motion is introduced in the House to allow for that and 20 Members rise in their place and object,</p><a name="06051719002561"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Speaker shall declare that the noes have it.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051719000085">Standing Orders already provide a blocking mechanism on procedure that requires a fuller hearing of the matter&#151;in this case, the Report stage&#151;than would otherwise be the case. That is precisely what we are trying to do in new clause 14.</p><p><a name="06051719000086"><b><a name="06051719002591">Mr. Roger Gale (North Thanet) (Con):</b> The hon. Gentleman has the text of the Standing Orders before him, and he is quite right. I do not have the text with  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 920</b><br>me, but I think that I am right that it does not specify that those Members should come from more than one party in the House.</p><p><a name="06051719000087"><b><a name="06051719002592">David Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman is quite right&#151;the standing order does not provide that extra protection. However, new clause 14 does so: Members who object to the use of the procedure should not all come from one party.</p><p><a name="06051719000088"><b><a name="06051719002593">Mr. Heath:</b> Another blocking mechanism can be deployed by a minority of one. It is often seen and heard on Friday afternoons when we debate private Members&#146; Bills. It is usually the role of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) to shout, &#147;Object&#148;, thus preventing the progress of such Bills. A blocking minority can therefore act to procedural effect.</p><p><a name="06051719000089"><b><a name="06051719002594">David Howarth:</b> Indeed, that is a blocking minority of one from one political party.</p><p><a name="06051719000090">The purpose of new clause 14 is to protect minorities. It provides geographical protection&#151;we have heard the point about local Acts&#151;and it also protects political minorities in the House and within parties. A matter can be controversial for a substantial number of Back Benchers, but it may not be controversial for their Front-Bench spokesmen. We need a mechanism that allows such minorities not to block the progress of legislation completely, but to demand further debate.</p><p><a name="06051719000091"><b><a name="06051719002595">Mr. Gale:</b> The hon. Gentleman is kind in accepting interventions, but he has contradicted himself. He says that the provision is meant to protect minorities, including minorities in a single party. Forgive me, but it is not inconceivable that 70 members of the parliamentary Labour party would disagree with their Front Bench, as they often do so at present. If they wished to object, but did not receive any support from the Opposition, their objection could not be heard under his proposal.</p><p><a name="06051719000092"><b><a name="06051719002596">David Howarth:</b> At least the position of those Members would be better than it would be if the new clause is not accepted. The hon. Gentleman, if I may say so, is making the best the enemy of the good.</p><p><a name="06051719000093">The purpose of the new clause is to make sure that in circumstances where the matter before the House is controversial in the minds of a sufficient number of Members, the full Bill procedure will be used. The main problem that we have had with the Bill all the way through is that Ministers have told the Committee that they did not intend to use the procedure for controversial matters, but they have not been prepared to offer any substantive definition of &#147;controversial&#148;. That is why, to extract Ministers from that difficulty, Members on the Liberal Democrat Benches and in other parts of the House have tried to solve the problem procedurally. New clause 14 offers, in effect, a procedural definition of what is controversial.</p><p><a name="06051719000094">I cannot understand why the Government resist. They do so, presumably, because they do not want written into the Bill matters that could possibly become subject to judicial review. They want to protect  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 921</b><br>themselves from the courts, but, with their own system of a Committee veto, they are offering a line of argument that may well lead to the Committees of the House being subject to exactly the same review in the courts. I find that to be precisely the wrong way round. It ought to be Ministers, more than Committees of the House or the House itself, who are subject to the courts.</p><p><a name="06051719000095"><b><a name="06051719002597">Mr. McFadden:</b> May I begin by offering the House a point of information relating to a point of order raised earlier about the regulator&#146;s compliance code?

We were left floundering about, not knowing that it was in the Library.

Yesterday there were many contributions from hon. Members who argued that the powers set out in new clause 19, 20 and 21 were perhaps an improvement on the original version of the Bill, but that they were still far too wide. They could be used, for example, to abolish trial by jury&#151;we heard that again a few minutes ago&#151;introduce euthanasia, and possibly even recast our relationship with the European Union, yet today, in the discussion of the veto, which is related to those same clauses, the powers in them appear to have shrunk. We are told that the veto is not worth much because it is related to those powers, which yesterday were criticised as being so wide. Today they seem to have shrunk so much that they might not apply to our friend the Wolverhampton butcher. There is a curiosity in the criticisms of tying the veto to the powers set out in new clauses 19, 20 and 21.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 922</b><br><p><a name="06051719000102"><b><a name="06051719002603">Mr. Gale:</b> In the light of the letter that the Minister kindly sent to me earlier today, which is about powers in new clause 19, can he explain what he had in mind when he wrote that letter?</p><p><a name="06051719000103"><b><a name="06051719002604">Mr. McFadden:</b> With the Deputy Speaker&#146;s permission, I am happy to do so.</p><p><a name="06051719000104">The legal effect of new clause 19 relates to the power to remove or reduce burdens. The purpose for which the power can be exercised contains two alternatives. The first is the removing or reducing of any burden resulting for any person directly or indirectly from legislation. The second is removing or reducing the overall burdens resulting for any person directly or indirectly from legislation.</p><p><a name="06051719000105">Removing or reducing a burden from one person may increase the burdens upon others, so the first alternative could permit an overall increase on persons as a whole. For example, where a regulatory regime is being placed on a risk basis, costs on low-risk businesses could go down, while costs on high-risk businesses may go up.</p><p><a name="06051719000106">The second alternative requires a removal or reduction of burdens overall, although this would permit the imposition of new burdens where the overall effect was a removal or reduction of burdens. This is similar to the position under the 2001 Act; if a burden is removed, new burdens may be added. Orders as a whole, including any new burdens, must meet the safeguards, including, for example, being proportionate to the policy objective of the order.</p><p><a name="06051719000107">In particular, I draw the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention to the precondition in clause 3(2)(c), which requires that Ministers consider that the provision as a whole</p><a name="06051719002562"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;strikes a fair balance between the public interest and the interests of any person adversely affected by it&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06051719000108">This precondition, which is clearly particularly relevant where burdens are imposed or increased, also mirrors the existing position under the 2001 Act. The explanatory document will include both a summary of consultation responses, and an assessment of the extent to which an order to be made under new clause 19 removes or reduces burdens. Also, a detailed impact assessment would be provided, where appropriate, and these documents would explain the rationale behind the proposals.</p><p><a name="06051719000109">The expectation is that in most cases the overall burden will have been reduced, but for the reason stated above the Government believe that we need the flexibility to add burdens as well as remove them, if these burdens are to be useful in delivering better regulation.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051719002568">7.45 pm</h5><p><a name="06051719000110"><b><a name="06051719002605">Mr. Chope:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation.

Measures should be properly and effectively scrutinised in the House to make sure that they do not unnecessarily increase burdens. We therefore need the amendments that we tabled to constrain the procedure through which the House might examine those burdens.</p><p><a name="06051719000114"><b><a name="06051719002608">Mr. McFadden:</b> Well, I think that that is what people call &#147;a stretch&#148;, although I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we need effective scrutiny procedures. If hon. Members allow me to proceed with my remarks, I shall set out how those scrutiny procedures will operate.</p><p><a name="06051719000115">Government amendments Nos. 46 to 55 fulfil a commitment made in Standing Committee to provide parliamentary Committees in both Houses with a statutory power to veto orders. Noting concerns about the procedural safeguards in the Bill, Government amendments provide that Committees can veto orders under any procedure; negative, affirmative and super-affirmative.</p><p><a name="06051719000116">I want to stress at the outset the important point that the Government have given careful consideration to the form that the promised veto should take. We have sought to listen and to respond to views on the issue raised during the passage of the Bill, including those of the Select Committees, most of the Chairmen of which have spoken, and we hope to continue that dialogue. I assure hon. Members that the Government will continue to listen to views on the most appropriate way to ensure that the safeguards in the Bill are effective and workable.</p><p><a name="06051719000117">As has been said, the veto is not a blanket veto. Committees will, of course, be able to oppose an order on any basis that they choose, which is the case under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. Several hon. Members have asked me to clarify that matter, and I reiterate the Government&#146;s commitment not to push through orders in the face of Committee opposition. I must add that the Government have always adhered to that commitment in the operation of the 2001 Act.</p><p><a name="06051719000118"><b><a name="06051719002609">Mr. Heath:</b> The Minister has said that the Committee can reflect on any matter in reaching its recommendation. Government amendment No. 46 states that</p><a name="06051719002564"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A recommendation may be made under subsection (2B) only if the committee considers&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051719000119">the criteria. How can that mean &#147;anything&#148;?</p><p><a name="06051719000120"><b><a name="06051719002610">Mr. McFadden:</b> The statutory veto relates to the powers set out in the Bill. If it were operated, it would mean that the order could not continue to be made by  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 924</b><br>the Minister. However, it would not constrain the Committee from opposing the order on other grounds, in which case the legal consequences would not be triggered and the Minister would seek to adhere to the terms of the undertaking. The statutory veto relates to the powers in the clauses that we discussed yesterday, but the Committee can express a view in other terms, should it wish to do so.</p><p><a name="06051719000121"><b><a name="06051719002611">Mr. Kenneth Clarke:</b> Will the Minister explain the logic of that proposition? He rightly accepts that the Select Committee will be totally unconstrained when it comes to considering the merits of an order, so if it wants to vote against an order or express a view, it can consider anything it likes. When it comes to what procedure should be followed, however, the Select Committee would be tightly constrained by the terms of the statute. What on earth is the point of allowing the Select Committee full discretion on debating the merits of an order, but to confine it so closely on the procedural point of cutting out parliamentary debate? There could be orders that the Select Committee is against, but on which it approves of the procedure, and there could be ones of which it is in favour, but on which it thinks that there should be full procedure, because it knows that many other hon. Members want to consider the matter. Why distinguish between the two?</p><p><a name="06051719000122"><b><a name="06051719002612">Mr. McFadden:</b> The position is symmetrical because the statutory veto relates to the powers in the Bill, which is the point made by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office in her intervention on the Chairman of the Procedure Committee. We were asked to introduce a statutory veto, but we were also asked to narrow the powers in the Bill. The Government amendments include a statutory veto, which relates to the narrowing of the powers in the Bill that the House agreed yesterday.</p><p><a name="06051719000123">In the context of amendments to focus the order-making power more explicitly on better regulation objectives, it was considered appropriate for the veto to provide a symmetrical and focused check on that power. The Government consider it right that proposals are judged on the extent to which they deliver the regulatory reform agenda, and it is right that the proposals are judged on whether the conditions in the Bill are met.</p><p><a name="06051719000124">First and foremost, the veto is intended to present an effective and workable mechanism to protect against the abuse of the order-making power in the Bill. To that end, the veto builds directly upon the strengths of the existing system for scrutinising orders. The conditions to which the veto is tied are consistent with those contained in the Standing Orders of relevant Committees under the 2001 Act, conditions against which Committees have previously tested and, in one case, rejected regulatory reform orders. The Government believe that those conditions continue to represent key indicators on whether a proposal is suitable for delivery by order.</p><p><a name="06051719000125">Additionally, the veto addresses concerns surrounding a Minister&#146;s capacity to implement Law Commission recommendations &#147;with changes&#148;, which has raised questions about the extent to which a recommendation can legitimately be altered when it is  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 925</b><br>delivered by order. In a case in which a Committee judges a recommendation to have been changed to such a degree that the recommendation can no longer be seen to implement a recommendation of the Law Commission, the Committee can exercise the statutory veto. As has been noted, however, the Government acknowledge the need for continued discussion about the most appropriate way in which to take forward the provision of a veto for Committees, which is a delicate issue. As was said yesterday, one of the reasons why the Bill is delicate is that it touches not only on what the Executive may want to, but on the relationship between the Executive and Parliament, which is why we are open to continued discussion on those matters.</p><p><a name="06051719000126"><b><a name="06051719002613">Andrew Miller:</b> I am grateful to my hon.

Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) is covered in that discussion? It would be unacceptable to the House and, indeed, to the Executive if we were to end up in a position in which the work of a Select Committee could be subject to judicial review.</p><p><a name="06051719000127"><b><a name="06051719002614">Mr. McFadden:</b> I am happy to take that point on board in the ongoing discussions, in which I hope that the Chairman of the Regulatory Reform Committee will be an active participant.</p><p><a name="06051719000128">A number of the Opposition amendments to new clauses 5, 6 and 14 and to Government amendments Nos. 46, 50 and 54 explore alternative arrangements for the veto. I hope that hon. Members will consider the issues raised during the debate and the rationale for focusing the veto on the powers and conditions in the Bill. I also hope that they are assured of our intention to continue to engage with Parliament on that issue.</p><p><a name="06051719000129">Some of the amendments deal with the issue of where the responsibility for exercising the veto should lie. They specify that the Committee capable of using the veto should be one</p><a name="06051719002565"><ul><p class="tabletext">"with responsibility for the matter".</p></ul><p><a name="06051719000130">Presumably, the rationale behind the amendments is to open the issue of changes to the structure of Committee scrutiny of orders. For instance, the amendments would allow separate Committees to perform procedural matters and the task of reporting on the substance of a draft order. It seems appropriate for the scrutiny of orders to be performed by a single Committee, which would make best use of the understanding of an order built up by a Committee. The Government have assumed that the Regulatory Reform Committee in the House of Commons and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in another place will continue to perform those roles, but I stress that those matters are for the House and that, in principle, there would be no objection to other Committees with expert knowledge being involved in the scrutiny of draft orders.</p><p><a name="06051719000131">As hon. Members know, it has been agreed to expand the remit of the Regulatory Reform Committee. The Government expect it to be appropriate for Standing Orders to reflect the potential need for the Committee to seek expert views from other  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 926</b><br>Committees on particularly complex orders. As noted, that is ultimately an issue for Parliament to decide.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051719002569">8 pm</h5><p><a name="06051719000132">Hon. Members have also tabled amendments that would remove provision for the House to overturn a veto exercised by its responsible Committee. To provide that a Committee decision could override the opinion of the House would be an unprecedented step that ultimately could be unworkable in practice. In new clause 14, however, hon. Members suggest a mechanism for the House of Commons to exercise a veto, whereby if a certain percentage of MPs objected to an order in writing, that order would have to be withdrawn. That percentage is set at 10 per cent.</p><p><a name="06051719000133">The Government are committed to ensuring that the procedural safeguards in the Bill are robust and effective. However, the amendments would create a somewhat arbitrary arrangement which, crucially, does not build on the strength of the existing system for scrutinising orders&#151;namely, the detailed scrutiny given to orders by the specialist Committees. In any case, under the affirmative and super-affirmative procedure, a proposal must, following Committee scrutiny, pass to the House for affirmative resolution. Some hon. Members suggested that the House is excluded from these matters, but that is wide of the mark.</p><p><a name="06051719000134">There was then a discussion on proposals for a two-year rule whereby once an order had been vetoed a Minister could not table a similar order for the next two years. I understand the reasoning behind those amendments. They seek to ensure that a veto system cannot be abused by a future Government, a point with which I have considerable sympathy, and which ultimately constitutes the rationale for Government amendments to introduce a veto into the Bill. However, we would want to avoid imposing an arbitrary restriction on the order-making process, and I am concerned that the amendments may do precisely that.</p><p><a name="06051719000135">New clause 6 proposes that where either House decides within 21 days that an order is inappropriate for delivery under the order-making power, it should be the subject matter of primary legislation. That arrangement could be difficult to operate. The Cabinet Committee on the Legislative Programme takes decisions each year on which proposals the Government will take forward by primary legislation. As provided for in clause 12, the explanatory document will describe to Parliament why a proposal is suitable for delivery by order. The legislative programme is carefully planned, and adequate resources need to be in place to take forward a Bill. A procedure such as this, whereby an order could suddenly be translated into primary legislation, could cause unmanageable uncertainty and potentially create a very overcrowded legislative programme. I hope that hon. Members accept that we could not support such an amendment. </p><p><a name="06051719000136">The Government recognise&#151;this was touched upon&#151;that there are issues surrounding the level of procedural detail that should be contained in statute and in Standing Orders. The Procedure Committee, for instance, has recommended that as far as possible the procedural requirements for scrutiny of orders should be left to House authorities. I have provided assurance that the Government will continue a dialogue with the  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 927</b><br>Chairs of the relevant Committees about appropriate changes to Standing Orders, and I have confirmed, and am happy to confirm again, my intention to listen to views on this issue.</p><p><a name="06051719000137">Our priority is to get the Bill right, to have a workable system of scrutiny, and to achieve the right balance between creating a power that is able to deliver the regulatory reform agenda and ensuring that effective and robust safeguards are in place. The veto clearly plays an important role in achieving that balance. The Government are confident that in the veto provided we have the substantial and workable safeguard that Committees have requested. However, we will continue to listen to views on the most appropriate form that the veto should take, both during the passage of the Bill and in relation to amendments to Standing Orders once the Bill has been passed.</p><p><a name="06051719000138"><b><a name="06051719002615">Mr. Gale</b><i>rose&#151;</i></p><p><a name="06051719000139"><b><a name="06051719002616">Mr. Deputy Speaker (Sir Alan Haselhurst):</b> Order.

We do not like the way in which the Bill is being taken through this House, and we do not like much of what it is in it, but, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) said, we are putting up with it for the sake of deregulation.</p><p><a name="06051719000141">It is somewhat bizarre to hear the Minister suggest that the wider veto is somehow related to there being narrower powers. We say that there must be safeguards and that there are not enough safeguards in the Bill as it stands, not least as regards the promised veto, which turns out in practice not to be a veto. I hear the Minister&#146;s offer of further consultation; we shall see. In the meantime, we had expected that a full and restrictive veto should be given to Select Committees, and we still expect that. On that basis, I intend to ask the House to divide on new clause 5.</p><p><a name="06051719000142"><i>Question put, </i>That the clause be read a Second time:&#151;</p><br><i>The House divided:</i> Ayes 205, Noes 256.<center><a name="06051719002575"><b>Division No. 236]</b></center>[8.5 pm<br><br><br><br>AYES</br><br><br>Afriyie, Adam<br>Ainsworth, Mr. Peter<br>Alexander, Danny<br>Amess, Mr. David<br>Ancram, rh Mr. Michael<br>Atkinson, Mr. Peter<br>Baker, Norman<br>Baldry, Tony<br>Barker, Gregory<br>Baron, Mr. John<br>Barrett, John<br>Beith, rh Mr. Alan<br>Benyon, Mr. Richard<br>Beresford, Sir Paul<br>Binley, Mr. Brian<br>Blunt, Mr. Crispin<br>Bone, Mr. Peter<br>Boswell, Mr. Tim<br>Bottomley, Peter<br>Brady, Mr. Graham<br>Brake, Tom<br>Brazier, Mr. Julian<br>Brokenshire, James<br>Browne, Mr. Jeremy<br>Browning, Angela<br>Burns, Mr. Simon<br>Burrowes, Mr. David<br>Burstow, Mr. Paul<br>Burt, Alistair<br>Burt, Lorely<br>Butterfill, Sir John<br>Campbell, Mr. Gregory  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 928</b><br><br>Carmichael, Mr. Alistair<br>Carswell, Mr. Douglas<br>Cash, Mr. William<br>Chope, Mr. Christopher<br>Clappison, Mr. James<br>Clark, Greg<br>Clarke, rh Mr. Kenneth<br>Clegg, Mr. Nick<br>Clifton-Brown, Mr. Geoffrey<br>Cormack, Sir Patrick<br>Crabb, Mr. Stephen<br>Curry, rh Mr. David<br>Davey, Mr. Edward<br>Davies, Philip<br>Davis, rh David <i>(Haltemprice and Howden)</i><br>Djanogly, Mr. Jonathan<br>Dodds, Mr. Nigel<br>Dorrell, rh Mr. Stephen<br>Duncan Smith, rh Mr. Iain<br>Ellwood, Mr. Tobias<br>Evans, Mr. Nigel<br>Fabricant, Michael<br>Farron, Tim<br>Featherstone, Lynne<br>Field, Mr. Mark<br>Foster, Mr. Don<br>Fox, Dr. Liam<br>Gale, Mr. Roger<br>Garnier, Mr. Edward<br>Gauke, Mr. David<br>George, Andrew<br>Gibb, Mr. Nick<br>Gidley, Sandra<br>Gillan, Mrs. Cheryl<br>Goldsworthy, Julia<br>Goodman, Mr. Paul<br>Goodwill, Mr. Robert<br>Grayling, Chris  <page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/debtext/60516-0110.htm"/>

order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I do not want to detain the House, but during the debate on the last group of amendments, I am fairly certain that I understood the Minister to respond to the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) by saying that it would be regrettable if a Select Committee were referred for judicial review. That is on the record. However, it is my understanding that Select Committees and the whole House are the subjects and beneficiaries of parliamentary privilege and could not be referred for judicial review.

The new clause deals with the capacity conferred by the Bill to delegate the function of legislation. It is, at first sight, a rather extraordinary concept&#151;the idea that Ministers might, by Order in Council, confer to any other person the function of legislating. Of course, delegated functions already occur through primary legislation in a number of cases, but when we asked Ministers&#151;in Committee and elsewhere&#151;exactly what they meant by the provision in the Bill, I have to say that the answers were less than convincing and less than adequate. There is no clear idea of why there is a need for Ministers to defer through an Order in Council what is the most important aspect of Parliament&#146;s work&#151;the legislative function&#151;to any other person. There is, I accept, an argument for allowing the function of levying fees or changing a fees regime to be delegated to another person, which is why we have framed our new clause in a different way from the amendment that we tabled in Committee, and why it does not deal with that issue.</p><p><a name="06051719000977">We would have liked a full debate on this subject yesterday in the context of new clause 19, but as you know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, our procedure yesterday did not entirely allow for that. The new provision was originally in clause 2, but now lies in new clause 19 and the subsequent new clauses. We would have liked at that point to move amendments reducing the capacity to delegate the function of legislating, and to have divided the House on them.</p><p><a name="06051719000978">Two things alarm us. First, we have to ask whether it is right to give, through secondary legislation, the legislative function to another person&#151;whomsoever that may be&#151;who is not a legislator; not a Member of this Parliament. The second and most relevant question is that even if one accepts the need to delegate the legislative function&#151;which I do not&#151;why on earth is the legislation that such a person can then create via the delegated power not subject to the same caveats to which the Minister who conferred that delegated function is subject? Why, moreover, is such legislation not subject to the same parliamentary protections&#151;albeit inadequate, as we have just been debating&#151;to which it would have been subject, had it been put through the House via secondary legislation?</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 936</b><br><p><a name="06051719000979">The case is absolutely unanswerable. I am prepared to listen to arguments from the Minister on the need to delegate a legislative function, although I am still at a loss to know in exactly what circumstances such a power would be used. However, I will not accept, under any circumstances, that such a power should not be subject to the same restrictions, caveats and the so-called veto that we have applied to matters properly before legislators: in other words, Members of this House acting in a legislative capacity in a Select Committee or in a Statutory Instrument Committee.</p><p><a name="06051719000980">The suggestion is entirely preposterous. I know that we sometimes seem to defer our legislative functions to all sorts of people, but at least we try to maintain the fig leaf whereby we legislate in this House on the basis of information that we have. Ministers will be allowed to wash their hands completely of legislation that is the product of this provision. They will not be interested in whether it complies with the regulatory principles or falls within the narrow constraints on Ministers&#146; ability to delegate through such means, which we have just been discussing.</p><p><a name="06051719000981">We must remember that we are talking about amendment to primary legislation. Primary legislation will go through all its parliamentary stages and, a few years later, a Minister will be able to say, &#147;I&#146;m going to amend this legislation, but I&#146;m not going to tell you how. I&#146;m going to delegate that function to another person whom the House does not know and whose capacity they do not know, in order that they can make amendments that the House does not know about, and which will never go back to the House for corroboration or scrutiny.&#148;</p><p><a name="06051719000982">I do not think that that is the way that the House should do its business. It is an error of judgment. I know that the Minister will say, &#147;It&#146;s nothing to worry about. We&#146;re only talking about a few learned bodies and things like that, and they must be allowed to make their own rules,&#148; but I do worry about it&#151;that is my job. It is the job of all hon. Members to worry about whether we allow other people to make legislation on our behalf without the appropriate restrictions.</p><p><a name="06051719000983">The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller), the Chairman of the Regulatory Reform Committee, also has amendments in this group. From his body language, it is clear that he shares some of our concerns and that he is itching to speak. Given the abbreviated time available I shall not delay the House, save to say that amendments Nos. 5 and 9 fall, as they apply to something that yesterday was deleted from the Bill by a decision of the House. However, new clause 15 is still relevant as it sets out the principles that should apply in this matter and would restrict the capacity to delegate the legislative function.</p><p><a name="06051719000984">I hope that we will get satisfactory answers from the Minister, but I expect that he will not be able to satisfy my concerns as he has not put forward his own amendments to bring the delegated legislative function within the compass of his constraints. It is likely that I shall wish to divide the House, but I hope to get some support from other parties.</p><p><a name="06051719000985">Conservative Members who share my concerns may feel put off because the new clause refers to the veto. They were unable to support that proposal earlier, but it has now been disposed of. This is an important issue and we must send the clearest possible message to the  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 937</b><br>other place that it requires appropriate amendment. For members of the principal Opposition party to sit on their hands in respect of such an important matter would be extremely unhelpful, and I entreat them to show their support in the Lobbies, whatever their reservations about one small aspect of the new clause.</p><p><a name="06051719000986"><b><a name="06051719003436">Andrew Miller:</b> In view of the time, I shall be extremely brief. I wish to move the two amendments in my name, which fill the gap&#151;</p><p><a name="06051719000987"><b><a name="06051719003437">Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman does not have to move his amendments, but merely speak to the group.</p><p><a name="06051719000988"><b><a name="06051719003438">Andrew Miller:</b> Amendment No. 7 would change the default position and ensure that the positive and negative procedures that apply to Ministers would also apply to any grantee of the power to legislate, unless an exception applied as set out in amendment No. 8.</p><p><a name="06051719000989">I shall give the House practical examples of how that would work. The North Western and North Wales Sea Fisheries Committee is made up of local authority appointees and others, including lay persons. It has been involved in long and complicated machinations about illegal cockle fishing on the Dee estuary with the Environment Agency Wales. A regulating order has been passed, but it needed the authority of the EAW and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. It would be intolerable if such a body could regulate on its own. I do not believe that that was the Minister&#146;s intention, or that of his predecessor, in drafting the order and my amendments are merely intended to help to resolve the situation. I could give further examples, but in view of the time and the fact that it is essential that we hear from the Minister on this important point, I shall conclude my remarks.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051719002570">8.45 pm</h5><p><a name="06051719000990"><b><a name="06051719003439">Mr. Heald:</b> The original Bill attracted widespread criticism because it allowed such wide sub-delegation. Throughout our proceedings, the Opposition and, indeed, the Liberal Democrats, have tried to frame amendments in a way that might lure the Minister into accepting them. We did not get far in Committee, but things are going a bit better now, so I hope that the Minister might at least give us some assurances about later stages of the Bill in the other place.</p><p><a name="06051719000991">I accept that there could be one sub-delegation to achieve the mergers that we were talking about yesterday in respect of the Hampton review, where it might be necessary to allow sub-delegation to a regulator&#151;a point that I discussed with the Minister&#146;s predecessor in Committee. However, to allow the possibility for continuous, chain sub-delegation, whereby there is sub-delegation to one person who has the power to make secondary legislation, including the power to sub-delegate again, and so on, is a bit much&#151;or a lot too much. New clause 15 is aimed at that situation. I support the idea that there should be a limit to the amount of sub-delegation&#151;the length of the chain.</p><p><a name="06051719000992">The point that there should be proper consultation before the use of secondary legislation for such purposes is well taken, so although, as the hon.  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 938</b><br>Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) rightly pointed out, I have reservations about subsection (2) of the new clause, given that the House did not vote for the provision that a veto by a specified number of Members of the House should be added to the Bill, I do not feel constrained by that technical point in supporting the new clause. We certainly support the new clause and I shall be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response to it.</p><p><a name="06051719000993"><b><a name="06051719003440">Mr. McFadden:</b> I was pleased to hear that the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) accede to the case for sub-delegation in some circumstances. The question before us is twofold. New clause 15 suggests that those to whom powers are sub-delegated should be subject to the same parliamentary processes as a Minister making an order. Powers to legislate are already exercised by entities other than Ministers in situations where statutory instruments are not always appropriate&#151;for example, there are local authority powers to make byelaws that are not subject to any parliamentary procedure, but instead have to be authorised by the Secretary of State and must have set model procedures. The conditions set out in the new clause would not cater for those powers and as a result would require extensive public consultation and parliamentary time when that would often be inappropriate or unnecessary.</p><p><a name="06051719000994"><b><a name="06051719003441">David Howarth:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</p><p><a name="06051719000995"><b><a name="06051719003442">Mr. McFadden:</b> Given the time available, I would rather make some progress.</p><p><a name="06051719000996">When making an order that confers a power to legislate, the nature of that power will be considered on a case-by-case basis and the order will set out the appropriate procedural requirements, depending on whom the power is conferred and its subject matter. That is the best approach, rather than being too rigid.</p><p><a name="06051719000997">In our short debate, there was a question about whether someone could &#147;sell on&#148; the power sub-delegated to them. No, they would not be able to do so.</p><p><a name="06051719000998"><b><a name="06051719003443">Mark Fisher (Stoke-on-Trent, Central) (Lab):</b> Will the Minister give way?</p><p><a name="06051719000999"><b><a name="06051719003444">Mr. McFadden:</b> I should like to press on.</p><p><a name="06051719001000">Amendments Nos. 7 and 8, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller), do not suggest that sub-delegation should not happen. He attempts to produce a list that defines to whom the phrase &#147;any person&#148; might apply. As with his contributions throughout these debates, there is much sense in what he suggests. There are various instances in which powers to legislate are exercised by bodies other than Ministers, and he has attempted to define some of them in amendment No. 8 and in his contribution. We do not propose to accept those amendments tonight, but I can tell him that the effort to define the term &#147;any person&#148; more clearly is something that we hope to reflect on, consider and return to, as the Bill makes progress in another place.</p><p><a name="06051719001001"><b><a name="06051719003445">Mark Fisher:</b> Will the Minister give way?</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 939</b><br><p><a name="06051719001002"><b><a name="06051719003446">Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

If the provision in the Bill that sub-delegates the power to legislate in the first place were to include the possibility of further sub-delegation, and that was part of the original order, there is no reason to believe that further selling on of the power to legislate should be excluded.</p><p><a name="06051719001008"><b><a name="06051719003451">Mark Fisher:</b> That is a fair point, but it does not address my point about where that is dealt with in the Bill.

As someone who loves footnotes in books, I thought that the  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 940</b><br>Minister&#146;s Halsbury footnote was a delight, but I hope that he will address the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention.</p><p><a name="06051719001014"><b><a name="06051719003457">Mr. McFadden:</b> Perhaps I can help the House further. In the case of our Bill, explicit wording would be needed to authorise further delegation of legislative powers. Given that the Bill does not contain such provision, such further delegation would not be possible. The Bill does not say so in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests.</p><p><a name="06051719001015"><b><a name="06051719003458">Mark Fisher:</b> I hope that the Minister is right, but it is very worrying that this is a fundamental parliamentary principle and we have moments before the knife falls on the debate. There is no point in discussing that, but such things should not just be rubbed through like that and the House and the other place must return to these things not in a gabbled way under the edge of a knife falling on the debate, but in a serious way. I am sure that the Minister intends to justify the position, and I hope that he can do so with his mastery of the footnote. However, as things stand, I am more persuaded by what the hon. Member for Cambridge said from a sedentary position. He feels that there are problems. These matters are too serious to buff through.</p><p><a name="06051719001016"><b><a name="06051719003459">John Hemming (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD):</b> The key point is that if there is a statutory instrument or order under the Bill that enables sub-delegation, sub-delegation can ensue. Only if the original Bill contained a provision saying that there could not be sub-delegation would that be, subject to judicial review, ultra vires. That is what we are asking for.</p><p><a name="06051719001017"><b><a name="06051719003460">Mark Fisher:</b> I am afraid that these issues are too nice&#151;in the true sense of the word&#151;to tease out in three and a half minutes, but they are very important and we are going to have to come back to them. We cannot allow this legislation finally to pass on to the statute book without being clear about what we are doing. The Minister may be clear and he may well be right. He has earned the right to our confidence. He has shown that during the debate today and yesterday. However, we cannot afford to give him the benefit of the doubt. He has to justify that to the House. We have to be extremely careful about what sub-delegation we are making.</p><p><a name="06051719001018"><b><a name="06051719003461">Rob Marris:</b> In terms of what the Minister said in response to amendments Nos. 7 and 8, which were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller), can the Minister assure me&#151;I was not clear from what he said&#151;that he was minded to accept the spirit, if not the wording, of those amendments?</p><p><a name="06051719001019"><b><a name="06051719003462">Mr. Heath:</b> That was a short, but informative debate. I agree that the Minister has been doing a good job in rather disadvantageous conditions over the past two days. I hope that next time he comes before the House with a Bill, he has a better Bill to work with. His officials are rather over-reliant on interpretations from Halsbury and insufficiently prepared to look at the common sense of what is written in the statute. Quite  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 941</b><br>clearly there is no exclusion in the statute in relation to sub-delegation&#151;a quite proper matter for the House&#146;s concern.</p><p><a name="06051719001020">The idea that the requirements on consultation, which are contained in clause 11, are an unsatisfactorily onerous duty for somebody who is legislating under a delegated function is quite wrong. If someone is making legislation that is binding on other people&#151;even if it is only a few people&#151;is it entirely improper that they should consult such organisations as appear to them</p><a name="06051719002566"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to be representative of interests substantially affected by the proposals&#148;?</p></ul><p><a name="06051719001021">I would suggest not. It is proper for delegated functions of legislation to fall within exactly the same constraints and to have exactly the same terms of consultation and procedures as any other matter handled under the accelerated procedure.</p><p><a name="06051719001022">We still have some very big question marks&#151;notwithstanding the Minister&#146;s preparedness to talk to the Committee and perhaps bring forward further proposals at the next stage of the consideration of the Bill in another place. Who knows, he may bring forward things that are of interest at that point, but that will not happen before this House today and, on that basis, we must seek the advice of the House, and I will press new clause 15 to a vote.</p><p><a name="06051719001023"><b><a name="06051719003463">Mr. Greg Knight:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Will you confirm that parts 2 and 3 of this very important Bill will remain unscrutinised on Report and that that disgraceful state of affairs arises only because of the terms of the Government&#146;s own guillotine motion?</p><p><a name="06051719001024"><b><a name="06051719003464">Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> I can confirm only that it begins to look extremely improbable that the other parts of the

Third

me begin by thanking a number of colleagues and others in the House.
First, I must thank my ministerial colleagues the Parliamentary
Secretaries to the Cabinet Office. I am sorry that one of them did not
have a chance to demonstrate his skilful mastery of his brief, but my
hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. McFadden)
demonstrated effectively his ability to master a complicated brief in a
very short time. I thank the Under-Secretary of State for
Constitutional Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East
(Bridget Prentice), for her expertise in dealing with the Law
Commission aspect of the Bill. I also thankmy hon. Friend the
Member for East Renfrewshire(Mr. Murphy), who is now Minister
for Employment and Welfare Reform, but who did so much of the work that
produced the Bill in the form in which it has been debated over the
past two days.</p><p><a name="06051719002512">I am
grateful for the constructive advice given by a number of key
Committees and their Chairs during the last few months on how best to
frame the order-making powers in part 1, and on the parliamentary
procedures for scrutiny of draft orders. I am particularly grateful to
my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew
Miller), to the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight), and
to my hon. Friends the Members for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) and for
Hendon (Mr. Dismore).</p><p><a name="06051719002513">We have engaged in a lively and
interesting debate over the past two days. Despite all the votes, I
believe that there has been an advance that most Members throughout the
House have recognised. We have sought to achieve a sensible balance
between producing a Bill with the power to deliver better
regulation&#151;in which respect I confess we were
ambitious&#151;and ensuring that Parliament would play a full and
constructive role in scrutinising proposals so that we could secure a
better regulation agenda overall.</p><p><a name="06051719002514"><b><a name="06051719004849">Mr.
John Redwood (Wokingham) (Con):</b> Well over a year ago,

importance of deregulation to his Government&#146;s plans. What will
the Minister deregulate once the Bill has been

the Bill is only part of the Government&#146;s wide-ranging
deregulation agenda. I look forward to working with him on a raft of
measures in the public and private sectors to bring about much more
effective operation. Perhaps he would like to share some of his ideas
with me.</p><p><a name="06051719002516"><b><a name="06051719004851">Mr.

to allow others to contribute to this debate.</p><p><a name="06051719002518">I am sorry that the right hon.
Gentleman was not present earlier, but as was said a number of times
today, the Bill does not stand in isolation, nor can we allow ourselves
to consider it in a narrow way. It is part of a much wider Government
agenda for cutting red tape in the public sector, businesses, charities
and the voluntary sector. As part of that wide agenda, the Government
are measuring the cost of all administrative burdens. The outcome of
that work, and the concerted push across Departments for better
regulation, will be reflected in concrete simplification plans from
each Department which will be published this year. Attentive Members
will be aware that that was announced in the
Budget.</p><p><a name="06051719002519">The challenge
for the United Kingdom and all western countries is to drive up
productivity and maintain competitiveness in the face of rising global
competition. Essential to meeting that challenge is a regulatory regime
that satisfies the needs of the public while imposing the smallest
possible extra burden on businesses.</p><p><a name="06051719002520"><b><a name="06051719004853">Sir
Patrick Cormack (South Staffordshire) (Con):</b> This rhetoric
is music to my ears, but may we hear just one example from the right
hon. Lady&#151;whom I greatly admire&#151;of what the country will
be rid of as a result of the
Bill?</p><p><a name="06051719002521"><b><a name="06051719004854">Hilary
Armstrong:</b> One idea that I have spent some time on,
and which I will look at again in much more detail when I do not have
to spend so much time on complex legislation such as this, is bringing
inspectorates together. That will ease the burden on a range of public
sector organisations and enhance the impact of these measures on the
citizen.</p><p><a name="06051719002522">Essential to
meeting the challenge to which I referred earlier is a regulatory
regime that meets the needs of the public, while adding the lowest
possible burden to businesses. Let us think for a moment about that
challenge. Today, Asia&#146;s manufacturing output is greater than
Europe&#146;s. Its share of world consumption has risen from some 10
per cent. to nearly 30 per cent. in the past 20 years. In the next five
years, China&#146;s economy will overtake Germany&#146;s, which is
now the EU&#146;s largest economy. China&#146;s exports to the EU
have grown by 100 per cent. in just the past three years. China and
India are now turning out more engineers, computer scientists and
university graduates&#151;4 million a year&#151;than the EU and the
USA combined. As we all know, the gap in productivity and
competitiveness between the USA and the EU is widening, not narrowing
in the way that it should.</p><p><a name="06051719002523"><b><a name="06051719004855">Mr.

way?</p><p><a name="06051719002524"><b><a name="06051719004856">Hilary
Armstrong:</b> The hon. Gentleman will understand that there
are many potential gains that we can deliver if we maintain this
agenda. Regulatory costs are estimated to be between 10 and 12 per
cent. of gross domestic product, and the administrative and paperwork
costs make up perhaps a third of that figure. As for measuring the
administrative costs of 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 962</b><br>regulation, as we are now doing on an even more ambitious scale, the
Dutch Government discovered that they were 3.6 per cent. of
GDP.</p><p><a name="06051719002525"><b><a name="06051719004857">Mr.

Armstrong:</b> Reducing those costs by a quarter over five
years, as the Dutch are doing, could save us up to 1 per cent. of GDP.
That is exactly the sort of approach that we should seek to
adopt.</p><p><a name="06051719002527"><b><a name="06051719004859">Mr.

giving way to me, Mr. Speaker. You were obviously surprised by her
generosity, but I am not. How is what she just said consistent with the
concession that the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office, the hon.
Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. McFadden) made earlier today?
He said that new clause 19 would enable overall burdens to be
increased.

Armstrong:</b> As the hon. Gentleman knows, we believe that,
used properly, these provisions will reduce burdens. But as my hon.
Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-East said, different sorts
of burdens might arise.</p><p><a name="06051719002531"><b><a name="06051719004863">Mr.

explain. Regulation itself is not a bad thing; it is the manner in
which it is imposed it that is the problem. <i>[Interruption.] </i>If
the hon. Gentleman will have a little patience, I will deal with that
point now.</p><p><a name="06051719002533">The
Government&#146;s better regulation agenda is designed to reduce
burdens without reducing the effectiveness of regulation or its
outcomes, so we are not going to stop introducing new regulations when
they are needed. The Government make no apologies for continuing to
regulate to improve standards in public services, to promote
competition, to ensure fairness at work, to help industry and to
provide protection for consumers and the environment. Indeed, one of my
right hon. Friends said to me earlier, &#147;I hope that we&#146;re
not so against regulation that we&#146;re going to send children back
to work up chimneys again.&#148; Of course we are
not.</p><p><a name="06051719002534">The order-making
powers in part 1 are intended to take their place among the number of
mechanisms designed to turn the aims of better regulation into reality
for the end user on the ground&#151;for those in business who create
wealth and jobs in our economy, and those in our public services,
voluntary and charitable organisations who improve the lives of our
citizens.</p>

  <p><a name="06051719002535">The World Bank survey published in September 2005 rated the UK second in the EU and ninth in the world for best business conditions.

We must ensure that the UK remains competitive.</p><p><a name="06051719002536">The order-making powers in part 1 will not be the appropriate or even the necessary mechanism for every better regulation initiative. In many instances, however, they will provide real tools, where appropriate, for Departments to pursue their ambitious plans for removing unnecessary regulatory burdens without having to fight for precious time on the Floor of this House.</p><p><a name="06051719002537">The order-making powers as defined by the amended Bill are more fit for purpose than the powers in the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 have proved to be.</p><p><a name="06051719002538"><b><a name="06051719004865">Mr. Edward Garnier (Harborough) (Con):</b> Will the Minister give way?</p><p><a name="06051719002539"><b><a name="06051719004866">Hilary Armstrong:</b> If the hon. and learned Gentleman will forgive me, I must make progress, as we are nearly out of time.</p><p><a name="06051719002540">In broad terms, that is because the rationale for using the better regulation powers will be outcome-focused on reducing costs or on removing obstacles to productivity, profitability or efficiency. They will not be limited by a very tight definition of legal &#147;burdens&#148;&#151;a matter that I know that the House has explored in some depth.</p><p><a name="06051719002541">The better regulation initiatives that this order-making power will allow us to deliver include the consolidation of legislation to make it easier to understand and work with, and the reduction or removal of administrative burdens such as form filling or requirements to give information. I am anxious to make progress, so I shall not list the initiatives&#146; effect on many other matters covered in the debate over the past two days.</p><p><a name="06051719002542"><b><a name="06051719004867">Mr. Garnier:</b> Will the Minister give way?</p><p><a name="06051719002543"><b><a name="06051719004868">Hilary Armstrong:</b> No. Other hon.

The concordat will be based on the Better Regulation Commission&#146;s five principles of good regulation. In the round, such initiatives should allow us to remove what business and others tell us time and again are unnecessary obstacles to their efficiency.</p><p><a name="06051719002545">I had intended to say quite a lot about parliamentary procedure, but again, I shall cut that down. We have had a good and full debate on that, and the Government have made it clear that although we want to find an approach that does not place too much emphasis on our perception of how Parliament should act, we do not want to avoid the responsibility that Ministers must face in terms of how they behave. We have sought to get the balance right. We have listened carefully to what the House has said, and I have no doubt that we shall return to the matter.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 964</b><br><p><a name="06051719002546"><b><a name="06051719004869">Sir Robert Smith:</b> Will the Minister give way?</p><p><a name="06051719002547"><b><a name="06051719004870">Hilary Armstrong:</b> I am sorry, but I must get on.</p><p><a name="06051719002548">I want hon. Members to bear in mind the fact that the Government have a responsibility to ensure that the UK stands its ground in an increasingly dynamic and competitive global economy, and that regulation does not prevent our public servants and voluntary workers from serving our citizens. This Bill will allow Government to do that by providing mechanisms to deliver real and meaningful cuts in red tape on business, charities and voluntary organisations.</p><p><a name="06051719002549">I want to leave hon. Members in no doubt that this Bill is needed. Business needs it, and is telling us so very loudly. Our dedicated public servants need it too, as do our hard-working voluntary and charity workers. It is an essential tool to maintain our competitiveness, safeguard our economic prosperity, reduce burdens on public services and improve the lives of all our citizens.</p><p><a name="06051719002550">I commend the Bill to the House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051719002572">9.54 pm</h5><p><a name="06051719002551"><b><a name="06051719004871">Mr. Heald:</b> I welcome the Minister to her new responsibilities.

It was not even the Bill on which the Government consulted. The proposals on which they consulted were very different. There has been a constant battle to try to get a Bill that really tackles deregulation, because we certainly need one&#151;my goodness, we do. With a Government who are passing 15 regulations a day and increasing the burdens on business, whose extra costs are &#163;50 billion since 1997, we need a Bill&#151;but not a bad one.</p><p><a name="06051719002553">We struggled in Committee. I tabled all the amendments suggested by the Regulatory Reform Committee and many suggested by other Committees of the House. All were rejected; the then Minister used to described them as debating points. Recently, however, common sense has been brought to bear on the problems and there has been a climbdown. I welcome new clauses 19 and 20, but they came so late in the day that we have not been able to tackle all the problems with the provisions. We still have issues about how to tackle the problems of small business and how to filter Law Commission Bills so that the most controversial are properly debated. We still have issues about the procedures to be adopted to give the House a veto.</p><p><a name="06051719002554">There are great time pressures tonight, so I cannot explain all the reasons why the Bill is not yet ready to become law, but I cannot stomach the idea that it should go to the other place with the approval of the Opposition.</p><p><a name="06051719002555"><b><a name="06051719004872">Mr. Gummer:</b> In the short time that my hon.

Does that mean that since yesterday, they have decided that they will no longer even get rid of game licences?</p><p><a name="06051719002558"><b><a name="06051719004875">Mr. Heald:</b> I will make one final point to show that the Bill is not good enough. The Department of Trade and Industry website shows new legislation proposed for the coming year. There are 40 pages of proposals. Nowhere in Government is there a similar website showing which measures will be deregulated. Until that happens, the Government will not solve the problems of their culture of regulation and burdens on business.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051719002573">9.58 pm</h5><p><a name="06051719002559"><b><a name="06051719004876">Andrew Miller:</b> I should like to spend just one minute thanking hon.

Ian Gibson (Norwich, North) (Lab):</b> I am delighted to have
the opportunity to talk about bowel cancer,because many members of the
public and Members of the House have experience of members of their
families, or perhaps themselves, having the prognostication of bowel
cancer and know of its effects on their lives. We have a real
opportunity in this country to make a difference on bowel cancer, which
is often called colorectal cancer, but it is my contention that we are
not doing that as quickly as, or to the extent that, we ought to
be.</p><p><a name="06051721000494">I do not want to
go into the numbers, although we conventionally talk in such debates
about the numbers of people who develop and die from a cancer. However,
hon. Members can take it from me that the figure is up there in the
thousands and thousands and that the problem is very serious indeed.
The research that has gone on in this country and the United States
will undoubtedly help us to tackle not only bowel cancer, but many
other cancers. For example, in the United States, at the Johns Hopkins
university in Baltimore, Bert Vogelstein has discovered something that
is quite magnificent in the sense of what it tells us about the
development of cancers. He has shown that five or seven individual
events can take place, all of which are necessary to develop the
full-blown cancer, which sadly can kill. The genetic changes that he
has identified are an important illustration of what research can do.
The interesting thing is t that the order in which they happen is not
A, B, C, D, E, F, G and so on, but A-C, E-F and so on in different
individuals. As a <i>New Statesman</i> article next week will prove,
that shows that cancer research is telling us much more about how
cancers progress from one stage to the next. It is not that someone has
it and everything else is inevitable. The research shows that early
detection not only of a genetic event, but of other events as well, is
important and can help to save lives. My contention is that we can save
thousands of people&#146;s lives if we take the subject much more
seriously.</p><p><a name="06051721000495">Many people
will say that bowel cancer is caused by diet and we can prevent it by
taking care of what we eat. Lots is going on in that sector, but it is
not the subject of the debate. We must have a process of screening
individuals, and it is which individuals and when we screen them that
is the subject of the debate going on not just in this country, but
across the world. </p><p><a name="06051721000496">We
have been lucky with some of the research into bowel cancer because we
can say things about the disease that we cannot say about other
important cancers. The major screening programmes are for cervical
cancer, breast cancer and bowel cancer, but bowel cancer is the only
disease for which we have additional information about the stages that
happen in the process. We have not quite reached that point with the
other cancers.</p><p><a name="06051721000497">How do
we screen individuals? People can look at their stools and
faeces&#151;I cannot use rude words in the Chamber, but I hope that
people know what stools and faeces are&#151;for blood that might be
present. They can 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 972</b><br>do it themselves by taking the stool and faeces and passing it on to the
experts to analyse whether blood has been exuded from the body. If it
has been, further tests can be done. The faecal occult test&#151;it
sounds like a religious group&#151;is used for men and women aged
between 60 and 69. It is very effective in what it does, because the
next stage illustrates what we can do with the result. However, we need
to ask why 60 to 69&#151;why not 70, 75, 80 and so on? That is true
for many other screening technologies, including breast
cancer.</p><p><a name="06051721000498">If there is
evidence that blood is exuded by an individual, the next process is
flexible sigmoidoscopy, which has been used in pilot studies of people
aged over 50. A small flexible tube, with a camera attached, is
inserted through a person&#146;s rear passage. We would not all
welcome that, but it does happen. I and others I know have been through
that. It is quite exciting to lie there and look at one&#146;s
insides&#151;parts of our bodies that we have not seen
before&#151;on a screen. It is better done after lunch and dinner, of
course, and certainly after breakfast. However, it is interesting what
one can see.</p><p><a name="06051721000499">It is
possible to see lesions and polyps on the screen. Polyps are little
structures that may have developed at a certain stage in
someone&#146;s lifetime, perhaps over a period of eating certain
foods, or whatever the factors are that induce their existence. When
the doctor sees those structures, he gets the message. One can
eliminate those polyps, which appear at an extremely early stage in the
development of bowel cancer, and people can survive for many years if
they do not develop the disease. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is an important
procedure in identifying the early stages of bowel cancer.</p><p><a name="06051721000500">The cancer can develop beyond
that stage and, sadly, it has done so in most of the cases with which I
am familiar, including that of my brother. Very little can be done, as
the cancer has entered a different phase and spread to the liver. In
such cases, even surgery will not extend someone&#146;s life by many
years, so early detection is extremely important. Removal of the polyps
is even more important, as mutations, changes and so on can be detected
in those structures. Rectal insertion is not the only technology used
to tackle the disease. New scanners have been developed that allow us
to look at people&#146;s insides, so we can discover the polyps in
their bowels without inserting an instrument in their rear
passage.</p><p><a name="06051721000501">We can argue
about whether people should be screened at 50, 60, 69 and so on, but we
need to consider the issue of take-up. Thankfully, the Government have
introduced screening, but take-up is only 60 per cent. That is
understandable, as people do not want to undergo such a test. Men, in
particular, do not like such procedures or the effects on their bodies.
The position is even worse for certain groups, where take-up is less
than 60 per cent. Screening is not worth while if people do not use it.
Recently, I received a paper from Warwick, De Montfort and Essex
universities on take-up among black and ethnic communities. Before
rectal insertion, a faecal occult blood test is necessary: people
collect three samples over three days&#151;goodness knows where they
keep them, as they cannot be stored in a fridge with food&#151;and
send them for analysis. For various cultural reasons, black and ethnic
communities do not like to 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 973</b><br>take that test. That is understandable&#151;my researchers, who come
from different cultural backgrounds, said that it was disgusting. The
take-up among much of the multi-cultural community therefore falls
below 60 per cent. to 30 per cent. and even lower. We await better
tests, as many people are not taking up that test.</p><p><a name="06051721000502">The national health service
records the results of the tests, and flexible sigmoidoscopy is carried
out. The problem of take-up has been tackled by Cancer BACUP, which has
produced leaflets encouraging people to take the test. It has a great
deal of experience of talking to people with breast and cervical
cancer, urging them to take tests that can save their lives. However,
low take-up is a huge dilemma, and I urge the Government to increase
it. I do not think that we will ever achieve 100 per cent. take-up, but
we can do better than 20 or 30 per cent. in certain communities.
Indeed, we can do better than 60 per cent.</p><p><a name="06051721000503">There is inequality in our
society, and not just in black and ethnic groups. The politics of
cancer in the United Kingdom is the politics of deprivation and the
poverty of many people. Not only do they suffer more pollution and eat
cheaper, poor quality food, but they do not take up the diagnostic
tests. I run the all-party cancer group. Our conference this year,
&#147;Britain against Cancer&#148;, will be about the inequalities
in our society, where certain groups of people who come from certain
backgrounds do not take up the tests that are
available.</p><p><a name="06051721000504">I urge the
Government to regard that as a priority and to do more about it. It is
all right to say, &#147;Eat more fruit. Eat more organic
food,&#148; but as I know, the surge in the green vote in Norwich,
which is all about eating organic fruit, involves the middle classes.
On the working class estates in my constituency, people do not eat
organic foods. They go to Lidl and buy food as cheaply as they can. The
difference in the diseases that they get reflects the difference in
lifestyle. We must take on the class problem and factors such as what
people eat, where they live, the pollution that they encounter, and so
on. I urge the Government to do more about
that.</p><p><a name="06051721000505">I know that the
Department of Health is trying to do more and to induce people to be
tested. The Department must speak much more to the relevant charities
and groups. Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer have great
experience of talking to the population and thinking about the
problems. We need a taskforce to encourage people to come forward and
take the test.</p><p><a name="06051721000506">What
have the Government done? In no way am I suggesting that they have done
nothing. They have, for example, set up various pilot schemes, which
have been quite successful. In certain parts of the midlands they have
saved around 250 lives. Saving 250 lives by testing for bowel cancer is
pretty good news. We could make that 20,500 lives if we extended it to
other parts of the country. There have been some delays in getting
money into such programmes, but in April 2006, after a little flurry
here and there, we managed to get &#163;10 million for the first year
of a bowel cancer screening programme, with the help of the national
cancer screening programme. That is good, but what will happen in years
2 and 3?</p><p><a name="06051721000507">At a Britain
against Cancer conference, the then Minister spoke of a three-year
programme tackling 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 974</b><br>bowel cancer. There is some scepticism about that. I want to hear
tonight, please, that years 2 and 3 will happen. We have a hub and a
screening centre, but we promised that there would be five hubs and 13
screening centres across the country. It has been proven that the one
existing hub and the screening that is going on can save lives, and we
could save many more lives. There is very good news. It is a winner,
and do we need winners in this area of health! Does the Minister
agree?</p><p><a name="06051721000508">When people die
of bowel cancer, I find it difficult not to wonder why the disease was
not diagnosed sooner, why the treatment was not effective, why the
polyp was not removed and so on, and why their lives were not saved.
That is a challenge for the Government. We need to discuss how we will
raise awareness, engage the charities, get leaflets out, engage with
the communities and at what level, to make sure they know that there is
good news and that the technology for dealing with the disease is
improving.</p><p><a name="06051721000509">We need to
know where the programme will happen. I will love it when it is rolled
out in Norwich and Great Yarmouth&#151;everything happens there
eventually&#151;and the pilots seem to have been effective.</p><p><a name="06051721000510">We need to know whether the
Government have estimated how many lives might be saved, and I wonder
whether the NHS can find the extra money. It was said that some
&#163;35 million would be found over three years, but will that
happen? When will we know that the money is in place for years 2 and
3?</p><p><a name="06051721000511">We must consider
the capacity issues. What about the personnel who will conduct the
tests? We need nurse specialists to look after patients, cancer
doctors, pharmacists and stoma nurses. I do not think that people will
not respond because of the nature of the cancer.</p><p><a name="06051721000512">I want to hear from the
Minister tonight that the programme will happen over the next three
years, the three years after that and the three years after that,
because it is a win-win situation. If the programme is successful in
bowel cancer, progress will be made on prostate cancer, because there
will be discoveries in that field, too&#151;there will be discoveries
across the spectrum of cancers over the next few years. We can show in
this country that the best treatment for any particular cancer comes
from early
screening.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051721000539">10.31
pm</h5><p><a name="06051721000513"><b><a name="06051721001019">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Ivan
Lewis):</b> I begin by congratulatingmy hon. Friend
the Member for Norwich, North(Dr. Gibson) on securing this
important Adjournment debate on what all hon. Members regard as an
extremely important issue. I am not sure whether I thank him for going
into so much detail in describing the nature of the condition and some
of the treatment, but he brought the matter to life and revealed the
reality of what many individuals go through at a very stressful time in
their lives.</p><p><a name="06051721000514">I want
to put the matter in context before responding directly to some of my
hon. Friend&#146;s specific questions. Bowel cancer is the second
largest cancer killer in England, accounting for more than 14,000
deaths a year. Around 28,000 bowel cancers a year are diagnosed, and,
sadly, the disease has historically poor survival rates. It can be
difficult to recognise bowel 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 975</b><br>cancer, as symptoms are often not reported at an early stage and can be
similar to less serious conditions, which is why we need, as my hon.
Friend has said, a proper national screening
programme.</p><p><a name="06051721000515">Research
undertaken in Nottingham and Denmark in the 1980s showed that screening
men and women for bowel cancer using the faecal occult blood test could
reduce the mortality rate from bowel cancer by 15 per cent. in those
screened, and an independently evaluated pilot in Warwickshire and
Scotland showed that that research can be replicated in a national
health service setting. Based on the final evaluation report of the
pilot and a formal options appraisal, we announced that the NHS bowel
cancer programme would begin screening men and women aged 60 to 69 from
April 2006.</p><p><a name="06051721000516">I can
confirm that the bowel cancer screening programme is definitely being
rolled out over the next three years, as confirmed in the White Paper,
&#147;Our health, our care, our say&#148;, which was published in
January. The programme is one of the first national bowel cancer
screening programmes in Europe, and the first cancer screening
programme in England to involve men as well as
women.</p><p><a name="06051721000518">My hon. Friend
will be pleased to hear that we have always intended to have a
three-year phased roll-out of this substantial new national programme.
However, we cannot put an entire screening programme in place in a
single year. We estimate that around &#163;10 million will be spent
on the first year of the programme. Funding decisions have not yet been
made for future years, but we are committed to ensuring that the
necessary funding is available to see through the full implementation
of the
programme.</p><p><a name="06051721000519"><b><a name="06051721001020">Mr.
Russell Brown (Dumfries and Galloway) (Lab):</b> I share the
admiration expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North
for what the Government have done. I also appreciate that the health
service is a devolved issue in Scotland, and we all want to see a
standard service across the country. The screening programme in
Scotland will not begin until March next year, which is some 11 months
late. However, it covers an age range of 50 to 74, which is far more
significant than that covered in England. I hope that as we progress
through the three-year programme we will start to extend the age range
that is
covered.</p><p><a name="06051721000520"><b><a name="06051721001021">Mr.
Lewis:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. As we
progress through the three-year period and the screening programme
develops, we will keep that under review and look to learn from our
Scottish colleagues.</p><p><a name="06051721000521">It is probably useful for both
my hon. Friends to be aware that 100,000 testing kits have been ordered
from the supplier for the purposes of the necessary screening
programme. We estimate that between 100,000 and 120,000 men and women
will be screened by the programme by March 2007. We believe that a very
innovative model has been developed for our national bowel screening
programme. For example, men and women will be sent a testing kit to
complete in the privacy of their own homes. My hon. Friend referred 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 976</b><br>to the importance of dignity and sensitivity in the way that we handle
this. We believe that about 2 per cent. of those who take the faecal
occult blood&#151;FOB&#151;test will be positive and will be
invited for a full colonoscopy. It is likely that about one in 10 of
those will be found to have bowel cancer. It is probable that a further
four out of 10 will be found to have polyps that can be treated to
prevent the possibility of bowel cancer developing at
all.</p><p><a name="06051721000522">When fully rolled
out, the programme is expected to detect around 3,000 bowel cancers a
year. As my hon. Friend said, five programme hubs across England will
invite men and women to participate in the programme, sending out FOB
testing kits, interpreting the kits and sending out results. There will
then be 90 to 100 local screening centres providing endoscopy services
for the 2 per cent. of men and women who have a positive FOB test
result. The pilot in Rugby will continue to run to the end of March
2007. The first of the five programme hubs will also be established in
Rugby because of the substantial experience and expertise gained
through the pilot. That programme hub will start by inviting men and
women in Wolverhampton to participate in the screening programme. It
will eventually cover the west midlands and north-west England. NHS
cancer screening programmes are currently assessing where the other
programme hubs will be located, and announcements will be made as soon
as possible. We heard my hon. Friend&#146;s bid for his own part of
the world, which would be expected in the course of such a
debate.</p><p><a name="06051721000523">We intend
that by March 2007, all five programme hubs will be established and
around 14 local screening centres will be operating. Last August,
strategic health authorities were asked to bid for their local
endoscopy units to become local screening centres as part of the first
wave of the programme in 2006-07. Similar exercises will take place for
the second wave in 2007-08 and the third wave in 2008-09. It is up to
SHAs to decide where local screening centres should be located for the
benefit of their own populations. In particular, SHAs need to take into
account the efficiency of their service for patients with bowel cancer
symptoms to ensure that those are not affected by the local
introduction of bowel screening.</p><p><a name="06051721000524">Preparations for the roll-out
of the programme have been going on for some years. As my hon. Friend
said, training in the necessary bowel scoping is vital to the diagnosis
of bowel cancer. A national training programme has been established to
train specialist staff to carry out vital procedures for diagnosing
bowel cancer. Based on current trends and definitions, the training
programme is projected to develop training for 1,573 specialists by
2006-07.</p><p><a name="06051721000525"><b><a name="06051721001022">Dr.
Gibson:</b> Will my hon. Friend say something about how we are
going to increase awareness in people about having this particular
test, because unless they think that it is going to preserve their
life, they will not undertake
it?</p><p><a name="06051721000526"><b><a name="06051721001023">Mr.
Lewis:</b> I will come to that in the moment.</p><p><a name="06051721000527">I want to spend a couple of
minutes on research, because I know that my hon. Friend rightly has a
long-established track record in being concerned about 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 977</b><br>that. I can assure him that as we roll out the bowel screening programme
nationally, it will be fully evaluated. We are also looking at flexible
sigmoidoscopy, which is another potential way of screening for bowel
cancer using a flexible bowel scope. Based on the promising results of
a Cancer Research UK trial, we are funding a demonstration study
atSt. Mark&#146;s hospital, and inviting men and women aged
58 to be screened. The study is costing &#163;300,000 and is expected
to report in two years.</p><p><a name="06051721000528">My hon. Friend has just asked
me about communications. We established a bowel cancer communications
group in 2005 with representatives from some of the organisations that
he mentioned earlier, including Cancer Research UK, Bowel Cancer UK,
Beating Bowel Cancer, Cancer BACUP and the Men&#146;s Health Forum. I
would like to pay tribute to those colleagues in the stakeholder groups
for their hard work and support in taking this forward. The
communications group is considering all aspects of communications,
including reaching ethnic minority communities&#151;my hon. Friend
also raised that issue&#151;as well as people from deprived areas and
hard-to-reach groups. Bowel cancer screening leaflets, which will be
sent out with each invitation, will be translated into a number of
languages, as happens now in breast and cervical screening. Lessons are
also being learned on how to reach these groups from the existing
breast and cervical screening programmes and from the bowel cancer
screening pilot.</p><p><a name="06051721000529">The
screening programme will save thousands of lives, but we are also
taking further steps to tackle the disease. As my hon. Friend said,
poor diet is associated with bowel cancer, and our five-a-day programme
is promoting the increased consumption of fruit and vegetables. Early
detection other than through screening is also important. That is why
we are working with professionals and key stakeholders to develop
awareness programmes. We are also looking at decision-supporting tools
to aid GPs in referring patients appropriately.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 978</b><br><p><a name="06051721000530">On the treatment side, we are
funding a multi-disciplinary training programme in a precision
technique called total mesorectal excision, which results in lower
rates of recurrence of cancer and the reduced need for long-term
colostomy. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
published updated guidance in &#147;Improving Outcomes in Colorectal
Cancer&#148; in June 2004, and it has published appraisals on the use
of five drugs for the treatment of advanced bowel
cancer.</p><p><a name="06051721000531">I hope that I
have demonstrated to my hon. Friends that the Government are fully
committed to tackling cancer, and to the full implementation of the
national health service bowel cancer programme. Bowel cancer is a
serious condition that acutely affects not only the individuals
concerned but their families and loved ones. It is time that we took
the issue seriously and understood the potential consequences to
individuals and to society of this horrendous disease. The Government
can be proud of their record in putting in place a national screening
programme for the first time. However, we cannot afford to be
complacent. One life lost to the disease is one too many, and we have a
solemn duty to do everything that we can to ensure that we detect the
condition and treat it quickly, so that people do not have to suffer
the horrendous consequences that have, sadly, led to deaths of far too
many people in our society over the years.</p><p><a name="06051721000532">I congratulate my hon. Friend
on securing this Adjournment debate and shining a light on this
important issue. Some people might find it difficult to talk about, but
it is extremely important that parliamentarians consider the issue, and
I am delighted that he has asked the Government to account for
themselves tonight&#151;</p><p><a name="06051721000533"><i>The motion having been made
