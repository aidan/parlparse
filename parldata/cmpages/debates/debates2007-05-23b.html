 I agree completely that there is no role for paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland, if there ever was. There is certainly no justification for any of the trappings of paramilitary activity, let alone the activity itself. We continue to work as a Government to ensure that loyalist groups, in particular, come out of their past of violence, paramilitary activity and criminality&#151;which is even more of a problem and has been for many years&#151;and move towards accepting the rule of law without any qualification.</p>

 The Secretary of State has alluded to the progress being made towards normality, and that is indeed welcome. A number of issues remain outstanding, however, the most glaring of which is the existence of the IRA army council. What pressure is he applying to the hon.

 I say to the hon. Gentleman, as I said to the hon. Member for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea), that the important thing is that the IRA has now turned its back irrevocably on its past. The apparatus that once existed for terror and paramilitary violence has all disappeared, not least due to the pressure that the hon.

The Secretary of State will be aware that the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs produced a report on community restorative justice that drew attention to the very points that the hon.

 Like the Secretary of State, I welcome the profound change that has taken place in the republican movement during recent years. Does he agree, however, that that very process of change means that the existence of something calling itself an army council&#151;and that council&#146;s continuing assertion of a claim to legitimate authority within the island of Ireland&#151;is at odds with the transformation that the Sinn Fein leadership says that it has brought about, and with the pledge of office that Sinn Fein Ministers have taken?

 The last question is entirely a matter for the German authorities under the European arrest warrant system. There will be arrests from time to time. The whole thrust of my argument is that the PSNI will continue to bear down on those involved in criminality or paramilitary activity. We should all be encouraged by the fact that Sinn Fein has made it clear that people should co-operate with the police whenever such arrests take place.</p>

He says that hospitals are closing, but the biggest hospital building programme is now under way. When we came to power, more than half the NHS stock had been built before the NHS came into existence, but the figure is now less than 25 per cent.

 For what reason the numbers of frigates and destroyers to be deployed by the Royal Navy have been reduced from the total set out in the 1998 strategic defence review.</p>

 As we said in the White Paper that we published in July 2004, we judged at that time that we needed fewer destroyers and frigates because of the reduced conventional threat and because of the improved technology of the new warships that are now coming into service. We are therefore putting more resources into programmes such as the future aircraft carriers and the Bay class landing ships, which will be vastly more capable and versatile than the ships that they are replacing.</p>

 That is indeed what was said in 2004, but what was said in 1998 was that we needed 32 frigates and destroyers. The warships then were just as technologically advanced as the ones referred to several years later. When it comes to believing the Prime Minister or believing successive First Sea Lords who have said, in and out of office, that we need 30 frigates and destroyers, I know which I would believe. The Prime Minister has cut them from 35 to 25. Will he now guarantee that he is not going to cut them further by mothballing another six frigates and destroyers?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman asks why the situation is different as between July 2004 and 1998. It is true that in 1998 we said that there should be 32 such frigates and destroyers, and in 2004 we reduced that number to 25, but we then increased the number or the capability of the alternative vessels.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman should wait for the answer before he shakes his head; he may shake it afterwards. As a matter of fact, we are the party that has increased defence spending, whereas his party cut it by 30 per cent. The amount of money that we are putting into the new warship programme, which is huge and amounts to &#163;14 billion over the next few years, is exactly the same as was predicated back in 1998, but we are spending it differently. That is change, and very sensible too.</p>

<a name="ordayhd_0"><a name="70523-0004.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="07052360001381"><h5 align="left">12.33 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o102"><a name="07052360000171"><a name="70523-0004.htm_spmin3"><a name="07052360001520"><b>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Alistair Darling):</b>
 With permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the energy White Paper and the consultation on the future of nuclear power, which I am publishing today. Copies of these, together with several accompanying papers, are in the Vote Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07052360000172">As I said last year, we face two big challenges: first, the need, with other countries, to tackle climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions; and secondly, the need to ensure that we have secure and affordable energy supplies. Both are vital for our future prosperity; both are global issues calling for action internationally as well as action here at home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07052360000173">The evidence supporting the need for urgent action on climate change continues to mount. Sir Nicholas Stern&#146;s report last autumn underlined the importance of acting now, and together with other countries. If not tackled, climate change poses catastrophic humanitarian consequences and economic costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07052360000174">Meanwhile, world energy demand continues to grow. It is expected to be 50 per cent. higher by 2030 than it is today, and it is likely to be met largely by fossil fuels for some time to come. That means rising greenhouse gas emissions and greater competition for energy resources, which has massive implications for both climate change and security of supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07052360000175">Here in the UK, our reserves of oil and gas are declining. Although significant amounts remain in the North sea, production has hit its peak and is now falling. As we made clear, we will make the most of our reserves, but as our economy grows we will become increasingly dependent on imports in a world where supplies are concentrated often in less stable regions. We need to take action to manage those risks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07052360000176">In the next few years, energy companies will also need to replace ageing power stations and other infrastructure, so we need to create the right conditions for that investment to get timely and increasingly low-carbon energy supplies. The White Paper sets out a long-term framework for action to tackle those challenges at home and abroad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07052360000177">The White Paper sets out our international strategy, which acknowledges that we need to tackle climate change and energy security together. Influenced by the UK, the European Council has agreed to a new strategy, including commitments to competitive markets, cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, more renewable energy and a central role for the European Union emissions trading scheme as a potential basis for a global carbon market. We also need to influence the wider international community, notably in getting a consensus on the post-2012 Kyoto framework for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It also sets out the measures that we are taking here at home. We have already published a draft Climate Change Bill&#151;which, for the first time, would impose a legally binding duty on Government to reduce the amount of carbon that is produced&#151;as we work towards our target of achieving at least a 60 per cent. reduction in carbon emissions by 2050. We are the first country in the world to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07052360000179">Faced with such challenges, more is needed. The first priority must be to save energy. The White Paper sets out a range of measures to help us to become more energy efficient and cut energy use. Consumers need better information about how they can save energy. Next year and the year after, any householder who asks for them can get free, visual real-time displays that show the amount of electricity that they use. In parallel, we will work with the industry to ensure that consumers have visual displays, together with smart meters, in 10 years. In addition, better and clearer energy bills will help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07052360000180">It is estimated that leaving electric appliances on stand-by uses about 7 per cent. of all electricity in UK homes. That is equivalent to the electricity generated from two 600 MW gas-fired power stations or from more than 1,500 2 MW wind turbines. We will work with industry and others to improve the efficiency of domestic appliances to phase out inefficient goods and limit the amount of stand-by energy wasted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07052360000181">If we are to make a genuine difference to reducing energy demand, we need a stronger obligation on energy companies to provide their residential customers with energy-saving measures. The White Paper therefore proposes that from next year they double their current effort, and from 2012 we aim to transform the way in which they see their relationship with their customers, shifting the focus to the provision of energy services, increasing energy efficiency and saving carbon in the home, rather than simply selling them gas and electricity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07052360000182">We will also require big organisations such as supermarkets, banks or hotel chains and large public sector organisations to limit their emissions and set tougher standards for the homes that we build and the products that we buy. We need more low-carbon generation of electricity and heat. We want to encourage the enthusiasm of individuals and communities to generate their energy locally, for example in homes or schools, through solar panels and wind turbines. We are therefore introducing a range of measures to support that approach. As part of that, we will remove the barriers and simplify the licensing regime so that more communities can the follow the example of Woking, including by developing combined heat and power schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07052360000183">However, we still need large-scale energy investment. In the next 20 to 30 years, we need new generating capacity equivalent to approximately one third of our existing capacity. Our aim must be to ensure that companies have a wide range of options available so that we can retain a diverse energy mix, which is good both for our security of supply and will help us to move to an increasingly low-carbon economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07052360000184">Renewables are crucial. We are strengthening support for renewable electricity. The reform of the renewables obligation is essential, and means that by 2015 we expect that around 15 per cent. of our electricity supplies will come from renewables&#151;that is triple the current amount in only eight years. In transport, the road transport fuel obligation will save a million tonnes of carbon a year. We want to double it only if we can be satisfied that it is sustainable to do so. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07052360000185">New technologies will also help. We want British-based business to be at the forefront of new green technology. That is why we set up the Energy Technologies Institute, which brings public and private  <br>

investment together, now with a minimum budget of &#163;600 million. We will launch a competition for the demonstration of carbon capture and storage, which has the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power stations by as much as 90 per cent., which is important as we will rely on gas and coal power, including coal mined in the UK, for some time to come. Details are set out in the White Paper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07052360000186">We want to save energy, and we want low-carbon sources of energy. That is why we will do everything that we can to encourage renewables such as wind, wave and tidal power. But that alone will not be enough if we are to minimise our costs and risks. Alongside the White Paper, we are publishing a consultation document on nuclear power, so that we can take a decision on whether companies should have that option when making their investment decisions. We have reached the preliminary view that it would be in the public interest to allow energy companies to invest in nuclear power. Before making our decision, however, we are consulting further. The White Paper makes clear the complexities of the challenges that we face in terms of climate change and energy security. There is no single answer to those challenges. As wide a choice of low-carbon options as possible is needed, so that we do not become over-reliant on any one form of electricity generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07052360000187">Nuclear is an important part of our current energy mix. We get about 18 per cent. of our electricity from nuclear power stations, which are a low-carbon form of generating electricity. That provides a regular and steady supply of electricity, whereas electricity generated from most renewables is, by its very nature, intermittent. Every year, a modern nuclear reactor saves about 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere, compared with an equivalent gas-fired station.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para15"><a name="07052360000188">Most nuclear power stations are set to close over the next 10 to 20 years at a time when we know that demand for electricity is going up because of economic growth. Quite simply, in the public interest we need to make a decision this year on whether we continue to get some of our electricity from nuclear, because new stations take a long time to build. If nuclear is excluded, there is every chance that its place will be taken by gas or coal generation, which emits carbon. Yes, carbon capture and storage, if it can be developed, would help, but at this stage we cannot be certain&#151;there is no commercial-scale operation of carbon capture and storage on power generation anywhere in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para16"><a name="07052360000189">Although we want more renewable energy as part of the mix, it, too, is controversial. There are more than 170 applications in the planning process at the moment. It will be for the private sector to initiate, fund, construct and operate new nuclear plants and cover the cost of decommissioning and its full share of long-term waste management costs. There are important issues to consider, including waste, and those will be examined in the consultation, which will run until October.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para17"><a name="07052360000190">Our measures, including those in the White Paper, put us on track to make savings of carbon emissions of between 23 and 33 million tonnes by 2020. If we meet  <br>

the upper end of that range, it would be the equivalent of removing all the emissions from every car, van and lorry on Britain&#146;s roads today. By saving energy, encouraging new timely investment in gas import and storage infrastructure and maximising recovery of UK reserves of oil, gas and coal, our measures will also help security of supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para18"><a name="07052360000191">We cannot become a low-carbon economy in a single step. Further measures will be needed if we are to achieve our long-term goals in the light of further international agreements in Europe and more widely. The White Paper sets out a framework for action to enable us to make real progress now towards tackling climate change and ensuring secure and affordable energy supplies. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o103"><a name="07052360000192"><a name="70523-0004.htm_spnew2"><a name="07052360001521"><b>Alan Duncan (Rutland and Melton) (Con):</b>
 I thank the Secretary of State for advance sight of the statement. At its heart, however, there is confusion. The Government say that certain things must be done, but their policy, at best, says that they might be done. The current Prime Minister says that the replacement of nuclear power stations is back on the agenda with a vengeance. The future Prime Minister says that a new generation of nuclear power stations will be built across the country. The most that the Secretary of State says, however, is that nuclear plant could be part of the future energy mix, and that it is for the private sector to take decisions over new nuclear power stations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para19"><a name="07052360000193">Whatever the rhetoric, nothing in the White Paper will guarantee that a single nuclear power station will ever be built. Where has the vengeance for nuclear power gone? Are the Government saying that nuclear new build will definitely happen, or not? How many new nuclear power stations will definitely be built as a result of the White Paper? How can the Secretary of State deliver a UK-wide energy policy if Scotland rejects nuclear power? If the Scottish National party has rejected both nuclear in principle and wind in practice, is the SNP&#146;s policy anything other than utter lunacy?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para20"><a name="07052360000194">Business will invest in nuclear power only if it knows its costs. It needs certainty about carbon, decommissioning and waste. There is no greater clarity on those issues today, so what will happen if no one comes forward to invest? Over a year ago the Prime Minister said of new nuclear build that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para22"><a name="07052360000196">Last July we set out our objectives. We called for a cap and trade scheme for CO2 based on auctioned rights, for site and type licensing, and for reform of the renewables obligation and the climate change levy. In addition, we said that there must be long-term certainty for investors. As we keep on saying, if this could lead to broad agreement between us and the Government, that would be good for Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para23"><a name="07052360000197">In today&#146;s announcement, there are detailed proposals for banding the renewables obligation, but these will not overcome its central flaws. On what basis,  <br>

therefore, has the Secretary of State assessed and then chosen to reject the considered alternative put forward by Ofgem?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para24"><a name="07052360000198">Hidden in the statement is bad news about carbon capture. Will the Secretary of State confirm that his failure already to agree a pilot project for it means that any prospect of it happening has been seriously delayed? Is it not the truth that far from being on the edge of happening, carbon capture is about to be deferred and endangered? How on earth will carbon capture ever happen if it is still clobbered by the climate change levy? When will the Government remove the perversity of keeping a dirty tax on a clean process?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para25"><a name="07052360000199">On strategic infrastructure projects, we welcome site and type licensing and the streamlining of the planning process. However, we have grave concerns about entrusting that to an accountable quango.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para26"><a name="07052360000200">Our policy statement last July called for the greater use of carbon trading. A broad and rational regime for carbon trading is crucial to incentivise low carbon technologies. We therefore welcome the Government&#146;s announcement that they will broaden the scope of carbon trading to cover a greater number of businesses. We think permits should be auctioned. Will the Secretary of State tell us how and when they will be?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para27"><a name="07052360000201">Climate change is the greatest threat that we face. That is why we supported the Government in signing up to tough EU targets on emissions and renewables in March, but at present we get just 2 per cent. of our total energy from renewables. Raising that to 20 per cent. was always going to be challenging, to put it mildly, but is it not true that today&#146;s plans will, at best, get us only about halfway to that target? Is it not the case that despite the clear wish expressed in the White Paper to encourage local and decentralised energy, there is almost nothing that amounts to a robust policy that will make it happen? Again and again, the White Paper wills the ends, but does not provide the means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para28"><a name="07052360000202">In households, smart metering could greatly increase energy efficiency and help customers to export electricity back into the grid, but the Government are supporting the limited clip-on visual electricity displays. Does this intervention not pull the rug from under the real smart meter market? Why are the Government going for the most basic option, when real smart meters would help to stimulate the microgeneration industry?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="70523-0004.htm_para29"><a name="07052360000203">Today&#146;s announcement has already been twice delayed. It is Labour&#146;s third White Paper, following dozens of consultations, and it is the product of their third energy review under their ninth Energy Minister. It offers nothing definite on nuclear or anything else. It heralds the potential collapse of carbon capture. It continues an irrational regime for carbon penalties and incentives. It provides little or no prospect of hitting renewables targets. It does not offer the security that we need. Ten months after the energy review, it is still content-free, not carbon-free.</p>

The Tory policy is to get rid of it.

 First, we have to consult on the principle of ensuring that nuclear remains an option that can be considered by generators in the future. We want to consult on that. In parallel, we are also publishing documents relating to licensing and siting. My hon. Friend is quite right to say that nuclear is a controversial and difficult issue, but I am quite clear in my mind that it is important to have a mix of energy supply so that we do not become over-dependent on one particular source. It really is important that we do not become over-dependent on imported gas, which is bad for the environment and very worrying for the security of energy supplies in the future.</p>

 On our analysis, by 2050 we can reduce emissions from the power-generating sector by 94 per cent. entirely without nuclear power. Bringing in nuclear has the effect only of displacing renewables rather than gas, so nuclear brings no advantages on climate change and no advantages in security of supply in the long term.

In his White Paper, he targets 15 per cent. of electricity by 2015, so could he please somehow integrate those two statements? Does his document on the future of nuclear power continue to assert below-market price financing for nuclear power, as he did in earlier documents and appears to continue to do today?

 I agree with the hon. Lady in what she says about renewable energy. I want to see far more of it, particularly wind or wave power, as and when the technology allows it, but I am sure she would agree that, although there are some interesting developments on wave power, it is still very much in its infancy. On wind power, she will not be surprised to hear me say that her words would carry a great deal more credence if Liberal Democrat councillors up and down the country were not objecting to just about every wind farm that ever comes up for consideration. They also object to any power line that would carry the energy from the wind farms to where it is needed. It is a problem that all politicians must face: we can be in favour of something in principle and in favour of a good idea like renewables, but we then have to back the means to make it possible. As I said in my statement, more than 170 applications for wind farms are now blocked in the planning system&#151;many of them by Liberal Democrat councillors, so the hon. Lady should have a word with them about that.</p>

The 20 per cent. commitment on renewables and energy was entered into by the Heads of Government at the European Council. It is a European target. We discuss it in the White Paper and refer to the fact that we need to take account of it. We support what Europe is trying to do, and the allocation of the 20 per cent. target among the 27 member states will, I suspect, be a matter of some debate&#151;not necessarily in this country, but certainly in some others&#151;particularly in respect of what exactly constitutes a renewable and how it will be allocated.

I used to be sceptical about nuclear power, but two facts have changed my mind. First, it is now clear that the rate of damage being done to the climate by carbon emissions is such that we need to do something about it, and nuclear is a low-carbon source of energy. Secondly, I am increasingly concerned by that fact that, as we obtain less and less oil and gas from the North sea, having to import more gas from areas of the world that are sometimes not politically stable could put our security of supply at risk. The Liberal Democrats might be willing to do that, but I am not.</p>

Members have had a chance to read the consultation, they will see that it is very thorough and that it goes into all the matters that I hope the public will want to know about. We need to reach a view at the end of this year. I am encouraged by the fact that a lot of the large generators now acknowledge the economics of change; they know that there is going to be a carbon price. We would like that to be tougher than it is at present, but I think that they can see the general direction of travel, which is important. I hope that the proposals that I have set out today will provide us with a framework that will help us to meet our energy needs over the next 30 to 40 years, while at the same time putting us on a path towards reducing the amount of energy that we consume.

Regardless of the decisions on nuclear power, one of our future energy sources will be coal. We will have to burn coal for some years to come.

I should have dealt with this point earlier, because it was raised by the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer). It is true to say that the technology to capture, transport and store the carbon exists, but it has not actually been joined up on a commercial basis yet. That is why I am so reluctant to say, &#147;Let&#146;s abandon nuclear now.&#148; These things might never become available.

me repeat that the Scottish nationalists, who tell us that they want more renewables, object to wind farm applications&#151;perhaps more than anyone else&#151;every time they come along.

The nationalists&#146; position on nuclear power is muddled. I noticed yesterday that their energy spokesman could not even say whether the existing nuclear ought to continue. I would have thought that that should be absolutely clear. In relation to the future, I have already said that the Scottish Executive have devolved powers, and we are not proposing to change that.

It is one of the safeguards of our constitutional freedoms and part of the mature framework of checks and balances that keeps us safe from tyranny. Many of the countries to which I travel in my work for the Westminster Foundation for Democracy would give their right arm to have an independent and rigorous press like ours. Yet there are occasions when the great British media overstep the mark and throw around their unprecedented power to influence and shape events and their ability to make or break careers and lives, without exercising proper responsibility or accountability. Too often, media stories are fabricated, exaggerated or sensationalised; too often, there are hidden agendas; and too often, we do not know enough about the integrity or motivation of the primary source of a story. In particular, we do not know whether anybody was paid for that story.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="70523-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07052360000283">It would be a big job&#151;possibly beyond the scope of any party, Government or Act of Parliament&#151;to put the media back in their box without damaging their essential freedom and the modest measure I bring forward today does not attempt to do any such thing. My Bill is designed to deal only with the fact that the reader or listener or viewer is rarely told whether a source of information for a story was paid, and if so, how much. Why is that relevant? Imagine the situation in a courtroom where a judge or jury is trying to assess the evidence in a complex set of facts. Imagine the sudden revelation in court that a crucial eye witness has been paid for his evidence by the defence. That evidence would be immediately discounted: nobody would believe a word that witness said, even if they had been telling the truth&#151;because concern over a possible mercenary motivation would rightly undermine confidence in the reliability of the testimony.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="70523-0006.htm_para7"><a name="07052360000284">Why is it different in the media? In a story about an alleged neighbour from hell, a bullying boss or an unfaithful wife, I want to know if the neighbour, the employee or the husband&#151;the persons making the colourful allegations&#151;have been paid for their stories. Why? Because it will help me to decide what weight to give to their evidence. It will help me to make a better informed decision about motivation and veracity and whether the subject of the allegations should rightly be the object of my distrust and scorn. Ah, people argue, but this is not a court of law, this is simply a story on the TV or in the press. It is just harmless entertainment. But it is not entertainment for the hapless target of that story&#151;countless dozens of them everyday, both celebrities and ordinary people alike, the victims of cheque-book journalism. What about the law of defamation, surely that can be used to protect people? It is an expensive exercise and beyond the means of all but the very rich to sue a mighty media organisation for libel, with no legal aid being available. Even stories that  <br>

More often than not, it reveals itself to be a toothless tiger and a self-congratulatory organisation that persistently fails those who seek its assistance. That means that the print press in particular is effectively free of regulation, despite the enormous power it wields over the perceptions we hold of the events and individuals that shape our lives. That is not a new problem. Even the military dictator Napoleon Bonaparte observed ruefully:</p>

I am not saying that people should not accept payment for selling their stories to the press. I am simply saying that the viewer or the reader or the listener should be told whether money has changed hands to put that story together, and if so how much. In this age of maximum disclosure and transparency, is it reasonable that the reader should any longer be denied that crucial information? My belief in more media disclosure is only one reason why I do not support the Bill that passed through this House last Friday, and I very much hope that it falls in the other place.</p>

Why not force all media by law to make that clear every time? Compare that example to the recent Lord Brown case. Was it right that it had to be dragged screaming and kicking from Associated Newspapers, days after the allegations about his private life were first unveiled, that his former friend Jeff Chevalier was paid substantial sums of money by Associated Newspapers over a significant period of time for his story? Surely, the very first time that that story broke we, the public, were entitled to be told that tens of thousands of pounds in cash or kind were paid to extract that expression of grief from a jilted lover.</p>

such mercenary motivation was not to be tolerated in the nation&#146;s Parliament. However, we have this powerful beast prowling around our country trashing lives and pronouncing their judgments and the reader does not have the first idea about how their stories were obtained and how much blood money was paid for the destruction of a reputation. It is time to bring that to an end. It is time for more transparency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="70523-0007.htm_para3"><a name="07052360000292">Naturally, the media must be allowed to protect its sources, and that is a principle we should respect. My Bill does not demand the disclosure of the source&#146;s identity, simply a sentence at the end of each broadcast or article stating whether or not the cheque book had been used, and if so how much. Then, the reader could make a better informed judgment about whether or not the story should be believed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="70523-0007.htm_para4"><a name="07052360000293">There is a particular problem, which I do not have time fully to consider today, and it relates to the police. Many sensational headlines emanate from some police officers who, within five minutes of a celebrity arrest, are apparently on the phone to their favourite reporter shopping the person concerned for cash&#151;a person who is innocent until proved guilty, as we should remember. It happens every day. The editor of <i> The Sun</i>, Rebekah Wade, in her evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on 11 March 2003, admitted that newspapers pay the police for stories. Often that is illegal, but whether it is or not, the reader should be told when it happens. Perhaps that is a problem that should be tackled through other means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="70523-0007.htm_para6"><a name="07052360000295">That is a seminal statement of the values of a free press. Somewhere along the journey from 1921 to today, that concept of a news media in which facts are sacred has mutated into &#147;entertainment is king&#148;, and on that modern altar, private lives and public reputations are sacrificed for 24 hours of amusement and titillation. The spirit of C. P. Scott has been lost and with it trust in that vital and serious pillar of our democracy.

In fact, the figure turned out to be too low, by nearly 50,000&#151;there were 146,097 rejected ballots, the equivalent of 1 million in a UK general election.

Most importantly, we want to ensure that this ludicrous situation is never allowed to happen again, in Scotland or anywhere else in the United Kingdom. I am thinking of the operational aspects of the elections and the holding of two elections on the same day under completely different voting systems.</p>

There can be little doubt that the changes in the conduct of the election had a detrimental impact on the ability of electors to have their vote counted. The report on the London mayoral election, reinforced by the Arbuthnott commission, showed that that was entirely predictable if two elections using different voting systems were held on the same day, especially when both ballot papers were in a new format.

In Edinburgh East and Musselburgh, for example, there were a massive 2,521 rejected ballots compared with a majority of 1,382. If &#147;rejected&#148; ballots had been a registered party in Glasgow Shettleston, it would have come third, with 2,035 votes&#151;about 12.1 per cent. of the total votes cast.</p>

which was an example of best practice to the rest of the world before the Labour Government began meddling with the electoral process. Compared with many countries throughout the world that want to hold democratic elections, Scotland and the UK have the expertise and technology needed to conduct elections in a successful and professional manner, but only when the advice of professionals is taken and adhered to.</p>

The basic premise of natural justice dictates that the same organisation should not be responsible for all lines of investigation when, as I have said, it played a significant role in the elections; in particular, setting out recommendations for the design of the single ballot. The Electoral Commission employed Cragg Ross Dawson to undertake research that was used as a basis for deciding on a single ballot paper. It could certainly be argued that the commission put an over-positive gloss on that report in its letter of early August, seemingly omitting to disclose the finding that the single paper option was more likely to lead to errors, and thus contribute to a higher number of invalid votes. If the Secretary of State has actually read the report, perhaps he will use this opportunity to clear up the media speculation in that regard.</p>

Only an inquiry that is not conducted at the behest of a stakeholder will satisfy the desire for an impartial investigation into how many people were disfranchised.</p>

with the instructions. Worse still, ballot papers issued at polling stations in Glasgow and Lothian did not resemble the sample papers previously shown to parties. It is a fundamental tenet of our democracy that a person voting in Shetland, for example, has the same format of ballot as a fellow citizen voting in Linlithgow. It is now clear that ballot papers across Scotland lacked uniformity. We regard that as entirely unacceptable&#151;on a par with Florida&#146;s hanging chads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="70523-0008.htm_para4"><a name="07052360000346">As I voted in Moffat, I naively assumed that people voting in Edinburgh or Glasgow would be presented with the same form of ballot paper, but I was wrong. In the regions of Glasgow and Lothian, ballot papers had different instructions from ballot papers in other areas of Scotland. The arrows telling people in which columns to put their crosses were removed. Not surprisingly, those two regions recorded the highest number of rejected ballots: a staggering 7.85 per cent. in Glasgow and 5.2 per cent. in the Lothians. Only an independent inquiry can get to the bottom of those kinds of decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="70523-0008.htm_para5"><a name="07052360000347">We need to know from the Secretary of State how decisions were made on the final design and layout of ballot papers. Did he see the final variations in the ballot papers for all constituencies and regions across Scotland? Did he sign off the decision to remove the instructional arrows from the ballot papers in the Glasgow and Lothian regions? More importantly, what level of consultation did he undertake with political parties, candidates, returning officers, DRS and the Electoral Commission before making the decision? Why did he give precedence to the electronic counting process rather than to candidates and electors? I have no doubt that if market research had been undertaken on the final ballots, they would have been rejected outright&#151;had the research documentation been read by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="70523-0008.htm_para6"><a name="07052360000348">No doubt the use of e-counting in the elections played a major role in the decisions to change ballot papers.

It was adopted initially, it was said, to shorten the amount of time taken to count local ballots, because counting votes manually under the new STV system would take days rather than hours. But it is quite clear that e-counting became a means in itself in Edinburgh and Glasgow, where, instead of altering the ballot papers by deleting instructional information, there should have been a manual count if the machines could not cope.</p>

electors were disfranchised by the postal vote debacle, which saw probably hundreds of people unable to return their ballots in time. It is ironic that postal votes arrived on polling day and that the only way to make them count was to take them to the polling station&#151;if the elector was lucky enough to be at home to receive that vote. The Government have always known about, and encouraged, the trend of more and more people opting for a postal vote. The election date was hardly a surprise and there is no excuse for not putting arrangements in place to guarantee that, at least from an administrative perspective, postal voters received their postal ballots on time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="70523-0008.htm_para9"><a name="07052360000351">There can be no doubt that the Government had a genuine opportunity to work with the Scottish Executive to reduce the possibility of voter confusion. The key to that would have been to decouple the two elections, as many people advocated. That is the view not just of the Conservatives or the newly appointed Scottish Executive, but of the Government&#146;s own Arbuthnott commission, which recommended it. The Electoral Commission made the scale of the difficulties clear during the evidence that it gave to the Local Government and Transport Committee of the Scottish Parliament. The Arbuthnott commission summed up the arguments perfectly, saying that holding the elections on separate days would</p>
<a name="70523-0008.htm_brev0"><a name="07052360001341"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;reduce the complexity of voting, potentially reduce voter confusion and keep the number of invalid votes to a minimum. It would also reduce administrative complexity in the planning, management and counting of the elections, and enhance the transparency of the electoral process, especially allowing attention to be focussed on local issues.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="70523-0008.htm_para10"><a name="07052360000352">It is ridiculous of the Secretary of State and his predecessor to argue that only the Scottish Executive were responsible for the date of the local government elections, when obviously holding those elections on the same day would have an impact on the Scottish Parliament elections. He may have no influence with the Scottish Executive now, but he did then. When I was a Member of the Scottish Parliament, I introduced the Local Government Elections Bill to do just what I have been talking about, but Labour and Liberal Democrat Scottish Ministers thwarted constant attempts to get the Bill through. Conservatives in the Scottish Parliament will continue to pursue the cause and will look to the new Scottish Executive for support this time around.</p>

Even if STV is accepted, what can be the purpose of holding such elections on the same day if, as was shown in the London mayoral elections and voting in Northern Ireland, having two separate systems in operation always exposes us to the risk of a disproportionately large number of people having their ballots rejected?</p>

He simultaneously predetermined the outcome of the review and demanded that an independent inquiry be established, incidentally by the Government, no doubt in consort with the Scottish Executive. The problem for the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) is that after just the introductory Front-Bench speech, the Conservative party&#146;s argument, as set out in the motion, is in severe danger of collapsing under the weight of its contradictions.</p>

 The Electoral Commission has already commissioned a report for the Secretary of State by a man called Cragg Ross Dawson. That report first highlighted the difficulties with the single ballot paper.

 I am happy to answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s questions. The Cragg Ross Dawson report was produced not by an individual, but by a company. It was commissioned by people in the Scotland Office, who had requested that work be undertaken through the Electoral Commission. The report was sent to the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, my hon. Friend the Member for Inverclyde (David Cairns), with whom I discussed the matter. It formed part of a consultation exercise that received 28 responses, along with three further responses that, technically, arrived after the consultation had concluded. We took account of the responses when we reached our decisions. I then had the opportunity to receive from officials a summary of the conclusions of all the consultation responses that we received, including work commissioned by the Electoral Commission. I discussed the report with the Under-Secretary and officials before making decisions.</p>

As I said, only when we have sight of its report will it be appropriate to determine the next steps to take. Let me remind the House of the remit of the commission and point out why I believe that it is only sensible to let it get on with its job before deciding what further steps might be necessary.</p>

That duty was conferred on it by the House without dissent. So far, it has reported on general elections, European elections, the 2003 elections for the Scottish Parliament and elections for other devolved institutions.</p>

Before the elections, the Scottish Executive asked the commission to review, as it did in 2003, the conduct of the Scottish local government elections, for which the Executive have legislative competence. Frankly, that makes sense. The decision of the Scottish Parliament in 2002 to move the date of the local government elections so that they could be held on the same day as the parliamentary elections had the effect of synchronising the elections.</p>

 The Secretary of State is being generous with his time. Does he think that, with the benefit of hindsight, the House might have to accept that it got the constitution of the Electoral Commission wrong? Does he accept that the insistence on not giving any of the political parties representation on the commission is seen as one of its major weaknesses because few on the commission have hon. Members&#146; day-to-day political experience of being involved in elections? Will he speak to Ministers with responsibility for the commission to determine whether there is any prospect of an early review of its constitution?</p>

 It is not for me to prescribe the means of publicising the review, although, as I have already assured the House, I hope that those leading the review will look carefully at the comments made in today&#146;s debate. The review is to be funded through the Electoral Commission, not by the Scottish Executive or the Scotland Office, so there is no issue of budgetary constraints being exercised to prevent the public from being made aware of their opportunity to contribute to the review. It is important proactively to give people that opportunity, because when one looks at where there were the highest levels of rejected ballot papers, one sees clearly that there are some constituencies where it is important to hear the voices of people who might otherwise not have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the debate.</p>

The arrangements for the synchronised elections were overseen this year by an elections steering group, chaired by Scottish Executive officials and comprising officials from the Scotland Office, the Electoral Commission, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Scottish Parliament and representatives of returning officers, registration officers and other election administrators. The presence of the Electoral Commission on the steering group, as well as the wider role that it played during the preparations for the elections, has prompted questions in this debate and in the discussion following my statement to the House on 8 May about the appropriateness of the commission carrying out its statutory review of the elections&#146; conduct, notwithstanding the fact that that duty could be set aside only by fresh legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="70523-0009.htm_para2"><a name="07052360000383">The commission has acknowledged and sought to address those concerns regarding the work of the review. In particular, it has appointed one of the world&#146;s leading experts in the conduct of the elections to &#147;lead&#148; the &#147;Scottish elections review&#148;. I welcome that appointment. Mr. Ron Gould, who has agreed to take on that important role, is a former assistant chief electoral officer of Canada.

 Given the narrowness of the SNP victory both in overall seats and in several individual seats, does the Secretary of State agree that it is quite possible that the will of the Scottish people was that Labour should be the biggest party and still hold the post of First Minister, and that the large number of votes that could not be counted made that impossible? </p>

As in every other election, it is open to individual candidates who wish to challenge the veracity of a constituency result to do so by means of a petition to the electoral court&#151;there is a period in which such an approach may be made. It is not for me to comment on individual results&#151;that would not be appropriate. However, in the light of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s question, I do reflect on the fact that, had I been minded to suggest a different type of review given the closeness of the result, I would have been subjected to heavy criticism by the Opposition for not being willing to accept the decision of the Scottish electors as manifested in the constituency and regional list results that emerged from the events of 3 and 4 May.</p>

form of inquiry at the present time, we would be in the position of having two parallel investigations into precisely the same events examining the same issues, talking to the same people and reviewing the same decisions at the same time. That does not strike me as the most sensible course of action, particularly when the Electoral Commission has said that the review is expected to have completed its work in just over 12 weeks&#146; time. I believe that it is better to await the report and then to take decisions informed by its findings and recommendations.</p>

In that statement, I set out in detail the problems that occurred and the issues that needed to be addressed. Briefly, they are: delays in the sending out of postal ballots; difficulties with some of the electronic counting machines; the unacceptably high number of rejected ballot papers; and the decision to hold the two elections on the same day, especially given the new arrangements for local authority elections. Those matters are now being investigated by Mr. Gould and his team.</p>

Across the regional and constituency sections, 3.47 per cent. of the total votes cast in the Scottish Parliament elections were rejected. That breaks down as 60,454 rejected papers in the regional vote, representing 2.88 per cent. of the total votes cast in that section; and 85,643 rejected papers in the constituency vote, representing 4.07 per cent. of the total votes cast in that section. The level of rejected papers and the problems encountered with e-counting and the administration of postal votes are subjects of Mr. Gould&#146;s review.</p>

The advice given by information officers on the day may have been wrong. Could that be considered as an important part of the review?</p>

at polling stations, it is wholly unacceptable. As I understand it, such a matter would be the direct responsibility of the electoral returning officers, but that is one of the issues that it seems entirely appropriate for the independent review to investigate. There was, as the hon. Gentleman acknowledges, a recognition of the need to ensure that people were available to explain the systems of voting that were in place, but it seems entirely appropriate that the review should consider the matter that he raises.</p>

 The Secretary of State mentioned the number of ballot papers that were spoiled. Can he tell us how many of them were spoiled as a result of over-voting or something similar, and how many were spoiled by being left blank? As I said to the hon.

 One of the striking features of the authoritative figures that I have just shared with the House is that the regional vote, which for the first time appeared on the left-hand side of the joint ballot paper&#151;that, of course, is a matter of contention&#151;had significantly fewer rejected votes than the constituency section of the ballot paper, which was on the right-hand side of the paper. In that sense, it is entirely relevant for the independent review, if it is so minded, to consider that issue. It is at least possible that, in a certain number of cases, people were determined to vote for a particular party on the regional list section of the ballot paper, and were determined not to vote for any candidate on the constituency section. I do not for a minute suggest that that explains the scale of the number of rejected papers, but it has been suggested, at least anecdotally, that there may have been individuals who, for example, were determined to vote for the Green party on the regional list, but who decided not to vote in the constituency section. That is a matter that will need to be considered by the independent review.</p>

 I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman has a grasp of geography or of electoral systems. He alleged, before the House, that 140,000 people had had their votes denied. Given that there was a vote both in the regional section and in the constituency section, it is perfectly conceivable that the same people are accounted for in both figures. I am not able to give a figure for the number of people involved, but I can rehearse the authoritative figures, whereas the hon.

 I have been generous in giving way and now I will make a little more progress. A key concern of the Arbuthnott commission was the need to enhance the understanding of the regional vote, which we have just been discussing. The process that led from the Arbuthnott commission first drawing attention to the combined ballot paper model used in the New Zealand elections to the final design was inclusive and consensual. Consultation was extensive and detailed. As I have already told the House, there were 29 responses to that consultation, and three late responses were also taken into account. Political parties, voters, election administrators, representatives of disabled peoples&#146; organisations and all other interested parties were consulted.</p>

As in other elections, including general elections, returning officers have statutory responsibility for implementing the rules covered in the elections order, and have scope to alter the design of the ballot papers provided that they do not diverge from those statutory requirements. Those are all matters that will be covered in Mr. Gould&#146;s report, so the Government amendment asks the House to allow him to do the job for which he is well qualified.

The mess of the rejected ballot papers, the electronic counting problems and the delayed counts were certainly, as the motion says, &#147;an affront to democracy&#148;. Since the election, there has been time for reflection on those events, and we have gained a certain amount of knowledge in that time. We now know just how many people lost their vote on 3 May. We know that an Electoral Commission inquiry led by Ron Gould will look into the conduct of the elections, and we know that the Secretary of State is still not taking full responsibility for the fiasco. However, there is still much to discuss, and that is why I welcome the debate.</p>

 I welcome the hon. Lady&#146;s intervention, and her warning, which I am sure was kindly meant. We certainly welcome the review, as we stated in the Liberal Democrat amendment, which was tabled but not selected. Obviously, many Members of the House have views on the Scottish elections and, as has already been said, I am sure that Ron Gould will be taking special notice of this debate and the experiences that hon. Members will want to share. The opportunity to share those experiences was perhaps more limited when the Secretary of State for Scotland made his statement on 8 May. This is an important time to bring up the issues that hon. Members of all parties have mentioned; I believe that that will be helpful to the inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="70523-0010.htm_para1"><a name="07052360000410">Obviously, the purpose of the inquiry is to ensure that mistakes are not repeated. Some mistakes can be forgiven, but failing to learn from them cannot be forgiven. We need to look in detail at the circumstances surrounding the selecting of the ballot paper design. We need to ask why problems occurred, not only with the e-counting. but with the postal vote; clearly, that should have been one of the least troublesome aspects of the election. It was the one part that we were already used to, as it had been used in previous elections. We need to ask whether, as the hon. Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell) suggested, decoupling the Scottish and local elections would succeed in reducing voter confusion while maintaining turnout levels.</p>

spoiled ballot papers was greater than the majority by 1,106. Like others, I do not want to call the election result into question, but it is worrying that the figures provide a sound basis for those who want to do so. Whatever people&#146;s views on that, it is certainly true that the high levels of spoiled papers undermine the public&#146;s faith in the electoral system. We need to put that right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="70523-0010.htm_para3"><a name="07052360000412">The single ballot paper commanded general support among political parties and other organisations that were consulted in the run-up to designing it. In Committee, a draft ballot paper was circulated and we discussed how clear it would be for voters. However, two issues need to be raised: first, how it was tested; and secondly, the difference between it and the ballot papers in Glasgow and Edinburgh. As has been mentioned, the testing was carried out by a company called Cragg Ross Dawson. That involved 100 people being interviewed and asked their views on five different ballot paper designs. Interestingly, the single ballot paper was the most popular, as the Minister said in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="70523-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07052360000413">Looking in more detail at what happened in the testing process, 7 per cent. of the test subjects mistakenly spoiled their ballot paper. The Secretary of State gave the figures for spoilage in the different elections. If one combines them, it could be 140,000 individuals, although I accept that it is impossible for us to find out exactly how many individuals spoiled their ballots without compromising voter privacy.</p>

 Does the hon. Lady accept that although it is impossible for any of us to know at this stage, it is not impossible for Ron Gould to discover it by examining the individual papers? Indeed, it is possible to remove identifying remarks from ballot papers and to make them widely available so that anoraks can study them.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. Electoral anoraks, as it were, having a look at the ballot papers and where the confusion lay, obviously with identifiers removed, will be an important part of the process. That would clearly take some time, but, dare I say, with the technology of the different barcodes it may even be possible to find out how many individuals were affected, although given our experience of the technology so far that may be easier said than done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="70523-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07052360000416">Taking the figure of 140,000 to be the total number who spoiled their ballots, that could be as many as 7 per cent. of the population, which is the proportion that were spoiled in the testing stages. Given that this was the ballot paper design that produced mistakes, should not the Electoral Commission have been a little more robust in its testing? A sample size of 100 is not very large in statistical terms; it equates to just seven individuals, which may not be statistically significant.</p>

 I accept that. As I said a moment ago, there was acceptance on both sides of the Committee that a single ballot paper was the best way to proceed. We all believed that and are dismayed by what has happened. That is why it is important to have the inquiry to find out what could have been done differently. I urge Ron Gould, in the conduct of his inquiry, to investigate thoroughly why, after that level of testing, the Electoral Commission did not then probe further, conduct further tests and see how the spoilage rate could have been reduced. That may well be instructive for what to do in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70523-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07052360000419">How hands-on were the Secretary of State and the Minister with the testing process? In terms of making the decision, I can understand their saying that it was the most popular option, but it would have been fairer to say that it is likely to have a higher spoilage rate. Will they publish any correspondence and communication that they had with the Electoral Commission so that it can be in the public domain and everyone in this House and among the public is able to see what went on?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="70523-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07052360000420">The spoilage rates in Glasgow and Edinburgh are of particular concern, because of the top 10 constituencies with high spoilage rates, seven were in Glasgow and Edinburgh. About 1,000 more papers were spoiled there than in the next nearest region. As a voter in East Dunbartonshire, I did not realise until after the election that a different ballot paper had been issued for Glasgow and Edinburgh. I understand that that was because there was a problem with fitting all the names on to the ballot paper that had been drafted. I have seen an example of the one used in Glasgow, which seems to have 23 different parties contesting the regional list side of it. The ballot paper does not have the clear arrow design that was shown to us in Committee. It has information at the top of it, but not the very obvious arrows pointing to the columns where the individual would need to vote. I can understand why it was more confusing. Indeed, the spoilage rates were on average 2 per cent. higher in Glasgow and Edinburgh than in the rest of Scotland, so there is good evidence that it led to confusion. The Secretary of State said that this is just a matter for returning officers and that he had nothing to do with it. However, when we were shown in Committee the draft ballot paper design with arrows on it, we were all led to believe that that was how it would be designed. That was at the beginning of March. When was the decision made to change it? Did the Secretary of State know about the change? Did he approve of it? Could not the need for it have been foreseen? There would have been room on the ballot paper to include the arrows, so why was that not done?</p>

to get the election result to reflect the way that people voted so that everyone&#146;s vote counts. That is hugely important to the credibility of the voting system. I do not accept that the PR voting system was the problem. Indeed, we had the same system for the Scottish Parliament elections in 2003, and it was not a problem. The single transferable vote system that was implemented this year had a much lower spoilage rate than the Scottish Parliament system. That points to its success and clarity. It was easy for people to understand how to rank in order of preference, as opposed to the confusion caused by the spoiled ballot papers.</p>

Members on both sides of the House have encouraged postal voting as a way of ensuring that people find it easy to vote, and that is welcome. People want a postal vote for a whole variety of reasons. They include people who are working away from home&#151;in Scotland, that can be offshore&#151;people who are on holiday, people who are housebound, and people who have busy lives and it is one less thing to do. That is a trend that has been happening over several elections, and is not difficult to predict. We know that postal voting has been increasing. Surely, we ought to be able to get it right. That aspect of the election was not new&#151;it had happened previously&#151;even though more people applied for postal votes in the recent elections.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that the elections presented a perfect opportunity to consider the early opening of postal votes and establish that a problem was about to happen on 3 May?

 My constituents tell me that they appreciate the opportunity of voting by post and the simplicity of doing that. That is welcome, but many were incredibly worried&#151;they wrote to me and e-mailed me&#151;because they were about to go on holiday and had been told that they would get a postal vote before they went but it had not arrived. People understandably feel strongly about being disfranchised. They have every right to be angry. As the Secretary of State knows, the issue was raised before the elections. I went on &#147;Newsnight&#148; and one of the points I made was that it was ominous that postal voting was the bit that should have been easy to get right, and it did not bode well for the electronic counting and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="70523-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07052360000434">We need to consider why lessons were not learned. Many of the same problems arose in the Greater London assembly elections in 2004: 423,000 Londoners registered to vote by post but 159,000 did not vote. Thousands of postal ballot papers were not even delivered. The Royal Mail apparently told the returning officer in Lewisham that it could guarantee delivery of only four out of every five ballot papers. A report was conducted about the GLA elections and we should have learned lessons from it. The Secretary of State has some explaining to do about the failure to take advantage of the experiences of 2004 to prevent further problems in Scotland.</p>

I take issue with the Conservative motion&#146;s contention that the Government ignored advice about holding elections on the same day. I believe that they listened to the advice but took the view that holding the elections on the same day would increase turnout. I have much sympathy with that view.</p>

 The decision to hold elections on the same day was a matter for the Scottish Executive, of which the Liberals were part. The hon. Lady and I attended the debate about the Arbuthnott commission. One of John Arbuthnott&#146;s clear recommendations was not to hold the elections on the same day, but it was ignored.</p>

 I accept that John Arbuthnott made that recommendation. However, I believe that there remains a good case for holding elections on the same day. If we consider turnout figures, about which we all care deeply, the turnout in the three local government elections in Scotland in 1992, 1994 and 1995 varied between 42 per cent. and 45 per cent. In the three years when local elections were held on the same day as the Scottish Parliament elections&#151;1999, 2003 and this year&#151;the turnout was between 49 per cent. and 59 per cent. That is at least 5 per cent. higher.</p>

Five per cent. more people going to vote in Scotland is the equivalent of 193,000 more votes being cast. That is important because it denotes another way in which people&#146;s voices are lost in the electoral system. There is, therefore, an argument for holding the elections on the same day.</p>

He is clearly one of the world&#146;s foremost experts on the matter and has great experience in elections internationally. I was intrigued by the Opposition motion&#146;s words on that. Sadly, the hon. Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale would not take an intervention on the subject. As my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) said, if the Electoral Commission cannot appoint someone independently, who does the hon. Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale suppose should do the appointing? If the inquiry will not be independent if the Scotland Office or the Electoral Commission nominate somebody, does he want the Conservative party to stipulate who will be independent? I suspect that it will not be easy to hold an independent inquiry under his definition if an independent, international election expert does not fit the bill in his view. His argument is flawed.</p>

I agree that it is essential to get the views of real voters who found problems with the ballot system. Frankly, we may not get that if we simply rely on people coming forward to the inquiry. Ron Gould needs to be proactive about seeking out people&#146;s experiences.</p>

Most of the people voting were illiterate, but, somehow, a 65 per cent. turnout was achieved. Apart from a little bit of shooting here and a little overindulgence there&#151;the guns and the alcohol aside&#151;the result was universally agreed by the international community.

 My hon. Friend makes a good point. I cannot remember how huge that victory was, but it was unbelievably massive. When I think of sleep deprivation experience in retrospect as a social experiment, it would probably be best if there were no guns or alcohol the previous evening. With all those people, not necessarily the best of buddies, in the same room, that might have added a bit of juice to the occasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70523-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07052360000483">In Falkirk, West&#151;the part of my constituency with which I am most concerned, because we lost it&#151;there are some details that worry me greatly. One is that the margin of the Scottish national party victory&#151;about 750 votes&#151;was substantially smaller than the number of votes that were apparently spoiled, about 1,200. I do not call the result into question, but the difference is substantial. For me, the key figure is the difference between the number of votes spoiled last time&#151;about 100&#151;and this time. There is clearly a fundamental problem. I suspect that there is something in the idea that some people deliberately spoiled their votes, as we have heard. A few people may have voted for a minor party in the list and chose not to put a second mark. My experience of standing and looking at the screen suggested that many people had voted Labour but put nothing down the middle. That was probably the case for other parties as well. It seemed to be the general pattern.</p>

In particular parts of my constituency there are high flats occupied primarily by old age pensioners. If there is a pattern, it seems to me that it was those people in particular who had difficulty with the ballot paper.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman share my belief that one of the most valuable aspects of the traditional way of counting votes in Britain is the emphasis on transparency and checks and balances? Does he agree that the refusal to recount in two of the constituencies in Scotland is perhaps one of the most worrying aspects of that election? For all involved in the political process and for all political parties, we must ensure that we enshrine those checks and balances and transparency in the future.</p>

 I welcome Mr. Gould&#146;s appointment. I do not rule out the need for further inquiries, but it would be premature to define the exact nature and extent of any such inquiries until we have had at least an initial examination by a person with international experience of voting systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70523-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07052360000501">I would argue that the problems experienced over the past few weeks are largely the result of the failure&#151;largely a collective failure&#151;to put the views of the voter first. The voters were distinctly secondary in determining the new voting systems in the first place, and they appeared only on the periphery of the many discussions, meetings, debates and commissions that were held over the past two years.</p>

Despite the calls to improve voter turnout, the worst figure of all was the turnout of below 52 per cent. If we take away the rejected votes, it was below 50 per cent., despite the fact that this was viewed as the closest-run Holyrood election since the Scottish Parliament was constituted. Let us today kill the myth that changing the voting system improves voter turnout.</p>

Yet for the latter group, rather than encouraging more to vote, we created a system that disfranchised them even more. It is no surprise that the largest number of spoilt papers were in the areas of the highest socio-economic deprivation&#151;more than 2,000 in both Glasgow, Pollok and Glasgow, Shettleston.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that the returning officers have an important role? What was striking during the last election was the number of people, many from poorer areas, who were not on the register.</p>

 I certainly agree with my hon. Friend that electoral registration officers have a very poor record indeed in respect of their ability to deal with marginalised groups, and this month&#146;s events have unfortunately made the situation even worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="70523-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07052360000507">From my own experience of representing a Glasgow seat, I know that problems with adult literacy among many in our population remain acute. Scotland has some of the lowest levels of literacy not only in the UK, but in the whole of western Europe. When someone&#146;s literacy is poor, form filling is a daunting experience and many people lack the confidence even to admit that they have a problem in the first place. If people receive two pieces of paper with two contrasting sets of instructions, by the time they put pencil to paper, we can expect a small but significant percentage to be confused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="70523-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07052360000508">Do I think that the elections should have been held on separate dates? Not necessarily. Some polling clerks used their initiative on the day to hand the papers out separately, giving out the second ballot after the voter had completed the first vote. It would probably have been better for the ballots to take place in different rooms in the polling station, so that only one set of instructions was given for each vote. The disappearing &#147;guiding arrows&#148; in Glasgow and Lothian only made a bad problem even worse. If forms are something that people tackle only occasionally and then often with help from a third party or friend, it should have been anticipated that some looking at the form would have read it as one long list that simply continued on to the right hand side of the page. The regional list was not even in strict alphabetical order. Branded names came first, based on the first letter on the line. Political parties, however bizarre or tiny, came next, and independents came last. The latter positioning reinforced the sight line that the four or five names at the top of the right-hand column were simply a continuation of the independents&#146; names on the left side. I was not alone in witnessing the hundreds of papers that showed one cross on the left-hand side and no votes on the constituency side. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson) that that was deliberate in some cases, but I do not believe that an overwhelming majority intended to abstain. By that point, they must simply have been baffled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70523-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07052360000509">Branded names have to be analysed. I certainly accept that the Scottish National party is a perfectly legitimate party and that it used the rules as it was entitled to under the law. However, I certainly have a question about the British National party describing itself as a local party for local people. We need to be very careful, because the system could easily be abused.  <br>

That was repeated on the constituency side, even though there was plenty of unused space for an enlarged font size. Instructions such as the guiding arrows should not be removed simply for the convenience of the machinery or at the sole discretion of electoral registration officers. They are fundamental to allowing people to vote as they intend, and that should be a democratic right.</p>

It was clear, particularly for individual candidates, that many were also standing for council seats but were canny enough to work out that getting on to the regional list secured them a Royal Mail freepost delivery, meaning that they did not have to trek around delivering everything by hand.</p>

 I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman on that point. I am aware that at least two of the so-called political parties were simply the creations of one individual, and that one was used to promote an individual&#146;s own publication. Standing for elections to the Scottish Parliament involves considerable public expenditure on freepost, and it should be based on serious intent. I believe that candidates should show an appropriate number of supporting nominations. That would not exclude genuine, serious independent candidates.</p>

The detailed instructions arrived along with an avalanche of election literature and probably ended up in many cases going straight into the bin. They came too late and were not sufficiently embedded in the general public&#146;s knowledge. Again, I would question the apparent lack of work on voters who are difficult to reach.

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="70523-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07052360000517">I am astonished that the Electoral Reform Society should have declared the council elections a success.

was no increase in the numbers of women or ethnic minority councillors. In fact, we probably ended up with fewer, including the loss in my own constituency of the sole Asian female councillor in Scotland. There was no significant increase in turnout, and despite the fact that, like myself, members of all the main political parties spent a lot of time trying to inform voters about the changes, many people were baffled by their consequences, including losing the long-cherished ability to vote out an unpopular representative.</p>

In the past, many of us who spend time in countries that are emerging democracies have been able to say with great pride and absolute confidence, regardless of our politics, that we are in no doubt about the result of a particular election. I have sometimes found it hard to listen to politicians or political party activists in other parts of the world explain their difficulties and lack of trust. We all know of countries where the degree of coercion is great. As the problems in Scotland have shown, however, something extraordinarily minor can cause the great problems that we have seen. Certainly I cannot imagine that any politician in Scotland or the rest of the UK would scoff at the electoral problems suffered by Florida a few years ago.</p>

A number of Members have drawn attention to the problems of constituents who had applied for postal votes. I experienced difficulties myself: my postal vote only arrived on Monday. In my area, council workers were out delivering postal votes by hand&#151;I do not know whether they were scuttling around in taxis&#151;to ensure that they arrived.

I am repeating them because I did not get an answer to them, and I would like to have an answer now. I asked whether the Electoral Commission warned the Secretary of State of concerns about the design of the ballot paper. When the ballot paper size became apparent, did he decide that all must appear on one page? At the end of the ballot design phase, was there any further testing? I then asked him to publish all relevant ministerial correspondence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="70523-0012.htm_para28"><a name="07052360000543">It is important for all those questions to be answered and to be a matter of public record. Frankly, the Secretary of State&#146;s contribution was underwhelming&#151;much like his initial statement&#151;and he seemed to be saying, &#147;Not me, guv&#148;, rather than anything else. It is not good enough. Thank goodness we now have a Scottish Executive who will treat this issue with the seriousness that it deserves, unlike the UK Government, who are running away from their responsibilities.</p>

 The observation that I wanted to make was about the impact on local government. It was my experience that the local government campaigns were almost totally submerged in the discussion of the Scottish Parliament results. That is not good for local democracy at the local government level. I would be very interested in any evidence about the extent to which there were discrepancies in this election, as distinct from others, because my impression was that the tide flowed in the same direction in the Scottish Parliament elections and those for local authorities, irrespective of the merits of individual councillors, which is inappropriate and unwise.</p>

That obviously had an effect. I would like to see that investigated and possible remedies applied in future. We should also examine the extent to which it was made more difficult for people who clearly intended to vote for candidates of a single party to do so because the candidates were not grouped. It would have been sensible to have candidates of the same party grouped together, and that should be investigated. Similarly, my understanding is that if voters who sought to vote for candidates of the same party put three Xs, all the votes were ruled out. It should be possible to devise a system in which the last remaining vote&#151;after the other candidates had been elected or eliminated&#151;could be given to the candidate.</p>

 It has been a good debate, which has been welcomed on both sides of the House as an opportunity to raise serious concerns. On both sides of the House, there is a recognition that there needs to be a proper inquiry into what went on. Some 146,097 votes were lost. The Secretary of State admits that he does not know how many people that represents, but one thing is for sure&#151;it could represent that very number. The Secretary of State, however, is not able to tell us.</p>

Although I fully understand that the Secretary of State wants to wait for his inquiry, the fact is that when 146,000 votes go missing, there should be an apology from those responsible.</p>

Whatever one&#146;s perspective, there is no doubt that, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, North (Ann McKechin) said, it was never going to be easy for electors to deal with two different kinds of electoral process on the same day.

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70523-0013.htm_para23"><a name="07052360000592">No one has raised a single issue on the Floor of the House that will not be covered by the statutory inquiry that is already under way. The inquiry will examine all the possible factors behind the difficulties experienced at the elections that have been identified. Ministers and officials will co-operate with the inquiry and the report is expected in a little over 12 weeks. That is why the Government&#146;s amendment simply asks the House to await the outcome of the statutory review so that its recommendations can inform decisions on whatever next steps might be necessary. The Conservative motion calls for another inquiry that would run simultaneously with the statutory review and duplicate its efforts, but that does not seem to be an especially productive thing to do, which is why I ask the House to support the amendment.</p>

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. We are about to debate a motion tabled by my right hon. and hon. Friends that states:</p>
<a name="70523-0014.htm_brev1"><a name="07052360001361"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the salary of the Secretary of State for Health should be reduced by &#163;1,000.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="70523-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07052360001095">I therefore found it surprising that one of the signatories of the amendment is the Secretary of State for Health, who will benefit from the decision, one way or another. That would not be<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

<p><a name="st_o311"><a name="07052360001096"><a name="70523-0014.htm_spnew1"><a name="07052360002221"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b>
 Order. I must be able to hear the point of order.</p>

<p><a name="st_o312"><a name="07052360001097"><a name="70523-0014.htm_spnew2"><a name="07052360002222"><b>Mr. Gummer:</b>
 That would not be a matter of importance were it not for the fact that the Secretary of State for Health has personally made a number of statements about the wonders of the national health service, including the fact that is the best service that we have had, and she is being paid for it. I think that it is an unusual circumstance.</p>

<p><a name="st_o313"><a name="07052360001098"><a name="70523-0014.htm_spnew3"><a name="07052360002223"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b>
 The right hon. Gentleman knows the procedure. He is an experienced and senior Member of Parliament, and he knows what the process and the procedures of the House are. It is not unusual for that to happen. We must now proceed.</p>

<p><a name="st_o314"><a name="07052360001099"><a name="70523-0014.htm_spnew4"><a name="07052360002224"><b>Mr. Gummer:</b>
 Further to that point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>

 Is the right hon. Gentleman going to pursue the same point of order that he has just raised?</p>

 No, Madam Deputy Speaker. You kindly suggested that I have been in the House a long time, but at no point during that period have I ever known any circumstances in which the person under criticism signed the contrary measure. It is a new element, and I seek your advice on the matter.</p>

<p><a name="st_o317"><a name="07052360001102"><a name="70523-0014.htm_spnew7"><a name="07052360002227"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b>
 I remind not only the right hon. Gentleman who raised the point of order but, indeed, all other hon. Members that it is up to each individual Member to judge whether they have a relevant interest that should be declared in any way. That is the norm for the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o318"><a name="07052360001103"><a name="70523-0014.htm_spnew8"><a name="07052360002228"><b>Alan Duncan (Rutland and Melton) (Con):</b>
 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. In the statement on the energy White Paper this afternoon, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry trumpeted his policy on carbon capture and experiments to achieve it. While he was on his feet, I understand that BP announced that it has withdrawn from what is probably the only carbon capture experiment. Do you have the power, Madam Deputy Speaker, to ask the Secretary of State to come back and explain the apparent contradiction in what he told the House of Commons this afternoon?</p>

<p><a name="st_o319"><a name="07052360001104"><a name="70523-0014.htm_spnew9"><a name="07052360002229"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b>
 I must inform the hon. Gentleman that that is not, in fact, a point of order for the Chair, but his remarks are now on the record.</p>

Members on both sides of the House will know that we have frequently used the time available to the official Opposition to raise a series of NHS and health-related issues. We have done so on health care-acquired infections, mental health, the NHS work force and planning, and the management of the health service, always on the basis of motions that are constructive and designed to support the national health service. However, NHS staff have reached the end of the line with the Secretary of State. Serial incompetence and a chronic failure to listen to those staff mean that she has no credibility left to resolve the imminent problems facing the national health service. It is not simply that she and the rest of the Government are paralysed by the non-election campaign of the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr. Brown). The fact is that even were she to remain as Secretary of State after a change in prime ministership, she cannot command the necessary confidence and support across the national health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="70523-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07052360001108">Many Members will recall the matters that we have raised before. Let me reiterate the many serial failures for which the Secretary of State has been responsible over the past two years. In 2005, there was the botched reorganisation of primary care trusts, which led within months to the resignation of Nigel Crisp, now Lord Crisp, as chief executive of the NHS. Under this Secretary of State, we saw the NHS plunge into its largest ever deficit. Since May 2005, the number of staff&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> .</i><i> ] </i>Labour Members are always telling us&#151;the Prime Minister did it again at Prime Minister&#146;s questions today&#151;how many additional staff have been recruited by the Labour Government. Of course, those include 107,000 administrators. When the Prime Minister says, &#147;There have been 250,000 extra staff&#148;, funnily enough he never goes on to say, &#147;of whom 107,000 are administrators.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="70523-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07052360001109">We are focusing on the record of the Secretary of State. Since May 2005, the number of staff working in the national health service has fallen. Payment by results and the tariff&#151;a critical element of NHS reform&#151;collapsed in February 2006, weeks before the start of the financial year in which the NHS plunged into its largest ever deficit. In payment by results and the tariff, we have a system that is necessary but is not being delivered successfully. <i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> .</i><i> ]</i> The Minister for the Cabinet Office says, &#147;Ah!&#148; as though it is some kind of mystery. &#147;Money follows the patient&#148; was a policy advocated by the last Conservative Government; it took years for the Labour Government  <br>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. Of course, the Tory Government were no stranger to deficits. Is it not the case that the deficit that he is talking about was smaller, as a proportion of the NHS budget, than many of those that the Tories had&#151;and now it has gone?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman does not seem to understand that last year a deficit of more than &#163;1 billion within the NHS masked a deficit in excess of &#163;2 billion within the Department of Health as a whole. That scale of increase has never happened before. The hon. Gentleman and other Labour Members probably often sit there wondering why, in the year just gone, their primary care trusts have had so much of their money top-sliced in order to deal with that deficit. Why did that happen if the deficit is so modest? Why &#163;1.5 billion out of PCT budgets? Why &#163;350 million out of education and training budgets? Why hundreds of millions extra out of the central budgets of the Department of Health? It is all because in the previous year there was not only a gross deficit of &#163;1.3 billion within NHS trusts but an unprecedented scale of overspending within the Department.</p>

 Is my hon. Friend aware that the new Norfolk and Norwich PCT started its operations with a massive &#163;50 million deficit? Surely if the Government set up a new organisation going back to where we were 10 years ago, they should at least allow it to start without a deficit.</p>

 I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s point. Indeed, the same can be said of Cambridgeshire primary care trust, which is, like his, in the east of England. We have the largest deficit proportionately anywhere in the NHS. Of course, there must be a transitional process of trying to deal with those deficits, otherwise the consequences to patients will be unacceptable. Ministers are only now beginning to realise the scale of the deficits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="70523-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07052360001120">Although Ministers are always telling the public about the unprecedented amounts of additional money that are provided to the NHS, the consequence of last year&#146;s deficits recurring this year is no growth in resources on the front line of the NHS. That means that, far from growth in services and resources in the past two years, people in the NHS have experienced cuts and reductions.</p>

<p><a name="st_o332"><a name="07052360001121"><a name="70523-0014.htm_spnew22"><a name="07052360002242"><b>Mr. John Gummer (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con):</b>
 Does my hon. Friend realise that the Great Yarmouth and Waveney primary care trust&#151;which was created on the basis that there was previously no deficit&#151;has entered into its existence with a special deficit, which the NHS central organisation invented, insisting that the PCT take on board a large sum of money because others have a deficit? Instead of starting deficit free, after working for five years to achieve that, it has to pay back money that it never owed.</p>

<p><a name="st_o333"><a name="07052360001122"><a name="70523-0014.htm_spnew23"><a name="07052360002243"><b>Mr. Lansley:</b>
 My right hon. Friend makes an important point. When Ministers consider the consequences of dealing with deficits, they claim that they have done away with the old system, which they describe as opaque. They say that everything is more transparent now. Conservative Members, who actually speak to members of primary care trusts and others about their financial position, know that the system is anything but transparent. Ministers are still in the business of shifting the money around the NHS to cover up the deficits and, indeed, the consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="70523-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07052360001123">Ministers try to cover up the consequences of deficits in places where accident and emergency departments&#151;for example, in Surrey, Sussex, Worthing and Enfield&#151;are threatened with closure, not because of genuine clinical cases for change, which the Secretary of State promulgates, but because of financially driven cuts and the consequences of the European working time directive. The Secretary of State has told us more than once that she wished that that directive had been amended. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, who is present, promised in 2004 that it would be amended to tackle its worst aspects. He told us that services to patients in the NHS would not suffer as a consequence of the implementation of the directive. Yet maternity units in Manchester and A and E departments in the south of England are being shut precisely because of the failure in December 2006 to amend the working time directive, as the Government had promised.</p>

 I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman shortly, but let me tell him something else if he is interested in the IT programme. He will remember that, 10 days ago, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that we had to deliver the electronic transfer of prescriptions. By the end of 2005, 50 per cent. of prescriptions were supposed to be delivered electronically. By now, the figure should have approached 100 per cent. Yet the last quarter for which figures are available shows that 4 per cent. of prescriptions were transferred electronically. Actually, it is worse than that: about 4,500,000 prescriptions were issued electronically, but only just over 1 per cent. of those issued could be dispensed electronically because bar codes had not been fitted to them and pharmacists did not have access to the necessary equipment.</p>

GPs have not been listened to with regard to its implementation; and the target was for 90 per cent. of appointments to be made through choose and book by now, but the latest figure is 38 per cent., and half of those were done on the telephone, not online.

As for cutting GPs out of out-of-hours care, the cost was a quarter of a billion pounds more than estimated, and it has turned into a shambles. The dental contract, which was described by the British Dental Association as a shambles, has reduced and limited access to NHS dentistry.</p>

It took her six months to admit, because the Healthcare Commission survey was going to present it anyway, that 22 per cent. of patients admitted to hospital were first admitted to mixed-sex wards.

 The Prime Minister said at Prime Minister&#146;s questions today, and it is stated in the amendment, that 200,000 lives have been saved by a continuing reduction in premature mortality from heart disease and cancer.

But if Members go back to <i> Hansard </i>of 27 November 2006, they will find that a member of the Front-Bench team asked what would have been the number of lives saved under the last Conservative Government, applying the same measure of the reduction in premature mortality. The answer was that, in respect of cardiovascular disease, between 1978 and 1996 535,000 lives were saved. In respect of cancer over the same period, 65,000 lives were saved.

luck? Surely it is due to the resurrection of the NHS by this Government, with preventive programmes such as bowel cancer screening, osteoporosis screening and flu jabs for pensioners. That is not due to luck. It is due to sound policies, backed by staff, resources and vision&#151;policies opposed by the Conservatives, whose own policies would decimate the NHS in deprived cities such as Wolverhampton.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Just a couple of weeks ago, I was shown around the brilliant accident and emergency department at St Helens and Knowsley Trust by Graeme Inkster, one of the emergency consultants, who explained to me exactly why we do not have winter bed crises now. He showed me what he called the corridor of shame, which 10 years ago was full of patients lying on trolleys waiting for hours on end. He said that he used to come into work first thing on a Monday morning and find patients queuing in the corridor; they had been left over from the weekend because there had not been anybody to treat them. Some of them had been there for six, 12 or 18 hours. The hospitals did not have the money or the staff, and they had not reorganised the care around the patients. The investment we put in and the reforms we made&#151;and the four-hour accident and emergency target, which the Opposition opposed&#151;drove the changes that led to us ensuring that we do not have winter beds crises.</p>

 Of course I listen to staff. I listened this morning to the midwives at the Royal College of Midwives, who gave me several examples of why we need to do more in terms of maternity services. That is why we worked with the RCM to produce the action plan, &#147;Maternity Matters: choice, access and continuity of care in a safe service&#148;, which was published recently. However, what I do that the hon.

 My hon. Friend is right. That latest survey by the independent Commonwealth Fund confirms what patients are saying. It looked at the health service in Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, the United States of America and the UK. Four years ago, it rated the NHS as number three, and two years ago it was still number three, but according to the latest survey the NHS is now number one&#151;it is the fairest, the most efficient and the best overall.</p>

 Is it not also the case that although specialists tell us one thing, sometimes the community wants something different? Sometimes specialists say to us that they want all services in one place. In my community, they wanted one specialist care maternity service and a midwife-led unit. We now have &#163;30 million investment in community service hospitals. As a result, Holme valley hospital&#151;which had been threatened with closure in 1997 and has been built up under this Government&#151;will now provide even more hospital services to our community, so we now have both services.</p>

 Hospital-acquired infection is a serious issue. We take it very seriously and we were the first Government to require every hospital to record cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and C. difficile and to report that publicly. Therefore, we know the exact nature of the problem and we can hold hospitals and their boards to account for getting those rates down. I am glad to be able to say that MRSA rates are falling, but there is a new strain of C. difficile. It is not only a problem in Britain; it is causing problems in many health services and we must do more to protect patients from it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="70523-0016.htm_para0"><a name="07052360001211">It is unsurprising that hospital patients are more satisfied as the waiting lists are lower than they have ever been&#151;almost nobody is waiting more than six months for the sort of operation for which people used to wait two years. That happened because we put in more money&#151;opposed by the Conservatives. But we did not put more money into the old ways of doing things, we put more money into new and better ways of caring for patients. At Walsall Hospitals NHS Trust, which I visited a few weeks ago, I met the staff who had reorganised the service, and found that with no further funding increase they could care for six orthopaedic patients in the time that previously they had been able to care for only one. They slashed the waiting time for MRI scans from two years to just a few weeks. That is investment and reform in action.</p>

it&#151;is ensure that for almost all patients and almost all conditions there will be no more than 18 weeks maximum from referral to treatment. For many people, the wait will be even shorter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="70523-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07052360001214">Let us take the example of Shepton Mallet treatment centre. I went there and talked to patients, including the chair of one of the local primary care trusts&#151;a Labour chair, as it happens. At that treatment centre, patients see the consultant, have the scans and tests, get the diagnosis, decide on the operation and book the date for the operation&#151;all in one visit. That never used to happen. Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust has also changed its way of working and will now be one of the first hospitals in the country to deliver a maximum of 18 weeks for almost all of its patients. That is investment and reform in practice.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right.

 After visiting a GP, one member of my family had to wait only three weeks for cancer surgery; another member of my family went into hospital with terminal cancer and spent 10 hours on a hospital trolley in a corridor.

 My hon. Friend makes his point very graphically. That is another real tribute not only to NHS staff and the new cancer networks, but to the target&#151;the promise that we made&#151;that patients diagnosed with cancer would wait a maximum of 62 days between an urgent GP referral and the start of cancer treatment. Just two years ago, fewer than two thirds of patients were getting from diagnosis to treatment so quickly; now more than 95 per cent. are. There have been real improvements in the past two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="70523-0016.htm_para5"><a name="07052360001224">Most important of all, the NHS is saving more people&#146;s lives. The lives of nearly 150,000 people with coronary heart disease have been saved. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire had something to say on that subject. It is perfectly true that under the Conservative Government, death rates from coronary heart disease were falling, but they were falling a great deal more slowly than in most other parts of Europe, and have been falling faster since. I looked at the numbers. During the 1980s, those death rates fell by about 20 per cent.; during the 1990s, they fell by 26 per cent. During the years of this Labour Government, they fell by 36 per cent., and we will meet early our target for a 40 per cent. reduction in those death rates. Furthermore, 50,000 more lives have been saved as a result of our changes to cancer care, and suicide rates are at their lowest level ever because of our changes to mental health services.</p>

We have discussed that recently. I find it extraordinary that the Conservative party should now want to end that provision and deny seriously suicidal patients the possibility of treatment from which they have benefited for decades.</p>

 Would the right hon. Lady care to comment on the extent to which changes in coronary heart disease death rates are affected by changes in smoking habits made 10 or 15 years earlier? The improvements in the Tory years could have been due to changes in smoking habits 10 or 15 years previously, and some of the changes we are experiencing now could also be due to earlier lifestyle changes.

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, although Sir Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer, stresses the point that the impact of smoking, including second-hand smoke, can show up extremely quickly&#151;within a year or two&#151;in coronary heart disease. Part of the improvements we have been making in the NHS is the much bigger investment in &#147;stop smoking&#148; services, which have helped more than 1.5 million people to give up smoking. The smoke-free legislation, supported on both sides of the House, will be the biggest step forward for public health for decades.</p>

It is not easy, but we have to do it to meet the huge challenges of an ageing population, people&#146;s rising expectations, new drugs, changes in medical technology and an epidemic of lifestyle diseases. We have to change the way the NHS works to safeguard what is most precious and enduring about it: the values of a health service that is paid for by all of us, available to each of us on the basis of clinical need and free at the point of use&#151;the values we believe in on the Labour Benches.</p>

 I think that the Secretary of State betrayed herself earlier in her speech when she talked about a Labour chair of a PCT.

However, our experience is reflected in a gerrymandered decision about the sites of hospitals in the south of my constituency, which drove the Surrey and Sussex Healthcare Trust into the largest deficit in the country under her predecessor. That was followed by her gerrymandered decision for a hospital at the St. Helier site in the face of recommendations.

Close to home wherever safely possible and in a specialist centre where necessary&#151;that is what clinicians are telling us. If the NHS can do that, each year we can save 500 more lives, prevent another 1,000 heart attacks and support more than 1,000 stroke victims to regain their independence, rather than being condemned to lasting disability.

There has been record investment, which we supported, and some genuine progress has been made, yet both the public and health professionals have lost faith. Just this month, a &#147;Newsnight&#148; poll found that, in relation to the NHS, Labour was the least trusted party. The Liberal Democrats came top. [Hon. Members: &#147;What a surprise.&#148;] I acknowledge that straight away.

When they were in government, there were years of chronic under-investment in the NHS. In 1997, when the Conservative party left government, investment in the NHS was 6.8 per cent. of gross domestic product&#151; 33 per cent. less than the EU average. Given that we were spending a third less than the rest of Europe, it was no wonder that people had to wait interminably for operations. I remember people coming to see me who were waiting for hip and knee-joint operations, sometimes for three years from the first referral to the point at which they had their operation. That is not a world to which we want to return. It was no wonder that the infrastructure of the NHS&#151;the buildings&#151;was worn out and so much investment was needed. In addition, not enough doctors or nurses were being trained or employed in the NHS.</p>

Let us compare our experience in the UK with that in the rest of Europe. In many countries elsewhere in Europe, waiting is simply not an issue. Never mind getting down to a maximum wait of 18 weeks next year; the fact is that people in many countries do not experience waits for operations. One has to take into account the massive head start that other countries have had because of their historically far higher funding for their health service than we have had in this country.</p>

Even after being turned out of government, the Conservatives voted against that increased investment. Had they had their way, cumulatively over the ensuing period we would have had &#163;35 billion less to invest in the NHS. Just imagine the closure of hospitals that we would be experiencing without that money! At the last election, their plan was to drain money out of the NHS to subsidise private health care&#151;that was stated in a manifesto drafted by the Conservative leader before he changed his mind.

 In the spirit of setting the record straight, which is what the hon.

decade of missed opportunity, inconsistent policy and botched reform. The chickens have come home to roost, and it is on her watch that we are experiencing the effects of so much mismanagement over the past decade. Let us consider the record and the roles of previous Secretaries of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70523-0017.htm_para10"><a name="07052360001276">In 1997, the Labour manifesto specifically said that the Government would scrap the internal market; that was the commitment made, but there is now an internal market. There is a purchaser-provider split, and hospitals compete for patients. That flip-flop in policy direction is the responsibility of the Labour Government as a whole, not just the Secretary of State. As for the other institutional reforms that have taken place, there was the introduction of primary care groups, then the creation of primary care trusts, the scrapping of health authorities, the creation of strategic health authorities, and the merger of primary care trusts. There has been endless organisational change, and it has not all been in a consistent direction; there has been a flip-flopping from one approach to another at great cost, and with an enormous impact on the morale of the people working in the health service, including the doctors and nurses.</p>

<p><a name="st_o434"><a name="07052360001277"><a name="70523-0017.htm_spnew19"><a name="07052360002344"><b>Andrew Stunell (Hazel Grove) (LD):</b>
 Is my hon. Friend aware that health workers in my area were employed by three different trusts in three consecutive years? Despite all the contract rewriting costs and management change costs that went with that, their job did not change one little bit; it was all wasted investment.</p>

<p><a name="st_o435"><a name="07052360001278"><a name="70523-0017.htm_spnew20"><a name="07052360002345"><b>Norman Lamb:</b>
 I am very much aware of that. Every time there is a change of organisation, another group of people get early retirement packages and redundancy packages. The impact on morale is intense. Changes have just taken place in Norfolk, and I know lots of people who are still in temporary posts and are waiting to have new posts allocated to them. Change always affects morale, and because the changes have been so frequent the impact on the morale of patients, doctors, nurses and many other health professionals has been dramatic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70523-0017.htm_para11"><a name="07052360001279">Botched reform has also hit the voice of the patient and the public in the NHS. The right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) was responsible for abolishing community health councils when he was Secretary of State. I have since heard it said that he had a particularly bad relationship with his local community health council. CHCs were abolished in 2002, and patient and public involvement forums were established after that, in 2003. Three years later, they were abolished, and the local involvement in health networks were created. That was another mess, and a botched reform that left all those involved with a sense of total frustration, including people who, as volunteers, were trying to make a contribution to improving our health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70523-0017.htm_para12"><a name="07052360001280">That same Secretary of State left another legacy: the current state of NHS IT. The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) got very hot under the collar on that point, but it is as though he is living in a parallel universe, and is not aware of what doctors in the NHS are saying about &#147;connecting for health&#148;. Their view is very different from the rosy  <br>

picture that he described. When a political commitment was made to &#147;connecting for health&#148;, no proper analysis was undertaken of the need for the system, or of whether financial benefits would outweigh the costs. That is the view of the Public Accounts Committee, and the majority of its members are from the Labour party. It took the view that there was no proper analysis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70523-0017.htm_para13"><a name="07052360001281">The original budget was &#163;2.3 billion, which will be exceeded. The PAC reckons that the costs range anywhere between &#163;6.2 billion and &#163;20 billion, compared with the original estimate of &#163;2.3 billion. The project is therefore massively over budget and it is behind schedule, too. The PAC says that the highly controversial patient clinical records scheme is running two years behind schedule, with no indication of when that part of the project will be complete. If one talks to any group of doctors, whether they are GPs or hospital doctors, one is met by a chorus of groans&#151;they are completely frustrated by &#147;connecting for health&#148; and the way in which it has been imposed from the centre. Again, that has impacted on morale.</p>

Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) said, there are 4,594 live sites providing the electronic prescription service, which is a huge improvement?

 I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman at least acknowledged that there have been frustrations. I repeat that if one talks to any group of doctors, they are enormously frustrated with the system and the way in which it has been imposed centrally. When I hear that there has never been a thorough system review to ensure that the people who are building it, the people who will use it, and the people who will purchase it share a common view, I am completely amazed.

That has happened under successive Governments, so does the hon.

 That is a very opportune intervention and I entirely accept the point made by the hon. Gentleman. In any system that tries to decentralise control and accountability there should be a role for the centre, too. It is a national health service, after all, and those specialist areas are particularly important to ensure that there is coverage across the country. I therefore accept his point entirely.</p>

 May I follow up that point? The hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="70523-0018.htm_para17"><a name="07052377000007">The reason that we have been so successful in cancer treatment and have such high survival rates is because of early screening, early diagnosis and far better treatment. Almost everyone with suspected cancer who is seen by their GP will be sent to a cancer specialist within two weeks, and 99 per cent. of patients who have been diagnosed with cancer will have had treatment within one month of their diagnosis. These are fantastic statistics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="70523-0018.htm_para18"><a name="07052377000008">Part of the reason for such success is that the NHS has introduced far greater flexibility in the system for cancer treatment and takes account of the needs of individual patients far more. Treatment is carried out in communities wherever possible. Simple chemotherapy treatments can now be given in district hospitals such as the Chesterfield and North Derbyshire Royal hospital, which has developed a chemotherapy suite so that patients do not have to travel all the way to Sheffield if they do not want to. The Chesterfield Royal has been so successful in its chemotherapy treatment that it is massively expanding its operation. It is a tiny district hospital, but the same is happening throughout the country so that patients diagnosed with cancer can receive treatment in a much calmer community-based environment, with their families close by. That is a huge achievement.</p>

Two thirds of women who are newly diagnosed with breast cancer are likely to survive for another 20 years. These sound like random statistics, but about 1,400 people who are alive today would not have been alive 10 years ago.</p>

The nurses were not entirely happy with the results, sent off for a biopsy on that day, and she was given a positive diagnosis there and then. She was seen and treated within three weeks of that routine appointment, which is staggering. On the day that she had her mammogram, she was given the name and telephone number for a nurse whom she could call day or night if she was worried. That was spectacular.

A death sentence has been lifted from this girl and it is so easy to see it when we talk to her about her experiences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="70523-0018.htm_para24"><a name="07052377000014">Those are two small examples&#151;albeit very close-to-home examples&#151;of where breast cancer treatment and survival rates have made a huge difference, not just to my life but to the lives of other people. I hope that we can continue to make a difference. The best chance of continuing to be able to help people with cancer, especially breast cancer, is to maintain a Labour Government, as recent history shows.</p>

 I shall try to adhere to your guidance, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="70523-0018.htm_para25"><a name="07052377000017">If we are discussing the health service, it is important to acknowledge that extra money has been invested and some improvements made, particularly on waiting times. We then have to ask whether the money has been spent sensibly and whether we could get more from it by spending it more productively. One of the dangers of a debate like this is that we quickly descend into our own individual examples of exactly what is happening in our own local health economies and local hospitals. That sometimes misses the broader point, because it is always possible to find one example that proves or disproves a general rule, so I shall leave any comments about local matters until the end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70523-0018.htm_para26"><a name="07052377000018">Accountability within the health service is one of its great problems, despite the amount of money going into it. I suspect that we have all experienced the problem of taking an issue on behalf of a constituent to an acute health trust. It tells us that the matter is not its responsibility, but that of the commissioning agency, the primary care trust, which then says that it is a matter for the strategic health authority, now a regional body. The SHA proceeds to tell us that it is not a matter that it can deal with because the Secretary of State needs to intervene. At that point, we contact the Secretary of State for Health, who tells us that it is a matter for the local health economy&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Absolutely&#148;]&#151;so we have gone round in a huge circle. It is extremely difficult, in a system that almost deliberately seems to go out of its way to cause such confusion, ever to pin down exactly who is responsible or accountable for what is happening locally.</p>

<p><a name="st_o472"><a name="07052377000019"><a name="70523-0019.htm_spnew0"><a name="07052377001201"><b>Meg Hillier:</b>
 I will be brief. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should visit constituencies like mine, where the Homerton hospital is a foundation trust made up of members of the public who have joined and created a mutual to help to run and hold the hospital to account. Does he not accept that that is a real achievement&#151;one that we should perhaps see more of?</p>

<p><a name="st_o473"><a name="07052377000020"><a name="70523-0019.htm_spnew1"><a name="07052377001202"><b>Grant Shapps:</b>
 I absolutely agree. We like the idea of foundation trusts and we want to go further and faster with them. We were going in that direction, until it was all reversed for the first half of the decade during which the Government were in power&#151;before we realised the error of their ways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="70523-0019.htm_para0"><a name="07052377000021">As I say, it is a problem of accountability. A great example is closing a chemotherapy unit on a temporary basis, when the entire community realises that it is actually being closed permanently. Chemotherapy is a treatment that people want to have close to home, if at all possible, for the simple reason that it is an uncomfortable experience. It is highly undesirable for people who are feeling sick to have to travel miles after their treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="70523-0019.htm_para1"><a name="07052377000022">I have heard of cases of chemotherapy units being closed on a temporary basis in order to remove the need for the local NHS trust to consult the public on the closure. A temporary closure, unlike a permanent one, requires no consultation. Having temporarily closed the unit, the trust then consults on a permanent closure. The effect has been to close the chemotherapy unit permanently, while calling the closure temporary. The rules have been circumvented by pretending to have a consultation, even though the unit is already closed. That is just another example of the lack of accountability that has found its way, almost systematically, into the health service. The Secretary of State should address that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="70523-0019.htm_para2"><a name="07052377000023">There are many other issues to address. Week in and week out in the House, we hear about a new top priority in the health service. Just the other week, I was highlighting the problems surrounding in vitro fertilisation in the NHS. In 2002, the then Secretary of State came to the House and said that everyone should be able to get at least one cycle of IVF on the national health service. I was very relieved to hear that. All three of my children were conceived through IVF, and the idea that others would be able to get the treatment through the NHS was to be welcomed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="70523-0019.htm_para3"><a name="07052377000024">The trouble was that, after that had been happening for a while, it stopped. The reason for it stopping seemed to be that other priorities had come along and been piled on top of the original priorities set by the Secretary of State, resulting in the first priority being almost entirely lost. That applies to all manner of services. An investigation into audiology services revealed that, despite the 18-week target, the average wait is 42 weeks. In Liverpool, the wait for having a hearing aid refitted is five years&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="70523-0019.htm_para4"><a name="07052377000029">The truth is that there is a five-year wait for people trying to transfer from an old-fashioned analogue hearing aid to a digital one. The Government have recently said that their aim is to include audiology services in the 18-week target. That is fine&#151;it is to be welcomed&#151;but there will be a problem if all that that does is pile that target on top of all the previous NHS targets. It is the latest priority in the latest week, and it simply will not work. The Government do not understand that the answer to all the problems in the NHS is not simply to stand up in the House and announce the latest priority, because all that happens is that the previous priority&#151;and the one before, and the one before that&#151;gets trampled on. That is how we end up with so little accountability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="70523-0019.htm_para5"><a name="07052377000030">I want to be brief, so I shall simply do what I am sure all hon. Members want to do, which is to refer to a local case. Despite all the promises and pledges, and despite what we heard at Prime Minister&#146;s questions today and in the Secretary of State&#146;s opening comments about how wonderfully rosy everything should be in the NHS, we all have our own examples of how the exact opposite is the case. In my constituency, the Queen Elizabeth II hospital is the place that illustrates that problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="70523-0019.htm_para6"><a name="07052377000031">A consultation is about to get under way into the closure of the accident and emergency unit, of maternity services, of elderly care and of paediatrics, and into ending all elective operations there. This is the proposed wholesale closure of all the acute services at the hospital. The Secretary of State and her Ministers must recognise that when we hear pledges and promises, or talk of the number of extra doctors and nurses, they mean nothing to those who live in a county such as mine, which has more than 1 million people but only two hospitals that are set to remain after this flawed consultation: one in Labour Stevenage, the other in Labour Watford.</p>

 I was first elected a member of a health authority in 1974. In 1977, I was appointed chair of Cumbria health authority by a Labour Secretary of State, and in 1979 I was not reappointed by a Conservative Secretary of State. There was something honest about that. There were people chairing health authorities who supported the Government&#146;s views. Now, I am afraid that we have given that away. Now, the Healthcare Commission appoints retired civil servants. In my area it has just appointed a new primary care trust, not one of whose non-executive directors lives in a city or a town. They all live in a rural area, and I suspect that they all come from the middle class.</p>

for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell). I was a Member of Parliament during his time as Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="70523-0019.htm_para8"><a name="07052377000036">I think that the Secretary of State would agree that she has been greatly assisted by dedicated staff, and also by record funding from a Labour Government. As we have heard today, the NHS has been transformed. We have heard about the experience of patients, as opposed to that of politicians or the general public: we have heard that 90 per cent. are pleased with the treatment that they have received, which is excellent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="70523-0019.htm_para9"><a name="07052377000037">We have slashed waiting times. Members who have been here for a while will remember when their postbags were full of letters and their surgeries were full of walking sticks, because people were waiting for hip replacements or elective surgery. They were not waiting for 18 weeks or for 18 months; some were waiting for two or three years. As Members know, that does not happen any more. The hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill) is waving a piece of paper. I would like to think it was his resignation, but I suspect that it is not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="70523-0019.htm_para11"><a name="07052377000039">Mistakes have been made. I happen to believe that the reorganisation of Cumbria PCT was wrong. It needed to be reorganised because it was ridiculous to have three PCTs for 40,000 people, but the creation of a unitary PCT for the whole of Cumbria was entirely wrong, because it has made the PCT too remote. I only hope that we do not make the same mistake in the local government reorganisation and end up with a unitary Cumbria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="70523-0019.htm_para12"><a name="07052377000040">At first there was great concern about clinics run by community action teams, but when we met the Minister of State he gave us assurances that the CATs would be tailor-made for rural areas like Cumbria, and would not take resources away. I hope that in the near future it will be announced not only that CATs will be complementary to services in Cumbria, but that one will be based at Cumberland Infirmary.</p>

My area had the first private finance initiative hospital in the country. I advise Members never to want to be the first at anything, because being at the cutting edge has its problems. My hospital had its problems, but they are being sorted out. However, the fact is that we had waited 40 years for that new hospital. The Conservatives cancelled it on four occasions. The previous hospital had been built a long time ago&#151;during the time of Lloyd George&#151;and the maternity service was dangerous because the district general hospital was three miles away from the maternity hospital and the consultants could not get to  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="70523-0019.htm_para15"><a name="07052377000043">Finally, I shall talk about the dentistry service in Cumbria. In 2005, because of how NHS dentists felt about contracts, the vast majority of those in Carlisle opted out of the service. There were long queues in the streets of Carlisle&#151;which was embarrassing and made the national news&#151;as one dentist said that if people did not sign up immediately they would not get a dentist at all. Last week, it was revealed in <i> The Cumberland News</i> that we have provided 23,000 places for patients in Carlisle, and that there was no waiting list for dentistry there. When the Minister&#151;my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central&#151;visited and we went to a surgery, we came across people who had not been to a dentist for 10 or 15 years. Under the current Secretary of State, we have cured the problems of dentistry in north Cumbria, and they can be cured throughout the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="70523-0019.htm_para16"><a name="07052377000044">That is not all that should be said on this matter.

That is not about my constituency; it is a story about the market town of Penrith, where there will also be no waiting list.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="70523-0019.htm_para17"><a name="07052377000045">It is wrong to say that the Secretary of State has failed. She has had a difficult task, but we are getting things right. One thing that we must do is ensure that the Conservatives never get another chance to decimate the NHS. They have never believed in it&#151;they voted against it&#151;and they still do not believe in it. Many of them do not even use it, so why should we trust them with it?</p>

 First, I shall respond to the closing comments of the hon. Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) by referring to what the Secretary of State said in her speech. She began by saying that being Secretary of State for Health is a great privilege&#151;and she was generous enough to say that it was felt to be so not only by Labour Secretaries of State but by Conservative Secretaries of State as well. I did not agree with very much else of what she said, but I do agree that it is a great privilege to hold her office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="70523-0019.htm_para18"><a name="07052377000047">However, when someone is granted a privilege it behoves them to ask what is expected of them in return.

The charge that sticks against the Secretary of State is not that she is not committed to the national health service and its ideals&#151;of course she is committed to them&#151;but that she has not delivered the level of competence that the taxpayers and patients of this country are entitled to expect in return for the investment provided by her colleagues in the Treasury.</p>

some aspects of the service it delivers. Conservative politicians who say that the NHS has got worse since 1997 are simply wrong. That defies the evidence and the experience of those who use the health service. As my hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State made clear, the charge against the Secretary of State is not that things have not got better. They have got better under this Secretary of State as they have under all her predecessors going back to 1948. There are endless statistics that my predecessors and I could quote on the improvements that were delivered by the NHS. Such improvements have been delivered throughout its history and my hon.

 Yes, I do, as long as it is understood that we are looking for the maximum possible health gain for the resources that are provided to the NHS and, in particular, the delivery of the stated objectives that Ministers, under both Labour and Tory Governments, have set out for the NHS. I wish to focus on one of those objectives, because if we conduct the health debate&#151;as is often the temptation&#151;purely in terms of the structure of health care delivered to particular communities, we miss the point of what the NHS exists for and what patients expect us to deliver through its structures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="70523-0019.htm_para21"><a name="07052377000052">It has been said by every Health Secretary that one of the purposes of the NHS is to reduce health inequalities around the country. So one of the challenges for the Secretary of State is why, despite the huge increase in resources over the past 10 years, health inequalities in Britain have got worse. In my intervention in the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), I said that we should look not only at the record on cancer mortality or infant mortality for this country now as compared with 10 years ago, but at the health outcome measures in comparison with other, comparable countries. We should challenge ourselves with the fact that although cancer mortality rates are better here now than they were 10 years, they are significantly&#151;not merely statistically&#151;worse in Britain than in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The latter is possibly the most telling, because that country&#146;s national income is significantly lower than ours.</p>

 I am delighted to speak in this debate, which gives us the opportunity to set out some of the dividing lines between the parties on the health service, to examine some of the choices that the British people will face at the next election and to consider the Government&#146;s record on some of the issues.</p>

It is fair to say at the outset that none of the improvements in Dudley would have been possible without the leadership of the Secretary of State and her colleagues. That is why I am speaking against the Opposition motion today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="70523-0020.htm_para0"><a name="07052377000062">There are new rapid-care teams, care staff working in the community with mental health patients and new nurse consultants working with those most likely to return to hospital most frequently. We are intervening earlier and working on ways of providing preventive care closer to home. When the impact of the work of those staff on just the first few patients was analysed, it showed that the length of their stays in hospital away from their families had been reduced by an average of one week. The most recent figures show that the strategy has slashed the average length of stay in hospital by almost a quarter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="70523-0020.htm_para1"><a name="07052377000063">There are new case managers, who ensure that patients who can be treated at home are not unnecessarily admitted to hospital and that those who are admitted return home more quickly. Such managers cut emergency admissions. Again, it is worth referring to the figures: the work of one manager alone meant that 88 people could be treated at home, away from hospital, in one eight-month period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="70523-0020.htm_para2"><a name="07052377000064">We are linking up health and social services in ways that could never have been dreamt of before. We are cutting out inefficiencies, speeding up treatment and reducing waiting times. Under the superb leadership of Rachel Harris at Dudley primary care trust, we have pioneered a new community heart failure team, which provides new services in health centres and clinics. As a result, emergency admissions caused by heart failure were reduced by 16 per cent. in the first year; a nearby PCT that did not then have a similar service saw its heart failure admissions increase by 10 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="70523-0020.htm_para3"><a name="07052377000065">As I said earlier, services at our district general hospital, Russells Hall, have also been transformed.

Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) said earlier. Whatever they say about their new-found commitment to the NHS, we must not let anyone forget that they constantly opposed that extra investment and would cut spending on the health service if they had the chance to do so.</p>

 What I have knowledge of is the proceeds of growth rule, which commits the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party to spending less on public services than we would. He has not denied that the proceeds of growth rule would result in a Conservative Government spending less on public services than a Labour Government. As I said earlier, if that rule was introduced this year, it would mean that spending would be &#163;21 billion lower than under the Government&#146;s plans. It would be lower still in every year after that. Let me put it another way: spending on the NHS accounts for almost a fifth of the Government&#146;s total managed expenditure, so cutting &#163;21 billion from public spending would mean slashing &#163;3.6 billion from the NHS. To achieve that, one would have to sack 100,000 nurses, 35,000 doctors and cut by a fifth the number of new hospitals, clinics and health centres.</p>

What do they mean when they talk about cutting back the big state or cutting the fat from public expenditure? They might not give us the details about which services they would slash to pay for the tax cuts or which bits of the big state they want to trim back, but the fancy photo calls, the so-called rebranding, the hospital visits, the fact that the Leader of the Opposition spent time in a school in Hull, and lived with what the Opposition patronisingly referred to as an ordinary family in Birmingham for a week, cannot mask the truth that this is the same old Tory party, running down the NHS because it is committed to the same old spending cuts.</p>

 That was another good debate&#151;at least until the last contribution&#151;and another health debate in Conservative time. There was an unprecedented show of strength by Cabinet colleagues in feigned support for the Secretary of State&#146;s valedictory performance, but we have to acknowledge the unprecedented scenes for which she is responsible. Thousands of doctors have taken to the streets to march against the Secretary of State and her policies. Thousands of Worthing residents, who are not known for taking to the streets, marched against the Government and the Secretary of State&#146;s policy on health.

Lady&#146;s health policy, on her watch as Secretary of State for Health in this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="70523-0020.htm_para26"><a name="07052377000101">The right hon. Lady has lost the confidence of her Department. She has lost the confidence of junior doctors and the next generation trying to train for a career in the NHS. She has lost the confidence of the RCN and nurses. She has lost the confidence of midwives. And she has lost the confidence of the patients she is here to serve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="70523-0020.htm_para27"><a name="07052377000102">The right hon. Lady has taken the culture of &#147;Not me, guv&#148; to new heights. It is never her fault. In November 2006, she told the Health Committee that it was the fault of the NHS for employing too many staff. In March 2006, she blamed &#147;clinical resistance&#148; to change in the NHS for all the problems. Just last week, for MTAS she blamed the BMA, the royal colleges and the postgraduate deaneries&#151;never herself&#151;and today we have seen her blame African Governments for her Government issuing 50,000 work permits for African nurses working in the NHS. It is never the fault of the Secretary of State for Health, never the fault of her Ministers and apparently never the fault of her Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="70523-0020.htm_para28"><a name="07052377000103">There has been a catalogue of departures by people around the Secretary of State. In March 2006, Sir Nigel Crisp departed, as did a Health Minister in the Commons and another in the Lords. Since June 2006, no fewer than six of the 14 board members at her Department have departed. Most recently, James Johnson, chairman of the BMA, fell on his sword after MTAS. Why? It is never the Secretary of State who takes responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="70523-0020.htm_para29"><a name="07052377000104">The NHS budget is larger than the GDP of 155 member nations of the UN and it needs skill and expertise to run it, yet under the right hon. Lady&#146;s leadership the central management of the NHS has rapidly come to resemble one of the less distinguished banana republics. The Home Secretary has just announced a &#163;3.5 million bonus scheme for his Department, which he described as &#147;not fit for purpose&#148;&#151;a perverse system that rewards failure. The Secretary of State should take the leaf out of her own policy of seeking to implement payment by results and to link elements of GP pay to patients&#146; satisfaction&#151;but I fear that if she took that route, she would end up  <br>

a net contributor to the Exchequer, rather than taking the modest &#163;1,000 reduction that our motion proposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="70523-0020.htm_para30"><a name="07052377000105">This Secretary of State has taken complacency, incompetence, fantasy and the art of the patronising to new heights. She has exploited the good will and hard work of staff in the NHS, whose dedication has been in spite of her, not because of her. Their loyalty and patience have been and are being severely tested. Reducing her salary by &#163;1,000 is poor compensation for two years of mismanagement. She is past her sell-by date. It is time that she gave the NHS a break. It is time for her to go.</p>

 The first responsibility of any Secretary of State for Health is to NHS patients. As much as we have obviously been hanging on every word uttered by Opposition Members this afternoon, I hope that they will not be too offended if I say that we set a little more store by the views of real patients treated in real NHS hospitals in the past 12 months. That is the ultimate verdict&#151;the one that counts and the one on which every Health Secretary should be judged. So what is their verdict?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="70523-0021.htm_para0"><a name="07052377000107">Let us start with the Leader of the Opposition&#146;s constituents: 94 per cent. said that the care that they got from their local trust last year was good, very good or excellent. The shadow Health Secretary&#146;s constituents were even more pleased: 95 per cent. of them said the same, with a full 43 per cent. saying that it was excellent. Just 1 per cent. said that the care they received was poor. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) is developing such a talent for whinging about the NHS that it would not surprise me if that 1 per cent. was him. The Healthcare Commission&#146;s figures record an improvement in patient satisfaction on last year. Those are the facts. They tell me that under my right hon. Friend&#146;s leadership, patient care is getting better in the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="70523-0021.htm_para1"><a name="07052377000108">However, we are not so arrogant as to say that there are not real issues to be addressed in the health service. Many have been raised today. The hon. Member for North Norfolk and others talked about MTAS. We have acknowledged that there have been serious problems with the system and we have promised to learn the lessons from those problems. Interviews are taking place now, and I believe that today&#146;s ruling in the courts will allow us to map out a way forward. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will say more tomorrow, including on the issue of costs, which the hon. Member for North Norfolk mentioned. I hope that that will enable us to move the issue on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="70523-0021.htm_para2"><a name="07052377000109">The hon. Gentleman made a big attack on private finance initiatives in his speech. He may correct me if I am wrong, but are not his constituents benefiting from a new PFI hospital, and is it not the case that PFI allows more areas to get their new hospital at once? Is it not a case of the hon. Gentleman saying, &#147;We&#146;ve got ours; we&#146;re all right, and we&#146;ll cancel those other hospitals&#148; including the Leeds children&#146;s hospital, which he was asked about, although he could not answer the question?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="70523-0021.htm_para3"><a name="07052377000110">My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel) made a powerful speech  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="23 May 2007">

<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2007 : Column 1390</b><br>
about the spectacular improvements in cancer care since the Government came to power. She was right to say that cancer affects every family in the country, including mine, which was affected by it only this year. One of the earliest targets that the Government set was on access to cancer services for people who have a suspected cancer. That is precisely the kind of target that the Opposition have been deriding and would remove. My hon. Friend was absolutely right to point to improvements in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="70523-0021.htm_para4"><a name="07052377000111">We next heard from the Tories&#146; self-appointed campaigner-in-chief, the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps). He began his speech by saying that money had been invested, improvements had been made and waiting times were down. I have only one thing to say to him: I thank him very much for his support this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="70523-0021.htm_para5"><a name="07052377000112">My hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) made important points about the NHS appointments process. He said that experience of politics and public life should not bar people from appointments, and I do not think that he will find any disagreement from Labour Members. He also said that services should be provided locally, and of course we agree with him on that, too. I can understand his frustration about the primary care trust changes, but they resulted in partnerships being more coterminous with local government, and that allows us to strengthen those partnerships across the country. On the issue of community action teams, he will know that a Cumbria-wide review is in preparation. The question of CAT services will be addressed as part of that review, which will be published in a few weeks&#146; time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="70523-0021.htm_para6"><a name="07052377000113">My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Austin) tied the shadow Health Secretary up in knots on the issue of health funding. It was a pleasure to watch, and the shadow Health Secretary completely failed to address my hon. Friend&#146;s points. The shadow Health Secretary said that the Tories had committed to the spending plan and would have invested the same amount as the Government did, but he conveniently forgot about the patient passport idea proposed by the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron). Had he forgotten about that?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman shakes his head; I think that he had forgotten. I am afraid that that idea would have taken money out of our national health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="70523-0021.htm_para7"><a name="07052377000116">Next, we heard from the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), who delivered a pious lecture, but a touch more humility might have been in order from that former Secretary of State for Health, because I have been reading his reviews from the time when he was Health Secretary. Let me read the headlines from his dying days in office: in January 1997, the <i> Daily Mirror</i> had the headlines &#147;400 kids turned away from intensive care&#148;, and &#147;two and a half days on a casualty department trolley&#148;. A third headline said, &#147;You&#146;re off your trolley, Minister&#151;NHS is in a critical condition&#148;. Those were the comments made when the right hon. Gentleman was Health Secretary. Those were the reviews, and these are the facts: when he left office, 286,000 people had been  <br>

waiting more than six months for NHS treatment and there was a large NHS deficit that was 1.5 per cent. of the total NHS budget. That is significantly larger than any deficit today. As I say, a touch more humility may have been in order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="70523-0021.htm_para8"><a name="07052377000117">The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire came here to throw stones, but let us take a little look at his performance. He will remember that I told the House a few weeks ago that an NHS trust had accused him of scaremongering when he said that its local accident and emergency department was to close. In fact, no such thing was true. Last week, he went further and put his name to a pitiful press release that claimed that official Department of Health guidance could lead to half of all accident and emergency departments being axed. Let me be absolutely clear: there is no such official Department of Health guidance. That announcement was about as well worked-out as the one that came out the same day&#151;that great Tory triumph&#151;on grammar schools. It was good of the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire to rush that rubbish out last Thursday to help the leader of his party out of a hole, but does he now accept that that embarrassing piece of tripe does not have any basis in fact whatsoever, so will he withdraw it? If you remember, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that is all part of the positive Tory NHS &#147;yes&#148; campaign which, in fact, is a nasty, negative campaign designed to scare the public and demoralise NHS staff. </p>

<p><a name="st_o501"><a name="07052377000118"><a name="70523-0021.htm_spnew2"><a name="07052377001230"><b>Mr. Lansley:</b>
 The Secretary of State confirmed earlier that she agrees with Sir George Alberti, as her aim is that accident and emergency departments across the country should have a catchment population of 450,000, with the implication that 92 A and E departments will close.</p>

<p><a name="st_o502"><a name="07052377000119"><a name="70523-0021.htm_spnew3"><a name="07052377001231"><b>Andy Burnham:</b>
 If the hon. Gentleman had been listening, he would know that my right hon. Friend had said that it was for specialist care. I repeat that there is no official Department of Health guidance on the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="70523-0021.htm_para9"><a name="07052377000120">How does the Labour Secretary of State&#146;s record compare with the record of Opposition Members? On my right hon. Friend&#146;s watch, waiting lists have fallen to their lowest ever level&#151;not just a low level, but the lowest ever level. Just 352 people have been waiting for more than six months, and the figures are falling further still in every English constituency represented in the House. She has had the political courage to take hard decisions to put the NHS back in financial balance, and it is on that platform that she laid out plans to invest an extra &#163;8 billion in the NHS this year. She is the first Secretary of State since the early 1990s to see MRSA rates fall after the inexorable rise that began under the previous Government, and that is something on which we want more progress. She has presided over continuing falls in death rates from cancer and coronary heart disease, thus saving lives up and down the country. Moreover, there has been no winter crisis on her watch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="70523-0021.htm_para10"><a name="07052377000121">I must tell the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire that the House fell about when, in response to my hon.

he was going to say &#147;global warming&#148;, but he did not. Let us look at my right hon. Friend&#146;s achievements. We have the lowest ever waiting lists. Is that luck? No, it is not. We have the best cancer care that the country has ever seen. Is that luck? I do not think so. We have the best health care system in the English-speaking world, as judged by the Commonwealth Fund in a report this week. Is that luck? I do not think so. It is a record of which she can be proud. Waiting lists, infection rates, death rates from cancer and coronary heart disease&#151;those are things that matter to the people who put us into office. They are the things on which every Secretary of State should be judged. It is a record of which she can be proud, and it is a record of which the Labour Government are proud. I urge the whole House to send those cocky Tories packing tonight.</p>

 I am delighted to have this opportunity to raise this rather complex and minor issue, except in the minds of dentists. That leads me to declare an interest: I am a very, very part-time dentist, but I take a considerable interest in endodontics. The reason for the debate is the letter sent by the chief dental officer for England last month to every dentist in England. I believe that a similar letter has gone out in the other countries of the United Kingdom. The letter stated that its intention was to</p>
<a name="70523-0022.htm_brev6"><a name="07052377001181"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;clarify the situation with regard to decontamination and reuse of instruments, especially those used in endodontic treatment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para7"><a name="07052377001134">That covers an area quite a lot broader than might at first appear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para8"><a name="07052377001135">Advice was given in the letter on having high standards of decontamination, which is good, logical and appropriate. A new point was introduced, however, which stated that</p>
<a name="70523-0022.htm_brev7"><a name="07052377001182"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;endodontic reamers and files are to be treated as single use.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para9"><a name="07052377001136">The advice was intended to stop the transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from carriers to non-carriers during endodontic treatment. To my surprise, it received a lot of coverage in the national media&#151;it must have been a quiet day. As patients tend to scare easily, especially in relation to dentistry, a little reassurance might help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para10"><a name="07052377001137">Variant CJD is an exceptionally rare but fatal human disease of the brain and nervous system. It was first discovered in 1996 and is considered to have originated in humans through the consumption of cattle infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy. By mid-2006, 265 people in the UK had either definitely or probably died from the disease. Iatrogenic transmission is considered to be a remote possibility via the prion protein on surgical&#151;especially stainless steel&#151;instruments. To add to the scare factor, I understand that in the last financial year more than 900,000 root treatments were conducted through the national health service in England alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para11"><a name="07052377001138">As well as looking at a number of papers dealing with the subject, I discussed the situation with Professor Hugh Pennington, a renowned expert in the field. He pointed out to me, reassuringly, that occurrences of the condition appeared to be diminishing, and said that, at a guess, there were perhaps 200 carriers in the United Kingdom out of a population of 60 million. The chances of being preceded into the dental surgery by one of those 200 are therefore fairly remote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para12"><a name="07052377001139">Professor Pennington made further reassuring points. He said there was no convincing evidence that vCJD had been iatrogenically transmitted to humans by surgical instruments. He thought that surgery was under some suspicion, but that that applied only to surgery on the central nervous system. Moreover, there was no evidence of iatrogenic transmission through dentistry at any time in the United Kingdom or, indeed, the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para13"><a name="07052377001140">As the Minister will know, the chief dental officer was concerned about the result of research involving  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="23 May 2007">

<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2007 : Column 1402</b><br>
mice and transmission from stainless steel endodontic instruments. That research prompted concern that the protein could be difficult to remove from stainless steel endodontic reamers and files, and hence could be iatrogenically transferred from one mouse to another. Professor Pennington considered that the normal dental wire brush cleaning, followed by autoclaving, would dramatically reduce the already tiny risk to any dental patient. However, the chief dental officer, acting on the precautionary principle, issued a warning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para14"><a name="07052377001141">As the Minister probably knows, endodontics&#151;tooth root filling or, in layman&#146;s terms, taking out the nerve&#151;are used as a means of preserving a tooth in its place in the jaw when it is dead or dying, or as a means of retaining or restoring a badly broken-down tooth. If the Minister does not follow that, the Chancellor will be able to explain, according to recent reports in the newspapers. The dentist locates the so-called nerve or pulp through the occlusal surface of the tooth using instruments such as diamond or tungsten carbide burs, often followed by stainless steel burs to locate the main pulp chamber. Further instruments, especially in the case of premolars and molars, are frequently used for location and opening of root canals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para15"><a name="07052377001142">Locating of the openings of the canals may be difficult and may involve specialist instruments, particularly endodontic Piezo ultrasound diamond and nickel titanium instruments. Traditionally, the cleaning of the canals is undertaken with stainless steel endodontic reamers and files. More recently, the profession has moved to the use of much improved rotary nickel titanium reamers. The manufacturers suggest that they should be used on up to 10 root canals&#151;which is just as well, as they are expensive. The advised limit is intended to reduce the risk of file separation in the canal. The alternative treatment of teeth clinically requiring root canal treatment because of disease is, of course, extraction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para16"><a name="07052377001144">Interestingly, a report in the <i> British Dental Journal</i> at the end of last month about a research programme on dental treatment and the risk of vCJD, involving examination of patients carrying the disease, concluded</p>
<a name="70523-0022.htm_brev8"><a name="07052377001183"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We did not find a statistically significant excess of vCJD associated with dental treatments with the exception of extractions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para17"><a name="07052377001145">Most instruments used for extractions are stainless steel. Incidentally, so are most dental instruments, all of which at some time or other will be contaminated with blood and potentially, in some cases of dental surgery or scaling, with oral tissue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para18"><a name="07052377001146">To give the Department of Health its due, I understand that it has been funding a research programme seeking a new method of prion decontamination. Last week&#151;the timing was brilliant&#151;the research produced, through a collaboration between D-Gen &amp; DuPont, a new prion disinfectant called Rely+On Prion Inactivator. Only DuPont could have come up with a name like that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para19"><a name="07052377001147">All those issues raise a number of questions. First, in the research on mice, was hypochlorite used, as in normal human etidodontics, as a lubricant and remover of protein tissue from instruments? Secondly, bearing in mind that stainless steel instruments are increasingly being replaced with nickel titanium, does the research on mice indicate that they as hard to clean of protein tissue as stainless steel? Thirdly, has use of the new prion inactivator been taken into account in  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="23 May 2007">

<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2007 : Column 1403</b><br>
the decision, or can it be now? Fourthly, in view of other research, why have endodontic files been specifically selected when many other surgical instruments, including other endodontic instruments, could technically be just as vulnerable?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para20"><a name="07052377001148">Fifthly, as national health service dentists keep asking, who will pay? Stainless steel reamers cost probably less than &#163;10 a pack. The cost of nickel titanium kits varies between &#163;35 and &#163;60 a kit. We must also consider endodontic instruments that enter and touch vital pulp tissue. A dentist who frequently searches for root canals might use one, two or three ultrasonic cutters in doing so, and they cost between &#163;70 and &#163;85 each. Endo-access kits&#151;to use the dental slang&#151;which have stainless steel burs as well as tungsten carbide ones and which frequently hit the pulp because they have to go through to find the chamber, cost &#163;40.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para21"><a name="07052377001149">Finally, as Professor Pennington agreed, the risks are infinitesimal. There are very few carriers. Sterilization techniques massively reduce what is already a very tiny risk to virtually no risk, especially if the new prion inactivator is used. Hence questions have to be asked about risk assessment and whether proportionality should be applied to the precautionary principle. In essence what I am asking is, can we have another think?</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) on securing the debate, and I pay tribute to all the dentists for their co-operation in implementing what is an important measure as part of the Government&#146;s precautionary actions to ensure the reduction of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease infection risks. The hon. Gentleman asked a number of questions on the research, and I hope he will accept that I do not know all the answers, but I would be happy to write to him with details on the procedures used in identifying the risk and other matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para22"><a name="07052377001151">I can assure the hon. Gentleman that in April the chief dental officer and colleagues in devolved Administrations looked carefully into what action needed to be taken. That was informed by the preliminary findings of research that was in progress at the Health Protection Agency, and it was also based on precautionary advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, which provides the Government with independent expert scientific advice on such matters as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, CJD and scrapie.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para23"><a name="07052377001152">SEAC issued its position statement on dentistry and endodontic treatment in May 2006. At that point, it concluded that it was unclear whether vCJD infectivity could be transmitted via endodontic files and reamers, but that given the plausibility of such a scenario and the large number of endodontic procedures undertaken annually, it would be prudent to consider restricting these instruments to single use as a precautionary measure. In addition, previous Department of Health advice on minimising the risk of vCJD transmission that was published in 1999 stated that where instruments are difficult to clean, consideration should be given to replacing them with single-use instruments. Owing to the difficulty in decontaminating endodontic files and reamers, making those instruments single use  <br>

would eliminate any potential risk. A number of dentists were already using single-use instruments for that reason.</p>

 What concerns dentists is that although stainless steel endodontic instruments have been specifically picked out, other endodontic instruments are involved and once one goes to single use of those the cost goes through the roof.</p>

<p><a name="st_o509"><a name="07052377001155"><a name="70523-0022.htm_spnew4"><a name="07052377002223"><b>Ms Winterton:</b>
 I shall say more about costs and further work later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para25"><a name="07052377001156">The Department has now received some early findings from the Health Protection Agency from research on mice, which is still in progress. I will write to the hon. Gentleman with some of the details that he requested. The early findings suggest that infectivity can be found in several dental tissues and support the possibility that endodontic files and reamers could pose an effective route for transmission of vCJD. Therefore, the findings at this stage support SEAC&#146;s view that these instruments should be restricted to single use on a precautionary basis in order to reduce any potential risk of transmission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para26"><a name="07052377001157">After we had obtained the advice from the HPA, we considered that it would be prudent to act immediately on SEAC&#146;s precautionary advice to make endodontic files and reamers single use. That decision was supported by both the HPA and SEAC. The studies are ongoing and I will give the hon. Gentleman as much information as I can, but I have to say that some of the studies will be subject to peer review before publication. I am sure that he will appreciate the need for that added check.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para27"><a name="07052377001158">The hon. Gentleman mentioned some of the concerns about cost implications for those dentists who were not already using single-use instruments. That is a complex area and one that we could not address fully when the announcement was made. The paramount concern at that point was to act swiftly and responsibly in terms of safeguarding public health. However, we have now analysed the cost implications in more detail and we will issue advice to primary care trusts this week on how to recognise some of those additional costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para28"><a name="07052377001159">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the data show that the incidence of root canal treatments is variable. Our figures show that a typical dentist carries out only about 25 root canal treatments a year. For those dentists, the additional costs, which I will detail later, will be marginal and could well be offset by other expenses moving in the opposite direction. We have to be clear about how to approach the issue of expenses that are paid to dentists. We cannot make adjustments every time for different costs that might occur for one instrument as opposed to another. It would be difficult to do that on a yearly basis, so there will be swings and roundabouts in the costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para29"><a name="07052377001160">However, a minority of dentists carry out more treatments. About 10 per cent. of dentists carry out an average of 180 treatments a year. Even for those dentists, it is important not to exaggerate the additional costs. As the hon. Gentleman suggested, some of the cost estimates have tended to focus on the use of the more expensive nickel titanium instruments, but the evidence from suppliers is that stainless steel instruments make up some 70 to 80 per cent. of the market. Many cost estimates have also ignored the extent to which the previous multi-use instruments had to be replaced; and, importantly, following the announcement dental suppliers have responded swiftly by making single-use instruments available at much lower prices than before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para30"><a name="07052377001161">The Department of Health is also working with NHS Supply Chain&#151;an NHS-based purchasing initiative&#151;to enable NHS dentists to take advantage of the significant buying power of the NHS, which should also result in lower expenses across the board. Information from dental suppliers indicates that dentists have responded in a very professional manner to the announcement and are now ordering sufficient quantity of these instruments to enable them to be treated as single use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="70523-0022.htm_para31"><a name="07052377001162">Taking all those factors into account, our best estimate is that practitioners undertaking 25 treatments a year are likely to incur additional costs of about &#163;80 on average per year. Practitioners undertaking 180 treatments a year will, we think, incur additional costs of about &#163;1,000 per year.

 The key point is where we draw the line on what an endodontic instrument is. If we restrict the definition to reamers and files, the figures seem right.
