On Monday, the right hon. and learned Lady claimed that the majority of the Bills in the Queen's Speech would become law before the next election. We have an absolute maximum of 70 sitting days before Dissolution, and we need to set aside time for debates on the pre-Budget report, as well as ensuring that we have time to discuss other issues, such as Afghanistan. Given all that, does the right hon. and learned Lady still stand by her original claim, or will she admit that there may be difficulties in fulfilling the Government's commitments? Given the limited time we have left, recess dates have an added significance, so is the right hon. and learned Lady still encountering problems in coming up with a date for the Easter recess?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="91119-0001.htm_para17"><a name="09111936000043">On Kelly, the Government are mired in confusion, with different Ministers saying different things. On the radio this morning, the Leader of the House said that all the proposals would be implemented before the general election, but that will not happen unless we move quickly, so can she confirm that if we table the amendments to the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill necessary to implement Kelly in full, we shall have the Government's support?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="91119-0001.htm_para18"><a name="09111936000044">On the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, can the right hon. and learned Lady tell us when she intends to table the motion on the appointment of Professor Sir Ian Kennedy? At the last business questions, on 5 November, I was told that it would be done "within a few days". Since then, we have heard nothing. The Government's handling of the issue is beginning to look dysfunctional. Why has the timetable been allowed to slip?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="91119-0001.htm_para19"><a name="09111936000045">Can the right hon. and learned Lady give an indication of when the House will get a chance to debate and vote on the imminent report from the Committee on Reform of the House of Commons?

It is important that the House continues to be given time to discuss our commitment, and to probe the Government's strategy. Last week, newspaper reports suggested that the Government would be investing in new Chinook helicopters and that an announcement would be made before the pre-Budget report. Can the right hon. and learned Lady provide any further details about the plans of the Ministry of Defence?</p>

Everyone knows that departmental spending has to be reduced by 10 per cent. according to the Government's own reckoning, yet on Tuesday it emerged that the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families had made an unsolicited demand for an extra Â£2.6 billion for his Department's budget, forcing the Chancellor to admit that he was not undertaking a spending review at all. The Government have just published a Bill promising to halve the deficit, but is it not clear that the Chancellor has lost control over his colleagues' spending habits, and is the abandonment of a spending review not further evidence that the Government are putting their own interests above those of the country?</p>

 I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his generous comments on my receiving the parliamentarian of the year award from <i> The Spectator</i>. I have to confess that it was a great surprise to me. Over the years, <i> The Spectator</i> has called me many things but they have not approximated to parliamentarian of the year. I am not actually going to subscribe to the publication, but I shall offer some of its columnists a course at my institute for political correctness, which some of them could probably do with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="91119-0001.htm_para22"><a name="09111936000049">As far as the legislative programme is concerned, the House knows that it is the Government's responsibility to bring before the House the laws that we think are necessary. We have introduced proposals for laws to deal with the financial situation facing the country, and to improve public services. It is the responsibility of the House to scrutinise those proposals. Obviously, given the forthcoming general election, some Bills may well receive full consideration in one House but only a Second Reading in the other, and so might go into what is described as the wash-up; they will then have to be the subject of negotiation between the parties, instead of receiving the full scrutiny of the Houses. That situation obtains before every general election. It would certainly not be right to step back from our responsibilities of government; we have to introduce a legislative programme and put before the House laws that we believe are in the interests of this country. The Easter recess will be announced in due course in the usual way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="91119-0001.htm_para23"><a name="09111936000050">On the Kelly situation, I want to reassure the House and the right hon. Gentleman, and ensure that the public are reassured, that we all remain determined to address the problems around allowances. We recognise the public anger and concern that the allowance system was misused, which is why we legislated in the summer to put the whole system on an independent footing, so that never again will the House set or administer its own allowance system. We invited Sir Christopher Kelly to investigate and make proposals for a new framework for allowances, and I pay tribute to him for the work that he has done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="91119-0001.htm_para24"><a name="09111936000051">I should like to reinforce what I said on 4 November: we, and all parties, accept Sir Christopher Kelly's report and look to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority to implement it. I did say at the time that there were further issues that it might fall to the House to deal with; they include the issue of additional lay members on the Standards and Privileges Committee, common auditing arrangements between the independent parliamentary standards commissioner and the House, and restricting the chair of IPSA to serving for one five-year term. We can, incidentally, do the latter by resolution of the House, when we confirm-as I hope that we will-the chair's appointment. When the House deals with the motion appointing the chair, it might be a good opportunity to deal with the other four members of IPSA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="91119-0001.htm_para25"><a name="09111936000052">As I say, by means of a resolution of the House we can, without legislation, make sure that the post is held for one term only, as Sir Christopher Kelly proposes. He himself says that legislation on the issue of the dual mandate should be a matter for the next Parliament. If there are any other issues that hon. Members feel cannot be dealt with by the House through a resolution, or by the existing powers of IPSA, I will be happy to discuss them, as I said on 4 November. However, I do not want  <br>

anybody to convey to the public the idea that we are all on the back foot on the issue-that we have gone soft on it and have swept it back under the carpet. The public would not accept that, and neither would we. We will make sure that the reforms are all carried through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="91119-0001.htm_para26"><a name="09111936000053">I am grateful to the Wright Committee on Reform of the House of Commons, which was established by a resolution of the House. Its members have been hard at work, and I look forward to its report next Tuesday. We will all want an opportunity to consider its recommendations, which will represent important opportunities to strengthen the role of the House, and we will need to ensure an opportunity for the House to debate, and act on, that report.</p>
<a name="09111936000838">
<p>Issues relating to Afghanistan are bound to be raised on Monday, when the Secretary of State for Defence and the Foreign Secretary speak in the Queen's Speech debate. As the matter was raised the last time that we had business questions, I know that there is a concern that there should be a specific, discrete debate on Afghanistan, and I will keep that matter very much under review. As for Secretaries of State making unsolicited demands of the Treasury for extra money, the right hon. Gentleman knows only too well that that is absolutely par for the course.</p>

 Enthusiasm for the fantasy Queen's Speech is obviously shared by Members from the right hon. and learned Lady's party, who are here in such great numbers today. The reality is that, whatever she says about the wash-up-and I understand how the term applies in this instance-almost all these measures will not make it through their parliamentary stages. Those that do will be abracadabra Bills: measures that-shazam!-at a stroke halve the fiscal deficit; and-shazam!-at a stroke abolish poverty throughout the world. That is fantasy politics, and we recognise it as such.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="91119-0001.htm_para27"><a name="09111936000055">Meanwhile, in the real world, we still have Afghanistan. I hear the Lord Privy Seal say that she is considering a debate, but we need a debate in this House on Afghanistan, and on the political as well as the military aspects of the situation. I see that the week after next, we are to have a debate about fisheries, which is an important subject, but not as important to this country as what is happening in Afghanistan, so will she look again at that programme?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="91119-0001.htm_para28"><a name="09111936000056">I listened to what the right hon. and learned Lady said about Kelly, but I still believe that there is a need for statutory changes. Will she meet the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) and me, so that we can discuss what needs to be introduced? Can she assure me that she will not use the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill as a vehicle for those changes; or, if she does, that she will extend the period of scrutiny to enable it to be done properly?</p>

Many of us are very vague about what exactly assistant Regional Ministers might be for, and about their role; but I am indebted to the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack), who last Thursday raised the fact that the assistant Minister for Yorkshire and the Humber asked a question of the Minister for Yorkshire and the Humber about the work of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in the region. We have a situation in which one Minister asks another about matters that are their ministerial responsibility. Is that proper parliamentary scrutiny?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a mistake when he describes the legislation that we introduced in the Queen's Speech as "fantasy politics" and "abracadabra Bills". The Crime and Security Bill, which gives the police more powers to deal with gangs, is necessary, and I hope that he and his hon. Friends will support it. The Energy Bill and the Flood and Water Management Bill, which has already received extensive scrutiny, are not abracadabra Bills; they are necessary Bills, as are the Equality Bill and the Financial Services Bill. Hon. Members need to be clear: are they saying that all those Bills, which will tackle the problems of the economy and improve public services, are not necessary? We believe that the economy needs to be stabilised and that there needs to be further improvement in public services. Legislation is not the be-all and end-all, but it is an important part of the story.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="91119-0001.htm_para33"><a name="09111936000062">I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's point about the need for extra, focused debating time on Afghanistan, and I shall keep that under close review. He suggests that that debate should take place instead of the fisheries debate, but the fisheries debate is a regular event, and hon. Members whose constituencies very much depend on the fishing industry would take it amiss if we suddenly pulled the plug on the fisheries debate. However, I do recognise his point about Afghanistan.</p>

I will give the hon. Gentleman one example of where Sir Christopher Kelly thought that a statute would be necessary-the prohibition on employing family members. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority does not need to have a legal right to bar the employment of family members, because MPs can employ whoever they want to employ, but it can say, "We will not reimburse-pay out of public funds-anybody who is a member of that MP's family." By imposing a condition, it can ensure that it effects and implements that part of Sir Christopher Kelly's report. Additional legislation is not needed,  <br>

because the legislation that we passed in the House to set up IPSA gives it the power to lay down conditions on how it pays out allowances. I am more than happy for the hon. Gentleman to come and see me to go through the list of things that are ancillary to the main structure of allowances that Sir Christopher Kelly proposed. I know that Sir Christopher has already met up with IPSA's chair designate, and they are at work on implementing the whole Kelly framework and package on allowances.</p>

All the things that have been said about the personal care at home Bill were said about the national health service. People have said that it cannot be done; we said, yes, it can be done, and it is necessary.

Will the shadow Leader of the House encourage his friend the Leader of the Opposition, the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) to attend such a debate, and explain whether his enthusiasm for the retrospective aspects of Legg and the Kelly report's eventual ending of all claims for mortgage interest repayments could be combined by his offering to repay all his substantial claims for interest over many years, which would, in turn-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

 It is important that Sir Thomas Legg can get on with his work. It is also important for the public to be able to see that every single claim made by Members of the House over the past five years has been gone through with a fine-toothed comb and to see that any overpayments, even those made by mistake, are paid back, so that we can turn and face them and say, "Any over-claiming has been dealt with and it's all been paid back."</p>

They should be looked at as a package and accepted as a package, and sent forward to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority to implement. I do not think the public want to see us going through the proposals and deciding which allowance will go, which will stay, which will be raised and which will be lowered-I think they want to see that done independently and any overpayments paid back. We are accountable to the public in the House of Commons and we should recognise that that is the feeling of public concern.</p>

The debate she has proposed for 1 December is going to be crucial, as the European Scrutiny Committee has said. Does she accept that it is absolutely essential that we have a proper, substantive motion that is capable of amendment, so that we can ensure that majority voting and co-decision arrangements, and the power and jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, do not dictate to us the manner in which our financial services are run in future?</p>

 It is common currency that, regrettably, this Parliament is very discredited and has become irrelevant to too many of our constituents. We have the Select Committee on Reform of the House of Commons, IPSA and the flawed constitutional reform committee, and we are only a few months away from a general election, yet today only three Labour Back Benchers are bothering to ask the Leader of the House questions. Yesterday we had empty Benches behind the Prime Minister. Can we have a debate on the relevance of Parliament, so that we can bring everything together and make this place the bastion of parliamentary democracy and democracy for our people, instead of the flawed and damaged institution that it has become?</p>

 When I was in opposition for many years, I never came to this House, elected by my constituents, to say from the Opposition Benches that I was irrelevant, or that the work I did was irrelevant. I put it back to the hon. Gentleman that he has been elected by his constituents. That is a massive honour and a massive privilege. He comes to the House of Commons and he can hold Ministers to account and add to the debate. Therefore, he should not talk himself into irrelevance. If he does, he will be doing his constituents a disservice.</p>

 Pursuant to that last question, may I remind the Leader of the House that the Committee on Reform of the House of Commons was established precisely to address people's perception that this House is not doing its job of scrutinising Government business properly? Given her answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)-that she could give no guarantees about how the results of the Committee's work would be dealt with-let me return to the point made by my right hon. Friend the shadow Leader of the House that it would be appropriate to make a statement on the publication of the report next Tuesday. We will have time to read it before she stands up to make it, as the report is to be published in the middle of the night. We look forward to the Government responding to proposals about how Government business can be much better scrutinised, so could the Leader of the House tell us how she will respond to the Committee's findings? I remind her that she had to withdraw her original motion.</p>

 I would never argue for complacency. We can always improve the processes of this House and modernise the way in which it does its business. Of course we should keep the issues under active review and make changes where necessary. In the meantime, however, we should not declare our work to be irrelevant, because that would be wrong. Part of the purpose of being a Member of Parliament is to do our job and continue to improve this institution. I said when I was first elected that it is a great and important responsibility to be a Member of Parliament. I came into Parliament  <br>

 Can we have a debate on the responsibilities of banks in which the Government are the main shareholder to support small businesses? For example, the Bank of Scotland has withdrawn the post of business relationship manager from its branch on the island of Islay, causing widespread anger among businesses on the island. A manager based on the mainland will never understand the unique circumstances of an island economy. Surely the Chancellor, as the main shareholder in the bank, has a responsibility to ensure that it services businesses throughout the country, so will he intervene in that case?</p>

 Hi! It is a great honour to open this debate on Her Majesty's Gracious Speech, the fifth and last of this Parliament. This Gracious Speech is based on the firm belief that the Government have a vital role to play in securing economic prosperity and building a fair society, with measures to secure our economic recovery and financial responsibility; to renew our democracy and this Parliament through political and constitutional reform; to continue, as we are debating today, our investment and reform of public services-in health, with a new series of powerful patient rights and wider provision of free personal care as a stepping-stone to the creation of the first ever national care service, and in education, with every pupil and every parent to be guaranteed a good local school, a balanced curriculum, tough home-school agreements and discipline and catch-up support for those who fall behind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="91119-0003.htm_para32"><a name="09111936000162">These clear entitlements and guarantees are essential for a strong economy and a fair society in which everyone accepts their responsibilities. They are possible only now because of our sustained investment and reform over the past 12 years. They are tailored to the needs of individual families; they are led locally by doctors, nurses, teachers and head teachers, with Government stepping in only as a last resort. These guarantees are all actively opposed by the Conservatives and would not appear in any Queen's Speech introduced by Her Majesty's Opposition.</p>

 I know that there is some history behind that intervention and meetings with the Schools Minister have taken place on these matters. It is important that local authorities are leaders in their commissioning role in their local areas, but in doing so they must ensure that they put the best interests of pupils and parents first and consult widely. I have to say that no Conservative authority in the country needs to be at all embarrassed about guarantees to ensure good local schools and catch-up tuition. If local authorities are not embarrassed by matching those pledges, why is the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) so embarrassed by the idea of these pledges and guarantees? It is very hard to understand.</p>

 I shall come on to the detail of all the guarantees in a moment, but on that particular one, we are announcing today that we have reformed the primary curriculum. We have also reformed the key stage 3 curriculum for 11 to 14-year-olds to make sure that there is teacher discretion, while ensuring at the same time that all schools are delivering a balanced curriculum. That is there in the guarantees and I would have thought that the hon. Gentleman would welcome it.</p>

 My constituency has historically had low income, low aspiration and low educational achievement. As a result of the sustained investment going into our local schools there has been a huge improvement, but it still lags behind the national average. Will my right hon. Friend assure me that the measures in the Queen's Speech will go a long way to addressing the social and economic issues that hinder a child's educational performance to complement the investment that we have put into teachers and the bricks and mortar of the schools?</p>

 I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend. It is not good enough for a parent to know that in their area the average child is doing well or that most schools are doing well; what the parent wants to know is that their child is getting support and their school will be improved. That is what we guarantee in the Children, Schools and Families Bill with powers to step in if it is not happening. That is what parents want-not a free market free-for-all, which is what the Conservatives are proposing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="91119-0004.htm_para2"><a name="09111936000172">Let us be clear that none of these guarantees could have been delivered or even promised with any credibility back in 1997 because we inherited a school system and national health service that had been subject to underinvestment for decades. Let us not forget that in 1995 it was a Conservative Government who introduced and then failed to deliver an 18-month target for NHS waiting lists-<i> [Interruption.] </i>Yes, it was an 18-month, not 18-week, target that they introduced but failed to deliver in 1995. In education, too, in 1997, we had leaking roofs, pupils using photocopied textbooks, a teaching profession demoralised, a third of 11-year-olds leaving primary school not secure in the basics and half of our secondary schools not even reaching the basic benchmark of 30 per cent. gaining five good GCSEs, including English and maths.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="91119-0004.htm_para3"><a name="09111936000173">The fact is that over the past 12 years we have had over 80,000 more doctors, 40,000 more nurses and 100 new hospitals. We are not failing to meet an 18-month waiting list target; we are delivering an 18-week target nationally. That is what our investment and reform have delivered. As for schools, we have 40,000 more teachers, more than 180,000 teaching assistants, 4,000 new or refurbished schools-the biggest school building programme since the Victorian era-and over 100,000  <br>

more children leaving primary school secure in the basics. Under the Conservatives, one in two schools did not make the grade. Now, just one in 12 do not make the grade. We will get there by 2011, because this party does not want a free market free-for-all. What we want is for every child to deliver in every school. That is our record.</p>

 I wonder whether the Secretary of State is as concerned as I am about the fact that the number of children in poverty has risen each year for the past three years, and the fact that the gap between children receiving free school meals and those from wealthier backgrounds has not narrowed under the current Government. May I put it to him that, rather than trying to find political dividing lines, he should try to make common cause with those of us on both sides of the House who wish to see disadvantage tackled and not used as a political football?</p>

 I fear that the hon. Gentleman is as confused as the Conservatives' Front-Bench spokesman. Yesterday on the "Today" programme, the hon. Member for Surrey Heath began an interview at 7.10 am by saying that our Child Poverty Bill was a gimmick and a political device. By 7.15 am, he was saying that he would support it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="91119-0004.htm_para4"><a name="09111936000176">The fact is that between 1979 and 1997 child poverty doubled. The fact is that over the past 12 years the number of children in poverty has fallen by more than 600,000. We will do more. What I want is a cross-party consensus that child poverty should be eradicated. If the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) is willing to join that consensus, he should know that it is not about political dividing lines, but about Governments' delivering fairness and equality. He should be supporting that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="91119-0004.htm_para5"><a name="09111936000177">I know that Opposition Members find this very difficult, particularly the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. At every stage, his approach to our more teachers, more investment and raising of standards is to run down the achievements of teachers, head teachers and our young people each year. Every few weeks, we hear a repetition of the usual litany from the hon. Gentleman. He comes along to the House, reads out what he calls our Mickey Mouse test questions in GCSE exams, and tries to use them in order to demonstrate that there has been dumbing down, that the exams are too easy, and that there is no rigour in our state education system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="91119-0004.htm_para6"><a name="09111936000178">I have to say that that is total and absolute nonsense. I have been checking exam papers over the last few weeks. I had a look at the GCSE additional science and biology paper. First question, first page:</p>

The third question comes from the mathematics exam, GCSE, June 2008: "Work out 33/4 minus 1" Does the hon. Gentleman want to try? I asked the Minister for Schools and Learners a moment ago. He worked it out as two and seven twentieths.. I do hope that he is right. The Minister for Further Education, Skills, Apprenticeships and Consumer Affairs checked it as well, and he says that that is the right answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="91119-0004.htm_para10"><a name="09111936000182">Hard questions, Mr. Speaker-hard questions in tough exams in which our young people are doing very well. But I have to say that there is one question to which I do know the answer. Why are more young people leaving school with good grades? It is not because there is dumbing down and the exams are getting easier; it is because of the hard work of pupils and parents and teachers and head teachers, and the investment and reform that the hon. Gentleman's party has opposed consistently over the past 12 years.</p>

 I have listened to the Secretary of State's end-of-the-pier turns with great interest, but he is being very partisan. We want to be constructive. Indeed, the whole country wants us to be constructive on the important issue of education. He has tried to entertain us, but we need some facts. Let me give him some.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="91119-0004.htm_para11"><a name="09111936000184">More than 50 per cent. of pupils are still not obtaining five good GCSEs including English and maths. Given that all those pupils have been educated entirely under a Labour Government, will the Government accept that their policies have failed and that head teachers and teachers must be given more trust and freedom to be able to raise standards for the whole country?</p>

 I will come on to discuss the free market-and actually, when we look into the detail, rather interesting-policies of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, but as the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Evennett) raises the issue, let me say that, yes, I am not satisfied, because 50 per cent. of pupils getting five good GCSEs including English and maths is not good enough, but the proportion was not 50 per cent. in 1997; it was a third of pupils-about 33 or 34 per cent.-12 years ago. We have made real progress with investment and reform; there are rising standards and more good teachers. The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford should be backing our reforms and proposals, rather than trying to run them down for party political and partisan reasons, contrary to the facts and the reality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="91119-0004.htm_para12"><a name="09111936000186">The Leader of the Opposition said yesterday that he was embarrassed-that we were trying to embarrass him. There is nothing embarrassing in this Conservative Front-Bench team saying, "We will guarantee parents and pupils a good school." There is nothing embarrassing in it saying, "For 16-year-olds, we will guarantee a school, college or apprenticeship place." The reason why the hon. Member for Surrey Heath is embarrassed is that the shadow Chancellor will not let him make the pledge. That is why under a Tory Government there would be young people leaving school and not getting a school, college or apprenticeship place. That is why he is embarrassed. Conservative Back Benchers should not be embarrassed, however; they should be pressing their Front-Bench team to get in the real world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="91119-0004.htm_para13"><a name="09111936000187">The reality is that we are the party that is more ambitious. We are the ones who, on this track record, want to do more. We know that we need excellence for all, rather than just some, children in our schools and school system. The only way to do that-as the Bill, which the Conservative party should support, sets out-is on the basis of investing in public services and having clear entitlements for public service users. It also involves backing local leaders-the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford mentioned this-to deliver services by devolving power, responsibility and accountability, and matching that with stronger accountability through the report card, as well as, where needed and as a last resort, not leaving things to the free market free-for-all, but stepping in and demanding the best for every pupil in every school. That is what our guarantees are all about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="91119-0004.htm_para14"><a name="09111936000188">Let me say something about health, which will also be debated over the course of today. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health is now proposing to back patients by turning targets into entitlements-an entitlement for all NHS patients to start treatment within 18 weeks, for them to see a cancer specialist within two weeks when referred by their GP, and where that is not possible, for the NHS to take all steps to find an alternative provider. He is also proposing a new legal right to an NHS health check every five years for 40 to 74-year-olds, and to lay the foundations for a national care service, starting with free personal care for those with the greatest needs. Those are guarantees which, aside from the political games being played, will have families in homes around the country saying, "Yes, that is what we want." That is what a Labour Government will deliver.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="91119-0004.htm_para16"><a name="09111936000192">We will now enshrine in law our guarantees to pupils and parents. They include providing catch-up help for any child who falls behind in reading, writing or maths during primary school and, for any child not getting to level 4, an entitlement to 10 hours one-to-one or small group tuition in year 7, with a report to parents at the end of year 7. That is not a gimmick; it is a real and tangible guarantee, which should be supported by any party that wants to invest in education for all children, rather than just some. Secondly-</p>

 In a moment. Secondly, there will be a personal tutor for every secondary school pupil, who will be a point of contact for the pupil and their parent throughout their time in secondary school. There will also be strong and effective discipline through tough home-school agreements so every family knows their responsibilities and schools have the power to take action to deliver discipline where needed. There is also-I have mentioned this before-our September guarantee  <br>

to school leavers, and now our new January guarantee of a place in education, which we will deliver and the Conservative party would deny. That is not politics; it is about the lives of young people. It is about their chance of having a job, a career or an apprenticeship, which we will invest in and the Conservative party wants to cut. That is the reality.</p>

I could not begin even to unpack that analogy, let alone know what the hell it means. What I would say is that we and Lord Lipsey are both clear that we want decent care for people in their homes. We will deliver it because we will invest in resources. The Opposition would not deliver it because they would cut resources; that is the difference.</p>

We expect in the vast majority of cases the concerns of parents, if they arise, to be resolved at school level, and that is an issue for personal tutors, heads and governors, with the parents. We legislated in the last Session for the seeking of redress, as a last resort, from the local government ombudsman. I would like to make it clear that, for any parent who is entitled to catch-up tuition for their child and is not getting it, we are announcing today that local authorities will have a duty to ensure that there is alternative provision outside the school, if that is needed, to get a child on track. Parents want tough discipline and to know that if their child falls behind, they will get the help. We will guarantee that, and as I said, there should be a consensus on this matter.</p>

We will put the wider elements of personal, social and health education on a statutory footing, guaranteeing for the first time that all children are receiving sex and relationship education, with the parental opt-out lowered to 15. We will make the process of establishing an academy easier and reduce bureaucracy, so that all academies are guaranteed charitable status, and we will introduce a new registration system for home educators.

Because parents are clear that they want to know how their children and local primary schools are doing, I have announced in a written statement this morning that, following the recommendation of our expert group on assessment, we are, of course, retaining key stage 2 tests in English and maths, and I have today approved the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency's choice of the preferred test operator-Edexcel-to deliver English and maths tests for 11-year-olds in 2010. We will also-again, implementing the recommendations of the expert group-publish teacher assessment data for pupils in year 6 alongside those externally marked tests, and from 2011 we will introduce a new form of local moderation of teacher assessment as we build confidence in teacher assessment, alongside that objective information for parents.</p>

In such circumstances, parents are right to say that they want action, which is why in this Bill we will provide stronger powers for parents to demand change from local areas.

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="91119-0005.htm_para1"><a name="09111936000210">As I said, that has delivered huge results. In 1997, more than 1,600 schools were not meeting the basic benchmark-that was what we inherited-but 638 schools were doing so when we launched our national challenge two years ago and as a result of Â£400 million of money that we are investing the figure is now 270. We are not now talking about one in two, but one in 12 and we will get the number down to zero by 2011. My message to the small number of councils that do not act and drag their feet is that there is no excuse for that and we must improve every school in every area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="91119-0005.htm_para2"><a name="09111936000211">We are clear that that improvement must be led by the schools themselves, local commissioners must step in where action is not being taken and we have powers and are taking further powers to demand that they act where progress is not being made. In July, when we published the White Paper, I told the House that I was concerned about school improvement in Leicester, Blackpool and Gloucestershire, and I asked independent expert advisers to report on what more could be done. Today, I have accepted and published the reports on Blackpool and Gloucestershire, where, with the full agreement of those local authorities, we are now moving ahead on school improvement, new academies and new national challenge trusts. We will receive the reports on Leicester, Kent and Suffolk shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="91119-0005.htm_para3"><a name="09111936000212">In addition, the Minister for Schools and Learners has today written tailored letters to a further 30 local authorities, which contain 38 national challenge schools where we are concerned that the action we want is not being taken. We have particular concerns about four of those 30 and we will need to know that there is a plan in place by Christmas. If there is not, we will use the powers that will commence in January to demand improvement in those schools and we will expect the local authority to issue a warning notice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="91119-0005.htm_para4"><a name="09111936000213">We are also particularly concerned about progress in Dudley, where there were plans for an academy but for some reason that I do not fully understand the Conservative administration in that local authority has decided that an academy may not be the right approach to take. I am sending in an expert adviser to see what has happened, what has gone wrong, who has been advising the local authority on its plans, whether the authority is getting the wrong advice and whether, in fact, we should be moving forward with this. We will see what the expert adviser tells us when a report is made to us by Christmas. If the hon. Member for Surrey Heath wishes to clarify the point, I would be happy to take an intervention now.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman shouts from a sedentary position that the gap has widened, but that is categorically untrue-the gap has narrowed over the past 12 years. We need to look at the facts, about which my hon. Friend was right. In 1997, half the secondary schools were below the benchmark, but two thirds of the pupils in those schools came from areas of below average income. Children from low-income families in lower-income areas were disproportionately losing out from Conservative education policy. Not only have we acted at the school level, but we are now saying that any child who falls behind will get extra help. That is the only way to close those gaps in attainment. It is a scar on our society, as it has been for generations, that children in poor areas do less well. The gap is narrowing, although there is more to do, but it will not narrow if we go back to the policies that we had before 1997-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> It is narrowing.</p>

In the case of Dudley, we are now sending in the national adviser with the agreement of Dudley council. I am grateful for the council's support. We are working with Conservative councils, Labour councils and Liberal councils across the country to introduce academies and national challenge trusts: Labour councils such as Nottingham, Salford and Hackney; Conservative councils such as East Sussex and Coventry; we even have a Liberal council working with us in Hull, which is a great thing to see.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that Opposition Members frequently do not represent the sort of constituencies that we represent? They therefore do not have an understanding that some parents are incapable of helping their children, sometimes because they are on drugs and sometimes because they simply do not have any English. We do not want that sort of situation, but we are in it, and I do not think that there is a magic-wand solution to it. Some of our schools are doing wonderful work with these children. I have three schools where 95 per cent. of pupils enter without a word of English, yet many of those kids are ready to take A-levels at 18. We have to look for value added, and these are very difficult circumstances.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The only way to deal with this is to start with the earliest years. That is why investment in Sure Start is so important and why we have to engage parents early in primary and secondary school. As I know, because my hon. Friend and I have visited schools together, that means getting the parents involved and sometimes helping them with their learning, and also saying to every parent, "You have to face up to your responsibilities and support your child." If we do that, we can make great progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="91119-0005.htm_para9"><a name="09111936000229">It is true that more Labour Members have more experience of those challenges and difficulties. I thought the Leader of the Opposition was very candid yesterday when he said there were almost no Conservative voters in the whole city of Glasgow. That is probably true of a number of inner-city areas around the country-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I apologise; let me set the record straight. There were actually 95 supporters of the Conservative party in Glasgow, North-East. I apologise to the <i> Hansard </i>writers for that slip and I am pleased to clarify it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="91119-0005.htm_para10"><a name="09111936000230">I said earlier that these guarantees are not being supported by those who sit on the Opposition Front Bench. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) has made it clear that he opposes our 18-week guarantee and our commitment to allow patients to see a cancer specialist in two weeks. I believe that for about an hour and a half yesterday the shadow Chief Secretary said that the Conservative party would back the two-week guarantee but was then reoriented over the course of the afternoon and came back into line, I would guess after a conversation with the shadow Chancellor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="91119-0005.htm_para11"><a name="09111936000231">I have to say that I am puzzled; why are the Conservatives not supporting these guarantees? Why are they giving in to those with vested interests and to GPs, rather than putting the interests of patients first? After all, the Leader of the Opposition said that he supports the NHS. He even elevated it to a cast-iron guarantee-or should I say an "iron-cast guarantee" as I am on the Government Benches? Whatever; he will drop it soon. We know how worthless cast-iron guarantees are from the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

Member for Surrey Heath was listed as a supporter of a book published last year called "The Plan" written by Mr. Hannan and the hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell).

The way to transform an atom into an ion is by adding or taking away an electron. As my hon.

Early in the morning of 15 June this year, on Radio Five Live, the Secretary of State promised a real-terms increase in spending on health and in his Department after 2011. Later that same morning, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury told journalists that there would be no such rises, and that the Secretary of State could not make that promise. At lunchtime, however, the Secretary of State was back, this time on Radio 4-moving upmarket. He again promised those same real-terms rises, but when he was told what the Treasury had said the Balls balloon quickly became deflated.</p>

 The crucial thing is that the Secretary of State has not committed to a real-terms increase because the Chancellor of the Exchequer will not let him. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary have been perfectly clear: the Secretary of State is not authorised to make such promises. I notice that when the Secretary of State asked his question, he used the conditional. He was not so hesitant before. He was absolutely adamant that spending would increase-until he was slapped down by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

After that period of silence-I think welcomed by the nation-came to an end in September, he shared his thinking with <i> The</i><i> Sunday Times.</i> On 20 September, in an interview with Isabel Oakeshott and Jonathan Oliver, he promised not spending increases but spending cuts:</p>

 Around the country, we have seen the emergence of a few super-heads, who run two or three secondary schools.

 I am in favour of super-everything. If schools wish to federate, I am all in favour of the idea that they have an executive head who can help to co-ordinate their efforts-someone such as Dan Moynihan, for example, who does such a brilliant job for the Harris group of academies, which I am sure the hon. Gentleman admires. Dan Moynihan does a wonderful job, but the point is, as he said, that he does it in tandem with great school leaders, great deputy heads and great heads of department.

There are up to 50,000 students who do not have funding for their places this year. Most schools and colleges will not want to turn those students away, but to take them on those institutions have to cut their funding even more.

Indeed, it is striking that the Government have so little support: the only people on their Benches are Parliamentary Private Secretaries and the Chairman of the Select Committee on Children, Schools and Families.

The Prime Minister said that, by adding 45,000 places, the new guarantee would build on the 55,000 places that the September guarantee funded, making 100,000. The truth, however, is that there are many more than 100,000 young people in need of a place at college.</p>

barren they are. More and more parents every year signal that they are unhappy with schools, and we propose radical change to give them more choice. Let me tell the House what the Government propose. In the schools White Paper, they state:</p>

When the plan is produced, it might include proposals for federating schools, expanding some schools, even opening new schools-or perhaps none of the above, because there is no requirement on the local authority to do anything quickly. However, if parents are unhappy when the proposals are introduced, what do they do? The White Paper says that they can</p>
<a name="91119-0007.htm_brev10"><a name="09111936000886"><ul><p class="tabletext">"appeal to the Schools Adjudicator if they are not happy with the resulting plan, in the same way they can currently appeal about local admission arrangements."</p>

How long do we have to wait before that process starts? The Government say that later this year they will work with up to 10 local authorities to trial the approach, then use that trial to decide how things might work and further consult on its introduction.</p>

 The overwhelming number of home-educated children benefit from the dedication of individuals who have deliberately sought to forgo income and time to give them the best possible education, and I think that the Secretary of State agrees with that.

The Education and Inspections Act 2006 allows schools to apply directly for an order. Schools and local authorities can also apply for an order earlier, prior to exclusion, following serious misbehaviour which, if continued, would warrant exclusion. However, despite the fact that those powers and their extensions have existed since at least 1998, not a single school has applied for a behaviour parenting order since September 2004.</p>

He could guarantee, as we would, to raise the prestige and esteem of teaching by saying no one with poor GCSEs or a poor degree could become a teacher.

 It is sometimes difficult for the Chair of a Select Committee to make a speech in a Queen's Speech debate, particularly if it is a very busy Committee that is about to produce major reports on a number of issues that are touched on in the Queen's Speech. As you will know, Madam Deputy Speaker, that inhibits some of things that one can say. Let me allude to the fact that we are about to produce major reports on school accountability, on the training of teachers and on home educators, as well as much else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="91119-0008.htm_para1"><a name="09111936000360">There is another difficulty with being the Chairman of a Select Committee. Everybody knows that I am a Labour/Co-op Member of Parliament, but I have a job as Chairman of the Committee on Children, Schools and Families to call the Secretary of State and the Government to account on a range of issues. Often, people may think that I criticise the Government too much when I appear on radio and television and in newspapers, but that is part of my job. However, to set my remarks in this debate in context, I believe that the Government, in many areas, have profoundly improved the educational situation in our country and made a very real difference to our children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="91119-0008.htm_para2"><a name="09111936000361">I shall give four examples of that, the first of which is an undersung part of the Children Act 2004, which introduced Every Child Matters and the five outcomes, which I asked about in an intervention and which I believe should apply to every child in our country. The Act was a triumph and it has made so much difference because every time we discuss children and education, we can refer back to it as a benchmark. I shall go into the five outcomes in detail in a moment, but are they being delivered for every child in this country?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="91119-0008.htm_para3"><a name="09111936000362">The 2004 Act is good, landmark legislation of which we should be proud. It is set in the context-this is indisputable-of more money spent on education per child than ever in the history of our country. That is something to be proud of. That does not mean that I am always persuaded that just money delivers real change. Money delivers the possibility of change, and we have seen many advances from using the enormous amount of money that is now spent on our children and state schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="91119-0008.htm_para4"><a name="09111936000363">I also put on record my great approval for evidence-based policy-my Committee has come across it in a number of inquiries. The fundamental of evidence-based policy, across the nearly 10 years that I have chaired various education, children and schools Committees, is that, as we know, the earlier we intervene in a child's life, the better. The more money spent, and the earlier it is spent, the greater the difference to the child's life and the educational outcomes in our country, so I approve of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="91119-0008.htm_para5"><a name="09111936000364">The Committee very often agrees across the parties on many of those evaluations and judgments. We disagree profoundly with each other at other times, but there is a great measure of agreement. I can bore the House again  <br>

by saying that if we look at education policies and change-perhaps from as far back as Butler to Balls, or from Baker to Balls-we see far more cross-party agreement on educational matters in our country than the earlier exchange between the two Front Benchers might suggest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="91119-0008.htm_para6"><a name="09111936000365">Of course there are disagreements on how much money we spend and, at particular times, on fundamentals, but very often some of the greatest advances in education policy have been made on a relatively bipartisan basis. The Education Act 1944 was the subject of cross-party agreement, although the Committee on it was led by Rab Butler. I remind the House that the Dearing report from 1997 is another example of real progress being made through agreement across the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="91119-0008.htm_para7"><a name="09111936000366">I am giving an overview before we evaluate particular aspects of the Queen's Speech. This is the first time in my time in the House and my experience of education that I can see an end to the silo in 14-to-19 education that marked off the academic route-the route from GCSE to A-levels and university-as the only prized route. The reforms might have gone further, and I have always been a supporter of all the Tomlinson recommendations.</p>

They are not in silos. Those young people can not only choose between those routes, but cross from one to the other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="91119-0008.htm_para9"><a name="09111936000370">I must tell the House about the inspirational apprentice who gave evidence to the Skills Commission. This bright young fellow from the north-west, pushed on why he chose an apprenticeship, said, "Well, I've joined BAE Systems. It's a very good company and they're paying me to do my apprenticeship. I'm getting paid and incurring no debt. When I get to a certain stage, I'm going to go and do a degree as well." That was refreshing, and we hear similar things all the time-we have transformed for many children how they see their 14-to-19 possibilities.</p>

 The Chairman of the Select Committee makes a powerful point. One would like a joined-up system with the ability to move between the different routes, but does he share my concern that the Secretary of State, in introducing diplomas, has failed to deliver that programme in the way that the hon. Gentleman and I would like; that the numbers taking diplomas so far have been alarmingly low, at enormously high cost; and that there are real risks attached to that very important initiative?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is a very good member of my Select Committee. I am going to desist from responding to that question. People watching this debate might think that there has been enough hurling of alternative policies and criticism one to the other. I am a great believer in diplomas as, I think, is he. There will be teething problems if a totally new qualification is introduced. I would not underestimate those problems, but I wish diplomas well and hope we get through that stage. Everyone recognised that there would be a transition time.</p>

I have always championed that and believed in it. I shall return to the Every Child Matters theme in a moment, but in this country, we consider people children until they are 18. That gives enormous protection to children, but it also means, when we are talking about raising the participation rate, that no child, until they are 18, should be allowed to go out into the big, wide world and work with no training or to be unemployed-that is absolutely right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="91119-0008.htm_para11"><a name="09111936000376">I celebrate the fact that we are going to move the participation age to 17 and then to 18.

 The Chairman of the Committee rightly praises the development of the 14-to-19 non-academic qualification.

I do not want to get too much into school accountability, but the Queen's Speech addressed it directly in a number of ways and I suggest to my party's Front Benchers that there are some concerns. I am not saying that what was in the Queen's Speech was all bad, but when we consider what school accountability is about, people say, "Well, that means Ofsted, doesn't it?" It does not. It means all the people involved in the school improvement process, such as the governing body-we underrate governing bodies and all the wonderful people who give their time and effort to be school governors-school improvement partnerships, local authorities and the whole range of bodies that call schools to account. Of course it covers Ofsted, and it also covers how testing and assessment are turned into school tables and published. Schools are accountable in a whole range of ways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="91119-0008.htm_para14"><a name="09111936000385">Sitting where I do, I sometimes think that we make schools so accountable that we paralyse them from action-not entirely, but it is a question of balance. Those of us in the House who take an interest in education will know that when the Department for Children, Schools and Families was set up, the remit of our Committee changed. It is a difficult remit, because it is not a tidy departmental responsibility. Matters to do with children, schools and families stretch across at least 10 Departments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="91119-0008.htm_para15"><a name="09111936000386">The Committee wanted to consider three things about school accountability, which are what most people think of as the three great educational reforms in the past 20 years. They date from about Lord Baker's time, although they are not all associated with him. We all know them. The first is testing and assessment, and I remember that people always used to say that Ken Baker, as he then was, had read "The One Minute Manager", which said that if something cannot be measured, it cannot be managed. They said that that was behind the great fashion for testing and assessment that has run through this country's education for the past 20 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="91119-0008.htm_para16"><a name="09111936000387">The second matter that we wanted to consider was the national curriculum. Everyone in the Chamber will know that we believed that although the inspiration behind it was right-testing and assessment had gone too far-it was too crowded and needed greater flexibility. We said that the pendulum should swing back in the other direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="91119-0008.htm_para17"><a name="09111936000388">The third matter was school accountability. I cannot go into too much detail about what we are going to say about it, but I shall give a tiny bit of the flavour of our analysis. School accountability should lead to improvement  <br>

both in schools and in children's well-being and outcomes. Too often, schools focus on the former rather than the latter. They focus just on examination results rather than on the other things that we do for children in schools, which are broader than just the number who get good GCSEs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="91119-0008.htm_para18"><a name="09111936000389">Any Government have to get their message clear, because it is not school buildings or testing and assessment that improve the quality of education that children get. The quintessential element that improves their education is the quality of the teaching that they get. It is not rocket science, is it? It is about the quality of the teachers and of the leadership and support of the teaching team. In everything that we do, the priority should be investment in high-quality teachers. We have seen more investment in teachers and some really good change in the quality of people coming into teaching and being retained. It has not gone far enough, but it has gone pretty darn far.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State that although some simplification has flowed from it, there is still a bewildering array of new initiatives. That has partly negated all the good stuff in the new relationship.</p>

Additional statutory duties on governors are coming through, and there was the national challenge, which was mishandled in some ways. There were good intentions, but initially the wrong view was given to many schools about the value that they were adding to the educational process.</p>

That is important both in how Ofsted approaches the running of a school and in a school's quality. However, we have yet again seen the role that Ofsted plays. Self-evaluation started and it told our Committee, "We want self-evaluation to be innovative and imaginative. We actually have schools that make videos of what they do." However, I think I visit more schools than anyone in the Chamber-the Secretary of State has probably overtaken me, but if he ever moves on to a new job I might still be here and going to schools, as I have been for 10 years-and I find that everyone says of the self-evaluation form, "They say you don't have to fill this in, but I'm not going to be the one who puts their head above the parapet and does not fill in the form in the way that Ofsted says".</p>

However, having considered the matter, I think that it is true. The commercial world impacts on children. They are seen as a soft target for advertising and are pressured into growing up too young; they are pressured to adopt fashion accessories too young and to have mobile phones and accessories and so many other things too young. Often they are pressurised by advertisers.</p>

The life of a girl who gets pregnant very young is more or less likely to be destroyed-she will probably always be poor-but we do not take that seriously enough in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="91119-0008.htm_para28"><a name="09111936000401">The country is also awash with a focus on early sexual activity. I talked recently with members of another Select Committee who had looked at the amount of pornography on the internet available to children. That disturbs me greatly. An inquiry has been conducted into that-<i> [Interruption.] </i>An hon. Gentleman is laughing, but I think that the accessibility of pornography to children in our schools is a serious matter. When I go to infant schools, teachers say to me, "Children come here, at five and six, simulating sexual behaviour that they should know nothing about." That is disgusting.</p>

Two days before, I had read that the Murdoch empire is not only the biggest carrier of pornography in the world, but has now bought a major supplier and maker of pornography in the United States. I do not know what "trusted" and "loved" meant, but a company that makes such filth available to children does not impress me. Our children should be protected from pornography, whether it is on BSkyB or the internet. Childhood should be protected.</p>

I shall return to the Government's guarantees set out in the Queen's Speech, but first I remind the House of the five outcomes-the guarantees of childhood-in "Every Child Matters": to be healthy, stay safe, enjoy and achieve, make a positive contribution and achieve economic well-being. There is nothing wrong with those.</p>

In an answer during Prime Minister's questions last Wednesday, the Prime Minister said that he now believes in votes at 16. I think that that fashion started with the Liberal Democrats, but the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House now seem to believe it too. However, I think that we should think extremely carefully before moving to votes at 16-it would mean adulthood at 16 and the end of the protections of childhood between 16 and 18.</p>

Having seen the vulnerability of 14 to 16-year-old children, and that of 16 to 18-year olds out in the world who are open to every kind of exploitation, we realised at the end of the inquiry that we do not want the protections of childhood to finish at 16. We lose those protections at 18 to our cost as a society.</p>

hon. Gentleman supports that policy, not only in schools, but beyond schools, and I suspect that if his advice were taken by his party, it would have a good deal more impact in motivating the electorate and, apparently, Labour Members than the 38 guarantees given by the Secretary of State, which we are supposed to be debating today.</p>

I strongly suspect that the Children, Schools and Families Bill, which covers a large number of areas, is one of those that might struggle to receive proper scrutiny in this place and another place. It might well fail to pass, therefore, before the end of this Parliament, although I think that most people outside this place, in particular those involved in schools and colleges, would welcome the Bill not getting on to the statute book.</p>

 I may be pushing the hon.

That needs to be opposed as fundamentally illiberal.</p>

 This is the second time that we have had an intervention on that point, so I just want to clarify it. When the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) reads the Children, Schools and Families Bill, he will see the detail, which may be helpful. Local authorities have the right under existing legislation to enter the home where a child is at risk and there is a concern about safeguarding. On the quality of education-that is what is new in the Bill-the Bill makes it clear that there is a right to see the child on their own only with the permission and agreement of the parent and the child.

 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that clarification. As we have been drawn into discussing the Badman review rather earlier in my speech than I had intended, all I would say now is this: first, we accept the Government's approach of saying that it is sensible for all those who are home educating to be registered. That is a reasonable minimum requirement. Our concerns, which will need to be debated when we scrutinise the proposals in detail, is whether the registration process will involve imposing a central vision of education by the back door. We are concerned also that home educators have gained the impression that there is seen as being a particular relationship between home education and child protection, which has caused a lot of anger throughout the country. The Government may not have intended that, but that is certainly the impression created by the Badman review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="91119-0009.htm_para8"><a name="09111936000415">We will also want to debate carefully the issue that the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) raised and the Secretary of State touched on, which is what powers local authorities should have and what oversight they should have of home education. I would hope that in most cases a light-touch approach would be taken, but most Members would also want to ensure that in extreme circumstances, where local authorities have genuine concerns, they should have the powers to ensure that parents are doing the job that they are claiming to do. Local authorities may have powers in relation to child protection; we will debate whether they have them in relation to oversight of the education provided.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I put it to him that local authorities do have that power.

State's Department issuing a press release on what the new education Bill will include. It confirmed that the Children, Schools and Families Bill, as it is called, will make amendments to nine separate Acts since 1996, one of which is the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009, which we passed one week ago and most of which has not even been implemented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="91119-0009.htm_para10"><a name="09111936000421">Does that not confirm the criticism of people involved in education throughout the country that the Government are addicted to legislation and bureaucracy, and cannot even wait until previous measures are embedded before they start legislating for new proposals? After all, we are talking about the 12th education Bill that we have had in 12 years of this Government. It is most people's view-although not, apparently, the Secretary of State's-that that degree of legislation says something not about the Government's commitment to education, but about their failure to get the basic frameworks right and then allow the education system to develop in a devolved way. Instead, we have the extraordinary tide of bureaucracy contained in the Bill, most of which is essentially about just that, which threatens to swamp most schools in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="91119-0009.htm_para11"><a name="09111936000422">Earlier the Secretary of State tried his best, as he normally does, to set up one of his dividing lines, with the Conservative party and others on one side of it. However, he is surely aware that the dividing lines are between himself and virtually everybody else involved in education. For instance, the other day the respected secretary-general of the Association of School and College Leaders criticised most of the measures in the Bill in very blunt terms, and particularly the guarantees. The National Union of Teachers, which is not normally associated with the forces of the right, was equally critical of many of the guarantees in the Bill, as well as other aspects. I could also mention the National Association of Head Teachers, and the list goes on.</p>

 I take very seriously the interests and views of the NAHT, the NUT and the Association of School and College Leaders, as the hon. Gentleman does. However, I am sure that he would agree that, as well as listening to the views of teachers and the profession, it is important that we stand up for the rights of children and parents. The change to the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 does not affect schools directly. We now have a power under the 2009 Act to ask local authorities to consider issuing a warning notice. The new power will say that if they refuse to do so, we can issue one ourselves, if we believe that a school is consistently underperforming. Does he think that that is the right approach or does he prefer the "let the free market rip" approach proposed by the Conservative party?</p>

 On the Secretary of State's latter question, there must be strategic oversight of schools at some level, although I am not sure that I agree at all with the Government's approach. My point was that if they wish to legislate on the issue, they should have done so in a coherent way in the previous education Bill, not by having the debate twice. When he says that the NUT and NAHT are not the only ones involved, I would refer him to what some of his own Back Benchers have been saying.

Gentleman's interesting speech yesterday, in which he even got a mention. However, in case the Secretary of State did not hear it, the right hon. Gentleman said that those guarantees</p>

Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) proposed a standard whereby if the NHS has not delivered treatment within a certain period, it should have the ability to pay for the patient concerned to go into the private sector. However, there is a big difference between such a guarantee, which is meaningful, deliverable and funded, which does not seek to micro-manage, which avoids bureaucracy and which focuses on the outcomes and not the inputs, and the list of guarantees that the Secretary of State has come up with in the Bill. The Bill contains 38 guarantees that are united only by the fact that most of them are either meaningless, undeliverable, bureaucratic and meddling or focus on inputs. As Peter Riddell said in <i> The Times </i>this morning, guarantees without funding, some of which I want to return to, are not worth the paper that they are written on.</p>

Earlier today, I raised with him pupil pledge 5 from the White Paper. I do not think that I had an answer from him on that point, so I will put it to him again.

We have argued for a pupil premium to deliver additional resources in schools to help the most disadvantaged get up to the right level in terms of the basic skills that we expect them to have before they leave primary education and, unlike the Conservative party, we propose to fund it. Any pupil premium introduced in an environment where there is no overall increase in funding is simply undeliverable, because no Government of any party would be willing to take money away from schools to fund others.</p>

In the modern world and the 21st century, what type of Government, other than one with the instincts of a Soviet Government of 50 or 100 years ago, would really think of prescribing centrally that the same number of hours, 10, should be delivered for all such youngsters, regardless of the views of teachers and head teachers on what they need, regardless of the need for flexibility to deliver in different-sized groups and regardless of whether some youngsters might need 20 or 25 hours and others with considerably fewer challenges might need only four or five?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="91119-0010.htm_para1"><a name="09111936000443">Surely that is the kind of pledge that gives the Government such a bad name for trying to impose such solutions from the top down. I hope that we will hear further responses on the matter from the Government next year, when they complete their review of deprivation. Surely the right answer is to introduce a fair system of funding for schools that delivers more, particularly to deprived youngsters, and then to allow the schools themselves to deliver the standards that need to be set nationally in a light-touch way and enforced by Ofsted.</p>

 I look forward to the debates that will happen in Committee. We will set out more details on how we will implement the guarantees as we take forward the White Paper in advance of that. As usual, the hon. Gentleman is making serious policy points. The point that he made about the pupil premium is absolutely right. A pupil premium could lead to more or less resourcing going to a school with more disadvantage, depending on what else is happening to school budgets and the school formula. Simply saying that one wants a pupil premium could be consistent with major and substantial cuts, so it is an important point. However, a pupil premium where money went to the school based on the number of disadvantaged pupils would not guarantee that the pupils with disadvantages or extra needs would actually get the support that they need.</p>

But we are saying that there should be a minimum entitlement of at least 10 hours for any pupil who has not got to level 4 at the end of year 6. If we do not do that, parents cannot know that their child with greater need will get greater support. How that is delivered-singly or in small groups and over how many hours-is a matter for the school to decide, but unless we set a minimum entitlement, how will we know that the pupil will get the support that they need?</p>

The problem with that is that no Secretary of State can reflect from one desk in Westminster and Whitehall all the requirements, complexities and particular circumstances of 23,500 schools and 11.5 million pupils. He has gone way too far in this particular supposed guarantee in imposing a one-size-fits-all solution from Westminster and Whitehall. That is the wrong way of holding schools to account.</p>

 I apologise to Members of the Conservative party, but this is the serious debate about policy that we did not have earlier from the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), so I would like to engage in it. There is an issue here. I agree that we have to make sure that we get more flexibility and power to head teachers and teachers, but at the same time, parents want to know that their school will be a good school and that if their child falls behind, they will get extra help. How can we ensure that that will happen without the right combination of accountability for the progress of every child and without telling parents that their child has a right to extra support? If we simply leave it to local decision making-or, as we know from the Conservatives, basically opt out entirely from the national curriculum of the state system and have a much more market-based free-for-all-it might work for some children, but how can we guarantee that a child from a particularly disadvantaged background whose parents may be less engaged will get the necessary support? How can we make sure that we deliver social justice in that way?</p>

 We can never ensure that we deliver social justice by trying to prescribe from Westminster and Whitehall a system that will fit every school and every child in the country. What we can do is ensure that an individual school has the funding it needs and then that the school is held properly to account for what it does with the money. The Government's job, it seems to me, is to put in place a system of oversight and inspection that will then hold schools to account for the money they get. That is very different from telling schools how to spend that money.</p>

 I accept that. We are having a legitimate debate about how we frame these guarantees to get these matters right both in terms of funding and how they are specified. I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but does he agree that telling schools to opt out of the national curriculum, to stop being part of the state school system, to not accept the accountability that comes from the report card and then basically to sink or swim depending on whether the school is a good one, is totally unfair, unjust and would leave many children substantially disadvantaged? Does he agree on that point, even if we can debate our differences about the guarantees?</p>

never end up delivering high school standards in the foreseeable future by relying only on market mechanisms. I would still like to see much more choice and competition in education, but we will need some type of strategic approach to make sure that schools deliver, particularly in the most deprived areas where, as the hon. Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer) said earlier, we cannot always assume that parents will have the ability or the inclination to move pupils around. We have to be able to bring successful schools to those communities and cannot rely on youngsters and parents moving large distances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="91119-0010.htm_para4"><a name="09111936000452">Let me move on from this exchange with the Secretary of State to discuss the obvious issue of school accountability. Another important part of the debate is about the school report card. When we heard the statement on the White Paper in June or July this year, we said that we welcomed the idea of having a school report card. I think that there is potential to deliver a much better overview of what schools are achieving. At the moment, Ofsted goes to inspect every few years, but it is only every few years and circumstances in schools can change pretty rapidly. It would be valuable to know more about parental views and it would be useful to be able to compare families of schools with similar catchments rather than just on the basis of the overall results.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="91119-0010.htm_para5"><a name="09111936000453">We nevertheless have some fairly serious concerns about the school report card model that the Secretary of State is seeking to introduce. First, my understanding-I am happy to be corrected if I am wrong-is that the school report card is, to my surprise, going to be delivered not by Ofsted or even by local authorities, which, in the Government's jargon, although not usually in the substance, are supposed to be the commissioners of education, but by the Department for Children, Schools and Families. That rings all the alarm bells because trying to manage and oversee 23,500 schools from Westminster and Whitehall is deeply damaging. It potentially leads to a situation in which anyone running education from the Department has the strong incentive over time to demonstrate that schools are improving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="91119-0010.htm_para6"><a name="09111936000454">I understand that in New York, where this school card approach has been tried, schools were initially awarded a single grade from A to F-or something like that-and there was originally quite a good distribution of schools in different categories. The latest figures came out from New York recently, but they showed that virtually all schools were graded in the A and B categories. That sends out a warning: there is a risk both of those who oversee these arrangements having an interest in the outcomes and of creating a whole series of measures of school performance that are woolly, difficult to measure-things such as well-being and pupil perception-and open to the predictable attempt by schools to meet the targets in any way possible, which often fails to measure what is going on underneath. Anyone serious about what is going on in education in this country is worried that the existing target approach used by the Government to drive up standards-with some success in many areas-is actually leading to serious distortions in what is being chosen in terms of subjects and how it is being delivered.</p>

 On that particular point about distorting choices-we will soon be able to have our debate in Committee-what is the hon.

 Well, it is on the record. The reason why this issue is so important is, as the Secretary of State said, that we do not want children choosing subjects because of league tables, because in many cases vocational subjects may be right for young people. What school is going to encourage the take-up of vocational subjects if they are not included in the league tables? The issue is to ensure that the weightings are right and realistic, which they may not be at the moment, and not to aspire to a curriculum that might have been appropriate for Eton in 1850 but is not right for England today. I hope that there will be some changes to the school report card process as we take the Bill through Committee. At the moment, we do not think it will deliver and we think it will replicate a lot that is happening elsewhere in the system.</p>

Although we think it is reasonable for all parents who are home educating to register their children, our greatest concern is that that should not become a back-door way of foisting much of the bureaucratic and centralised education system on those who are seeking to home educate often precisely in order to escape from that system. They do not want it coming in through the back door.</p>

All that he wanted was for the person beside him to smile and nod as though he were being very clever.

When we ask now whose idea it was, no name comes forward. That is the kind of legislation which has a harmful impact on the ground.</p>

I see no reason for us to continue to split education between different Departments. I also hope that we can have a Department of Health, which, if people want CHCs to be brought back with the same level of resources that they had before, will be able to do that. I think that-both in Greenwich, where I was first a Member of Parliament, and in my present constituency of Worthing-such a system, with some adaptations, would work better than the current system in which the load is placed on volunteers. The current system is almost impossible to describe, and very difficult to sell to those whom we wish to become involved.</p>

He told me, as did doctors in my own hospital, that the Government-or the Department of Health or the national health service, depending on who wants to take responsibility-plans for MMCs, or modernising medical careers, and the MTAS, or the Medical Training Application Service, system would work perversely.</p>

When a good doctor with a relevant PhD in a clinical subject gets marked down, and somebody else has ripped 150 words on leadership off the internet and puts in an application, and five qualified doctors at a hospital not far from here get not a single interview between them for a next job when they are the very people who will become the consultants and teachers we need in the future, we wonder what has been going on in the Government and the Department of Health.

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="91119-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09111936000487">My last point on the NHS is to do with the national health service IT system. Every strategic health authority said that one of their hospitals must be a victim in order to bring in this new system, and, sadly, Worthing was chosen in my SHA area. The hospital tried to put that off for as long as possible, but when it came in, within six to nine months an extra Â£2 million had to be added to the hospital budget of Â£140 million a year to provide the clerical and manual back-up to substitute for the system that had been put in to replace the computer system it had, which was working, but was not working in the way in which someone, who has now left their job, up at Whitehall had imposed on them. That is terrible. Those Â£2 million could have been very usefully spent on some things that truly matter. When I thought of the doctors, nurses, administrators, managers and others in the hospital having to face that, knowing it was coming in and it would not work, I wept. It is not what the Government are supposed to be doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="91119-0011.htm_para13"><a name="09111936000488">The final topic that I wish to address is equality. I attended an important NATO Parliamentary Assembly meeting in Edinburgh over the weekend. At one point, on the platform were put a brigadier and three other officers, all of whom were women. After they made their presentations, it was time to make some contributions. I had been reminded of my first ministerial role at the Employment Department, when I was responsible for, among other things, equality and diversity. I asked why it was that in Departments in those days-we are going back 25 years now, to 1984-80 per cent. of first-line managers were female but two promotion grades later only 40 per cent. were female. In part, the answer to that is that there was an agreement-I call it a conspiracy-between the management and unions that staff had to serve a certain number of years before they could get a promotion. Secondly, they had a system where staff had to apply for promotion; people were not told, "We want you to go for this bigger and better job." The issue came down to the generalisation-it is no more than that-that most men who are half-qualified for something think they are over-qualified, and most women who are half-qualified think they are disqualified. The same applies normally-this is just a generalisation-to doing a good job; a woman doing a good job thinks it is a good reason to go on doing it, whereas a man doing a good job thinks it is a good reason to change and do something else. Some of these issues are cultural.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="91119-0011.htm_para14"><a name="09111936000489">We also had issues over race. I remember being questioned on the BBC Radio 4 "Today" programme about why racial discrimination in employment had not appeared to have improved very much. I pointed out that "Today" had 40 staff, not one of whom was black or Asian. I asked whether that was because they did not have the qualifications or somebody in recruitment was discriminating. I was on the show twice more in the next few weeks. I asked the same question, and I then got a letter from the director of personnel saying would I please stop exposing the BBC to scorn by asking questions, which seems an odd request to come from the BBC. It said it would have, in effect, an open access policy, under which people doing media training at the then polytechnic next door would get work experience, so  <br>

people would no longer have to be called Dimbleby or Jay or something else to get an internship at the BBC, and the BBC has now changed. Therefore, being open and fair and giving people opportunity is what unites the education and health sides of this debate, and it is certainly the driving force behind my participation in public and political service.</p>

 I am grateful for having been given the opportunity to make a short contribution on this Queen's Speech. Clearly, it will not be as short as the Queen's Speech-nothing could be. I love pomp and ceremony, but I assume that the events of yesterday were not put on just so that I could be cheered up on a grim, blustery day. This Queen's Speech covers only three pages-it costs Â£4 from all good booksellers, no doubt, but it must be one of the worst buys in the country. To distract Her Majesty from her other duties to come all the way to Parliament in order to deliver this very short speech, which most people do not believe will be delivered on in any great way, shape or form, was a complete waste of time. I am sure it was great for the tourists, however-I am sure they enjoyed the event.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="91119-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09111936000492">Perhaps, however, this was the Prime Minister giving a dry run of what will become the real Queen's Speech next May, when most people expect the general election to be. We will then get a Queen's Speech that will be full of substance and will be properly delivered and have the mandate of the public. As we all know, at present the Prime Minister has not been endorsed by any member of the public. Indeed, at the last general election the "great" Tony Blair said he would be Prime Minister for a full term. That did not happen and two and a half years into his premiership the keys of No. 10 were dangled above him and out went Tony Blair and in came the current Prime Minister. Therefore, yesterday's Queen's Speech has not got the mandate of the general public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="91119-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09111936000493">There was a great opportunity for the current Prime Minister to call a general election as soon as he was given the position; it is a great shame that he did not. If he had won that election, at least we would have had a series of Queen's Speeches over a five-year period which would have had the endorsement of the general public.</p>

<p>While I am talking about things that have not got the endorsement of the general public, I should mention today that it is very likely that in Brussels our unelected Prime Minister will vote for somebody whom the great British public will also not have a say on: the President  <br>

of the European Council. I am not quite sure what it takes these days to fulfil that particular post. I do not think that the jobs pages of <i> The Guardian</i> carried an advertisement so that anybody who wished to apply could do so. It is more mysterious than a papal announcement. This is supposed to be a President who will speak on behalf of the whole of Europe, yet who this person will be is a complete mystery. Will it be Herman Van Rompuy, the Belgian Prime Minister-a household name, no doubt, throughout Europe; or will it be someone who really is a household name throughout the UK, at least, and who fills me with even greater dread: Tony Blair? The fact is that this position has not been endorsed by the general public of this country, even though it was created by a treaty that we were told we would have a referendum on.</p>

Will it help this country, and help provide more jobs?" Today we are talking about health and education, in the main, but for all the education that is being delivered in this country-vocational education was mentioned by the Chairman of the Children, Schools and Families Committee-the sad truth is that there are no jobs for some of the people now being trained and educated.</p>

That study found that 49 per cent. of businesses believe they would be significantly more competitive if they moved more business functions outside the UK, and 72 per cent. have moved or are considering moving a proportion of manufacturing overseas. The study's most alarming finding was that 81 per cent. of the UK's largest multinational firms are either considering moving or already planning to move at least one major business function overseas by 2015. Furthermore, one in seven companies have already relocated manufacturing abroad. We clearly have a lot more to do to ensure that manufacturing is assisted in this country, and that we look at the burdens we are putting on our businesses. The money being diverted into rules and regulations could be invested in those companies, providing jobs for the future for the work force-for the people whom we are educating now in our schools and in further and higher education.</p>

When the VAT rate was reduced to 15 per cent., a percentage was added on to alcohol so that it did not benefit from the reduction. In the context of tourism and the great British pub, beer is one of the great British traditions. As the Government know, 50 pubs are closing a week, destroying not only jobs but the fabric of life in many parts of the country. When the VAT rate goes back up to 17.5 per cent. on 1 January, I do hope that the Government will make a similar alteration to ensure  <br>

that-just as VAT on alcohol went up so that there was no benefit to the public when VAT generally went down-that issue will be addressed. Otherwise, there will be another 6p on a pint of beer, and many more pubs will close every week and jobs will be lost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="91119-0011.htm_para22"><a name="09111936000498">I turn now to the dairy industry, another industry that is struggling, but which is vital to the Ribble Valley. In 2000, there were 20,000 dairy holdings; by 2008, the figure had virtually halved, to 10,112. In Lancashire, there were 1,144 dairy holdings; by 2008, the figure was down to 634. In the Ribble Valley over a similar period, a figure of 206 dairy farms reduced to 134-a decline of 35 per cent. Such a great number of dairy farms are closing simply because the cost of production is beyond what they can sell their milk for. No business can survive for any length of time when the cost of production exceeds the sale price.</p>

We are trying to encourage as many people as possible to enter university and higher education, but to date some 119,000 students still have not had their student loans. I heard a student say on the radio that his university has a scheme whereby if a student is suffering from complete hardship, they can borrow from the university, which he has done up to now. However, that still means that for the time that he has been at university he has been unable to fulfil the full role of a student, simply because he has not had any money. I suspect that a great many of the 119,000 students who have not received their loans to date are struggling, facing Christmas with still no prospect of their loans being paid to them.</p>

 Has my hon.

 Absolutely. I imagine that every constituency will have a number of families who are wondering how they will survive this Christmas. There might even be guilt on the part of some students, thinking that they will go back to university in January still having to rely on parental contributions so that they can eat and live. It is an absolute scandal. The Secretary of State said that more money is going into education, which is absolutely true, but this issue needs to be properly addressed.</p>

In fact, this is the last November of this Administration; next month will be the last December; and then we will have the last Christmas of this Administration-until we finally get to the general election, which will further cheer me up no end. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley), I will be working very hard indeed for a change of Administration, but I suspect that we have a half-open door to a general public who want such a change and to see fresh policies and ideas.</p>

necessary facilities and time within the curriculum for sport. Sport must not be seen as the easy option, or something that they do instead of the serious work of academic education. Sport and a healthy lifestyle are vital to our youngsters, and in many senses this issue is relevant to the health arena. If youngsters participate in sport they will be healthier, and the health budget will probably thereby be less than if they were not doing sport, eating the wrong sorts of foods and leading very unhealthy lifestyles. This issue will have a huge health impact, so let us get it right now by investing in our youngsters through sport. Let us not treat sport as a Cinderella subject that is unimportant in schools.

I know that it is easier for journalists to pick on the very small number of young people who do bad things, and blow it out of all proportion, as if everybody under the age of 18 is a young thug waiting to pick on some unsuspecting member of the public and rob them, for example. That is clearly not the case. I am co-president of the British Youth Council and in my estimation, having talked to young people, the vast majority are really interested in what they are doing. They actually want to make a contribution to society, and a lot of them do tremendous charitable work, day in, day out, of which we read very little in the newspapers. I wish that there could be a deal or pact with young people so that, for every bad story that a newspaper carries about them, they also print a good one about some of the great things that some young people are doing in this country.</p>

However, one thing that supermarkets do on education and training-I should mention Tesco and Sainsbury's in this regard-is operate the voucher scheme that provides computers and other equipment to a number of rural schools in my constituency that otherwise would not get access to them. I am sure that a number of MPs get the opportunity to present those goods to their local schools once a year, and I think that the scheme is fantastic; the gratitude, in particular that of small rural schools, is tremendous to see. If ever the supermarkets look to change the emphasis of that scheme, they could give shoppers an opportunity to donate their vouchers in store so that they could be reallocated to smaller, more rural schools, because the number of parents and grandparents collecting vouchers for those schools will be that many fewer. That is the one suggestion that I make to supermarkets.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Queen's Speech. I must say how much I enjoyed the speeches made by my hon. Friends the Members for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) and for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley). Both of my hon. Friends gave us lots of ideas and things to think about as they covered areas of the Queen's Speech and the way forward on health and education. I am delighted to see the shadow Health Secretary on our Front Bench, because he has done so much for, and is so heavily involved in, health matters across the country. We very much hope that before long he will be responsible for the health of our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para5"><a name="09111936000512">In the final year of this Parliament, at a time when this country is suffering so greatly because of the economic recession, it would have been expected that the contents of the Queen's Speech would be constructive and would attempt to deal with the real major issues confronting us. Regrettably, that was not the case and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley said, the Queen's Speech was very thin. I wish to highlight the fact that the Government Benches are devoid of any Back Benchers or participants in this debate on a very important legislative programme. Where are the Labour Members? There is no one on those Benches, save a few Members on the Front Benches. The empty Benches reinforce the belief that Labour Members, too, think that this Queen's Speech is inadequate to meet the needs of the nation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para6"><a name="09111936000513">In general, the Government's legislative programme appears to show that they have run out of ideas, and that this was a political speech and an attempt to save them at the general election. They will not succeed on that. They should be endeavouring to outline a programme to clear up the mess they have created over the past decade, be that in health, education, any other such matter or, more importantly, the economy. Too much of the programme in the Queen's Speech is, regrettably, partisan point scoring and is not about improving people's lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para7"><a name="09111936000514">I am disappointed that the Education Secretary is not here, because his speech highlighted what is wrong with the Government and with this Queen's speech. His contribution was partisan and, regrettably, it was not constructive. When I intervened on him, I endeavoured to suggest that on education we should be looking to work together to improve in the areas where we need to improve for the benefit of our children and our country. On this occasion, we need real change to create jobs, reform the health service, deal with our huge debt, put forward plans on immigration and offer real reform in schools. The Government have nothing to offer on ideas, vision or practical policies. Most of their measures have been window dressing.</p>

In fact, some aspects of them were not mentioned at all. One is the NHS and the other is immigration. Cutbacks in our local NHS in Bexley,  <br>

financial problems affecting our local hospitals, the closure of wards and the proposed permanent closure of the accident and emergency at Queen Mary's hospital, Sidcup are causing anger and concern in my area. My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) has come down to Queen Mary's to see the problems at first hand. We have a good hospital that is losing a facility that is much loved and much needed in my area. Obviously, we need reforms to the NHS to ensure that the system works better. We should not set our sights against change-we believe in change-but what we need is a new approach and I do not believe that this Labour Government can bring that new approach to the NHS or anything else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para9"><a name="09111936000516">As for immigration, there needs to be a change in both the approach and the policy. There was nothing in the Gracious Speech on a subject that even the Prime Minister recently admitted in a speech was causing concern across our country. One might therefore have expected some mention of it in the Queen's Speech or some proposals. Regrettably, that was not so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para10"><a name="09111936000517">Today's debate, of course, focuses on education and health-two of the most important issues to our constituents across the country. We all know that things need to improve and need to be better. Yes, money has gone in, but what are the results and the outcomes? That is what our constituents are looking for. I want to concentrate mainly on education today, and the Government's proposals are, I think, an admission of failure in education after 12 years in office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para11"><a name="09111936000518">As a former teacher and lecturer, as well as a father, grandfather and school governor, I remain very concerned about the state of education and our schools in this country. So much for the 1997 Government slogan or mantra of "Education, education, education." We have had so many education Bills and so many reforms, yet we still have many problems. That is quite an indictment of failure for the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para12"><a name="09111936000519">The Government have said that they believe that their new legislation will allow them to create world-class standards in schools, to listen to parents, to give them more information and to act to protect vulnerable children. These are commendable aims. We are all in favour of them and believe that they are vital. Why, after nearly 13 years, have we not achieved them? Why is still more legislation being introduced? The Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families should be ashamed, I think, of the Government's record in education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para13"><a name="09111936000520">What will the new Children, Schools and Families Bill do? We heard a large number of interventions from the Secretary of State about the bureaucracy and the aims of the Bill to give guarantees to parents and pupils. That is commendable in principle-we want to see guarantees of good schools and a lot of these aims are worth while. The Opposition do not disagree with some of the principles, but we are concerned about the bureaucracy that will be created. Of course we want guarantees, of course we want parents to be more involved and of course we want teachers to be freed up from bureaucracy so that they are able to do their jobs. We want heads and schools to have more independence. Our proposals are not as unfettered as the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) tended to suggest, but we want to ensure that the professionals can get on with the job-whether they are in the health service or in education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para14"><a name="09111936000521">Many of the measures in the Children, Schools and Families Bill are to be welcomed. Some are really good ideas. As my hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families said in an impressive, entertaining and constructive speech, a lot of the parts of the Bill that we agree with are measures that we proposed that have now been taken over by the Government. Of course we welcome that fact-anyone welcomes a sinner who repenteth, and this Government have a lot of sins.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para15"><a name="09111936000522">Legally enforceable home-school contracts were an idea that we were very passionate about, proposed by the Conservatives. It is just a pity that it has taken the Government so long to come forward and accept them. Regrettably, however, the Government seem to be tinkering a lot with education rather than grasping the real need for school reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para16"><a name="09111936000523">Of course, we must deal with the worst and poorly performing schools as a matter of urgency. Children are being failed by the system and in 2009 that is not good enough. The majority of children who are failing the most are those in the more deprived and difficult areas, who have fewer opportunities. That cannot be acceptable and must be attacked as a top priority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para17"><a name="09111936000524">In the longer term, the whole education system must be more responsive to parents. A system of legal guarantees, as proposed by the Government in their measure, could be expensive and time-consuming, and will not give parents more control over their children's education. We should be giving parents more real choice by opening up the system, not closing it down and introducing more and more bureaucracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09111936000525">In his speech, my hon. Friend was positive about the need for educational reform. We need a radical approach to transform poor and failing schools-not more bureaucracy. The Conservatives have positive and radical ideas. We believe that there should be a new generation of independently run state schools. We do not believe that local authorities should have total control over our education system. In some areas, they have failed to take the initiative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para19"><a name="09111936000526">I commend the local education authority in my borough of Bexley as innovative and good. We are looking towards even greater diversity. We have grammar schools, comprehensive schools and single-sex schools. We also have Church schools and some academies. The academy in Welling is doing well, and we hope that the new one in Crayford will open next September. The primary part of the school is already open-I had the privilege of opening it in July. We look forward to the innovative education at the school giving real opportunity to people in that part of my constituency. The Haberdashers' Aske's federation is behind the project and is to be commended for taking the initiative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para20"><a name="09111936000527">Conservatives want passionately to smash down the regulatory barriers, such as planning guidance and building regulations, so that it is easier for new providers to open a school. Moving to a per capita funding regime, whereby new schools are paid if they attract pupils, and introducing a pupil premium to direct extra funding towards the poorest pupils must also be a way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para21"><a name="09111936000528">We are keen on turning the best schools into academies, giving every school the opportunity to apply for academy status and extending the academy programme to primary schools.

for more than a year to be taken over by an excellent academy provider is a way of taking real action to improve schools that have been failing our children and communities. Giving parents the power to take over schools that local authorities want to close is another option for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para22"><a name="09111936000529">We believe in giving schools greater freedom, but that must come alongside making schools more responsible to parents. In that way, we shall have better and more balanced education provision for every child, all over the country, not just those who happen to live in an area where there are already good schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para23"><a name="09111936000530">We want positive action. We shall look carefully at the pupil and parent guarantees of a legal right to a good education, but we have concerns. We believe that we need to free things up rather than increase bureaucratic regimentation and control, and to be much more effective at pushing up standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para24"><a name="09111936000531">Standards are the key. People should have the opportunity to be educated, to aspire and to develop to their maximum potential. Many of us are very grateful to the state schools we attended and to our teachers. They gave us opportunities to get on and make something of our lives. I am certainly grateful to the teachers at my primary school and grammar school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para25"><a name="09111936000532">Teachers do a fantastic job. As my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West said in his excellent speech, teaching is a vocation. Teachers can really help pupils to develop. We should be grateful to people who go into that profession and give their lives to encouraging, enthusing and educating our young people. It is a tremendous career, but a demanding one. We should appreciate, too, the head teachers who give leadership and encouragement and set the benchmarks for their school. We believe in head teachers, teachers and parents, and we want more power for them, so that they can help improve standards, and can enthuse pupils and give them the necessary aspirations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para26"><a name="09111936000533">I conclude with a short word on the Queen's Speech in general. There is very little in it-and, to be realistic, how many of the Bills that it mentions will be enacted by the time the election comes? I do not know. The Queen's Speech is a missed opportunity for a Government who, when they came in, promised so much, but who have delivered so little in nearly 13 years. They are political to the last, as they always have been. The speech was a regrettable missed opportunity to deal with the issues facing our country. Therein lies the Government's tragedy. I am sure that the electorate will pass their verdict on them in the near future.</p>

Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) is a distinguished member. At the moment, the lonely presence of the Health Secretary's Parliamentary Private Secretary, the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Phil Wilson), is guarding the Government Benches. Labour Members are presumably off to their constituencies, but perhaps they have come to the conclusion, as we certainly have, that there is nothing wrong with the Queen's Speech that a speedy general election will not put right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para27"><a name="09111936000537">It is appropriate that I should begin by reflecting on saying goodbye, because this is not only the Government's last Queen's Speech, but mine. I am in the process of saying goodbye myself. As I go about doing so today, I want to reflect, in a local way, on the public services-health and education. First, I want to say something about public service itself and some of the issues that have arisen as a result of the expenses scandal over the past year. I shall conclude, if I have time, with a few brief remarks-a kind of coda-about the situation in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para28"><a name="09111936000538">It almost goes without saying that it has been a debilitating and, in many respects, disastrous year for the House of Commons, what with the expenses scandal and the issues that arise from it. I want to try to take a step back for a moment and ask a fundamental question of principle that is rather more important, in the long run, than some of the detail with which the issue can sometimes become surrounded. The basic question that the House has to ask is whether it sees Members of Parliament fundamentally as citizen legislators who are free to earn and work elsewhere, or as professional politicians. Professional politicians are, by definition, not so free to earn and work outside, and are therefore inevitably members of a political class, distinct and separate from the constituents whom they represent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para29"><a name="09111936000539">Looking back at the journey that has taken place this year-beginning, probably, with Nolan, through to the House's decisions of 30 April, the Parliamentary Standards Act 2009 and Kelly-the direction of travel is clear. We are travelling in the direction of professional politics, and that is not something that I want to be part of. I have made it clear elsewhere that if Members of the House effectively have to fill in time sheets for outside work, it will ultimately be deeply damaging, and will have serious consequences for this House and its ethos, character and nature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="91119-0012.htm_para30"><a name="09111936000540">My answer to the question, "Why shouldn't hon. Members fill in time sheets in the way that has been suggested?" is that the Commons should not become a monopoly for the political class who work here, work here only and do not have any outside interests and expertise, whether in dentistry, the law, the City or charities and so on. If hon. Members disagree, as some will, I simply make one observation: ultimately, what is good for the goose must be good for the gander. If being a Member of this legislature is a full-time job, it follows as night follows day that Members cannot moonlight as Ministers on the Government Benches; and, if that is the way that this House and the voters want it, the legislature and the Executive must go their separate ways. I should not like that, but I am afraid that that is the position into which the House is getting itself. I make that point gently but, I hope, firmly.</p>

there were more-gave birth in my constituency, and I am sure that the whole House will want to congratulate them. Unfortunately, they did not do so in the safety of a labour ward: they both gave birth in ambulances. They did not give birth in the security of a hospital, either: one gave birth in an ambulance in a lay-by on the A4010, which stretches between Wycombe and Aylesbury; and the other gave birth in an ambulance outside the Eden shopping centre, which has many virtues but is not, after all, a hospital.</p>

Although I could revisit the territory that has been covered by some of my hon. Friends, who have seen health cuts and closures in their constituencies following the Government's change to the health service funding formula in 2004, I shall resist the temptation to go back and, instead, make two points about the present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para2"><a name="09111936000543">In Buckinghamshire, we are trapped in a vicious circle. After the restructuring of the past eight years and, in particular, the change to the funding formula in 2004, we have had a primary care trust deficit. That tends to leak into the hospital deficit, and, because the hospital trust has a deficit, it is very hard for it to make progress on its entirely noble aspiration to become a foundation trust. We receive about 17 per cent. less NHS funding per head than the average citizen in England, so we cannot address the deficit fully. I am not suggesting that the PCT does not have a role to play in getting its deficit down, but that is very hard if it is 17 per cent. behind the rest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para3"><a name="09111936000544">I have had several constructive conversations with my hon. Friend the shadow Health Secretary, who, unlike the Health Secretary proper, is in his place on the Front Bench, listening to the debate. My hon. Friend has been able to reassure me that there will be a simpler, fairer and independently administered funding formula if a Conservative Government are elected in May, as I believe they will be, and that will greatly help to improve my constituents' situation. In the long term, if some of that extra money can unlock foundation status, Wycombe hospital may be able to regain some of the facilities that it lost to Stoke Mandeville hospital after the 2004 changes to the Government funding formula.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para4"><a name="09111936000545">I am sure that my hon. Friend will get any structural changes that he wants to make in early, because, like my hon. Friends in other areas, we have seen absolutely bewildering health-structure change in Buckinghamshire. When I arrived, there were three primary care groups, which became three primary care trusts. There is now one primary care trust. The mental health trust has been merged with Oxfordshire. The regional health authority has been abolished and recreated, and the ambulance authority has been merged. Not one single team of chair and chief executive is in place now that was in place in 2001. For us, the experience of the NHS in Buckinghamshire has been almost like watching permanent revolution in China. If my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) becomes Health Secretary, as I am sure he will, my constituents will look to him to introduce some stability to the situation.</p>

that social mobility has stalled under this Government since 1997 and that the gap between rich and poor has not narrowed but, in several key respects, widened. Our education system in Buckinghamshire is unusual, although not unique, because we still have a selective system. For a long time, it has been my party's policy not to seek to reintroduce a selective system nationwide or to seek to disrupt the selective system where it is working well, as it does in Buckinghamshire. Given that the 11-plus, at least as it works in our county, is essentially not dissimilar from an IQ test and seeks to match pupils to schools, and given that a large proportion of pupils in our excellent grammar schools appear to come from better-off areas, I want to ask one simple question as I approach my departure from the House in March, May, or whenever the general election takes place. Are we absolutely certain that that test is working as well as it should for pupils in the poorer areas of my constituency, who would greatly appreciate the chance to be as socially mobile as their predecessors were a generation ago, and who arguably appear to be doing less well out of the system than others?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para6"><a name="09111936000547">I want to conclude with a few remarks about Afghanistan in the light of my experiences, which my hon. Friends and Members in all parts of the House will have shared, on Remembrance Sunday. As each year passes, certainly in my constituency, I have observed the crowds growing as the involvement of our servicemen and women becomes greater, and sensed a greater appreciation of the sacrifice that they are making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para7"><a name="09111936000548">The current strategy in Afghanistan is that the American Government and our Government require a surge-there is no controversy about that. Clearly, our troops need to be better equipped. In some respects, the Government's record on that has been absolutely scandalous. The alternative to a surge and better-equipped troops-immediate withdrawal from Afghanistan-would plainly be disastrous; apart from anything else, it would place enormous strain on the western alliance. I am sure that no one in the House would want to contemplate an immediate unilateral withdrawal. However, we must look forward and ask ourselves seriously whether, if the surge does not work, the Helmand mission in which our troops are engaged is fundamentally indispensable to our national security. There are different views in the House about that. The right hon. Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) recently said, in effect, that it is not indispensable, and called for much higher spending on security in this country and for a scaling down of our presence in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para8"><a name="09111936000549">I think that hon. Members and others would benefit from reading the recent interesting pamphlet by my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Holloway), which was published by the Centre for Policy Studies. It follows very much the line of thought developed by a man who I believe will be a future colleague here-Rory Stewart, our excellent candidate in Penrith and the Border-and argues that a new emphasis should be placed on more local decision making in a country where, after all, there is no history of unitary Government. My hon. Friend and Mr. Stewart emphasise the need for a smaller military and development presence but, crucially, enough of a presence to be able to search out and destroy any bases that the al-Qaeda leadership might seek to re-establish. Those ideas are well worth examination.</p>

 I am very pleased to make a short contribution to the debate, which gives an opportunity to tie health and education issues together. Although a lot of legislation endeavours to do that, I think we are all aware of the huge gaps where children's services and health services are not working together as they should.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para11"><a name="09111936000553">I should like to speak about access to health services and subsequent outcomes for children and young people. The hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) mentioned child protection and said that even after a year of debate and after we have identified so much that needs changing in our children's services, it did not come up in the Queen's Speech-perhaps I should say that it is yet another such issue that did not come up. The problem has impacted greatly on the public and they certainly want to hear more about how we can tackle it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para12"><a name="09111936000554">I have tabled amendments to a series of Bills to achieve provision of therapeutic services for all abused children, starting with the Bill that became the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Sadly, I have been unsuccessful so far, but most of my political life has been "Try, try again," so I have not given up yet. As an ambassador for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, I agree with its call for comprehensive post-abuse therapeutic provision for children in care, custody and refuges, and for children exhibiting sexually harmful behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para13"><a name="09111936000555">Child abuse remains an unacceptably large problem in the UK. An NSPCC study from way back in 2000 showed that 16 per cent. of children had experienced some form of sexual abuse, which may well have been by a parent or another relative. Other forms of abuse-physical or emotional or neglect-can also have a traumatic impact on children. In 2006, the then Department for Education and Skills said that of 60,000 children in care, 63 per cent. were there because they had experienced some form of abuse or neglect. Of course, in reality, the problems are likely to be much more widespread, because instances of abuse go unreported or because they are reported many years after they occur. The long-term consequences of child sexual abuse include anxiety and depression, anger and guilt, phobic reactions, substance abuse, difficulties functioning at school, poor self-image and difficulties with personal relationships and parenting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para14"><a name="09111936000556">The Corston report in 2007 highlights criminality as a very real potential consequence of these problems, and it revealed that a high proportion of female inmates have a history of sexual abuse. Adults being treated for mental health problems often identify childhood abuse as an influence. Research shows that 25 to 40 per cent. of all alleged sexual abuse involves young perpetrators. The majority of those children and young people have been, or are being, sexually, physically or emotionally abused themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para15"><a name="09111936000557">Therapy at an early stage could therefore help to reduce the scale of the problems over time by breaking the cycle. In addition, of course, it could save much money and anguish, and many troubled adults. Therapy can transform children's lives, but provision is inadequate and patchy across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para16"><a name="09111936000558">A recent NSPCC report published just this year, "Sexual Abuse and Therapeutic Services for Children and Young People", concluded that the overall level of specialist provision is low, with significant gaps in provision both nationally and locally, and that there is a huge gap between the estimated need for services and service availability. The report identified potential shortfalls in provision ranging from around 51,000 to 88,000 therapeutic places. That is a massive problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para17"><a name="09111936000559">I was talking to a member of the NSPCC just yesterday about ChildLine, a service so important that I hope that all parties will say in their election manifestos that they will continue funding it. Young people who do not want to speak up face-to-face with someone do manage to contact ChildLine and explain what has happened to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para18"><a name="09111936000560">ChildLine also provides counselling services at the end of a telephone, and has allocated times when children and young people can ring in. Obviously, that is not as good as face-to-face counselling sessions but it is a start, as talking about these issues has to be a good thing. All the contacts made through ChildLine indicate how much a comprehensive service is needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para19"><a name="09111936000561">Specialist services are not only too few but are often offered too late, when a child or a young person is already showing symptoms of mental health or behavioural problems. There are very few services available for young people who have been raped or seriously sexually assaulted. Recently, a Victim Support volunteer from my constituency came to talk to me about the total lack of rape counselling in our area for young people under 16 who have been raped. It took an enormous amount of work to convince people that merely referring a person in those circumstances to a website was really not satisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para20"><a name="09111936000562">Not so long ago, I got a letter from a mother whose child, sadly, had been raped. The child had waited months for counselling, and I do not think that that is good enough. That may not be the most popular of items to talk about in relation to the Queen's Speech, but there are problems that we need to face up to and do something about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para21"><a name="09111936000563">Finding resources to provide a comprehensive service will obviously be a problem in today's economic climate, but I should like to see at least a commitment to a strategy to make such services fully available in time. Preventive action that should be taken automatically now will save money and heartbreak in the long run.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para22"><a name="09111936000564">We need joined-up thinking. The new Department for Children, Schools and Families covers not only schools and children, but young people's health issues  <br>

and youth justice. All those matters must be brought together when considering the need for therapeutic treatment. My last attempt to get the provision of therapeutic treatment included in legislation was on Report on the Children and Young Persons Act 2008. As I recall, the Government had agreed to amend the Bill to make provision for medical assessment for children taken into care. I tabled amendments to link the provision of therapeutic treatment to that assessment where appropriate. I was advised by the Bill Clerks that it was a DCSF Bill and that it would therefore probably not be possible to have an amendment accepted for debate which would place a monetary commitment on the Department of Health. Sure enough, my amendments were not selected.</p>

We should not get the answer, "This is not my Department," if we are looking at the child as a whole. I made a similar plea for more therapeutic services two years ago in the Queen's Speech debate and was heartened by the response that I got from the then Secretary of State for Health, who said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para24"><a name="09111936000566">I do seek that, and I seek real movement on it before the general election.</p>

There will never be enough money, but there has been considerable investment. However, that pot of money will not necessarily help the children about whom I am talking, because they may not have a diagnosable mental health condition, for example, and not all children and young people will wish to receive CAMH services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para26"><a name="09111936000568">The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children delivers excellent programmes, and Action for Children is doing a lot of work with children in care, including running some pilots for the Government on the provision of therapeutic treatment. There is a lot of good work, but we need more. The Barnardo's report "Whose Child Now?", published just this week, identifies the need for better services in local authorities, to provide special support to children who are sexually exploited or at risk. We need more preventive work in all our local authorities to stop sexual exploitation and truly tackle trafficking rather than pretend it does not exist. When it sadly does happen, there needs to be appropriate treatment and counselling if young people are to be able to go on in life and fulfil their full potential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para27"><a name="09111936000569">I congratulate the Secretary of State in particular on his commitment to supporting disabled children and their families, but I recently came across a local case in which there was a battle between the primary care trust and social services about who would pay for the support in overnight care that was necessary for a very sick child to be returned home from hospital and restored to his parents. The battle was acted out over four to six weeks, with the parents tragically in the middle. I hope that everybody is happy now, because three nights' support are being provided by the PCT and two by children's services, but why should the family have been in the  <br>

middle of that tussle? That is one family, needing one set of services. Why cannot we do these things better?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para28"><a name="09111936000570">I wish to touch on maternity services, which are a local issue that the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) will also be concerned about. When we are talking about good outcomes for children and young people, we have to go back and get pre-birth services right. Equally, it is really important that mothers have a good experience at the time of the birth, because attachment to the baby, love and caring are all-important. If there is not a strong bonding, perhaps because of an unfortunate situation at birth, it can lead to all sorts of further problems. We have to get that right at this level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para29"><a name="09111936000571">My granddaughter was born on Poole maternity unit just 16 months ago. Although it was a proud moment, I was shocked at the physical state of the buildings. A few months later, on a routine visit to the chief executive of Poole hospital, I mentioned that I had been deeply shocked. It had been many years since I had last been there, but clearly the buildings were outdated and it was difficult for staff to operate in such conditions. I was reassured at the time because I was told that everything was in hand for a new maternity unit to be built. That is long overdue and the existing buildings are past their sell-by date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para30"><a name="09111936000572">Poole hospital is an important, main hospital serving a large area, including my constituency, and has really tackled the Government's agenda. It was recently awarded a double "excellent" rating. What more can we ask of an NHS hospital? It has been ranked as the safest hospital in the country, because of how it has tackled infections. We are not talking, therefore, about a badly managed hospital-quite the contrary. Yet problems have arisen with the funding for the new maternity unit. I make a special plea to the Minister to look into the matter. The unit is much needed in a hospital that has been managed extremely well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para31"><a name="09111936000573">We are approaching the 20th anniversary of the signing of the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, and I am really disappointed that no one from the Department for Children, Schools and Families is here. The anniversary should be acknowledged in all debates today given that we are debating the Queen's Speech on health and education. That is really important. We have some wonderful programmes in our schools on the rights and responsibilities agenda put forward by UNICEF over the years. I am sure that many hon. Members will be visiting schools to celebrate the 20th anniversary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="91119-0013.htm_para32"><a name="09111936000574">I make a plea to the Government: so much has been done and the Government are getting much better reports when they go to the United Nations and talk about the progress that has been made, but this country has not fully implemented the convention, despite being an early signatory. We need to care about, for example, children in detention and asylum seekers' children, and fundamental issues need to be addressed. As we face the 20th anniversary, we have much to celebrate, but we need to ensure that we put our children first and foremost.</p>

two main parties. We should compare the partisan, petty approach taken consistently by the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families with the thoughtful and responsible approach taken by my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para0"><a name="09111936000576">In truth, there are not so many things that divide us: we are all committed to creating an education system that is fit for purpose and in which teachers are valued and their roles recognised. Most important, we must do everything to ensure that educational opportunities for the most vulnerable children from the poorest families are as great as for those from better-off families. In order to make progress, we must recognise the reality of the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09111936000577">The debate is not just a sterile exchange of data. The truth is that the Secretary of State said repeatedly that the gap between rich and poor had narrowed. Despite being prompted repeatedly, he failed to provide any evidence for that. We always end up with a slightly mixed picture, depending on the data that we look at, but the truth is that most independent assessments suggest that the gap between rich and poor has not been narrowed. That is something that all of us across the House should be worried about. We should work consensually to provide a framework for teachers, schools and parents to ensure that the current injustice in opportunity through education is addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09111936000578">I plan to focus my remarks on the proposals that we are told will be in the Children, Schools and Families Bill to deal with elective home education. Elective home education is where children who have either never been to school-some parents may never put their children into school-or been taken out of school, which can happen for various reasons, are educated at home. I want to put on record my tribute to the commitment, enthusiasm and success of the many parents and children involved in elective home education. They have been shocked and horrified at how they have been portrayed. Even in yesterday's Queen's Speech, the Government's proposals for the compulsory registration of all home-educated children was put under the heading of "safeguarding", suggesting, as Ministers have done repeatedly, that there is some stigma or safeguarding problem with home-educated children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para3"><a name="09111936000579">The picture is complex. There are children who are electively home educated because the schools have effectively pushed them out, because they do not want children who are not succeeding to lower their percentages for certain targets. There are also children suffering from bullying, children with special needs that are not recognised and sometimes even children with special needs that are recognised, but who are deeply miserable at school. A complex set of people are covered by elective home education; but have the Government, if they are serious and concerned about it, set out to get a comprehensive understanding of children who are electively home educated? Have they tried to get robust data? I would put it to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that the Government have not done that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para4"><a name="09111936000580">The Badman review, which the Government commissioned, failed to tackle the issue. Badman said in his first report:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09111936000581">However, Badman was not even certain about that:</p>
<a name="91119-0014.htm_brev1"><a name="09111936000897"><ul><p class="tabletext">"We know that to be an underestimate and agree it is likely to be double that figure"-</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09111936000582">in other words, more like 40,000 young people-</p>
<a name="91119-0014.htm_brev2"><a name="09111936000898"><ul><p class="tabletext">"if not more, possibly up to 80,000 children."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09111936000583">After people involved in home education challenged the Badman review's findings, which suggested that more of the children involved had child protection plans, Badman went out again, to gather additional data. He then came back and told the Select Committee on Children, Schools and Families that children with child protection plans-that is, children about whom local authorities have the greatest concern-accounted for 0.4 per cent. of electively home-educated children, which he compared with the national average for all children of 0.2 per cent. He therefore said-he said it on the record, in a letter to the Committee-that the percentage of home-educated children who are subject to child protection plans is double the percentage for the population as a whole. Yet his numbers were based on the 20,000 who were known to be registered, and he himself said that the figure was probably at least double that. When challenged by me in the Committee, he failed even to understand and, in a later letter to the Committee, again failed to accept the basic point that if there are at least 40,000 home-educated children, as appears to be the truth from his evidence, and if every child on a child protection plan is known to the local authority by necessity of being on such a plan, it is clear that the percentage of home-educated children with a child protection plan is, if anything, probably lower than the national average overall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para8"><a name="09111936000584">Therefore, the whole idea that there is a special risk around the home-educated population appears to have no supporting data. I would say that children who may be a cause for concern to local authorities are sometimes taken out of school, perhaps to disguise behaviour, abuse by parents and the rest of it. Then there are issues with Traveller communities. We have no information, particularly from Badman, about the number of children moving around the country all the time. Children in a number of categories may or may not be greater cause for concern. However, it is clear that for the broad number of dedicated electively home-educated children, the risk of their being on a child protection plan and thus at risk of abuse appears to be less than for the population overall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para9"><a name="09111936000585">The fundamental basis of Badman and the Government's approach-that there is a problem from a safeguarding point of view that needs to be solved-seems to be statistically flawed. The Government should not be rushing forward with legislation to introduce compulsory registration and possibly to erode the civil liberties of the families concerned; they should be building a much better understanding of the system overall. What do the Government's proposals mean for children's services, social workers and those involved in home education? More work load and yet another database.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para10"><a name="09111936000586">One expert from the reference group to the Badman review said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para12"><a name="09111936000588">However, the Secretary of State seems to have made up his mind. He talked today of giving parents the support that they need, but we know that he has been described by the hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) as a "bit of a bully", and we know what happens to parents who reject his support. Parents on benefits, whose children stand little chance today of getting the grades that they need to help them escape poverty, are told to be grateful for all the money that Labour has spent, despite the fact that the outcomes have not been delivered. Parents who go to desperate lengths to avoid the inadequate school dished out to them are labelled as failing to do their duty. And parents who want to set up their own school? Not in the Secretary of State's name.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para13"><a name="09111936000589">As for parents who reject the Secretary of State's school system entirely and sacrifice their time and career to bring up and educate their children themselves, they are stigmatised as more likely to be child abusers than normal people. It is an absolute affront to those in the home education community, and it is baseless. The scheme is all about getting home educators in a headlock and forcing their children back into the Balls fold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para14"><a name="09111936000590">On the cost of the proposals, the Department for Children, Schools and Families has estimated that the registration and monitoring scheme would cost Â£21 million to set up and Â£7 million a year to run. That would pay, just about, for 1.5 additional staff members for each local authority in England. Is that enough to cover the additional demands of registration, database maintenance and additional inspections? A former head of research at Citigroup estimated the cost of launching and running the scheme at Â£500 million. Whatever figure one wants to choose-I imagine that it is somewhere between the two-a huge resource will be spent setting up a registration system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para15"><a name="09111936000591">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke), who speaks for the Liberal Democrats, said that she has been persuaded that a light-touch registration scheme for home-educated children would be appropriate. At first glance it looks as if that would offer benefits, just as with ID cards it seemed obvious at first glance that they would provide us with defence against terrorism and make us more secure. The more we gained an understanding of how ID cards would actually work and of the nature of the terrorist threat, the more the efficacy of ID cards to help us in that regard melted away. I would suggest that the idea of light-touch registration to make children safer or to make it more likely that they will get a suitable education will, on closer inspection, also melt away. I put it to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that people who move around the country will not be caught by the net, but the typical people who will be caught by it are those who live in one place, who are committed to elective home education yet have to face someone from a local authority coming and knocking on their door.</p>

 I endorse the hon. Gentleman's point. Does he agree that one of the big problems is the confusion of education and child protection? If I am teaching in a school, I am hopefully trained to recognise signs of child abuse and will report it to the appropriate authorities, which will not have to set out to solve it. Is not the problem the attempt to wrap this all into one, instead of being clear about what the issues are?</p>

 The hon. Lady is absolutely right that the two issues-safeguarding children who might be at risk and ensuring a suitable education for all children-have been mixed up. As I say, the data on the safeguarding issue suggest that elective home education in and of itself is not a problem area, although there may be groups covered by that heading and certain children who need greater support. We do ourselves no favours by mixing up the two issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para17"><a name="09111936000595">The Badman report's recommendation 7 said:</p>
<a name="91119-0014.htm_brev4"><a name="09111936000900"><ul><p class="tabletext">"That designated local authority officers should... have the right of access to the home".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para18"><a name="09111936000596">That right applies not after being given cause for concern or because the local authority has reason to believe that the child is not being properly educated or that the child is at risk or because of any issue whatsoever. This is a profound right to enter the home as the local authority sees fit. The recommendation also states that those officers should</p>
<a name="91119-0014.htm_brev5"><a name="09111936000901"><ul><p class="tabletext">"have the right to speak with each child alone if deemed appropriate".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para19"><a name="09111936000597">The Badman review thus recommends that local authorities, some of which will have significantly let down the families and the children concerned by failing to tackle fully any under-performing schools or by leaving children and families traumatised and upset, should be given the right to march into the home to start monitoring and make an assessment of the child's education. That is fundamentally wrong and if the Secretary of State's intervention on the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) means that that will not happen, it is good news. I say to the Minister of State, Department of Health, the right hon. and learned Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien), who is in his place on the Front Bench, that I would be most grateful if that assurance could be repeated in the summing-up speech. That would provide enormous reassurance to people.</p>

We do not want children below the radar or children who are not known to anyone-that is what moved the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole and one can go along with her on that. If, however, we look at the detail of how it might work, we need to think about what "light touch" actually means. Does it mean that there is a registration system at local authority level and that the local authority then does nothing with it, or are we going to ensure, as Badman recommends, that every child who registers is visited within one month of registration? Local authorities do not have the resources to provide for that, so I can easily see that instead of the scarce resources of local authorities being used to give support where it is most  <br>

needed-to families that are crying out for the extra support-we will end up with a bureaucratic procedure whereby the limited, overstretched staff will be forced to go around visiting family after family after family even though there are no issues and no concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para21"><a name="09111936000599">In the meantime, under a system that is supposed to ensure the provision of education and safety for children, what will actually happen-and it is typical of this new Labour Government, who are so wedded to bureaucracy and databases-is that the families most in need will be let down, because local authorities will not have the resources that would allow them to do something positive with the information that they are given. What else could happen? If local authorities obtain, in one way or another-from central Government or from their own resources-additional funds to invest in home education, and if we follow the Badman recommendations, we shall see local authority officers repeatedly entering homes and monitoring educational progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para22"><a name="09111936000600">A fundamental principle of our system of government has been that parents are responsible for delivering the education of their children. It is parents who should take the lead, not the state. I fear that this draft Bill may change fundamentally the relationship between the state and parents, and that from now on the overarching responsibility for the welfare and education of children will be assumed to rest with arms of the state. The state will have to come in and satisfy itself that local authority officers cannot be sued and that their defensive position is watertight. We do not want them to get into trouble, so if we follow the Badman recommendations, they will have the right to enter homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para23"><a name="09111936000601">I have another reason for asking the Minister to ensure that we hear a repetition of the Secretary of State's earlier pledge that local authority officers would not go into homes-if, indeed, I heard him aright. In June the Secretary of State wrote to Badman, saying that</p>
<a name="91119-0014.htm_brev6"><a name="09111936000902"><ul><p class="tabletext">"LAs need greater powers to monitor...home educated children must be seen regularly in their education setting".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para24"><a name="09111936000602">That clearly suggests that local authority officers would go into the homes of home educators, but it also suggests that the Secretary of State fails to grasp the nature of much of home education. There is not necessarily a classroom in the home. Home-educated children are educated in libraries, in local leisure centres, in the park and when visiting country houses. They are educated everywhere, and a great deal of their education takes place on an autonomous basis: in other words, the child leads the education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para25"><a name="09111936000603">Academics have studied this matter, including one at the Institute of Education in London. He said that he was sceptical at first, but has become convinced that autonomous education, including many of the alternative approaches adopted by home educationists, is tremendously effective, ensuring that children are educated in a way that is sympathetic to their needs and interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para26"><a name="09111936000604">I hope that the Minister will tell us what percentage of home-educated children the Government expect to register. Will only families in one place be pursued and possibly prosecuted? Will peripatetic families escape the net?

on the various local databases? And-this is a key question for many home educationists-should failing local authorities be allowed to decide what a suitable education looks like, when so many of their own schools and institutions are not delivering? Is that right? Is it right for the state to take away from families the overarching responsibility to ensure the education of their children?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="91119-0014.htm_para27"><a name="09111936000605">Why cannot the Government adopt a humbler approach? Why can they not invest more money in research, enabling us to gain a better understanding of who is not at school and who is being educated at home? Why can we not be given a better understanding of where problems might lie among electively home-educated people? Why can we not have a voluntary registration system, perhaps involving additional financial support for families educating children at home? The present position is absurd. A home educator told our Select Committee that one father had to pay Â£1,000 to cover the cost of GCSE exams taken by his daughter, although he was a taxpayer like the rest of us.</p>

Why can they not work with people on a voluntary basis, build up the picture and then and only then-with a complete picture and a real understanding of the risks in respect of safeguarding and education-come forward with proposals, which might involve compulsory registration if there is due and proper cause. Due and proper cause does not currently exist, and I sincerely hope those aspects of the Children, Schools and Families Bill that deal with home education will not become law.</p>

I certainly vividly remember the first one I attended, which was in 1997 and was replied to by Sir John Major. It was clear at that stage that the new Government were in the ascendancy; the place was packed with Labour Members. Some of us who had arrived in this place for the first time were keen to make a contribution, but the Conservative parliamentary party as a whole was very dispirited; that was clear from how  <br>

empty the Conservative Benches were. In that respect, things have changed a lot over the subsequent 12 or 13 years. This is the Queen's Speech of the current Government of course, and yet we have had only one contribution from the Government Benches so far-although we may have another powerful contribution in a moment. It seems that we on the Opposition Benches are keener to contribute than Members sitting on the Government side.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="91119-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09111936000610">The Labour party abandoned clause 4 but it still seems to think that Whitehall knows best. It still thinks that if it pulls a lever, passes a law, or has a press conference in London, that will change the world. Indeed, a substantial number of the Bills that have gone through Parliament have had elements that have not been enacted or have not been introduced. From my experience of the past 13 years, I firmly believe that the only way of getting proper public services that are delivered well is to trust the people who are delivering them and those who are the recipients of them. I truly believe that decisions made in Dorset are generally better than decisions made in Whitehall. In terms of, for instance, the police authority, the fire authority or local government, an awful lot more can be done if we give people the resources and let them get on with the job, rather than always try to second-guess and always be introducing changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="91119-0015.htm_para2"><a name="09111936000611">My experience of the health service over the past 12 or 13 years is that there has been constant change-health authorities have been changed, and there have been mergers. However, I have never known a change in the NHS or in local government to have either saved money or delivered better services; indeed, it is often a distraction from the delivery of decent services. If my party is fortunate enough to win the confidence of the British people in the middle of next year, one of the lessons that I hope my Front-Bench colleagues will learn is not to go in and immediately make fundamental changes. We should leave people in post, let them do the job, and give them clear targets. The "Whitehall knows best" approach is unsustainable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="91119-0015.htm_para3"><a name="09111936000612">I was going to mention home education, which my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) dealt with eloquently and in more detail than I had intended to do. There are many parents who are committed to educating their children-some because their children have special needs or autism, and it is the only way they feel able to educate them-who feel they have been stigmatised, although I know that that was not the Government's intention. They already undergo an inspection regime, which they feel is fundamentally wrong. I therefore hope that if the education Bill becomes law before the election, we can iron out some of these difficulties.</p>

He made some very good points, none of which I disagreed with. For example, he made a very good point about social mobility. One of my first experiences of politics involved Wiltshire county council. Several teachers who had retired decided to reappear on the county council. Most of them had grown up in areas of great poverty; some were from south Wales, and their fathers had been miners.

were able to enter and make a contribution to teaching because the education system was able to give them the qualifications and skills and get them out of the mining villages. As all the social statistics are saying, we have lost some of the social mobility that our grammar school system, in particular, provided for many of our less fortunate constituents. I hope that a Conservative Government look to tackle that issue. The idea behind Disraeli's "one nation" conservatism is to give everybody the opportunity to use the skills that they have to get on. We have lost a lot of that.</p>

Well, the Flood and Water Management Bill is a good one; water is a valuable element. Subject to seeing the detail of the Child Poverty Bill, I think it a good thing that we will be legislating in that area. I do not think there is any great disagreement with the bribery Bill, and we Conservatives agree with the cluster munitions Bill. There are many Bills that we partly support.</p>

One reason why we are where we are with our finances is the changes undertaken in the first flourish of the current Government: they gave independence to the Bank of England, but took away that large and important element of bank supervision. The country lost a lot as a result, and the Financial Services Authority has never fulfilled the same role with the confidence that the Bank of England showed.</p>

I am always a little suspicious when people put into Bills aspirations for the longer term, rather than actions to deal with the given issue. We have a major problem with the public finances, and it will be a priority for whoever is elected in the middle of next year. Unless we tackle it, our children and grandchildren will be paying the very real costs of dealing with the heavy level of debt and the associated interest payments, which will divert money from important public services unless we grasp the nettle at a very early stage.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) and our Front-Bench team now have a coherent policy programme that they can put to our country. That will make a major difference. I can honestly say that whereas the last three general elections were a foregone conclusion, the next one will be a fight, and there is a real chance that we can have a change of Government.

very much involved in the Child Poverty Action Group. Coincidentally, this Queen's Speech refers to the Child Poverty Bill and, in a way, I suppose that prompted me to think about coming in here to say a few words, especially given that this debate is on health and education, which are near and dear to my heart.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="91119-0015.htm_para9"><a name="09111936000619">I listened to the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms), who talked about passing laws. He said that that was almost a waste of time, despite suggesting a few at the end himself. It is important to remember that we do a lot of things in life and here in Parliament. We pass laws-Labour Members certainly do this-to try to better the lot of the many and not the few. That is one of the reasons why I wish to start off by talking about pleural plaques, which is a health issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="91119-0015.htm_para10"><a name="09111936000620">A couple of years ago, the Law Lords, across there in the other place, decided that even though pleural plaques had been recognised for many years as the precursor to mesothelioma, which, as we all know, is one of the worst diseases that anyone can get, they would get rid of the compensation. I hope that the Minister of State, Department of Health, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) will pass the message on, although we have already had meetings with the Prime Minister about this matter. Although it is not specifically mentioned in this Queen's Speech, it comes under the general heading of "any other measures"-I suppose that expenses could be thrown into that too. It is necessary to ensure that we make progress on this issue to restore the position to what it was way back in 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="91119-0015.htm_para11"><a name="09111936000621">Another thing that I want to say to my right hon. and learned Friend is that we do not want a scheme that will be similar to the one that the miners had for chest disease and vibration white finger. That was a wonderful scheme in itself-it got us about Â£4 billion to Â£5 billion for miners who were suffering from chest disease and vibration white finger-but it had, built within it, a system that forced every miner to have a separate solicitor. The net result was that the solicitors got a lot of money out of it. I must say to the House that we do not have to have that kind of system, because our system for pleural plaques and for mesothelioma could have a different basis. It could be based on the scheme that we had for pneumoconiosis back in 1974 and 1975 and for the slate miners in Wales in 1979. What we did then was introduce benefits based on the severity of the disease; we are talking about perhaps 10, 15 or 20 per cent. and it did not matter which pit someone worked at, that was the amount of money they would get. The pneumoconiosis scheme was completed by the Labour Government in 1974-75 in next to no time. No solicitors were involved, no solicitors got paid and every penny went to the miners and to the slate workers in Wales. What I am saying is that from here on in the Government should remember that scheme and introduce a pleural plaques scheme on that basis, so that we steer clear of these solicitors' making a small fortune out of every case.</p>

The other is that we should also remember that help for cancer is very important. I speak with a bit of authority on this, although I never thought 10 years ago that I would.

knew a lot about the NHS but, frankly, I knew very little until I went in, when I realised that I had a big problem and had to have an operation to remove the cancer. It is then that we realise the importance of the NHS and of passing laws.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="91119-0015.htm_para13"><a name="09111936000623">We raised the sum that was spent on the national health service from Â£33 billion in 1997 to about Â£106 billion today. When I lay there in that hospital, it was in the knowledge that more money would be coming from a Labour Government than had been in the tube. I do not think that we can avoid that argument. The Tories refused to support us in the 1 per cent. increase in national insurance and they made a big mistake. I am sure that they all recognise that now, because the national health service has grown in strength ever since we took that decision way back in 2001. That is why almost everybody who works in hospitals understands the ethos.</p>

When someone is in intensive care, they see the wonderful teamwork. People can be seen answering telephones while dressed in suits, and suddenly patients see the same faces in nurses' uniforms helping because there is a crisis. It is like going back to those days when teamwork was essential working down a coal mine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="91119-0015.htm_para15"><a name="09111936000625">That is why we should all treasure the national health service. Of course, nobody is going to say that it is 100 per cent. perfect-it never will be. We have an ageing population-I am one of them-and once a person has been in, they keep going in. I have been to hospital in London more than 20 times ever since I had that operation. I have been for check-ups and for this, that and the other, hoping that everything is okay. That is why the Â£33 billion that is now Â£106 billion was not wasted on people who should not be there. A lot of people over the age of 60, once they start using the NHS, are going to use it for a long time. That is what we have to understand and what any Government will have to understand in the future. We must ensure that the NHS has the money to keep up that progress.</p>

done, but it was one of the first things that happened under Labour because we injected a load more money into schools. We now spend about two and a half times more on schools in real money than in 1997. The result was that I got a new school in Bolsover. The Church of England school has been moved away from the castle to Welbeck road. There is a brand-new school. The kids have been down here about three times on visits. The same thing is true right across my constituency and I am sure that it is mirrored up and down the country. I want to ensure that it continues.</p>

I finished up with a United Nations heart. I had a Dutch doctor, a Syrian cardiologist and a Malaysian surgeon-the same one who operated on the last Speaker but one, Betty Boothroyd. He is one of the top five in the world. All those people worked together. If I had been in hospital for that open-heart surgery another month, I would have sorted out the Israeli-Palestine issue. All the ingredients were there. In a hospital, it does not matter where people have come from-they all work together.

I have been looking at the unemployment figures, and for the past two months, they have been going in the right direction. I thought it would be the turn of the year before we would see that. It is a wonderful and valuable indication of the fact that the stimulus we injected in the economy is beginning to work, particularly on jobs. We should remember that in the run-up to the next election.

We have been living in a credit card society where people do not appreciate that they have to struggle to get something valuable. They have been able to get things at a whim.

It lasted much longer than that. It was only when German rearmament took place under Hitler that our Government suddenly realised that they wanted more coal, and my father and his mates were able to get back to full-time work in the pits.

 There are not many occasions on which I agree with the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner), but there is one issue on which I do: the importance of a national health service. Last night in my constituency, I held a meeting, and more than 200 people turned up to hear about the plans to cut accident and emergency and other services at the King George hospital. That hospital serves my Ilford, North, constituency and is based in the neighbouring constituency of Ilford, South. Not one person in the room, with the exception of the representatives from the primary care trust, thought that it would be a good idea to cut services in the accident and emergency department. Not one of the clinicians who came to see me beforehand thought that it was a good idea. The only people who said that it was a good idea were the people from the primary care trust who proposed it.</p>

I was told that even though it has an active accident and emergency service, they would not be seen there, but would be taken to Queen's hospital in Romford. That is a new hospital, and I am very happy that the people of Romford have it, but we have to look at what it has replaced. There was a hospital in Harold Wood; there was already a hospital in Romford; and there was the King George hospital. Now the proposal is for just one A and E department, based in Romford, to serve all my constituents.</p>

That is what I pledged to do, and that is what I will continue to do while I have the honour of serving as the Member of Parliament for Ilford, North. To those ends, I ask, as I did earlier when I intervened on the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, the Government to intervene, to stop the proposals now and to impose a moratorium. I thank my party's Front-Bench spokesmen for saying that they support that. There should be a moratorium until after the general election, when what is best for the residents of Redbridge-for my constituents-can be considered and discussed outside a political forum.</p>

He said that he wanted the success of Marks and Spencer to be repeated in the NHS, because it gave its customers what they wanted. Well, the customers of the NHS in the London borough of Redbridge do not want to lose their accident and emergency department. If it were lost, it would be the equivalent of Marks and Spencer saying, "This is our best-selling line, so we're not going to stock it any more." I urge the Government to make the intervention that I have requested, and in the winding-up speeches perhaps we will hear whether they are willing to do so and put a stop to the closure now.</p>

In various debates over the years in which I have been in the House, I have called for the ring-fenced funding of education provision for children suffering from autism and Asperger's. The issue was not mentioned in the Queen's Speech, but I ask whether it, too, can be looked at under the heading, "Other measures".

What a damning indictment of any Government that so many children live in child poverty. One only has to look at the efforts of Shelter to focus attention on the Government's failure to provide decent housing for all our people, despite having the world's fifth richest economy. After 12 years of a new Labour Government, they should hang their head in shame.

The following day, I had a meeting with the then Schools Minister and officials, in which we were given assurances that by September last year a federation of those two schools and Stanway school could be in place, under the executive headship of the inspirational head teacher, Mr. Jonathan Tippett.</p>

Bearing in mind that Colchester is the fastest growing borough in the country, it said it would transfer the children to other schools, one of which, as we now know-it was never put in the public domain, but the leader of Essex county council has confirmed it to the leadership of Colchester borough council-would have to expand to 2,500 pupils. To the best of my knowledge, Conservative Front Benchers do not wish to have secondary schools of up to 2,500 pupils.

I urge Ministers to reiterate the fact that it is Government policy to encourage the concept of super-heads. I was not too enthusiastic when I first heard about it, but one particular head, Mr. Tippett, has transformed Stanway school into arguably the best secondary school in Colchester-I have to say "arguably" because other schools may disagree. He has transformed Thomas Lord Audley from a failing school to one that last year produced the best exam results in its history, sailing past the Government's artificial target of a 30 per cent. pass rate. In September this year, the number of pupils joining at year 7 was the highest for many years; and this at an allegedly failing school in a town of falling rolls.

I have a further education college in my constituency that is a building site. We need an explanation for that.</p>

I encourage Ministers, their advisers, researchers and experts, to look at that Act, because in the midst of war, politicians from all parties realised that something better for the young people of this nation was called for. The Act was about more than just teaching in the classroom. It was a passport for young people for future generations. It was for education, but it also dealt with social matters, through the school meals service, and, linking with the health aspect of the debate, it introduced medical, eye and dental checks. If this Government, or any Government, could get back to the ethos and principles of the 1944 Act, many aspects of the health problems in this country would be addressed. I urge the Minister to look at the thinking behind the Act and the cross-party consensus that brought it about.</p>

If our young people, from the age five upwards, were given first aid training in schools, they would automatically learn every aspect about themselves-good eating and healthy lifestyles as well as the dangers of excess smoking, taking illegal drugs and substances, obesity and so on. That would bring together health and education and dramatically reduce the number of people who end up at accident and emergency departments who, frankly, should not be there.</p>

We had the extraordinary situation about 18 months ago that education officials-the professionals-were putting forward a case for closing two schools and amalgamating them on one site as an academy. However, they were told by their political master-the person who took over the education portfolio after he had dispensed with the previous post holder's services-that both would shut. The schools would not be amalgamated, and the children were to be shipped away. The Tory leader of the county council said to me, "I've got to get those children off those estates so that they can be taught with the children of more aspirational families."</p>

That is not on. I am not having any part of my constituency treated in that way.

We all do, but that is the broad picture and I want to explore the detail. I do not support wasteful public expenditure. In the current economic climate, there is no guarantee that the Â£130 million that the county council has talked about will materialise. Members of the Conservative administration in the county council want to rush the closure project through, and the irony is that they are doing so because they fear that there will be cuts if their party forms the next Government.</p>

There is no guarantee that the Â£130 million will materialise, and in any event it would be much cheaper to the public purse, in both capital and revenue terms, if the two threatened schools remained open and serving their local communities, because several hundred thousand pounds a year will be needed to transport youngsters. The journeys will be 2 to 3 miles in the case of my constituents, but in the case of those in the neighbouring constituency, they will be tortuous 14-mile journeys across country from West Mersea on the island of Mersea across to Tiptree. They are not my constituents, so I cannot speak for them, but I can speak for my constituents, who do not want their schools shut.</p>

Unfortunately, getting the matter before it is virtually impossible. A Member of Parliament cannot do so, nor can Colchester borough council, but I hope that the Government can say to the OSA, "Please investigate these figures, because they do not add up." We know that there will be a shortage of secondary school places in Colchester. The capital sum required for the secondary schools reorganisation under Building Schools for the Future could be dramatically reduced by retaining the Alderman Blaxill and Thomas Lord Audley schools. It is agreed that the Sir Charles Lucas secondary school in the north of the town needs to be replaced. I do not agree that it should be replaced with an academy, but I  <br>

In a letter that I have with me from the leader of Essex county council to the leader of Colchester borough council, he tries to explain what would happen if a new access road were not provided to one of the secondary schools. I find it hard to believe that the whole future of a Â£130 million Building Schools for the Future project depends on an access road being put across a piece of public open space.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="91119-0016.htm_para24"><a name="09111936000668">Earlier this month, the Minister for Schools and Learners wrote to the leader of Colchester borough council, stating:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="91119-0016.htm_para25"><a name="09111936000669">Interesting. In a letter to me dated three days later, 12 November, Partnerships for Schools stated that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="91119-0016.htm_para26"><a name="09111936000670">There was then confirmation from the leadership of Colchester borough council that the leader of Essex county council had told them that the Philip Morant school would need to expand to up to 2,500 pupils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="91119-0016.htm_para27"><a name="09111936000671">In an open and democratic society, we cannot have Essex county council or any council proceeding on figures that have been massaged or claims that do not stand up to examination. For example, it has put forward the case for the BSF expenditure on educational grounds, yet I am told that Colchester has the sixth highest GCSE results of all the parliamentary constituencies in Essex and is above the Essex average.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="91119-0016.htm_para28"><a name="09111936000672">What is going on? I believe that what is going on is that Colchester is the only local authority area in the whole county of Essex that is not run by the Conservatives. The inspirational leadership of Mr. Jonathan Tippett has turned around not one, not two but three secondary schools. He is exactly the sort of executive head or super-head that the Government say they want. There is already a guy there doing it, so let him do it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="91119-0016.htm_para29"><a name="09111936000673">If necessary, why can the Government not remove those three schools from Essex country council? That is what the population wants. It has no confidence or trust in the council or its officers, who, 18 months ago, made a case to justify amalgamating two schools, but who were then obliged, because of a direction from the political leadership, to do away with two schools. They then came forward with arguments that are now rapidly unravelling. I urge the Government to consider the details of the situation, because it is not acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="91119-0016.htm_para30"><a name="09111936000674">In conclusion, I point out that the leader of Essex county council is also a shadow Minister in Her Majesty's Opposition in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="91119-0016.htm_para31"><a name="09111936000676">My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, and the Prime Minister, at the start of their responses to the Gracious Speech, talked about the recent losses in Afghanistan. Last Sunday, Rifleman Andrew Fentiman, from my constituency, died in Helmand province, so is now among those whom we have lost. His lieutenant, Lieutenant Heap from 7th Battalion the Rifles, said of him:</p>
<a name="91119-0016.htm_brev6"><a name="09111936000909"><ul><p class="tabletext">"He died alongside his friends doing a job he loved".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="91119-0016.htm_para32"><a name="09111936000677">That says something powerful about the nature of the young people serving in Afghanistan. It should also further reinforce our determination to ensure that they have every support they need-by support, I mean not just equipment and other physical support, but moral and political support for their job in Afghanistan. I want to express our deepest sympathies to Andrew Fentiman's family in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="91119-0016.htm_para33"><a name="09111936000678">It has been an interesting debate. The hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) told us about education in Colchester. He was right to instance Rab Butler in the 1944 Education Act, and in doing so he struck a note in harmony with that of the hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman), who was one of only two Members to speak from the Government Back Benches, but who, in talking at the outset about the history of education policy, and the consensus, in many respects, on it, struck a powerful contrast with the Secretary of State, who sought not a consensus, but only to create his own absurd self-styled dividing lines, the purpose of which clearly is to manipulate educational policy for party political advantage. As far as I can tell, it comes to nothing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="91119-0016.htm_para34"><a name="09111936000679">Indeed, much of the Queen's Speech seems to have been constructed around party political opportunism, rather than public interest. That is a great pity, because we have talked today about two subjects-education and health-in which often, in the midst of debating, we find that we have shared objectives. We might have differences of opinion about the means by which those objectives can be met, but so often we have shared objectives and sometimes, as it turns out when we get into the debate, a great deal of commonality on what some of the underlying mechanisms should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="91119-0016.htm_para35"><a name="09111936000680">My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley) echoed what he had previously said we should see in the speech from the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay). He touched on a range of subjects, but in all respects was interesting, brief and to the point. In particular, I was struck by what he and-in an interesting speech-my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Evennett) said about education. They highlighted the importance of the quality of teaching. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) said from the Front Bench that the quality and status of teachers is central to the improvement of education.</p>

Friends reminded me in their speeches that 12 and a half years ago, shortly after I came here, my old politics teacher at Brentwood school in Essex retired. He visited Parliament for tea, and there were four of us who gave it to him: two Labour Members-the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) and the hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Hamilton)-along with myself and our former hon. Friend Howard Flight, the then Member for Arundel. Our teacher had taught us all  <br>

politics and inspired two Labour Members and two Conservative Members, which struck me as an admirable illustration of his capacity as a teacher. There were no Liberal Democrats, I hasten to add, as he was clearly a man whose inspiration to the art of politics obviously had all the right effects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="91119-0017.htm_para1"><a name="09111936000682">My hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) echoed the point that was made by the hon. Member for Huddersfield about young people getting a bad press. He also touched on an important health issue. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has said in a decision-I hasten to add that it is a provisional decision-that it does not propose to recommend sorafenib as a drug for primary liver cancer, which is a very serious disease. Only about 5 per cent. of those diagnosed with primary liver cancer are alive five years after diagnosis. There has been an increase in the number of people with primary liver cancer of about three and a half times in the past 30 years, so the issue is important. Even though it may have limited effects, sorafenib is recognised as the only drug of its kind available for treatment, as most patients at that stage will be beyond surgery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="91119-0017.htm_para2"><a name="09111936000683">If the Government are talking about guarantees, as they are in the context of patients' rights in the NHS, we have to find a means by which patients recognise that they have guaranteed access in the NHS to the treatment that they need when they need it. With sorafenib, of course it is unacceptable for pharmaceutical companies to have limitless opportunities to produce new drugs and simply ask the NHS to pay any sum of money. That is why I have made it clear that it will be our intention, the electorate permitting, to move to a system of value-based pricing in the NHS, so that the reimbursement price to pharmaceutical manufacturers should reflect the value of that medicine-the therapeutic value, the innovative value and, where appropriate, the wider value to society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="91119-0017.htm_para3"><a name="09111936000684">On that basis, the question should never be, "Should this drug be available on the national health service?" if it is licensed and effective; rather, that drug should be available for patients, and clinicians should have access to it. Then the argument will be between us and the pharmaceutical companies about what the appropriate reimbursement is. However, if we all genuinely believe that patients must come first, we must ensure that they have access to the medicines that they need, so I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley for making that point.</p>

 I listened to a patient speaking on the television this afternoon about the treatment that he receives. He gave the example of Norway, which is another country where the drug is made available. Does my hon. Friend agree that patients in this country who need that cancer drug will find it rather bizarre that it seems to be available in so many other European countries, yet not here?</p>

Having visited with him and talked subsequently to managers of the new trust formed in south-east London, I hope that additional services will be based at Queen Mary's in future. Looking at the population, there is obviously an opportunity for access to cancer services, for example, based at Queen Mary's. I hope that we can look to a positive future for hospital services based in Sidcup.</p>

I share entirely his view that the NHS seems to be in constant revolution as an organisation. Organisational upheaval and reform do not seem to correlate well. The organisational upheaval over the past decade seems to have impeded reform rather than furthered it. It is therefore important for us, as my hon. Friend says, to give people structural stability while ensuring that the dynamic process of reform happens. One touchstone of that will be, as he has stressed in his own constituency, the need for patients and local clinicians to be able to make decisions about where services can best be provided. He has been an effective advocate on behalf of his constituents. For that and for all the other reasons that he demonstrated in his speech, we will certainly miss him after the election in this place.</p>

Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) talked about the problems of child abuse and the number of children contacting ChildLine, and I note the extent to which children are now subjected to online bullying-cyberbullying. The other day, at Netherhall school in my constituency, I met a group of young people who I thought were doing an excellent job as cybermentors, in the school and online, to people who feel themselves victims of cyberbullying, helping them to deal with it effectively. That is just one more good example of the importance of recognising that there are many impressive young people doing very good things, which we should celebrate.</p>

Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) talked about home education, making some important points that tell us something broader about the nature of the relationship between the state and public services. Sometimes we have to trust people more. We have to trust that the decisions that parents make about their children and that patients make about their health care will sometimes, individually and in aggregate, be better than those made by a bureaucracy. I echo the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) when he said that decisions made in Dorset were better than decisions made in Whitehall.</p>

the Government Benches and nine from this side of the House. I am afraid that that is a telling and damning indictment of the Labour party's commitment to its own Government's legislative programme. It is the weak legislative programme of a tired Government clearly incapable of being supported by a tired Labour party that has run out of time, ideas and steam.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="91119-0017.htm_para10"><a name="09111936000693">However, it turns out that one person who never runs out of steam is the hon. Member for Bolsover. His killer sudoku seems to be working. I must say to him that his point about the impact of an ageing population on demand for health care services was right. On that basis, my right hon. Friends the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) and the shadow Chancellor and I have made it clear that we are committed to real-terms increases for the national health service in the life of the next Parliament. I must tell the hon. Gentleman that that commitment has not been matched by his own Prime Minister or those on his own Front Bench.</p>

Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Scott) talked about a meeting that he held last night in relation to the accident and emergency department at the King George hospital. He said, rightly, that we need to ensure-if necessary by imposing a moratorium after the general election, if the electorate permit us-that the proposals are not based on the impact of the European working time directive or a response to the failures of management. As my hon. Friend knows, there have been sequential failures in management of the health service in parts of north-east London, including his area. Rather, decisions about the configuration of services, particularly the commissioning decisions of local general practitioners, should respond to the needs and wishes of local people. There is no way that we should allow bureaucratic organisations to pre-empt access or service decisions made by local commissioners on behalf of local people under the sort of devolved decision making in the health service that we hope to introduce.</p>

 It may well be. One of the worst reasons for denying people access to health care services is as a result of the failures of management that have allowed deficits of that kind to build up. If it is the consequence of inequalities of access under the funding formula, we need a more independent and transparent process, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe rightly said, by which resources for the NHS are distributed across the country on the basis of a fair assessment of the prospective burden of disease in each area rather than on the Government's distorted funding formula.</p>

Health care is not mentioned in it. Arguably, then, on the basis of the Queen's Speech, this debate should not be about the health service. I think I know, however, why there was no mention of the NHS in the Queen's Speech; it is because the Government have no ideas about what to do in the NHS.

 Where is he now? I do not know. Perhaps he is somewhere in a corridor outside the Council of Ministers in Brussels-who knows? Three years ago, Tony Blair as Prime Minister said that there were drivers of reform in the national health service and that practice-based commissioning was going to be one of them. It stalled. The national clinical director for primary care at the Department of Health said the other day that practice-based commissioning was a "corpse" that was "not for resuscitation" and was</p>

It needs to be introduced and it needs to be reformed. It has stalled. Progress has not been made to the extent that it should have been. The Government literally took their feet off the accelerator on payment by results simply because they did not realise that it was bound to have an impact on the distribution of resources between hospitals. What they should have done is to move faster to a much more effective payment-by-results system that accurately reflected the costs of different procedures.</p>

Last year there were 28 new foundation trusts and there were 28 in the previous year; this year, there have been eight so far. The Health Bill of the last Session before prorogation showed the Government moving towards trying to de-authorise foundation trusts rather than to authorise more of them.</p>

Instead of having a policy of any willing provider who will meet NHS standards within NHS prices, which is the policy that we have consistently argued for and I thought that the Government had accepted, the Secretary of State writes a letter to the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress announcing a U-turn, saying that the NHS is going to be a preferred provider. Frankly, he was saying, social enterprises and the independent sector can go hang. The right hon.

The Government's narrow-process target suggests that if a patient receives treatment within 18 weeks that is good enough, but there are many patients for whom it is not good enough. There are many patients whose maximum waiting time should relate to their condition and circumstances. Just as education should be built around the individual needs of children, health care treatment should be built around and assessed according to individuals' health care needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="91119-0017.htm_para19"><a name="09111936000706">Because of the way in which the Government's target approach works, hospital clinicians often find that the bureaucracy has ordained that patients who have been referred should not see a consultant for eight weeks, and that a decision can be made after that. The consultant will suddenly find that a referral has been made without his or her knowledge, and that it relates to a patient who should have been seen on a more urgent basis. The problem is that patients are treated as if they were on a production line rather than on the basis of their clinical priorities. Identifying clinical priorities is central to providing patients with good-quality treatment in the future, although, in the case of many patients, that does not preclude the provision of quality indicators demonstrating the standard of treatment that should be provided. What I am saying-we have been saying it for a very long time-is only exactly what the Secretary of State himself said in January 2007. He said then:</p>
<a name="91119-0017.htm_brev2"><a name="09111936000912"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Overall, from 2009, there should be fewer national targets...Targets and priorities should be set locally wherever possible, within national service frameworks and national standards such as those set by NICE."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="91119-0017.htm_para20"><a name="09111936000707">We are looking for quality indicators set by NICE-the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence-making it clear what should be the basis of a contract between the commissioners and the providers of health care services. When the Government talk about legally enforceable rights, what they mean is that, through the contracts, patients should have access to the rights to treatment that are specified in the contract between commissioner and provider. That is exactly what we are talking about, and that is the kind of guarantee that we should be talking about. What we need in future is for patients to know what are their entitlements to treatment, and to know that those entitlements are reflected in the commissioning undertaken by their GPs on their behalf. The Government's "legal entitlement" is no such thing. What they are describing is simply an expression of a wish in the NHS constitution-a wish that, if it is to become a reality, must be turned into the contracts made between commissioners and providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="91119-0017.htm_para21"><a name="09111936000708">As I have said, the Government talk of guarantees, but where is their guarantee of access to the medicines that patients need at the point at which they need them? Where is their guarantee that patients will have access to a "zero tolerance of infection" environment in hospitals? We may talk of waiting times, but there is clear evidence that patients also want-perhaps want even more-to know that they are entering an environment in which they are much less likely to acquire an infection. The Government have not offered that guarantee, and, in  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="91119-0017.htm_para22"><a name="09111936000709">Where is the Government's guarantee of access to choice in maternity services or in end-of-life care? Where is the guarantee of access to local accident and emergency services to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North referred? If the Government are talking about guarantees and access, why are those kinds of access completely left out? If we then go down the path of making sure patients have such access, and we focus on the degree of quality that needs to be built into decisions on the purchasing of health care, we can concentrate on the outcomes. We can then move beyond the narrow targets that have been the obsession of this Government and that have distorted clinical priorities-and that in places such as Stafford have led, frankly, to the death of many patients who were discharged from accident and emergency departments on to wards to languish and to die. We can then also start to make up the difference between where we are and where we need to be in respect of so many of our key, great public services, including education and health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="91119-0017.htm_para23"><a name="09111936000710">There remains a persistent and unacceptable gap between the quality of outcomes achieved in this country and those achieved in some of the leading countries elsewhere in the world. In respect of health, since 1997, despite increasing spending threefold-as the hon. Member for Bolsover said-our ranking among European countries on deaths from disease has slipped from ninth to 10th. More people die in this country from diseases that are amenable to health care than the average for Europe. We have fallen behind other countries in our deaths from cancer rates, too. Deaths from lung disease-such as mesothelioma, which the hon. Gentleman talked about-are 75 per cent. higher in this country than the European average. People in the United Kingdom are twice as likely to die prematurely from a heart attack than in the best performing country in Europe, which is France. That is where we need to be. We must have the ambition to have the best outcomes in Europe-not just to spend as much as other countries in Europe, but to have outcomes that are at least as good as any in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="91119-0018.htm_para0"><a name="09111936000711">I want to mention two other important matters. First, the Government have announced this afternoon that they will extend the swine flu vaccination programme to the main carers of those who are very vulnerable and living at home, which I welcome, and to children aged between six months and five years. I welcome that, too; indeed, I have been making it clear to the Secretary of State for some considerable time that, as has been the situation in America, there is a good case for extending the vaccination programme to young people on the grounds of the evidence that is emerging of the much higher likelihood of young people who do not have existing underlying health conditions having complications from swine flu. The debate continues, and the Secretary of State has advised that the Government do not-yet-support a school-based vaccination programme, but I none the less think it is right for us to proceed in this way for very young people and to give positive consideration as to whether in the new year, when the vaccine is available and the existing priority groups have been  <br>

substantially dealt with, we should move on to offer vaccination to young people up to the age of, let us say, 24 or 25, in recognition of how many of them are hospitalised when they have swine flu and the pressure that there is on paediatric intensive care. I also join the Government in hoping that those who are offered vaccination will take it up, especially those working in the NHS and social care, and pregnant women given what we know about the risk of complications for them. There has been much inappropriate comment about the speed at which this vaccine has been made available, when we know the technology on which it is based is a proven technology that has been used in seasonal flu vaccines over many years and that there is no reason for people to resist it on this basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="91119-0018.htm_para1"><a name="09111936000712">The Queen's Speech proposes a personal care at home Bill. Last July, the Government, after having pursued for a very long time the idea that there should be a long-term consensus on social care-my colleagues and I had often made efforts to join in such a consensus, but the Government ignored that-published their Green Paper; they proceeded without such a consensus in place. What is subsequently astonishing is that, as Lord David Lipsey tellingly described it, they have even fired an Exocet at their own flagship. The Prime Minister has shot right through their own Green Paper by putting a further proposal forward that was not even in the Green Paper, and I understand that David Lipsey's view is that it runs counter to what ought to be the long-term consensus for a more comprehensive social care plan, because it would provide free personal care for a small minority of care users living at home with highest need, abandoning those with lesser care needs, but who, frankly, have seen local authority support to them diminishing. About 600,000 fewer people are now accessing local authority-arranged support in the moderate and lesser care need categories. So everything is being focused on the highest care need, but that does absolutely nothing for people in very high care need who go into long-term residential care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="91119-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09111936000713">The Prime Minister says, as Tony Blair did 13 years ago, that he does not want to live in a country where people have to sell their home to pay for care. Why does he think that happens? It happens because people go into long-term residential care when their home becomes at risk as a consequence of the means test, the cost of care rises dramatically and their homes have to be sold to pay for it. According to the latest estimate, 47,000 people a year still have to sell their homes to pay for care. Frankly, it is outrageous for the Prime Minister to publish an article suggesting that his proposal in the Queen's Speech yesterday will do anything about that; it will do nothing. Those going into long-term residential care will not be supported at all, and as David Lipsey rightly points out, sometimes it is necessary, right and in their own best interests for people to be admitted to long-term residential care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="91119-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09111936000714">We do need to establish a long-term consensus on social care. In the light of the speeches that I and my Conservative colleagues have made, not least to the national children and adult services conference in Harrogate, such a consensus is available. However, it is not available on the basis of scrapping attendance allowance and disability living allowance for those over 65, but on the basis of prevention.

enablement through prevention-is a step in the right direction. We need to do more on assistive technologies and on home adaptations and prevention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="91119-0018.htm_para4"><a name="09111936000715">The second principle is personalisation of care. More than 2 million older people with disabilities and needs are receiving attendance allowance of Â£60 a week on average, or disability living allowance of Â£75 a week on average. The Government's Green Paper proposals would take that away in order to pay for their national care service. Frankly, that is not acceptable. If personalisation of care is right, and it is, such people need to maintain access to cash benefits that they can use to support their care needs as they see fit. In particular, that means cash benefits that they can use to support family and informal carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="91119-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09111936000716">We support a national care service, which the Government are proposing; what we oppose is a nationalised care service. Instead of personal care and local authority involvement, the Government want to turn such a service into something driven only by bureaucracy and the state. As my colleagues made clear in their contributions, we have to listen to people; we have to let people make choices. We have to give patients, care users and parents the opportunity to control their public services. So we oppose the Government's nationalisation proposal; instead, we are in favour of creating a national care service through which people can access a common assessment that can be transferred around the country. That way, they will know they have support for keeping them independent at home and the ability to manage budgets on their own behalf, while getting the care they need. They will also know that, through our home protection scheme, they can buy into an insurance policy that means they genuinely will not necessarily face the threat of selling their homes to pay for long-term residential care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="91119-0018.htm_para6"><a name="09111936000717">The Government's "dividing lines" are an absurd political gimmick. What we actually have, as the Lord President of the Council and First Secretary of State-and grand panjandrum-describes it, is a choice. We have a choice between, on our part, ambitions for our national health service, or atrophy of reform on the Government's part. We have a choice between radical reform in education to deliver higher standards, or reactionary politicking by the Secretary of State. We have a choice between a future Government who are committed to our public services and to practical and workable solutions, and a Government who have run out of ideas and are using the public services as no more than a political football. We are committed to achieving the quality of public services that people have a right to expect, and not least to achieving the outcomes that will make our public services among the best in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="91119-0018.htm_para7"><a name="09111936000719">At the beginning of my contribution, I wish to set out the broad context for today's debate. Some 10 years ago, our crumbling hospitals and schools were a national embarrassment and were failing patients and parents, but today, after a decade of investment and reform, they are substantially rebuilt and provide a good service to the public; no longer are they the poor relation in Europe and the world; they instead receive accolades on the world stage. The respected US-based The Commonwealth Fund has tracked the progress in our NHS and, two weeks ago, it said that England had one of the best-if not the best-primary health care systems in the world. That is not only a huge tribute to all the staff who work in primary care in our constituencies and a particular tribute to the work of general practitioners-perhaps we do not praise them enough-but it is an endorsement of the Government's reform programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="91119-0018.htm_para8"><a name="09111936000720">The UK and England were ranked first of the 11 countries surveyed, which included Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the US, on the following criteria: low waiting times for specialist care; the use of multidisciplinary teams; the use of financial incentives to reward patient experience; the quality of clinical care; the management of chronic diseases; the use of data on patient experience; the reviewing of doctors' clinical performance; and the benchmarking of clinical performance. We were given that outstanding record of achievement in Washington. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="91119-0018.htm_para9"><a name="09111936000721">The evidence for that transformation in primary health care can be found in my constituency; we had a world of too few GPs working out of terraced houses, but we now have modern premises with more GPs providing a wide range of services to the public. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families would agree when I say that primary education has undergone a similar transformation to that of primary health care services. Our schools are now a joy to visit and are unrecognisable from the shabby and depressing buildings of 15 years ago. The primary heads in Leigh tell me that they have resources that they could once have only dreamed of. Through investment and reform, our public services have gone from poor to good-now the challenge is to make them even better.</p>

patients, pupils and parents. To do that, we are turning targets into rights and entitlements in order to guarantee the services and the standards that people expect and deserve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="91119-0018.htm_para10"><a name="09111936000726">The Children, Schools and Families Bill provides a range of guarantees to pupils and parents. It aims to help everyone reach their full potential, to make everyone aware of their entitlements and to allow everyone to seek redress if their expectations are not met. I particularly welcome the entitlements that will improve children's health. We propose that every five to 16-year-old should have access to five hours of high quality physical education and sport every week, in and out of the school day, and that every 16 to 19-year-old should have access to three hours of that. I also welcome our proposal that every pupil should have access to regular competitive sport, to coaching, to a choice of different sports and to help to lead and volunteer in sport. Furthermore, we propose that every pupil should go to a "Healthy School" that promotes healthy eating, an active lifestyle and emotional health and well-being. Those are genuine steps forward and I want to pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for introducing them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="91119-0018.htm_para11"><a name="09111936000727">In essence, the Bill is about the right to a rounded education. As someone who was unlucky enough to spend his entire secondary school career in a northern comprehensive under Mrs. Thatcher, I have always felt passionate about this. I saw the after-school activities-music, culture and sport-dry up in the teachers' dispute of the mid-1980s, never to return. These new guarantees would prevent that from ever happening again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="91119-0018.htm_para12"><a name="09111936000728">In the NHS, there will be a similar shift in power to the public from professionals. In the next period of reform, as we move towards a service that is more preventive and people-centred, empowered patients and staff will lead change. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire mentioned the reform journey and the ideas. I was the one who promised to remove practice boundaries and to give patients more choice in primary care. He mentioned payment by results, and we are introducing a further reform to the tariff to link payment to the quality of services provided. Where is he in these debates? I am putting forward these proposals, and he comes to the House today and asks where the changes are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="91119-0018.htm_para13"><a name="09111936000729">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the commitment to making the NHS the preferred provider. As we will have more reform, not less, in the coming period we will have to take more work out of the hospital setting and we will have to ask NHS staff to work in different settings. That is precisely why we must give the NHS the chance, the space and the time to rise to the challenge, and to make those changes and to improve health care as a result.</p>

We must go further towards a more people-centred service. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire asked where the choice was in end-of-life care. I will tell him where the choice in end-of-life care is. I asked for consultation on a right for the public to choose to die at home. I think that that is a sensible choice to offer the public. I am consulting on it right now, so if the hon. Gentleman would care to read the odd thing that the Department puts out, he will see that we are ahead of the game and ahead of him on these issues.</p>

 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for giving way, and I know precisely what he is consulting on. He is consulting on a right to die at home, but people need the ability to exercise choice in end-of-life care, including the right to choose to die in a hospice or, for some people, to die in hospital. The right to die at home is not the only choice. There are a range of choices, so why does the Secretary of State not give people choice?</p>

 A few minutes ago, the hon. Gentleman asked where the choice was in end-of-life care. I have launched a consultation on extending to people the right to die at home. Where was he before I proposed that right? I did not hear him calling for it. I have opened that consultation-if people want to make that argument I will listen to it, but it is the Government who are making the proposals. We are also saying that people should have the right to access a personal health budget and to have more control and power over their health care.</p>

Again, we are consulting on this. Waiting lists should be 18 weeks for elective treatment and two weeks to see a specialist for suspected cancers. Let me get a few things straight today. The Leader of the Opposition said yesterday from the Dispatch Box that the Conservative party first proposed the NHS constitution, but the first mention of it in any Tory document was in June 2007-a full nine months after I proposed the creation of an NHS constitution in a pamphlet in September 2006.

If an acute stroke patient arrives at a hospital, they should have a CT scan within 24 hours maximum. Then there are patients with a cardiovascular condition, such as the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner). I have no doubt that there was a point when the hon. Gentleman needed treatment in much less than 18 weeks. Maximum waiting times make sense, but a single 18-week target does not.</p>

Friend the Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher) said that at that meeting, the clinician presented independent evidence that about 200 lives had been saved by the A and E reconfiguration in the area. What does the shadow Secretary of State say to that clinician, when he has just told the House that clinicians should be able to decide where services go?</p>

 I went to Burnley and met the chief executive of the local NHS trust. I also talked to the chief executive of the ambulance trust. They agreed that it was right to put the medical directors of the ambulance trust and the hospital trust together, to see whether there could be protocols that meant that someone in an ambulance could be taken to Blackburn for blue-light purposes if necessary, and that an A and E department could still be established at Burnley. That is precisely why, shortly after I went to Burnley and made the perfectly reasonable point that the A and E department could be returned, the Secretary of State had a meeting with the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) and instituted an independent review of the decision to close the A and E department at Burnley. <i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

I can stand making a tough decision. I can say, "This is saving lives; I will stand by it," but the hon. Gentleman wanders round constituencies with candidates wearing rosettes, promising the earth. He does that not just in Burnley, but in my patch, Greater Manchester, where we have had a difficult review of maternity services. He goes round Greater Manchester promising to reopen everything.

 The big question in my constituency is why the East Riding of Yorkshire, which has an older-than-average population and a higher burden of disease than average, receives one of the lowest health funding settlements in the country.

 I have heard more than one plea for more funding from Tory Members today. The funding formula follows health need, and we believe that it is right for funding to be targeted in that way. If the hon.

Colleagues have mentioned reconfiguration decisions. The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Evennett) talked of the temporary closure of A and E at Queen Mary's hospital, Sidcup. There is an extension of service provision in the urgent care centre; its opening times have been extended to 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The majority of patients will continue to have access to urgent care on the Queen Mary's hospital site.</p>

There is growing evidence that LINks are beginning to provide a strong voice locally for patients, but I accept the point made by the hon.

I was not the strongest proponent of product placement, and I was not in the majority on that question.

He asked us to recognise the contribution of people who give lots of their time and effort in raising the standards of home education. A constituent who recently came to see me-Caroline Shevalan-made the same point, and I am happy to endorse it. It is important that there is certainty, with good processes and standards in place. Registration and monitoring of home education will not be onerous-home educators are doing a good job-but it will give local authorities the tools that they need to tackle the small number of cases where the education provider is not good enough.

As he said, we are proposing to extend the offer of vaccination to parents of children aged between six months and five years. That particular group of young people has been chosen because there is evidence of higher levels of hospitalisation among them. There are reports today of further deaths from swine flu, which is of course sad news, but there has been a drop in cases.</p>

His constituency and mine share many similarities in that many people worked in industries exposed to asbestos. There is a legacy of people suffering from mesothelioma in certain parts of the north, as well as other parts of the country. In summer, the Justice Secretary announced the elements of a package involving an industry-funded tracing office to help to identify insurance companies and an exploration of ways of speeding up the process of compensation for people with mesothelioma, with more funding for asbestos-related diseases; that aspect is led by my Department. He said that we were taking forward those planks of a package and that a further announcement would be made in due course. In addition, we have agreed to the CMO's recommendation that we should commission more information on pleural plaques for patients, and we are working on that with the British Thoracic Society and the British Lung Foundation. I know of his great interest in the subject. Of course we will do justice to the people concerned by taking forward proposals, and I am grateful to him for raising the matter today.</p>

It is the first significant step towards addressing one of the great remaining unfairnesses of modern times, which is that people with the greatest care needs can still face the highest cost, and that those who suffer the most can pay out the most.</p>

Take the example of somebody who needs 17 hours of personal care a week, which is about average for someone who requires intimate personal care. For the essential care that they need, which could include all aspects of their daily lives-eating, drinking, washing, toileting, dressing and so on-they would currently pay around Â£13,000.

the benefits system, including attendance allowance, would need to be considered alongside the support that the Government put into social care through grants to local councils. However, it is quite a different thing to say that that is about cutting support to vulnerable people.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to speak in this end-of-day Adjournment debate in this week of all weeks in the calendar, when we continue to debate the Gracious Speech, which has set out Government plans for the remainder of the Parliament. I am a new MP, although as of yesterday, I am pleased to note, no longer the newest in the House, on which title I congratulate the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-East (Mr. Bain). I am delighted to have succeeded in securing a debate on a subject that is close to my heart and exceedingly important to my constituents in Norwich, North.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o545"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para16"><a name="09111936000806">I said in my maiden speech to the House that I am proud of Norwich, North, with its one foot in an historic city and its other in beautiful Broadland. The subject of this debate is a defining characteristic of my constituency: the particular transport needs of those who live on the boundary between a vibrant urban economy and a rural region. I am calling for the Norwich northern distributor road because it will benefit my constituents. It holds the key to a wider transport strategy that has the potential to transform travel choices in Norwich and Norfolk. In my constituency, both local residents and firms need this critical piece of infrastructure to get around and conduct their business. It is vital for those of us who live there, but it would also have a wide-ranging and significant strategic impact on the region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o546"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para17"><a name="09111936000807">I shall cover the economic case for the scheme, the people's case for it and the transport choice benefits that it will bring, and the local, regional and national significance of the proposed road. I will finish by noting how straightforward it could be for the Minister to respond in the positive. I note that in his capacity as MP for Ipswich, he might find it hard to give us in his rival city anything that I am asking for, but perhaps he might like to think of all the Ipswich Town fans who could get in and out of Carrow Road even quicker were the road to be built.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o547"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para18"><a name="09111936000808">I wrote to the Minister's boss in late October on the subject of this debate, stating that the road was fundamental to Norwich's economic prosperity. Local and regional businesses, including the chamber of commerce, the Federation of Small Businesses and the Institute of Directors, believe that</p>
<a name="91119-0020.htm_brev4"><a name="09111936000917"><ul><p class="tabletext">"the road is vital for jobs and prosperity in the north and east of Norwich, and a large part of north Norfolk... including Norwich International Airport."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o548"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para19"><a name="09111936000809">As part of the comprehensive work done on the proposal by Norfolk county council and others, a survey of businesses has shown that 78 per cent. of respondents believe that the road will have a positive impact on their business. Anecdotally, a business said in the same survey:</p>
<a name="91119-0020.htm_brev5"><a name="09111936000918"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Transport is a problem. It is almost easier to get to London than north Norwich."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o549"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para20"><a name="09111936000810">Another said:</p>
<a name="91119-0020.htm_brev6"><a name="09111936000919"><ul><p class="tabletext">"People from outside Norfolk view us as being in a backwater that they can't get to without spending hours in traffic jams."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o550"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para21"><a name="09111936000811">I do not know whether that is true in the Minister's view from Ipswich. Perhaps those colleagues who visited Norwich in July, who have sadly left their places, can bear it out from personal experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o551"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para22"><a name="09111936000812">I jest on that point, but the serious impact of not having the road could be, as a strong selection of companies said in the survey, that a lack of adequate transport infrastructure causes them to consider relocation. Considering that 35,000 additional jobs are forecast in the wider Norwich area, that testimony from businesses on how they intend to grow and bring us out of recession is not to be ignored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o552"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para23"><a name="09111936000813">I spoke in my maiden speech about the fascinating economy of Norwich, Norfolk and the region. Norwich has the largest cluster of financial services businesses in the eastern region and is a major centre for creative industries, research, engineering and other start-ups. The northern distributor road will potentially provide vital infrastructure to key locations for such growth, including Norwich International airport and the surrounding industrial estates in my constituency, where many people are employed in engineering; Thorpe St. Andrew and the cluster of business parks in the area, including the Broadland business park, which backs on to the Postwick hub, the eastern starting point for the road; and the Norwich research park and Norfolk and Norwich university hospital, on the south side of the city. I particularly regret that the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke) is not present to hear the debate, because the road has the same significance for his half of our fine city, including on local employment.</p>
<a name="09111936000842">
<p>Without doubt, Norwich is a hub for growth in the eastern region. The Greater Norwich area provides one third of the county's jobs and is the largest employment economy in the region. Norwich is home to more than 50 national and regional business headquarters, and there is more than Â£1 billion of investment in our city. It needs better transport infrastructure, befitting its economic achievements and its bright future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o553"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para24"><a name="09111936000814">Norwich is not just a place to work, however, but a great place to live: it is one of the top 10 shopping locations in the UK, and has a jewel of a historic centre with beautiful countryside just outside and plenty of pleasant places to bring up a family in between. The nature of the county of Norfolk makes Norwich a hub for living and working, but people are being held back by the transport available. We need better transport for a reasonable quality of life. I break it to the House that living and working in Norwich or Norfolk requires access to a car, and motorists need relief from crawling out of their own driveways at l0 mph because of jam-packed traffic throughout northern Norwich.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o554"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para25"><a name="09111936000815">There are more cars in Norwich, North than the roads can take. I am grateful to the Minister's Department for telling me that the number of vehicles registered for personal and business use in my constituency has risen by 25 per cent.-nearly 12,000 cars-in the past 10 years. Furthermore, patterns of driving are changing. There are no longer just morning and evening peaks, but potentially a picture of congestion throughout the day as people's working and living patterns change in the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o555"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para26"><a name="09111936000816">My speech, however, is not an argument for giving gas-guzzlers what they want. By giving the go-ahead to the plan, the Minister can improve transport choices in many ways. The plan proposed is for a distributor road, not a bypass, and an estimated 11,000 vehicles a day could be guided out from inside the inner ring road by  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="19 Nov 2009">

<notus-date day="19" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>19 Nov 2009 : Column 246</b><br>
2012-the year when work on the road could and should start. Removing cars would open up the city centre and much of my constituency, including the many employment sites to which I have already referred, for pedestrians and cyclists. I count myself as a motorist, a cyclist, a pedestrian and a user of public transport, and I would welcome such choices for myself and my constituents, as I am sure the Minister would.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o556"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para27"><a name="09111936000817">The scheme has the potential to improve public transport. For many people in Norwich and Norfolk buses are necessary, but do not yet serve the areas needed or at an affordable price, especially for families. The road would create more space in the city centre and the outskirts and, I believe, stands to improve transport choices both private and public. This kind of integrated package-private, public and green-should represent the future of road-building, and is wanted and needed by people in Norwich. I challenge the Minister to accept the plan today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o557"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para28"><a name="09111936000818">I should also issue a caution to the Minister. If the Government want to put 33,000 additional dwellings in the area, including some in an eco-town in nearby Rackheath, he needs to give the road serious consideration. People do need new houses. Average house prices in my constituency have risen by 186 per cent. in 10 years and now cost more than 10 times the average salary. Many young families in my constituency talk about being unable to find a suitable property in which to live, and I want to see those people able to carry on living in Norwich. The idea, however, of 33,000 new homes dumped on us from on high without enough infrastructure to support them is not visionary but nightmarish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o558"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para29"><a name="09111936000819">The road scheme stands up in its own right: it is vital for jobs, prosperity and people's everyday lives. It would be crucial in opening up a range of transport choices-public, private and green-and it also has strategic significance and wide support. Locally, it has cross-party, multi-council support through the Greater Norwich development partnership, composed of Norwich city council, Broadland district council, South Norfolk district council and Norfolk county council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o559"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para30"><a name="09111936000820">Regionally, the plan has wide support and is already a regional priority through inclusion in the eastern region funding allocation, as a priority 1A scheme for construction in 2011-12 to 2015-16, which means that Â£79.7 million of the required funding is already allocated, subject only to programme entry. Furthermore, the county council has committed to funding any remaining shortfall. Locally and regionally, therefore, we are ready to go, if the Minister will give us a firm decision today on programme entry.</p>
<a name="09111936000843">
<p>Nationally, the scheme would improve access to Norfolk from the national trunk road network, via the A47 and the A11. Of course, it would be even better if I could come away today with a decision on the A11 to boot, but I suspect that I, and my Norfolk colleagues, might come back for that another time. The road scheme should be a straightforward decision for the Government. The business case has been in for over a year and the funding has been earmarked regionally. The plan represents good value for money in accordance with the guidelines from the Minister's Department. The scheme meets the criteria laid down by the Minister's Department for programme entry, and local councils have done the further work required by the Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o560"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para31"><a name="09111936000821">To sum up, failing to give a clear decision on the project jeopardises the value of the extensive cross-party and multi-council work done to date. It ignores the local, regional and national need for the road to be built, and refuses to acknowledge the imperative for infrastructure to support growth-growth that the Government demand for our region from on high. Failing to give a clear decision also turns a blind eye to the many public, private and green transport choices that could be opened up, and kicks people in the teeth for wanting to get around their own city and county. Perhaps worst of all, in this, the deepest and longest recession since records began, dithering further on the project drags down those businesses and job creators who stand ready to pull us out. Will the Minister give us a firm decision today on programme entry for the Norwich northern distributor road?</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Chloe Smith) on securing this debate on the proposed Norwich northern distributor route. She is one of the newer Members of the House and, if I am not mistaken, this is the first Adjournment debate that she has secured since entering Parliament in July. However, I might caution her not to mix politics and football, which can be unwise. I might also be tempted to observe that her offer of faster transit for Ipswich Town fans to Carrow Road will be useful only when both teams are in the same division again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o561"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para32"><a name="09111936000823">Good transport is fundamental to building thriving and prosperous communities. The step change in local transport funding that we have made over the past 10 years emphasises the Government's commitment to delivering sustained improvements to this country's transport infrastructure and thereby providing real improvements to people's daily lives. Since 2000-01, we have more than doubled the funding to local authorities for transport in every region, excluding London, to more than Â£1.345 billion this financial year. Funding for local transport in the eastern region, in which we too have an interest, Mr. Deputy Speaker, has risen from Â£57 million in 2000-01 to Â£163 million in 2009-10, an increase of 186 per cent. Norfolk alone is benefiting from more than Â£30 million for small-scale integrated transport block-funded schemes and highways maintenance this financial year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o562"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para33"><a name="09111936000824">Norfolk is served by six major roads from the west and south: the A47, A11 and A12, for which the Highways Agency is mainly responsible, and the A10, A17 and A140, which are the responsibility of Norfolk county council. In recent years, there have been several improvements to the roads in Norfolk, such as the dualling of the Attleborough bypass, which removed a major congestion point on the A11 and significantly reduced delays along the route. A number of local transport schemes in Norfolk have also contributed to improved access to the wider strategic network. I am also aware that a public inquiry into the statutory orders for the A11 Fiveways-to-Thetford scheme is due to commence later this month. Subject to completion of the necessary statutory requirements, the scheme, which is being progressed by the Highways Agency, would mean the last remaining section of single carriageway on the strategic M11/A11 route to Norwich being upgraded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o563"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para34"><a name="09111936000825">It is important that we ensure that our funding for new transport infrastructure is focused on schemes that will most effectively address the needs and objectives of each region. That is why, since 2005, we have given regions in England a say in decision making about transport schemes that affect them regionally and locally, through the regional funding allocation process. In the east of England, as in other regions, the regional transport board, its local authority partners and other key interests have been able to consider their transport programmes together, against the region's high-level objectives, and develop a funding programme that offers the best overall contribution to meeting those objectives. Those bodies have worked together to identify which of the many proposals before them should go forward and in what time scales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o564"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para35"><a name="09111936000826">The first round of the regional funding allocation advice, which was received from the eastern region in 2006, advised that the proposed Norwich northern distributor road-known to many as the NNDR-was a priority for funding. Following a refresh of the regional funding allocation earlier this year, the region reaffirmed that the scheme remained a priority for funding. We responded to the advice in July this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o565"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para36"><a name="09111936000827">Before I explain the issues surrounding our assessment to date of the NNDR scheme, it might be worth highlighting the current situation regarding the related community infrastructure fund scheme for Postwick hub, which is situated on the outskirts of Norwich. After Norfolk county council submitted a business case for CIF funding to the Government in October 2008, we and the Department for Communities and Local Government jointly announced in March this year that we were minded to accept funding for a number of community infrastructure schemes, including the Postwick hub interchange scheme. Community infrastructure funding is a dual-key capital fund between my Department and DCLG that provides the necessary financial support for small and medium-scale transport schemes to unlock housing sites and housing growth potential in growth areas, including that part of Norfolk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o566"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para37"><a name="09111936000828">Our March announcement explained that although the Government were minded to provide funding of Â£21 million towards the Postwick hub interchange scheme, we would not be able to release the funds until our assessment of the proposed Norwich northern distributor road was completed. The Postwick scheme consists of improvements to the junction at Postwick that would enable an increase in the capacity of the associated park and ride site and unlock the potential for 600 home sites and a possible 1,000 more at a later date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o567"><a name="91119-0020.htm_para38"><a name="09111936000829">The hon. Lady will recognise that Norfolk county council designed the Postwick hub scheme around the NNDR, and that the junction upgrade would therefore provide a key junction linking the proposed NNDR with the A47 trunk road. I assure her that if the outcome of our assessment of NNDR is positive, subject to the successful completion of the necessary statutory orders required, funding for the Postwick scheme could be released early next year, allowing Norfolk to commence works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o568"><a name="91119-0021.htm_para0"><a name="09111936000830">As for where we are with our assessment of the Norwich northern distributor route, Norfolk submitted a major scheme business case to my Department in July 2008. The proposed scheme consists predominantly of a dual carriageway road approximately 20 km long that  <br>

would form a new road around the north and east of Norwich. The scheme, including Postwick, is currently estimated at a cost of just over Â£127 million, and Norfolk is requesting a funding contribution from my Department of Â£79.7 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o569"><a name="91119-0021.htm_para1"><a name="09111936000831">Although I am aware that key stakeholders in the Norfolk area, including the chamber of commerce, see the proposed scheme as part of a wider strategy for the Norwich area, including delivery of housing growth and facilitation of the broader economic aspirations for the Norwich area proposed by the Greater Norwich Development Partnership, we have not yet been in a position to approve the proposed scheme for entry to our programme of local major transport schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o570"><a name="91119-0021.htm_para2"><a name="09111936000832">Although I recognise that there are concerns that our assessment has taken longer than Norfolk envisaged, my officials have made good progress on a number of matters relating to the assessment of the business case, including understanding the interaction between the Postwick junction and the proposed NNDR scheme. However, before we can decide whether to grant the scheme programme entry, the Department must be completely satisfied that it meets our value for money and scheme appraisal criteria, considering the full range of scheme benefits and costs, including potential adverse environmental impacts. I note the hon. Lady's point about the relief that the scheme could bring to the inner ring road by 2012. Wider redistribution of traffic is one of many issues that the Department's assessment will need to consider carefully to enable us to understand the scheme's wider impacts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o571"><a name="91119-0021.htm_para3"><a name="09111936000833">Our assessment of Norfolk's bid for the scheme has focused very much on the traffic modelling, which has raised a number of queries requiring further work. One query was whether we could continue to assess the scheme using the existing traffic demand model that  <br>

Norfolk used in support of the scheme bid, which unfortunately did not fully meet our current departmental requirements, or whether the council would be required to switch to a different and more up-to-date traffic model, delaying the assessment by an additional six months or more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o572"><a name="91119-0021.htm_para4"><a name="09111936000834">Conscious of the facts, we decided to undertake in the summer an urgent review of the modelling data and we informed Norfolk in September that we would accept the use of the existing modelling subject to a number of sensitivity tests to be undertaken to enable the Department better to understand the uncertainties associated with our current analysis and better to align this analysis with the Department's guidance. This is a good example of how we have tried to minimise the additional work required. My officials have worked closely with Norfolk throughout this process in order for the tests to be completed as quickly as possible. We received the results from the tests earlier this week and are now considering them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o573"><a name="91119-0021.htm_para5"><a name="09111936000835">I fully understand the importance that the hon. Lady attaches to this scheme in supporting Norfolk county council's wider strategy for the area, which includes proposed improvements to bus and cycle provision across Norwich. I also recognise the arguments that these proposals can be achieved only with the road capacity released by the NNDR. While I am unable to announce today a decision on programme entry for NNDR, I can assure you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that we are working hard to resolve all the outstanding issues and to complete our assessment. Depending on whether any further work is required, I hope to be able to come to a conclusion and make a decision by Christmas on whether or not to grant initial funding for the scheme.</p>
