However, does he agree that it is right that the Government provide adequate funding for the ordinary policing in the community that tackles all the matters that concern the people of Northern Ireland? Does he accept that there should not be a reduction in the police budget, given the increasing costs of the inquiries that I have mentioned?

 Mr. Speaker, we had the Adjournment debate yesterday, and in it we covered much of the territory in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question. However, I shall start with the facts. This year&#146;s budget for the Police Service of Northern Ireland is &#163;100 million more than it was two years ago. As for the CSR discussions, I assure him that we want to maintain the same police numbers&#151;that is, 7,500 officers&#151;that we have at the moment. For obvious reasons, that is rather more than one would find in the average police service in the rest of the UK. What matters too is how those resources are deployed. That is very important, and the Chief Constable&#146;s commitment to neighbourhood policing is very welcome.</p>

Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) touches on another important issue that no doubt will be touched on later in our proceedings today. We cannot go on spending on investigations into the past without there being a knock-on effect on both present and future services. The CSR considerations that are going on at the moment will be important in that respect, but I am committed to making sure that we continue to provide the necessary funding for the PSNI, and I am determined that that will happen.</p>

 Will the Minister assure the House that budget constraints in the future will not curb or compromise the roll-out and full implementation of the Patten vision for policing? This morning, the Police Service has had to seal off a number of streets in Derry city centre because of hoax devices. Will he join me in condemning the so-called dissident republicans responsible for such attacks? At a time when Derry city centre is seeing the fruits of normalisation and the removal of military installations, the attacks serve only to bring the British Army, in the form of the bomb disposal units, back on to the streets there.</p>

 I assure my hon. Friend that the Government are fully signed up to what he describes as the Patten vision, and that we will continue to deliver on it. That will include making sure that the PSNI reflects more fully the composition of Northern Ireland&#146;s population. Over the past three years, we have committed &#163;178 million to fulfilling the Patten vision for policing in Northern Ireland. He has told the House about the events in Derry, and I of course join him and others in condemning dissident republicans who continue to think that violence and conflict are the way forward, when the truth is that politics is the way forward. Equally, however, I condemn those loyalist paramilitaries who were involved in the shooting of a police officer at the weekend. That is just as damnable, and such actions are increasingly marginal in a Northern Ireland society where real politics is taking over and determining the future.</p>

 The special fund of &#163;34 million that we have provided for the historical inquiries team to look into the unresolved murders of the years of the troubles is, of course, additional money that does not come out of the day-to-day policing budget. It is important that we focus all the resources that we can on day-to-day policing&#151;that is, on neighbourhood policing and dealing with antisocial behaviour, for example&#151;but we must also deal with the remaining threats from dissident republicans, loyalist paramilitaries or those involved in organised crime networks. I know that the hon. Gentleman cares very deeply about such matters, and that he will agree that we must remain very strongly focused on them.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that issue. He is right: where assets are seized and turned back into cash, it can be put back into front-line police services. I am pleased to say that with some of that money the Police Service of Northern Ireland has just taken on 60 new financial investigators, who will further improve the capacity for that work. The ARA is doing a tremendous job in Northern Ireland and its work will be redoubled and strengthened when it merges with the Serious Organised Crime Agency next year. Of course, partnership with our colleagues in the Republic is also an important element of that work.</p>

 I welcome the Secretary of State and the Minister of State to their new positions and offer the best wishes of my party to them in doing what remains, potentially, a very difficult job. I share many of the concerns about the price of the inquiries, but we should never lose sight of their value. The Secretary of State just referred to the Bradley and Eames commission on the past. Does he accept that that is an inquiry of a different order? Will he ensure that its deliberations are properly resourced and that any recommendations it makes will be properly implemented?</p>

 I welcome the new Secretary of State to his office and wish him well. We were both elected as Conservative MPs in 1997 and it is an interesting reflection on the different ways in which we have spent the past 10 years that we hold our current posts. I intend to build on the sterling work of my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington), who supported the Government through the current process, but did not offer them a blank cheque. On the question of cheques, will the Secretary of State estimate the total cost of all the current and future inquires, and say when he thinks they may be completed?</p>

 Since the hon.

Even though he has remained in the Conservative party for eight years longer than I did, if he wants to come across now, I am sure that we can always find a place for him here.</p>

 I welcome the hon. Gentleman to his new post. I believe that he has already taken the opportunity of discussing some of the issues with the Chief Constable. There is no question but that investigations into the past are a considerable burden for the Chief Constable, in terms of resources, manpower and time, but we should recognise that the investigations and inquiries have played a critical role in allowing us to get to where we are with devolution, the Assembly and the Executive in Northern Ireland. Crucially, as was said earlier by my hon. Friend the Minister of State who has responsibility for security, there are unparalleled levels of confidence in policing in Northern Ireland. The way in which the Chief Constable has dealt with the past is exemplary, and that has been crucial to ensuring those levels of police confidence. As for the future, we have asked the consultative group to consider the issues and find a consensus. I will not second-guess what it will find, but I will pay very close attention to the work that it produces.</p>

 The focus in some parts of the country is now shifting from emergency response to clean-up. Can the Prime Minister tell us what steps the Government will take to make sure that the insurance companies pay up rapidly? Many people who do not have insurance will find their homes ruined and be left with little or nothing. Some local hardship funds are being set up, but is the Prime Minister satisfied that they are extensive enough to cover all the affected areas?</p>

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman because his question allows me to explain that we have been talking to the insurance companies. They are in a position to act quickly, and we are urging them to do so. On those people who are uninsured, part of the reason why we are funding local authorities with the additional &#163;20 million is to enable them to help people who are in particular difficulties. In addition, there are crisis grants and community care grants, and I know that money has already been paid out in Yorkshire and Humberside. We will do what we can to help people to get their insurance payments as quickly as possible, and to help the uninsured.

We will increase that to &#163;800 million in the next few years.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I shall make a statement. On 29 and 30 June, the professionalism, vigilance and courage of our police and our security and emergency services thwarted a conspiracy to murder and maim British citizens. Britain&#151;led by London and Glasgow &#151;stood firm in the face of threats. Our calmness and steadfastness as a nation sent a powerful message across the world that we will not yield to terrorism, or ever be intimidated by it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07072570000164">Those events were the 15th attempted terrorist plot on British soil since 2001. As previously set out, the police and security services are currently having to contend with around 30 known plots, and monitor more than 200 groupings or networks and about 2,000 individuals. I think that the whole House will agree that our country&#151;and all countries&#151;has to confront a generation-long challenge to defeat al-Qaeda-inspired terrorist violence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07072570000165">In recognition of that continuing long-term threat, we have created, among other things, a new national security committee to oversee the new office for security and counter-terrorism. Following the first meetings of the national security committee, I want to report on changes that we now recommend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07072570000166">First, let me confirm to the House that in future we will publish a national security strategy, and that the first will be published and presented in the autumn to Parliament for debate and decision in this House. At the time of the spending review, we will announce a single security budget for our country. In line with the Butler report, we will separate the position of chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee from policy adviser to the Government. Thus, the sole responsibilities of the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee will be to provide Ministers with assessments that have been formulated independently of the political process and to improve across Government the effectiveness of intelligence analysis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07072570000167">Today, I am also publishing the Intelligence and Security Committee report on rendition and the Government are consulting on how in future the ISC should be appointed and should report to Parliament&#151;where possible, with hearings in public, a strengthened capacity for investigations, reports that are subject to more parliamentary debate and greater transparency over appointments to the committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07072570000168">To strengthen the counter-terrorist capability of the police and security services, we have, since 11 September, doubled our overall investment to more than &#163;2 billion a year. Dedicated anti-terrorist resources have also doubled. Even in advance of the spending review settlement for future years, the Security Service will, by next year, be twice the size it was in 2001.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07072570000169">The protection and resilience of our major infrastructure and crowded places requires continuous vigilance. I can confirm that over 900 shopping centres, sports stadiums and venues where people congregate have been assessed by counter-terrorism security  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07072570000170">The counter-terrorism Bill will also include a new power allowing the Secretary of State to ensure additional protection for key utility sites. We have asked Lord West to oversee, over this summer, a further overview of how best we protect crowded places and our buildings and national infrastructure, from roads, railways and tunnels to bridges, water systems and utilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07072570000171">Since 1997, the Government have given the police new resources and Parliament has provided new legal powers to arrest and try terrorists. Thanks to the hard work, dedication and commitment of the men and women in the police, security and intelligence services and the prosecuting authorities, this year alone, in nine cases, a total of 30 individuals have been convicted. The forthcoming counter-terrorism Bill will propose additional penalties for terrorists charged with other criminal offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07072570000172">Our first line of defence against terrorism is overseas at other countries&#146; ports and airports where people embark on journeys to our country and from where embassies issue visas. To protect us in routes and places where there is the greatest threat of harm, I believe that we now need to accelerate our plans, completing the move from old and ineffective paper-based systems to real-time monitoring, which will allow us to act immediately and in a co-ordinated way across immigration, police, and intelligence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07072570000173">The way forward is electronic screening of all passengers as they check in and out of the country at ports and airports, so that terrorist suspects can be identified and stopped before they board planes, trains and boats to the United Kingdom. After a review of counter-terrorism screening, and as part of the overall spending settlement for security to be set out in the autumn, the Home Secretary will enhance the existing e-borders programme to incorporate all passenger information to help to track and intercept terrorists and criminals as well as, of course, illegal immigrants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07072570000174">While new biometric visas are already in place for immigrants from high-risk countries, I can confirm that within nine months&#151;from March next year&#151;we will extend biometric visas to all visa applicants. From 2009, we will introduce a new, enhanced system of electronic exit control, linking the checking of passports to checking against the warnings index.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07072570000175">The second line of defence is at our borders, where biometrics&#151;not just fingerprints but iris recognition&#151;are already in use. To strengthen the powers and surveillance capability of our border guards and security officers, we will now integrate the vital work of the Border and Immigration Agency, Customs and UKvisas overseas and at the main points of entry to the UK, and we will establish a unified border force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07072570000176">I have asked the Cabinet Secretary to report back by October on the stages ahead in implementation and whether there is a case for going further while ensuring value for money, but as a result of our announcement today, the first change that people will see is that, starting from next month when arriving in Britain, they will be met at the border&#151;either sea port or airport&#151;by a highly visible, uniformed presence, as  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07072570000177">But this, our second line of defence, has also to be complemented by a third line of defence&#151;ID security within our own borders. While for UK citizens the first biometric ID cards will start during 2009, from the end of 2008 any foreign nationals coming to the UK for more than six months will be required to have a biometric ID. Such an identity scheme will help to prevent people already in the country from using multiple identities for terrorist, criminal or other purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07072570000178">In the identification of potential terrorist suspects, there should also be maximum co-operation internationally, with maximum possible use made of alerts and watch lists. While Lord West&#146;s review has found no systematic failings in our procedures for checking potential suspects, it has highlighted the importance of enhancing existing co-operation to share more information between police and immigration services and internationally across countries: within the European Union, to enable British law enforcement authorities to access immigration information on existing European Union databases; bilaterally with other member states, mutually to exchange information; and joining up criminal records databases throughout the EU, so that our authorities can quickly identify individuals who are charged with crimes, no matter where in Europe they are convicted. At a cost of &#163;5 million, we will link the UK watch list to the Interpol database of lost and stolen documents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para15"><a name="07072570000180">In addition to the nine foreign nationals recently deported under immigration powers on grounds of national security, a further 21 foreign nationals are currently subject to deportation proceedings on national security grounds. On the same grounds, we are preventing 124 individuals from coming to our country and refusing to admit another 52 for glorifying terrorism or other unacceptable behaviour. Overall, 4,000 foreign prisoners are likely to be deported from our country this year. We have agreed repatriation arrangements with Jordan, Libya, Lebanon and Algeria, and we will now press ahead to sign more agreements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para16"><a name="07072570000181">Liberty is the first and founding value of our country, and security is the first duty of Government. The British way is that every measure we take to enhance security is complemented by additional protections against any arbitrary treatment and in defence of the liberties of the individual. We want to consult widely, and we seek&#151;and look forward to obtaining&#151;an all-party consensus on how we treat intercept evidence and on new provisions for pre-charge detention and post-charge questioning. The independent and cross-party review into the use of intercept as evidence in court will be led by Sir John Chilcot, and its members will include the Privy Councillors Lord Archer of Sandwell, Lord Hurd and the right hon.

regime that allows pre-charge detention for up to 28 days. There is general agreement that the circumstances in which the police might need to go beyond even 14 days will be rare, and that will be subject to special procedures of both judicial oversight and parliamentary accountability. I detect that there is also a growing weight of opinion&#151;including from Lord Carlile, the independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation&#151;that there might be some circumstances in which detention beyond 28 days is necessary, such as if the police have to intervene early to avert an attack, if huge quantities of material evidence need to be analysed, or if assistance from other countries is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para18"><a name="07072570000183">The 2005 case cited in previous debates on this issue involved investigation of some 60 mobile phones, 268 computers, and 920 DVDs. However, the airline investigation last August involved 200 mobile phones, 400 computers, 8,000 CDs, DVDs and other discs containing 6,000 gigabytes of data, almost 70 premises searches, and inquiries across three continents. Another case involved 3,000 statements, the examination of 6,000 documents, more than 8,000 exhibits and inquiries across nine countries. During the recent period&#151;I must make this clear to Members, in the light of a radio debate this morning&#151;six people had to be held for 27 or 28 days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para19"><a name="07072570000184">While one of our proposals, which enjoys broad support, to allow post-charge questioning for the explicit purpose of securing evidence in a terrorism trial will reduce the risk that we will need to go beyond 28 days, the Home Affairs Committee concluded that that step will not entirely eliminate the risk. It is right to explore whether a consensus can be built on the most measured way to deal with the remaining risk. I hope that Members will agree that we should not return to the previous proposal rejected by the House, but I also hope that they will agree that there must be a maximum limit&#151;and that that should be set by Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para20"><a name="07072570000185">We today put forward four options for consultation over the coming months. One proposal that we cite in the consultation document from Liberty, to which we are grateful for engaging constructively in the debate, is that if this risk materialises, we should declare an emergency under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 and allow for a period beyond the 28-day limit, for up to a further 30 days, although that would require the declaration of a state of emergency. We are also proposing for consultation&#151;this would not require a state of emergency&#151;an extension of the current limit for up to 28 days more or a lesser period but only if, in addition to the requirement that a judge must approve every seven-day extension, the case is notified to Parliament and subject to a timely report to it of all circumstances, and with the option of a later parliamentary debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para21"><a name="07072570000186">This therefore means that any extension would be subject not only to a specific case being made by the Director of Public Prosecutions, subject every seven days, up to the agreed limit, to the approval of a High Court judge, and subject to the regular report of the independent reviewer, with an annual debate in Parliament but, in each and every instance, to a specific parliamentary notification procedure, to a further statement to Parliament on the individual case, and to a review on the specific case by the independent reviewer, with the provision for this House to scrutinise and debate the report and all the circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para22"><a name="07072570000187">More important even than consensus here in the House is the consensus that we seek in all communities across the country. Since the attacks of 7 July 2005, communities in Britain and across the world have come together in a common front against terrorism and against the propaganda that fuels it. This requires not just the security measures we are outlining today, but that we work with all communities&#151; and, indeed, all countries&#151;through debate, discussion, dialogue and education as we tackle at root the evils that risk driving people, particularly vulnerable young people, into the hands of violent extremists. Here, schools, colleges, universities, civil society, faith groups&#151;indeed, every institution in our country&#151;have a part to play.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para23"><a name="07072570000188">Last week, President Sarkozy of France and I agreed to propose the formation of a joint working group with Germany and other countries to share our experiences and develop ways to expose and defeat terrorism. We will report later this year on this work, but we can make a start today. Over the next three years, we will provide an additional &#163;70 million for local authorities and community groups to improve the capacity of local communities in our country to resist violent extremism. This will include developing leadership programmes for young people, strengthening the capacity of women&#146;s groups, and local projects to build citizenship. There are perhaps as many as 1,000 madrassahs in Britain, educating more than 50,000 to 100,000 young people in after-school classes. In Bradford, an agreement was reached to include citizenship education in their curriculum, and we will now offer to work with other communities on similar programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para24"><a name="07072570000189">We will also support a new skills qualification in citizenship and community cohesion for faith leaders. We will sponsor English-speaking imams and propose interfaith bodies for every community in the country to build greater understanding. We will update guidance to universities before the autumn on how they can do more to protect the safety and security of vulnerable young people in particular. I can also confirm funding for a BBC Arabic channel, and an editorially independent Farsi TV channel that will broadcast to the people of Iran. Following further discussion on these and other issues, the Government will report back to Parliament on further measures that can isolate extremists who preach and practise terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="70725-0004.htm_para25"><a name="07072570000190">Our priority as a Government is a Britain strong in security, robust in our resolve, resilient in response, so that as a nation we both defeat terrorism and isolate violent extremism, wherever we confront it and whatever its support.

The immigration Minister has described that policy as damaging, disruptive and distracting, and the Prime Minister and others said that all the way through the election campaign. I am pleased that the Prime Minister now agrees with us and that questions from this Dispatch Box result in action from the Government.</p>

Is not that the most important way of ensuring that the police can get on with their job without introducing something that could, if we were not very careful, start to look like a form of internment?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="70725-0005.htm_para2"><a name="07072570000202">That brings me to the issue of 28 days. We will look at the Prime Minister&#146;s consultation papers very carefully. I have to say that we have seen the point before about the volume of evidence that needs to be gathered. What specifically in the paper today amounts to new evidence? In particular, what evidence does he have that was not available in December, because it was then that the then Home Secretary, Attorney-General and Lord Chancellor agreed that fresh evidence was needed before any further change could be justified?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="70725-0005.htm_para3"><a name="07072570000203">Rather than passing a new law, will the Prime Minister look carefully at our proposal&#151;and Liberty&#146;s&#151;to use the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, which gives the Government power to detain people for an additional 30 days in time of national emergency. That would make a total of 58 days, two more than the Prime Minister has talked about, without the need to introduce a new, repressive law. The Prime Minister said in his statement that the problem is the need to declare a state of emergency, but if there was a multiple attack on our country and those powers were needed because of the pressures on the police, it would indeed be a state of emergency. Should not this House ask that Ministers prove that all existing laws are being used before they reach for new legislation?</p>

It is not just me saying that: the previous Prime Minister said that it needed reform and the previous Lord Chancellor said that there are problems with it. Will the Prime Minister now admit that the Act is frustrating our fight against terrorism? Will he work with me to draw up a proper Bill of Rights that protects our liberty and our security? Vitally, do the Government understand that what is needed to defeat terrorism is the hard-nosed defence of liberty, and we must avoid any approach that lapses into ineffective authoritarianism?</p>

 I am grateful for the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s support for the individual policies that we have put forward. The support that he has indicated for the work of the emergency, police and security services is appreciated across the House.

We need to look at what is happening in some communities to see how we can bind people closer together. I agree that if we could reach a conclusion on the intercept inquiry, we should legislate as quickly as possible. I am glad that there is now all-party agreement on the issue of post-charge questioning.</p>

It will be a single, uniformed presence and a single checkpoint for passengers. There will be new borders officers, with immigration, Customs and police powers to investigate and detain people suspected of immigration, customs or criminal offences, all reporting to the head of the Border and Immigration Agency. As people come into a port or airport, they will see one single, uniformed presence.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s other proposals will be investigated in the Cabinet Secretary&#146;s review, but what we propose today can be implemented very quickly and people will soon see that uniformed presence at ports. If it is not exactly the same as the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal, work will be done to consider other measures he wishes to propose. I believe that it is important that we move ahead now with the unified border force that I propose, and the details are made clear in the documents.</p>

It is common ground that there may be circumstances in which the police are justified in asking to go beyond 28 days. Over the course of the last few years, whatever the debates on 90 days or on this allegation or that, the Government and the Official Opposition have come to the view that there may be circumstances in which more than 28 days is necessary. I hope that the Liberal party and the other parties will say that they also agree with that case. Therefore, in the rare circumstances in which the police will ask to go beyond 28 days, the question will be what we should do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="70725-0005.htm_para10"><a name="07072570000211">The Leader of the Opposition asked if there was new evidence that we could bring to bear since the publication of previous discussions. He agrees that we are dealing with a unique set of circumstances. International terrorists wish to maim or murder indiscriminately as many people as possible. In some cases, they are suicide bombers who have no fear for their own safety, but simply wish to inflict the maximum damage. They also seek to achieve a propaganda effect.</p>

be involved in an investigation before charges can be properly laid. The ricin case involved 26 countries. One ricin-related operation involved 800 passports and 2,500 forged documents. In some of the cases, thousands of documents are involved that are eventually put before the court. That is why the police have said that it is their view that they need more than 28 days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="70725-0005.htm_para12"><a name="07072570000213">I accept that we are talking about rare and unusual circumstances, and that it is not a power that we would wish to use other than in the rarest of circumstances. However, if we agree that we will go beyond 28 days in certain circumstances, by what mechanism can we justify to ourselves that the situation is rare, and how can we ensure that there is proper judicial oversight and parliamentary accountability? Those are the questions that we must ask.</p>

It suggests that a state of emergency would be declared, under the civil contingencies legislation&#151;but do Opposition politicians believe that the declaration of a state of emergency in the circumstances that we have been talking about would not send out a message about how we deal with things in this country that is exactly the opposite of the message that we want to send out?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="70725-0005.htm_para14"><a name="07072570000215">However, I do accept that there should be a special parliamentary procedure if we go beyond 28 days. Therefore, I ask the Opposition to consider in detail&#151;and obviously there can be cross-party talks on these matters&#151;what we propose as an alternative. We are talking about rare circumstances, and in some cases the parliamentary power that we propose would not be used in any one year. Therefore, would it not be better to ask the Home Secretary to make a parliamentary notification about what has happened and prepare a report that would come to Parliament? In each case, moreover, the independent reviewer would be asked to prepare a report for Parliament as a whole and not just for the Home Secretary. Parliament would then be in a position to debate the matter in full, if it chose to do so. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="70725-0005.htm_para15"><a name="07072570000216">It seems to me that what the Opposition parties and Liberty have suggested may be a way forward is better dealt with by the notification procedure, by the requirement on the Home Secretary to give a report, by the requirement that, if it is thought necessary, the House will have a debate on the matter, and by the requirement that the independent reviewer prepare a report in each and every circumstance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="70725-0005.htm_para16"><a name="07072570000217">I hope that we can have a full debate over the summer months on this and the two other proposals that have been made, in addition to the one from Liberty. I am as anxious as other people in this House that we as a nation can move forward with a united agreement on this matter. Such a consensus would serve this House well. I believe that we can find a solution to this problem if we have a debate and dialogue about it that allows people to listen to all sides of the argument.</p>

The Government have always made it clear that that is not our preferred route, but the Leader of the Opposition has to look very carefully at the constitutional position that he is taking on this matter. On &#147;The Westminster Hour&#148; last year, his shadow Attorney-General was asked whether a British Bill of Rights</p>

Let us debate the matter in such a way that we understand the difficulties and work through them, rather than giving people the impression that a solution can be found simply by announcing a new piece of legislation that we know might not have the intended effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="70725-0005.htm_para21"><a name="07072570000222">Otherwise, I feel that there is scope for consensus in other areas. I hope that, over the summer and autumn months, there will be discussions between the parties, led by the Home Secretary, about how we can work together on all the major issues to defeat what everyone agrees is the great issue of our generation. We must ensure that terrorist violence will not flourish, and that it will never intimidate this country.</p>

 The Prime Minister was right to begin with a tribute to those who had a hand in thwarting the terrorist efforts of 29 and 30 June. He might also have mentioned the members of the public who behaved with conspicuous and gallantry, especially at Glasgow airport. I hope that there may some way to recognise their bravery formally, in a way to which we are accustomed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="70725-0005.htm_para24"><a name="07072570000226">In due course, we shall be asked to make judgments about how best to defeat terrorism in all its guises. The Prime Minister has asked for consensus, as he is entitled to, but I have to tell him that for many of us, consensus cannot be achieved at the expense of principle. The essential test for any proposed new power must always be whether it is necessary, not whether it is desirable or convenient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="70725-0005.htm_para25"><a name="07072570000227">Of course the public have a right to security, but they also have a right to security against the power of the state. We know that it is in the nature of the police to ask for more powers&#151;for the best of motives but often for the worst of reasons. It is in the nature of Government to grant such powers, and it should be in the nature of Parliament to resist them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="70725-0005.htm_para26"><a name="07072570000228">Key questions have to be asked. What has changed in the past 18 months that merits asking Members of Parliament to change their minds about detention without charge? Which investigations in that period have been hampered by the absence of a 90-day limit, or of a limit greater than 28 days? Where is the conclusive evidence that an extension to the 28-day period is required, and what assessment has been made of the risk of fanning extremism with a detention policy that will act as a recruiting sergeant for terrorism, just as internment did for the IRA? Why does Britain require greater powers of detention than other comparable democracies, including Australia?</p>

It would be extraordinary if one single terrorist made it necessary to declare a state of emergency for the whole country. To that extent, I agree with the scepticism expressed by the Prime Minister, but it would be a most curious constitutional development if the alternative was that the matter should be brought before Parliament. I suppose that this is the high court of Parliament, but the suggestion that reports should be made to Parliament, followed by later parliamentary debate, seems to stand the normal provisions of our constitution&#151;and the separation of powers&#151;very much on their head.</p>

For example, why are there no measures to make it easier to charge people with a lower threshold offence at an earlier stage in investigations, when a prime facie case for a charge can be established? Finally, why is there no reference in the statement to the possibility of a more extensive use of plea bargaining, so that those on the periphery of conspiracies may be used as credible witnesses against those who are the principals in terrorist activity?</p>

 I admire the passion with which the right hon. and learned Gentleman puts his case for the defence of civil liberties in this country; it is what marks out our constitution, and has done for hundreds of years. Protection against arbitrary acts by Government, or any vested interest, must be central to the business of the House in making sure that such things do not happen in this country. I agree with him on the issue of principle. The question we have to deal with, however, relates to circumstances in which, in the last few months, six investigations led to 27 or 28 days. I can put to the right hon. and learned Gentleman figures that show the degree and scale of the evidence, the intercontinental nature, and the multiple passports, multiple identities and multiple addresses used by terrorist suspects or potential terrorists. The scale and complexity of the investigations that the police now have to conduct in relation to the specific issue of terrorism dwarf what came before. As the Leader of the Opposition&#151;and also, I believe, the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#151;recognises, we are in a very different situation from that of even 10 years ago in relation to terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="70725-0005.htm_para30"><a name="07072570000233">The question is: can we both ensure the security of the citizens of this country and protect the civil liberties of the individuals who live in this country? I believe that we can. I am sorry that the right hon. and learned Gentleman has interpreted our proposal for consultation as a threat to the relationship between the judiciary and Parliament. I do not believe that it is. I am suggesting that, as has been recognised by a number of people, there are circumstances in which it may be right to go beyond 28 days&#151;unusual, rare and only in the instance of terrorism&#151;and the question is how we can find a mechanism for dealing with those circumstances. One suggested mechanism is the declaration of a state of emergency and, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman rightly says, people question whether that is the right message to send out. However, if the Home Secretary were to notify Parliament that a case was going beyond 28 days, if at the same time the independent reviewer, whom the right hon. and learned Gentleman has agreed should play a role in reviewing all cases of between 14 and 28 days, was brought to bear so that they could look at the individual case, and if the option was left&#151;after the report of the independent reviewer&#151;that there could be a debate in Parliament on the issue, that is not a threat to the judiciary; it is parliamentary accountability working at its best. I hope he will understand that what I am trying to do in the proposal is to uphold the principle of independent judicial oversight, but saying at the same time that where issues of public interest are raised it is right that in certain circumstances they be debated here in the Chamber of the House of Commons. I hope that he will agree on reflection that this is a way forward.</p>

 On the question of detention without trial, the whole House will examine the Prime Minister&#146;s proposals very carefully. However, does he accept that there are pragmatic reasons, as well as reasons of principle, why the House so decisively rejected any period longer than 28 days? It is by no means certain that there is a consensus, even among senior policemen and prosecutors, on the need for any extension. The new information that he mentioned earlier about the complexity of investigations was very much part of the debate about 90 days and in that sense is not new to the House. There is the issue that alarm is being caused in communities by the notion that people can be lifted and held without charge for months at a time. In that sense, it might well prove counter-productive. So the issues are not just issues of principle; they are also pragmatic issues and issues of how best to secure our national security.</p>

We are dealing with large amounts of data and, in some cases, with multiple passports, addresses and bank accounts. In some cases, the police do not know the identity of the person they have arrested for some time, because that person is operating under the cover of so many passports, identities, addresses and bank accounts.

The very fact that Liberty has joined the debate on what might happen in circumstances in which we need to go beyond 28 days suggests that it is possible to find a consensus on the issues across the spectrum. I do not know that I necessarily agree with him that some authority other than Parliament should set the final or ultimate number of days for which people can be detained before a charge is put, but of course that, too, can be a matter for the debate, because there are four options in the discussion document. He may wish to make his own representations during discussions over the summer months.</p>

Did the US authorities ignore vigorous protest from our security authorities about the rendition of Bisher al-Rawi and Jamil al-Banna, and will the Prime Minister take this opportunity unequivocally to condemn the policy of extraordinary rendition&#151;that is, the practice whereby many people have been kidnapped by US authorities and taken to places where they may be tortured?</p>

Committee, which has resulted in today&#146;s report; we have also had very good reports from it in the past. The reason why I favour a reform of the Intelligence and Security Committee is not to lose the uniqueness of what she describes, which is the ability of parliamentarians to talk to the security services about matters that it would clearly not be in the interests of the country to report widely. There is a second reason why the Committee should take the form that we suggest: it ought to be able to tell the country, through its work, about the important efforts made, and energies used, by the security services in the interests of our whole country. That is the part of the work of Select Committees that other Committees can undertake, and we must find the means by which the Intelligence and Security Committee can do that, in the interests of the security services and parliamentary accountability. I applaud the vital work that is being done, and I know that the security services appreciate it from discussions with them of some of the big challenges that they face, but we ought also to think about a public role, which I think will enhance the security services and the reputation of Parliament.</p>

 I am pleased to inform the House that the Ministry of Defence has agreed with Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury a comprehensive spending review settlement for the next three years. The total departmental expenditure limit for defence over the CSR period will be &#163;34 billion in 2008-09, &#163;35.3 billion in 2009-10 and &#163;36.9 billion in 2010-11. That is an additional &#163;7.7 billion for defence by 2011, and a 1.5 per cent. average annual real terms increase against our CSR baseline, excluding the costs of operations that are met from the reserves and the time-limited defence modernisation fund. The Treasury will, of course, continue to fund from the reserves the additional cost of operations over and above the defence budget, having already provided some &#163;6.6 billion from the reserves to support the front line since 2001.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="70725-0007.htm_para0"><a name="07072570000293">The settlement continues the longest period of sustained real growth in planned defence spending since the 1980s; that is evidence of the Government&#146;s commitment to defence and to the men and women who serve with the utmost bravery in our armed forces. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="70725-0007.htm_para1"><a name="07072570000294">The result of Labour&#146;s consistent funding for defence is that the defence budget will be significantly higher in real terms than the budget that we inherited in 1997&#151;on average, a billion pounds more for defence every year, for 10 years. Compare this with the last five years of the Tory Government, when the defence budget was being cut by around &#163;500 million a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="70725-0007.htm_para2"><a name="07072570000295">Our priority remains success on current operations. This settlement gives the MOD the financial certainty required to continue delivering that success. Over the past year I have been able to announce to the House important enhancements in protected vehicles, in helicopters and in surveillance. The settlement will enable us to do more in all these areas and others. It also allows for additional investment in the support that our service personnel deserve, building on recent improvements in pay, in the new tax-free operational bonus, in medical care for our wounded personnel and in accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="70725-0007.htm_para3"><a name="07072570000296">At the same time as ensuring success on current operations, and support for our people, this settlement enables us to invest in the capabilities that we will need for the future. I am pleased to be able to confirm today that we will place orders for two 65,000 tonne aircraft carriers to provide our front-line forces with the modern, world-class capabilities that they will need over the coming decades. These will be named HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales. They are expected to enter service in 2014 and 2016, respectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="70725-0007.htm_para4"><a name="07072570000297">This delivers on the Government&#146;s promise in the 1998 strategic defence review. The carriers represent a step change in our capability, enabling us to deliver increased strategic effect and influence around the world at a time and place of our choosing. They will be a key component of the improved expeditionary capabilities that we need to confront the diverse range of threats in today&#146;s security environment. They are evidence of our commitment to ensuring that our armed forces are modern, versatile and equipped for the future.</p>

We have shared the costs of developing the common baseline design to which we are committing today and we have capitalised on our huge collective technical and military experience. Our industries are exploring further opportunities for mutual benefit, including joint procurements of equipment for the carriers, and shared support arrangements. We look forward to making a joint announcement on further co-operation in the next few months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="70725-0007.htm_para6"><a name="07072570000299">The carrier programme will sustain and create some 10,000 jobs across the UK, but we have always been clear that the carriers cannot be built without change in the maritime sector. As we set out in the defence industrial strategy, we need further improvements in efficiency to ensure that the taxpayer is getting value for money. We need to ensure that the UK maritime industry is the right size and shape, so that it is sustainable in the longer term, so I am pleased that VT Group and BAE Systems intend to form a joint venture in naval shipbuilding and support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="70725-0007.htm_para7"><a name="07072570000300">The creation of such a joint venture will enable the Royal Navy to work with industry to deliver the infrastructure that the Navy will need to support the fleet in the future while retaining all three of our existing naval bases at Portsmouth, Devonport and Faslane. This will be good news for the three communities and the service, civilian and contractor personnel employed at the bases. None the less, some reductions in the 17,600 personnel currently employed will be necessary and will be taken forward in consultation with trade unions in the usual way. We aim to rationalise infrastructure and spare capacity, streamline processes and build on partnering and other commercial arrangements. For example, today we are also announcing a &#163;1 billion partnering arrangement with Rolls-Royce for the in-service support of the nuclear steam raising plant that powers the Royal Navy&#146;s submarines over the next decade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="70725-0007.htm_para8"><a name="07072570000301">I am determined to ensure that more of our money is spent where it is really needed, reducing overheads to put more into the front line and into supporting our people. To enhance the spending power that this settlement gives us, we will make savings against the Department&#146;s overheads, including a 5 per cent. year-on-year saving in our administrative overhead over the next three years and a 25 per cent. reduction in our head office. These are additional to the &#163;2.8 billion efficiencies delivered over the spending review 2004 period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="70725-0007.htm_para9"><a name="07072570000302">A priority through the CSR period will be the continued investment in improving accommodation for our people and their families. We expect to spend some &#163;550 million on this over the three-year period, including plans to upgrade over 18,000 barrack-type bed spaces. This builds upon the achievements of recent years in providing upgrades to our service families&#146; homes and our plans to spend &#163;5 billion over the next 10 years on upgrading and maintaining accommodation. We also intend to explore with the Treasury and the Department for Communities and Local Government how best we can support the wishes of many servicemen and women to own their own homes.</p>

The intensity of the campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in the loss of equipment and in equipment being worn out much more quickly than would otherwise have been expected. In other words, the defence budget needs to rise faster than predicted just for us to stand still. On top of this, there is increasing evidence that operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have not been fully funded by the special reserve and that there has been salami slicing of equipment and training budgets to fill the gap.</p>

Only when we have detailed answers to those questions will we be able to make a judgment on whether this is anything like an adequate settlement for the armed forces, given what they are being asked to do. Under the current Prime Minister, we are only too well aware, following his last Budget, that financial statements that look good today can look very different tomorrow.

 There was an expectation on the part of some people. However, with all due respect to the hon.

This is a very large and important procurement with significant implications not only for the Navy but for communities throughout the country, as well as for our shipbuilding infrastructure and the industry that will support the surface fleet for decades to come.

As I said, announcements will be made appropriately. I say to him, in the spirit in which the question was asked, that we stand by our description of what is necessary to sustain our Navy for the challenges that it faces and deals with so well and so professionally across the world. Only this week, in chairing a meeting of the Admiralty Board, I was immensely impressed by the work that our Navy is able to do right across the world. I have asked for a piece of work to be done to compare its current presence and capability with what it was 10 or 20 years ago. My sense is that we will discover that it is now doing much more because it is better trained and better equipped than it was then. The simplistic view of just counting ships and paying no regard to capability pays no proper respect to what it does.</p>

At some stage, those communities need to work together and not necessarily in competition for the resources that others have.</p>

A little less political spin in the Secretary of State&#146;s statement would have done a little more honour to his office. To describe the real increase on defence expenditure given in the figures as quite substantial breaks any reasoned connection with the English language. The armed forces are exhausted and worn out.

My recollection is that we came to power with a commitment to follow the planned budget of the previous Conservative Government. We inherited an economic situation that required significant attention and a legacy of under-investment not only in our armed forces, but throughout public services.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

I had to be informed that Shropshire is to have a unitary authority by my secretary, who telephoned me from Shrewsbury. That is an absolute disgrace.

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="70725-0010.htm_para0"><a name="07072570000415">I am still reeling over the issue of unitary authorities, but I shall endeavour to calm myself and introduce my ten-minute Bill on milk pricing. It is an appropriate time to do so, as the front page of <i> The Daily Telegraph </i>says that the price of milk and food is set to soar over the summer&#151;and not just because of the flooding, but on account of the tremendous crisis in the dairy industry. It is so bad that many of our dairy farmers are going out of business, which will ultimately affect the consumer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="70725-0010.htm_para1"><a name="07072570000416">At the moment, many of my Shropshire farmers are paid as little as 16p a litre for the milk that goes to supermarkets. Today, I spoke to Tesco and found that it charges 58p a litre to its customers. I would like Parliament to think for a moment about the huge margin between 16p and 58p a litre. Any hon. Member representing a rural constituency will know how hard dairy farmers work. They face an unsustainable price for their milk: 16p a litre is simply not enough. That is why hundreds of dairy farmers have gone out of business and lost their livelihoods. In addition, dairy farmers face huge levels of Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs red tape and bureaucracy. To cap it all, there is the tremendous crisis of bovine tuberculosis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70725-0010.htm_para2"><a name="07072570000417">I asked the relevant Minister about the number of cases of bovine TB in Shropshire in the year 2000 and was given the figure of 39. In 2006, however, the number had increased to 147. We have seen a massive increase in the number of cases of bovine TB in Shropshire and, in my estimation, the Government are doing very little to tackle it. When I first became an MP, I was lobbied by my Shrewsbury farmers on many occasions to do something about the problem and to take up their cause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70725-0010.htm_para3"><a name="07072570000418">I started to speak out on these issues two years ago as an individual MP. I had extensive meetings with various chief executives from various supermarkets. The first one I met was the chief executive of ASDA&#151;and it got me absolutely nowhere. People like him were simply not prepared to acknowledge that there was a problem. They simply refused to consider the long-term ramifications for the indigenous production of milk in this country. They simply were not prepared to acknowledge the crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70725-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07072570000419">That explains why I decided to set up the all-party group for dairy farmers&#151;and I am very pleased to see some of its members in their places here today. In fact, we have become one of the largest such groups in Parliament. As of today, we number 157 Members from all parties. That shows the extent of feeling on this issue among all political parties; we all want to do something to ensure that the UK continues to have a dairy industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70725-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07072570000420">One group that has greatly helped me and the all-party group is the women&#146;s institute, which had adopted this issue as one of its main areas of campaigning. It organised a major petition up and  <br>

down the country, securing hundreds of thousands of signatures, which was presented by my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman). The WI also had a series of national debates throughout the country, where it brought supermarket chief executives together with farmers and other interested parties. I participated in two of those national debates: one in the west mid show in my constituency of Shrewsbury, the other close to Parliament where I debated with Mr. Justin King, the Sainsbury chief executive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70725-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07072570000421">The greatest publicity came not just from we politicians, but from a single individual WI member from Gloucestershire who came on a very cold January morning wearing nothing but a bikini. They were pouring bottles of milk all over her as she sat in a bath just outside the House of Commons. That went down very well, I have to say, and got us a great deal of publicity. I applaud her for doing that on such a cold day and for being prepared to be photographed in a bikini with all that milk being poured all over her.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70725-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07072570000422">The all-party group listened to hundreds and hundreds of hours of evidence. We have had many meetings with various interested parties. We met the Office of Fair Trading and many farming organisations, including the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers. Supermarket bosses were called as well as many consumer organisations. We have even led a cross-party delegation to Brussels to lobby the Commissioner for Agriculture, Mrs. Fischer Boel. For an arch Eurosceptic like myself, the idea of going to Brussels to ask the EU to intervene to help save the British dairy industry was quite difficult. However, I had to do so, in desperation at the lack of action by the Labour Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70725-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07072570000423">That activity and the national campaign had some results, as the supermarkets have started to feel embarrassed about this issue. I know that Tesco is leading the way in increasing the prices paid to farmers. On some occasions, it pays 22p a litre, but that affects only 450 local farmers, so we need to increase that number significantly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70725-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07072570000424">I shall place the all-party dairy farmers group report in the Library. It may not be a very Conservative thing to do, but I desperately wanted to call for a regulator for supermarkets. Regrettably, there was no consensus in the group about that matter. As a Conservative, I usually do not like to interfere in market forces; it is  <br>

quite an unusual thing for a Conservative to want to regulate in that way, yet we have regulators in all our major industries. On my way to Parliament earlier today, I passed the offices of Ofgem, and then there is Ofwat and Ofgas, for example. Everything is regulated apart from the supermarkets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70725-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07072570000425">I would like a regulator, but I cannot get the support of my group on this issue. What we can achieve, what my Bill sets out to achieve and what we can agree upon, I believe, is more powers for the Office of Fair Trading to investigate what supermarkets pay for milk. When the OFT came before the all-party group, it said&#151;this is set out in all our notes&#151;that it would very much like to be able to investigate supermarkets and shine more of a spotlight on them, but that regrettably its hands were tied and it did not have the power to do so. The Bill will enable the OFT to scrutinise the supermarkets in a much better way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="70725-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07072570000426">Tesco has announced an extra &#163;25 million of investment to increase the price for milk. It is also getting local brands and offering its customers the opportunity to pay more for local milk such as Dorset milk in supermarkets in Dorset. I am negotiating with Tesco to try to get Shropshire milk to be sold in Shropshire supermarkets. I urge all MPs to negotiate and lobby with Tesco to get local milk in their supermarkets from their own counties. This is a very good first step and I applaud Tesco for this measure. I will not rest until I can go to Tesco and buy Shropshire milk from my local Shropshire dairy farmers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70725-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07072570000427">This Bill will place some extra pressure on the supermarkets. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70725-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07072570000435">The House disagreed with Lords amendment No. 22 on annuitisation because the draft would have had undesirable effects. Subsequently, the other place did not insist on it. However, the Government had some sympathy with the aim of the amendment and accepted amendment No. 22B from the Opposition in its place. We were persuaded by the arguments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70725-0010.htm_para19"><a name="07072570000436">The background is that in this House last week I announced that the cost of extending the financial assistance scheme to give pensioners more might be met by better use of the assets remaining in pension schemes, in accordance with the recommendations of Andrew Young, along with a matching contribution from the Government. I am sure that hon. Members will welcome my noble Friend Lord McKenzie&#146;s announcement yesterday that we have decided to accept the Young review&#146;s recommendation that we should not enforce a cut-off date for employer insolvency. The cut-off date of 31 August 2007, announced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (James Purnell), now Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, will not be enforced.

That may well have been enough, but we accept that reinforcing that message in law has some merit. Therefore, we will take powers to prevent annuitisation by FAS qualifying schemes to ensure the greatest benefit to the greatest number of pension scheme members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70725-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07072570000438">Amendment No. 22B has the same broad objective as amendment No. 22, but achieves it without the difficulties of the previous version. Amendment No. 22B puts a hold on annuitisation for the benefit of members of qualifying pension schemes hoping to see the extra funds raised by the assets within schemes matched by the Government. However, it also allows trustees to buy annuities, where appropriate, if they have the approval of the FAS scheme manager, who in law is the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. That is a sensible and flexible approach, although  <br>

In short, I believe that the Government realised they were losing the arguments and decided to shut down the debate. That is a blatant affront, not only to this House but to the victims who have lost their pensions. This is probably our last opportunity to debate this Pensions Bill, although the joy of my job and the Minister&#146;s is that another Pensions Bill is always just around the corner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70725-0010.htm_para23"><a name="07072570000441">Only recently, our new Prime Minister told the nation that he believed in</p>

The big clunking fist has crashed down, and the Government have invoked the Parliament Acts and stopped any further discussion. They have, in effect, torpedoed the lifeboat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="70725-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07072570000444">Even before the Government did that, however, there were dark threats from Government sources that if the lifeboat fund amendments did get through, they might abandon the whole Bill, leaving victims with even less money than they would have received under the Government&#146;s latest proposals. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to dissociate himself from such threats. I can assure him that the campaign to get proper help to those victims will continue both inside and outside Parliament. If the Prime Minister thinks that he has heard the last of this issue, he is very much mistaken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70725-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07072570000445">The amendments on annuitisation are the remaining vestiges of the raft of lifeboat fund amendments. It is also perhaps worth reminding the House that that approach to bulk annuity purchase has been advocated by the Conservatives for at least a couple of years and by campaigners such as Ros Altmann for even longer. Can the Minister make an estimate of the pension fund assets that have already been committed to annuity purchase in the time scale and are therefore no longer available to provide direct help to the victims?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="70725-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07072570000446">The Minister touched on the recent report by Andrew Young and his team. It is worth quickly reviewing some of the major conclusions on this subject. On page 13, they concluded that there was some &#163;1.7 billion of uncommitted assets in schemes eligible for FAS assistance that are in the process of winding up. What we do not know is where they are in that process at this precise moment. Andrew Young also concluded in chapter 4:</p>

Can the Minister give me an idea of the time scale during which he expects to be able to do so? Thirdly, the Minister told us that he has written to trustees.

 I am grateful for that intervention. The Minister referred to amendment No. 22B which would provide support for members of the FAS by blocking the bulk-purchase of annuities using the assets that remain in schemes. Its purpose is to allow the unused funds that are left in the pension schemes to be used to improve the benefits within the FAS. It is a great shame that the Minister is still unwilling to state that he agrees with the position set out by the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives and, more significantly from the Minister&#146;s point of view, by many of his Back Benchers. The right, just and decent thing to do would be to ensure that those whose pension schemes collapsed before the introduction of the Pension Protection Fund and who therefore benefit under the FAS should receive benefits at the same level as those in the PPF. We have consistently articulated that position. That is the purpose to which any funds that can be husbanded through the judicious and speedy application of regulations under the amendment should be put. That is what the 125,000 people, organised so admirably by Dr. Ros Altmann and others, have been campaigning for. Much anger was expressed on this matter in the debate in the other place, but such anger is more strongly felt by the 125,000 people who believe that, unaccountably, they will have to wait longer than they had expected to get what they regard as a just and decent settlement.</p>

In last week&#146;s debate, I observed that what was then amendment No. 22 served the Government&#146;s purpose. At that time, the Minister denied that. I am delighted that common sense has prevailed and that the Government have accepted this revised version of that amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="70725-0011.htm_para14"><a name="07072570000462">I have a couple of questions about how the Minister intends to implement it. Lord McKenzie has made it clear that the Government intend to introduce regulations under the amendment. How quickly do they intend to do so? Clearly, the regulations are subject to a negative procedure. Can they be introduced during the summer recess, or will that have to wait until October? As has been said, time is of the essence. According to the Young review, &#163;1.7 billion of assets remain in the schemes. As the Young review also made clear, and as was made clear in last week&#146;s debate, any delay could result in some of the funds being annuitised by scheme managers.</p>

 I agree that it is important that the rules are introduced quickly. We will use the negative procedure, and we will seek to move as quickly as possible as we want them to be in place by the autumn. The House must have an opportunity to debate that, if it wishes to do so. However, although I agree with the hon. Gentleman on this, the consequence will be that we will not have a consultation period; we will just introduce the rules. We will be happy to share them with Opposition spokespersons in advance.</p>

Does the Minister think that that is the length of time needed for the Government to introduce and act on the conclusions of the Young review? Given that the House has reached a positive consensus on this very narrow issue, it would be a shame if the limited time scale specified in the amendment meant that, although bulk annuitisation was restricted for that period, it was not until after that period had elapsed that progress was made on using the assets in those funds. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that point.</p>

One scheme in my constituency, operated by a solvent employer, illustrates the slow crawl through this legislation that has taken place to get some justice. As the Bill progressed, the Minister rightly agreed that that employer should be covered by the financial assistance scheme, which it previously had not been. The trustees were asking that annuities be bought for those in the scheme who were retiring. Had that change not been made when it was, that scheme would have been annuitised and the assets lost. There is therefore an urgent need to get this situation sorted out.</p>

make an application to the Secretary of State, who will presumably have to investigate the particular circumstances of that scheme before deciding whether to allow annuitisation. That is an extra burden of bureaucracy that the original amendment did not impose; it simply provided for a nine-month ban until the situation has been sorted out. Presumably, all the scheme assets would then have gone into the general FAS pot, which is a better approach. Does the Minister feel that amendment No. 22B imposes an extra bureaucratic layer that could lead to delay, and could require the Secretary of State to investigate many schemes that it would otherwise not have been necessary to investigate?</p>

 With the leave of the House, I seek to reply to this debate and to some of the points raised. Let me first deal with what should perhaps be described as the political knockabout points, before moving on to the serious stuff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="70725-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07072570000473">Various claims were made about the Parliament Act 1911, which has a number of different provisions. It was invoked, as described by the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson), when the other place refused to accept particular pieces of legislation regularly passed by this House. That probably happened on about seven occasions&#151;indeed, I think that I was part of the process with one of them&#151;but that is not what we are talking about here. Rather, we are talking about the invoking of financial privilege, which happens to be dealt with in the 1911 Act, but which has been regularly invoked in this place over many years. It is therefore an entirely different matter from the point raised by the hon. Gentleman. The parliamentary procedures are different, and such invoking in the other place merely means that the Lords would have to table a differently worded amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="70725-0011.htm_para22"><a name="07072570000474">It was therefore possible&#151;I assumed that Opposition Members knew this&#151;to table a differently worded amendment, if the Opposition really want to bring back their lifeboat proposal. Frankly, however, it was pretty well sunk by the Young report, so they were better off not doing that. The lifeboat proposal was torpedoed not by the Government, but by the Young report, which said that the basis on which it was framed&#151;that pensions and the various insurance assets were unclaimed and lying there, and could easily be accessed&#151;faced impediments so great that it was not a realistic option.</p>

 I do not want to follow the Minister down the route of discussing the 1911 Act, because I suspect that I would be ruled out of order. However, I remind him that&#151;amendments or no amendments, and whatever their wording&#151;if the Government had accepted the principle of a lifeboat fund and getting help to people sooner rather than later, as we suggested, we would have been happy to accept any drafting from the Government. It is because they set their face against that principle and the proposed timetable that we are where we are. The Minister referred to dealing with knockabout political points before moving on to the serious stuff. The serious issue is the people who need help from the FAS but are not getting it, and might not get it for some time.</p>

 I want to have one last brief go at this point, and then I shall allow the Minister to move on. The Government still have not stated clearly why they do not want to allow FAS beneficiaries to receive benefits at the Pension Protection Fund level. We Liberal Democrats have put forward a range of options for funding that, and the financial cost would be slim, given the figures that we have heard mentioned in the Lords, such as &#163;25 million a year for the first 10 years. If the issue is purely a financial one, that figure seems like pretty slim pickings, given that we have just heard that billions more are to be spent on aircraft carriers.</p>

 It was the Young report, not the Government, that torpedoed the lifeboat, but it was pretty leaky anyway.

If we were to go to PPF levels, that would have to be funded. The hon. Gentleman has made it clear that the Liberal Democrats would be happy to put Government funding into that. That is a straightforward point of view, and I understand and respect it. However, the Conservatives have always said that they would not put loads of Government money into the scheme. They would not be prepared to spend an extra &#163;1 billion. They are silent on that point, and as far as they are concerned, there would be no extra money. They claim that the funding would somehow be obtained from the unclaimed assets, but that has now been torpedoed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07072570000483">The claim is made that a threat has somehow been made to withdraw the increase to 80 per cent. if the Bill goes into the spill-over period. That was the substance of a letter that Conservative Front Benchers sent out earlier today, but it is complete nonsense. It is true that I warned in the last debate that if the Bill was delayed into the spill-over period the increase from 60 per cent. to 80 per cent. in the cover under the financial assistance scheme would also be delayed, and pensioners would not get it over the summer&#151;and I think that they deserve it. That is why I am pleased that the Opposition have agreed to the amendments and that the Bill can receive Royal Assent so that the increase to 80 per cent. can begin to be paid by the FAS operational unit.

From our point of view, it would be rare. It might happen if an otherwise fully funded scheme were close to being wound up, but found that it had a small gap. It would therefore not stand to benefit very much from the FAS, so the trustees might ask the Secretary of State whether they could annuitise in those circumstances. The Secretary of State would look at the facts and take a view. Such circumstances would be rare, which is why we do not want annuitisation to proceed for funds engaged with the FAS&#151;and that would be the purpose of the amendments.</p>

We hope that Young will report in November, and we expect to be able to make some decisions fairly quickly thereafter. We do not yet know the full terms of the Young report, so we will have to wait and see what it contains, but we want to put various alternative courses of action before the House as quickly as possible. Details of any substitute scheme will be made known in regulations put in place before the nine months elapse.</p>

Member for Eastbourne to the amendments, and I hope that he will adopt a similar approach to the next group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07072570000489"><i> Lords amendments agreed to.</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07072570000490"><i> Lords amendment:</i> No. 28.</p>

<p><a name="st_o238"><a name="07072570000491"><a name="70725-0012.htm_spnew0"><a name="07072570001090"><b>Mr. O'Brien:</b>
 I beg to move, That this House insists on its disagreement with the Lords in their amendment No. 28 but proposes amendments (a) and (b) in lieu.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07072570000492">I shall be brief. We considered that Lord Fowler&#146;s amendment No. 28 was unnecessary, not least because we have already made commitments to keep under review the reforms enacted by this Bill. However, we have reservations about the exact terms of the amendment. Although we may have an idea about what the term &#147;post-legislative scrutiny&#148; means, we are reluctant to commit the Secretary of State to complying with a duty until there is a clear understanding of what that might entail. No final agreement has been reached about what post-legislative scrutiny would entail, so we have proposed instead that the Secretary of State present to Parliament a report on the operation of the Act that will give Parliament an opportunity to consider and debate the findings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07072570000493">We also took the view that 2011 would be too early for a review to be conducted, as only the measures relating to new qualifying conditions for state pensions would have come into effect by then. Many of the provisions in the Bill would not have come into effect by that date, so we suggested in the other place that the Secretary of State should present the report by the end of 2017. That would follow a period of some years when all the measures, apart from the increase in state pension age, had had time to bed in. It would also allow us to consider whether we were taking the appropriate steps to ensure the smooth implementation of the state pension age changes in 2024.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para11"><a name="07072570000494">It was evident from yesterday&#146;s debate in the other place that their Lordships were dissatisfied with the proposed date for the Secretary of State&#146;s review. We now propose, therefore, that he should present his report by the end of 2014. I understand that Conservative Front-Bench spokespersons in the other place would be satisfied with that compromise, although for completeness I should tell the House that Government amendment (b), to clause 28, is purely consequential. Clause 28 defines the extent of the measures in the Bill, and the amendment would ensure that any review of the operation of the Act in due course would take account of the provisions as they relate to Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07072570000495">I believe that the proposed amendments in lieu are sensible, and consistent with the principles of good administration. I hope that they command the support of the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o239"><a name="07072570000496"><a name="70725-0012.htm_spnew1"><a name="07072570001091"><b>Mr. Waterson:</b>
 As the Minister has explained, the Government amendments are, in effect, a compromise arising from the Lords debates, and on behalf of the official Opposition, I welcome them. Lord Fowler made a powerful case in the Lords for the principle of post-legislative scrutiny. In recent times, we have heard a lot about pre-legislative scrutiny, and that of course  <br>

has its place. However, one can actually sustain the argument that scrutinising the effects of legislation after the event is every bit as important, if not more so. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07072570000497">In a powerful speech in the Lords on 11 July, Lord Fowler made his case extremely well, based on his massive experience in such matters. He gave two specific examples. The first related to the Social Security Act 1986, the state earnings-related pension scheme and subsequent issues such as compensation claims and the non-issue of leaflets. In that case, he thought that post-legislative scrutiny would have made a significant difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para14"><a name="07072570000498">Lord Fowler&#146;s second example related to some of the issues dealt with by the parliamentary ombudsman, the High Court, the European Court and Select Committees in recent times. It is not for me to rehearse all the arguments on this occasion. The issues are currently before the courts, but he uses them to show how a post-legislative scrutiny procedure could have picked up some potential problems and some of the misinformation on the basis of which the ombudsman found that there had been maladministration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07072570000499">Lord Fowler came in for a certain amount of criticism from the Minister in the other place for leaving rather vague the issue of who would actually perform such scrutiny. However, as Lord Fowler said:</p>
<a name="70725-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="07072570000761"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The amendment would give the Government maximum flexibility.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 11 July 2007; Vol. 693, c. 1410.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para16"><a name="07072570000500">There is some merit in that view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para17"><a name="07072570000501">Most important is the commonsense point that every time we pass pensions legislation in the House the law of unintended consequences runs through it. It was trumpeted that one of the principal aims of the Pensions Act 2004 was the protection and enhancement of defined benefit schemes. In fact, the measure accelerated the closure of such schemes to new entrants and even to existing members, so I permit myself a wry smile when I consider the arguments in the Lords about the time scale for post-legislative scrutiny. Is it not interesting that within barely two years of the 2004 Act the Government&#146;s White Paper announced a review of its provisions? Any Government worth their salt would look closely at such legislation in a much shorter time scale than that proposed in either the original amendment or the compromise amendment. It is ironic that on this very day the Government published the results of the regulatory review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para18"><a name="07072570000502">We on the Conservative Benches are keen supporters of Lord Fowler&#146;s proposition that major legislation deserves proper post-legislative scrutiny. I join Lord Fowler in noting the fact that the new Prime Minister has said that he wants to restore the role of Parliament, and we welcome the Government&#146;s deathbed conversion to the principle. I understand that Lord Fowler and his colleagues in the Lords are content with the amendment proposed; therefore I am too, so we shall not oppose it. However, if and when we win the next election we shall certainly carry out our own thorough review of this and other recent pensions legislation.</p>

<p><a name="st_o240"><a name="07072570000503"><a name="70725-0012.htm_spnew2"><a name="07072570001092"><b>Danny Alexander:</b>
 The activities in the other place to add the concept of post-legislative scrutiny to the Bill played a useful role. The work done by Lord Fowler,  <br>

supported by Liberal Democrat, Conservative and Cross-Bencher colleagues, to insist on that concept has in the end managed to wheedle from the Government a useful amendment in response. That goes some way towards meeting the objectives set out in the Lords and on that basis I welcome the Government&#146;s amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para19"><a name="07072570000504">The Bill will have a very long-term impact indeed. The main impact of the legislation will be felt not in one, two, three or four years&#146; time, but for generations to come. It is appropriate therefore that there be scrutiny of the Bill&#146;s impact once it receives Royal Assent and becomes law. That is true for a number of reasons, the first of which is the point that Lord Fowler made in his speech in the other place about perceiving and acting on errors or mistakes that may have been made. Government amendment (a) will allow the possibility of proper scrutiny in the future of some of the flaws in the Bill that my hon. Friends and I have highlighted during its passage. The Government deny that there are flaws, but the truth will become certain only with the passage of time. Government amendment (a) will allow time to elapse before those issues can be properly examined.</p>
<a name="ordayhd_7"><a name="70725-0012.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="07072570000824"><h5 align="left">3.45 pm</h5>
<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07072570000505">I hope in particular that, in implementing Government amendment (a) in relation to reviewing and preparing a report on the operation of the Act, the Secretary of State, whoever he is by 2014, will have regard to questions about the extent to which means-testing is still a pervasive part of the system by that date. No doubt, we will debate this when the next pensions Bill comes down the track&#151;one is expected in the next Session&#151;but I remain of the view that the extent to which means-testing is still a pervasive part of the system, or mass means-testing, should be considered. I believe very much that that could well undermine personal accounts, the establishment of the delivery authority for which is part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para21"><a name="07072570000506">The Liberal Democrats have concerns about what the way in which the Bill operates will mean for the rights of many women pensioners to have access to a full state pension, a matter which we debated briefly last week. Again, I hope that the Secretary of State can include that in his report. The Minister rightly referred in his opening remarks to the increases in the state pension age that will follow the Bill. Again, reviews of the proper operation of the implementation of that will be important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para22"><a name="07072570000507">The Bill relates to the uprating of pensions in line with earnings. We have been given a date&#151;I think that it is 2012&#151;but we have also been told that the uprating might not happen for two or three years after that. It might well not happen until the end of that Parliament. Although I am not able to predict the dates on which Parliaments begin and end, it is possible that the uprating in line with earnings will not start until 2015. I hope that the timing of the report before the end of 2014 will, if necessary&#151;I hope that it is not&#151;act as strong corrective to any governmental wish to delay yet further the implementation of the uprating in line with earnings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para23"><a name="07072570000508">The Minister will know that the Liberal Democrats have called for that uprating to take place immediately, and I remain of that view.

produce such a report and to bring it before Parliament, where we would expect to debate it, so that it could come under scrutiny and pressure from hon. Members about possible failure to deliver the content of the Bill, we will ensure that Ministers act quickly to do the decent thing in relation to the uprating in line with earnings and to introduce it, at least by their own timetable, inadequate though the Liberal Democrats believe it is. With those few words, I say that the Liberal Democrats will be happy for the House to pass these amendments.</p>

 With regard to post-legislative scrutiny, when provisions come before the House, many Members are at a disadvantage in so far as we do not have the time to go through the detail. Would the Minister like to give an undertaking to ask the National Audit Office to produce a report that covers certain key sections to inform Members, so that they can fully take part in any scrutiny debate in the House?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para24"><a name="07072570000513">These are important amendments. It is perhaps fitting, as we move towards the conclusion of the Bill, that the amendment has been dealt with in a spirit of compromise. That is important because pensions, above all, require a consensus to be built around long-term planning for the way in which we develop security for the elderly in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="70725-0012.htm_para25"><a name="07072570000514">The Bill will enable a lot of legislation to be passed&#151;some of it potentially quite controversial, such as the provisions to increase the retirement age. We have been able to put those provisions through the House because the Turner report, and those who worked on it, provided the basis for a consensus to be built around pensions policy. There were some issues of political controversy during the course of the Bill. In the course of reviewing the Bill, perhaps a Minister will look at some of those issues, as well looking at the areas where we all agreed. It was important that we had that level of agreement and that we were able to get through some potentially very difficult issues. I extend the Government&#146;s thanks to Opposition Front-Bench Members for the way in which they broadly approached many of the issues.</p>

The Treasury Committee, under the able chairmanship of my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (John McFall), has helped us a great deal, enabling us to move forward in a short space of time, and I thank him and his Committee members for that. I reiterate our support for Sir Michael, who was nominated by my right hon.

In its report published earlier this week, the Committee highlighted its role in reviewing public appointments in respect of the Monetary Policy Committee. Both the Exchequer Secretary and I are former and recent members of that Select Committee and have been involved in many such cases. The methodology used in those cases, which is being used in the present case, entails considering two aspects: first, professional competence, and secondly, personal independence. In respect of Sir Michael Scholar&#146;s professional competence, as the Exchequer Secretary rightly said, he has had a long and distinguished career  <br>

in the higher reaches of the civil service, and he has considerable experience also in the City and in business and academia. His extensive experience is important, given the stresses and strains in the statistical service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07072570000541">On the same day as the appointment of Sir Michael was published by the Treasury Committee, a report on the efficiency savings of the Treasury&#146;s departments was also published, following a review by the Treasury Sub-Committee. I pay tribute to the Sub-Committee, under the chairmanship of my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon). He highlighted some of the issues that will need to be addressed by the chairman of the Statistics Board, derived from the evidence received by the Sub-Committee indicating some of the strains on the Office for National Statistics, which is described as an organisation under intense pressure. The Committee states:</p>
<a name="70725-0013.htm_brev8"><a name="07072570000770"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;That pressure arises from the combined effect of budgetary restraint, the requirement to meet stretching efficiency targets for monetary savings, headcount reductions and relocation, the ambitious modernisation programme including re-engineering of the National Accounts, the need to prepare for the 2011 census and the preparations for legislative change, including the creation of the new Statistics Board&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para15"><a name="07072570000542">The report goes on to say that</p>
<a name="70725-0013.htm_brev9"><a name="07072570000772"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the combination of demands creates an exceptional burden&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para16"><a name="07072570000543">As chairman of the Statistics Board, Sir Michael will be required to address some of those matters. His experience as a senior civil servant will stand him in good stead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para17"><a name="07072570000544">The second aspect that the Treasury Committee traditionally considers is independence. The oral hearing during which Sir Michael gave evidence to the Committee focused heavily on his independence. It was suggested to him that some might say that as a perhaps naturally discreet career civil servant, of whom the <i> Financial Times</i> wrote that</p>
<a name="70725-0013.htm_brev10"><a name="07072570000773"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;his reputation among establishment figures is already high&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para18"><a name="07072570000545">his main challenge will be to show that his is an independent voice. That is clearly significant. Some might also raise concerns about the fact that he is the father of Mr. Tom Scholar, a civil servant who has returned from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Washington to become the Prime Minister&#146;s chief of staff at No. 10 Downing street.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para19"><a name="07072570000546">Nevertheless, the Treasury Committee was satisfied, and I believe rightly so, with Sir Michael&#146;s independence, not only on the basis that if Caesar&#146;s wife must be above suspicion, so must the chief of staff&#146;s father, but on the evidence of what he said in the course of the hearing, particularly about the most controversial issue debated during the passage of the Bill&#151;pre-release practice. I have no intention of dwelling on that but, in brief terms, many of us believe&#151;Conservative Members, Liberal Democrat Members, the House of Lords, which has shown it on at least two occasions, and most experts in the field&#151;that pre-release policy should be determined by the Statistics Board and that it should be somewhat shorter than the 24 hours that the Government eventually settled on as the maximum period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para20"><a name="07072570000547">Sir Michael was questioned about that because the Government&#146;s position has been that Ministers should decide&#151;albeit, now, after consultation with the board. When asked about his position by my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks, he stated that he would prefer to have a shorter pre-release period, and said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para21"><a name="07072570000548">When asked whether he thought that the board, as opposed to Ministers, should decide pre-release practice, he responded:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para22"><a name="07072570000549">Reading the transcript, one can detect a sense of reticence on his part in not wishing to intervene in this controversial area, but when pressed he was clear and unambiguous. I think, therefore, that we can be reassured as to Sir Michael&#146;s independence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para23"><a name="07072570000550">However, there are one or two questions for the Government, who have been forced by defeats in the House of Lords to concede&#151;although they have not gone nearly far enough&#151;that they have to consult the board on pre-release access. Given that the board recommends a maximum pre-release period of less than 24 hours, which is what the Prime Minister announced on 3 July, and that that is the view of the chairman of the board, would the Government be prepared so to reduce it? If not, the whole consultation process would appear to be something of a sham. That would be damaging to the credibility of Sir Michael Scholar in his role of chairman of the Statistics Board, damaging to the board as a whole, and damaging to the reputation for independence of statistics in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para24"><a name="07072570000551">The appointment of Sir Michael is welcome, because he is clearly a very able man who showed, in the course of the Treasury Committee hearing, that he is a man of independence. However, there is an important question for the Government, who will have to listen to Sir Michael if they are in any way to protect our statistics&#146; reputation for independence.</p>

 On Friday 13 July, I received a call from the Chancellor asking if the Treasury Committee would hold a pre-confirmation hearing into the appointment of the new chair of the Statistics Board if the appointment was made on the subsequent Monday. I was pleased to do that, because this is a new constitutional arrangement and it is important that Parliament, particularly its Select Committees, has more power. I pay tribute to the fellow members of my Committee and particularly to its staff, who have been under quite a lot of pressure in the past few months. We have had many reports to put out. Indeed, in the past few days, we have agreed reports on the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, on private equity, and on unclaimed assets.

and integrity of statistics. We asked him tough questions, including one that I put to him at the beginning of the meeting about his close family connections with No. 10 Downing street&#151;his son is the chief of staff to the Prime Minister. Sir Michael answered that question very clearly, saying that his son was a civil servant, and that he phoned him up after the appointment to congratulate him. He was very clear on that, and I have read since that Sir Michael prepared a report on independence for the Bank of England when he was personal assistant to the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, Lord Lawson, but it was not implemented by that Government. His son, Tom Scholar, however, was involved in the preparation of the report on independence for the Bank of England in 1997. The Governor of the Bank of England has referred to that as &#147;a scholarly achievement&#148; and I would endorse that comment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para27"><a name="07072570000555">Sir Michael answered that question very satisfactorily. We also tested his willingness to take a position at odds with Ministers and we were encouraged by his answers. I suggest that we brought the best out of Sir Michael, because he is a civil servant, and he mentioned that since his retirement six years ago, and during his time spent heading St. John&#146;s college, Oxford that&#151;unlike a number of other civil servants&#151;he has never spoken to the press. We suggested to him that perhaps everything he had said in the past six years had been off the record, but it was very important that everything he said as chair of the Statistics Board was on the record, and that he should question the Government on a number of points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para28"><a name="07072570000556">The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) and the Minister were both on the Treasury Select Committee, so if anyone thinks of it as a Select Committee that is in isolation from the House, they can forget it. I would suggest that on the evidence of today&#151;from both the Front Benchers&#151;the Treasury Committee is a good training ground for people who want to get on and get promotion. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman and the Minister for the distinction of their service on the Treasury Committee, and I wish both of them well for the future. I suggest that wishing both Front Benchers well shows a real independent stance by the Chairman of the Treasury Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para29"><a name="07072570000557">We were encouraged by Sir Michael&#146;s responses, and as a result, we recommend him to the House. I want to touch on the challenges that he will face. Public confidence in statistics in the United Kingdom is low. That may be because of the perception that statistics can be spun by Ministers, and a key challenge for Sir Michael will be to work to overcome this perception and to monitor the arrangements that give rise to it. When questioned by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon), Sir Michael was very clear that he wanted pre-release times to be shorter. Furthermore, he wished that that had been a decision of the board, and the Committee agreed with those comments. We look forward to him chairing the board in the professional manner he has shown in his life as a civil servant, and as an academic, and also, at times, we hope that he makes constructive criticism of the Government when we feel that they have got it wrong.</p>

international comparisons and the United Nations recommendation. Indeed, the Select Committee visited the Republic of Ireland a few months ago, when we examined arrangements there for statistics and pre-release. The Act that governs that in the Republic of Ireland dates back to 1993, which shows how far behind we were. We have come far, but there is still a distance to go on pre-released statistics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para31"><a name="07072570000559">I remember an opinion poll that suggested that only 17 per cent. of the population in the United Kingdom have confidence in official statistics. That is bad for statistics, politicians and the democratic process. It is important to improve the position and I hope that Sir Michael&#146;s appointment will help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para32"><a name="07072570000560">Sir Michael will face an organisational challenge. It has already been said that, earlier this week, we published a report arising from an inquiry by the Sub-Committee, which is ably chaired by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks. It characterised the Office for National Statistics as an organisation that is under intense pressure. I trust that my hon. Friend the Exchequer Secretary will tackle some of those pressures before 1 April 2008. In doing that, I hope that she will work closely with Sir Michael as shadow chair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para33"><a name="07072570000561">The combined task that Sir Michael faces will make demands on his time. He has been appointed as a non-executive chairman to work a three-day week. We questioned him about his other commitments, most notably his post as head of St. John&#146;s college, Oxford. He told us that he would work three days at St. John&#146;s college and three days at the Statistics Board. That is a six-day week and we forcefully suggested to him that his primary responsibility should be his Statistics Board job. He took that point on board. The position as chair of the Statistics Board must be his primary commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para34"><a name="07072570000562">Let me offer some thoughts on the new process. In the case that we are considering, a pre-appointment Select Committee hearing and a debate on the Floor of the House have taken place. However, the Government&#146;s report on the new constitutional arrangements does not make clear the posts that are up for pre-appointment hearing and those that are not. The Government have much work to do on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para35"><a name="07072570000563">I welcome the Government&#146;s proposals that Select Committee hearings should precede formal appointments, but the case for motions and debates on non-controversial appointments is not clear. Taking the two points together, along with the Government&#146;s argument that Select Committees&#146; views should be non-binding, the Committee proposes that debates and votes in the House should be reserved for cases in which Select Committees reach an adverse opinion on a Government nominee. We have not reached such an opinion about Sir Michael&#146;s appointment, which we welcome and support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="70725-0013.htm_para36"><a name="07072570000564">We are glad to support the motion and we wish Sir Michael and his colleagues every success on the Statistics Board in the next few years, with a view to improving confidence in statistics and thereby in the democratic process.</p>

 Although I have not had the privilege of serving on the Treasury Select Committee, I am not here to break the consensus on endorsing Sir Michael Scholar and confirming him as Government nominee to the post of chair of the Statistics Board. The right hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire (John McFall) was right to highlight Sir Michael&#146;s experience and to question him strongly about his work load and his independence. The Committee was right to do that forcefully, and its members have shown themselves to be independent in reaching their conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="70725-0014.htm_para0"><a name="07072570000566">The process has been worth while and I would like to dwell on that. It is new and welcome. It is excellent to have the opportunity not only to hold a pre-appointment hearing but to debate and potentially vote on the nomination on the Floor of the House. My question to the Exchequer Secretary focuses on the role of the Select Committee and the interaction with the process up until now, with the passage of the Statistics and Registration Service Bill through Parliament. We know now that departmental responsibility for the issue will fall not to the Treasury, but to the Cabinet Office. Although I appreciate that that was not the basis on which the Bill was planned and went through, and the appointment process started, that was known when the Treasury contacted the right hon. Gentleman and asked for a pre-appointment hearing for Sir Michael.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="70725-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07072570000567">Given the compressed timetable and the fact that it was known then that it was more than likely that responsibility would be transferred to the Cabinet Office, would it have been appropriate for the Committee to have been involved with the relevant experience and expertise in the Cabinet Office rather than in the Treasury? That would have reflected how things were going to be, rather than the process thus far. My question for the Exchequer Secretary is: did the Treasury consider such a move? Perhaps the Select Committee on Public Administration could have undertaken a role similar to that undertaken by the Treasury Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="70725-0014.htm_para2"><a name="07072570000568">I conclude by echoing the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments, in welcoming the opportunity that we have had and in asking the Exchequer Secretary how she and other Ministers will consider extending the process to other high-profile appointments. This case might be the only instance in which we have such an opportunity. We have heard concerns expressed about how compressed the process was, but there is cross-support for the principle, so I very much hope that the Government will consider extending it to other posts of such importance and profile.</p>

 I, too, join the chorus of congratulation of the Government on initiating the process. It is the kind of thing for which I have argued for years and it is a pleasure to be part of a Parliament that is implementing it. I also congratulate the Treasury Committee on doing a pretty okay job at almost no notice. It came across clearly from the questions that the Committee asked Sir Michael Scholar, from his experience and his commitment to independence, and from the interview process as a whole that the appointment was appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="70725-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07072570000570">I want to focus on one aspect of the questioning that could have been fuller. I do not say that in a critical tone, because the Committee did a good job at short notice, as well as doing an exposition on how the process should go forward, which is also helpful. I want to focus on Sir Michael&#146;s post-appointment actions. There was a focus on the appointment of other board members, which was quite appropriate, but in my judgment we are making a mistake&#151;hon. Members will have heard me say this before&#151;about what the source of the lack of public confidence in statistics is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="70725-0014.htm_para4"><a name="07072570000571">It is true that one source of the lack of public confidence in statistics is a sense that politicians get hold of them first and might manipulate them. However, there is a much more important source, which is when those statistics are just plain wrong. We have to address that issue seriously&#151;indeed, there is an Adjournment debate on the subject today. I am profoundly concerned that we are not confronting certain weaknesses sufficiently strongly. We all know that they are not deliberate weaknesses&#151;the Office for National Statistics is not trying to get the census and inter-census estimates of population wrong&#151;but we are also confronted with overwhelming evidence that things are not right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="70725-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07072570000572">One of the risks of that public discourse is that the Committee goes with the flow when people say, &#147;Oh well, the source of the lack of public confidence in statistics is spin&#148;. I believe that there is another very important source of the lack of public confidence in statistics&#151;</p>

 Order. This is a very narrow motion, and if the hon. Lady is going to engage in a discussion about one of the specific functions of the office in question, she must keep that point brief and relate it back to the specific matter of the appointment of the name on the Order Paper.</p>

 Thank you very much for your kindness, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The point that I was about to make was that I was rather surprised that the Committee, in questioning Sir Michael, did not probe his plans for tackling failures in the quality of our statistics as powerfully as I would have expected. It probed very strongly his plans for the appointment of the panel, and for pre-release information, but I did not feel that it dealt with that first issue strongly enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="70725-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07072570000575">I am raising this matter because one of the functions of this kind of process is to have a parliamentary debate about these appointments, and I am confident that the new chairman of the Statistics Board will read the Committee&#146;s very useful report and the report of this debate closely. It is right for Members to use this debate to set the board on track to improving our national statistics, because I am certain that an excellent chair of the Statistics Board would want that to happen.</p>

 I shall not follow the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) too deeply into the issue of the census. She described our report as &#147;pretty okay&#148;, so I shall simply congratulate her on a pretty okay speech. She might like to know, however, that the Treasury Select Committee will address the preparations for the new census, as it did for the previous census, at some point in the next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="70725-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07072570000582">I want to speak briefly in support of the motion. I welcome the new procedure, which allows the House to express its view. Should the motion be passed, it will also enable the new chairman of the board to begin the task of rebuilding public confidence in statistics knowing that he has the full support of Members on both sides of the House. The Treasury Committee, which looked in detail at Sir Michael Scholar&#146;s appointment, supports him and has confidence in him. We questioned him at length, and then discussed  his candidacy at length, before making the recommendation that is now before the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="70725-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07072570000583">The fact that the new procedure has been introduced for this appointment underlines the importance of the chairmanship of the new, independent Statistics Board. It is an important post. I believe that the chairman of the Statistics Board should become a big public figure, who is able not only to lead one of the major public agencies but to give the public back their confidence in the statistics that it provides. That matters because the new board is now, finally, at the end of the legislation, independent of Ministers in all respects bar one. The chairman of the board will therefore be closer to Parliament than any of his predecessors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="70725-0014.htm_para10"><a name="07072570000584">That also matters because he takes over the chairmanship of the board at a time when the Office for National Statistics is in transition. It is becoming the Statistics Board; it is relocating to Newport; it is facing formidable challenges; and, as we were reminded earlier, it is preparing for the census in 2011. As the Treasury Committee mentioned in a separate report earlier this week, it also faces a series of challenges and is under enormous pressure from the Government in  <br>

terms of efficiency savings&#151;costs and headcount reductions&#151;which could put at risk services on which key users such as the Treasury itself, the banks, the City and business so desperately rely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="70725-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07072570000585">It was the permanent secretary who, in giving evidence to our Committee, defended the efficiency targets. When he was asked why he was piling them on top of the relocation, on top of the preparation for the census, on top of legislative preparations to transfer the ONS to the Statistics Board, he replied that the target-setting process was</p>
<a name="70725-0014.htm_brev0"><a name="07072570000776"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;like trying to solve a set of simultaneous equations&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70725-0014.htm_para12"><a name="07072570000586">I have to say that this is not an academic exercise. We need a strong Office for National Statistics producing accurate and timely statistics, which are a vital public service and a cornerstone of our democracy. The new chairman therefore needs quickly to get a grip of the challenges faced by the ONS and ensure that management is fully supported and that priorities are properly set before the ONS is overwhelmed. He must ensure that it is ready for the challenges that lie ahead&#151;not least the preparation for the 2011 census.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70725-0014.htm_para13"><a name="07072570000587">My final point is to ask whether Sir Michael Scholar is the right man. He is a former Treasury mandarin and I note that former Treasury mandarins never quite retire&#151;not when new quangos are being set up! I am not convinced, however, that when it comes to applying for those particular jobs, Treasury mandarins should necessarily be discriminated against just because they are Treasury mandarins. In any event, there is not much evidence that they are being discriminated against. Given their success in securing the glittering prizes, I would make one suggestion. It might be an idea for the current permanent secretary not necessarily to sit on each of these selection panels when he is so likely to appear on the other side of the table in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70725-0014.htm_para14"><a name="07072570000588">Two main considerations apply to Sir Michael&#146;s candidacy, the first of which is independence. Will he be sufficiently independent? The Treasury Committee was fully satisfied on that point. It is already clear, one day after the Government asked the House to send an amendment back to the Lords, that Sir Michael Scholar disagrees with the Government. He believes that pre-release should be a matter for the board and not for Ministers to determine. Within 48 hours of the Prime Minister&#146;s recommendation that the maximum time for pre-release should be 24 hours, he also disagreed with that. He said that he would much prefer less time. The all-party Treasury Committee, comprising six former Ministers, recommended only three hours. I hope that Sir Michael follows that independence through and makes vigorous comments on the arrangements for pre-release access when the Government publish them in draft. When it comes to the 12-month review of those arrangements, I hope that the Statistics Board under his chairmanship will make it very clear what it would prefer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70725-0014.htm_para15"><a name="07072570000589">The only remaining issue was the time commitment involved in the job. As the Chairman of our Committee has already said, the post is three days a week. Sir Michael is already committed as president of a busy Oxford college and he has a non-executive directorship, all of which seem to add up to six days a week. I simply draw the House&#146;s attention to our recommendation that  <br>

the chairmanship must be his primary commitment. He must be here in London or out in Newport at the office rather than in the garden or at the organ or in the cellars of St. John&#146;s college, Oxford. Indeed, we expect him not only to fulfil his commitment at the London and Newport offices but to be here as well, answering questions in Parliament. He should make himself fully accountable for the work of the Statistics Board to whatever new Committee takes on the scrutiny function that my sub-Committee has exercised for so long.</p>

 The motion proves that if a Member is in the House long enough, all decisions are ultimately reversed. I recall vividly in 1988 when Margaret Thatcher transferred the then Central Statistical Office, which was under the control of the Cabinet Office, to the Treasury, to the great chagrin of many of the statisticians in my constituency who were concerned that it had gone to the Department with the greatest vested interest in fiddling the figures. They were worried about their positions and that the value of their work would be undermined by ministerial interference. I was told in a letter from Margaret Thatcher that that was an unworthy thought. Unworthy though it may have been, we are now moving the organisation back. There is great merit in that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70725-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07072570000594">I welcome the procedure. It is innovative and has been called for by many people with an interest in our parliamentary processes. It is a major reform. As Andrew Dilnot said, the Statistics and Registration Service Bill might be the most important Bill in this Parliament&#151;at least equivalent to the legislation that gave independence to the Bank of England.</p>

As we heard, he is not entirely in tune with Government thinking on the release of information.

Some people do not seem to accept with the enthusiasm that they should the Government&#146;s offer to give them a passport out of Pimlico to the joys of Newport and its hinterland. I hope that tomorrow she will see the many people who came from the south-east of England&#151;from the Patent Office, the Prison Service, the UK Passport Service and the ONS&#151;with grave doubts about whether they would settle well in Newport and who have found themselves much happier in so many ways with the facilities and the quality of life there.

There has been some lack of clarity on that. All statisticians should sign up to the code, whether they are employed centrally or are departmental statisticians.

The Office for National Statistics is preparing for independence, and that has been widely welcomed in all parts of the House. The Statistics and Registration Service Bill might well be one of the most important Bills for many years. I am sure that the system for pre-release and other issues will evolve; the Bill has been created and subsequently changed in ways that will assist that to happen. I can certainly give the House an undertaking that I, as Exchequer Secretary, will work closely with Sir Michael and the shadow board when it comes into existence in the run-up to April next year when the ONS will celebrate its independence.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. In connection with the motion that the Leader of the House is about to move, may I ask why it is on the Order Paper in the form that it is? If the nomination of the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) had been placed on the Order Paper on Monday, there would have been no need to suspend Standing Order No. 121. I have to confess that, as someone who has chaired the Procedure Committee for some eight years, I find this an abuse of the House of Commons. This motion has appeared only today and should in my view have appeared 48 hours earlier. The press might well have been interested in this matter for a variety of reasons, which might well be raised during the course of the debate on this motion. To suspend Standing Orders for the nomination of a Member to, and the discharge of a Member from, a Select Committee is an abuse of this House and has not allowed it sufficient time to consider the relevance of the motion, and the suitability of the individual in fulfilling what I consider to be a very important role in this House of Commons. </p>

The position at the moment in relation to the Home Affairs Committee is this. Following the appointment of my right hon.

I say &#147;effectively&#148; because until my right hon.

 I entirely understand the thrust of the argument that the Leader of the House is developing, but if memory serves me correctly, the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills was appointed on 28 June. There have been no fewer than 27 days since that appointment, during the course of which it would presumably have been possible to establish the willingness or otherwise of the right hon.

 Perhaps I can respond by setting out the chronology. On 27 June the Prime Minister became Prime Minister, and thereafter he had to select and appoint his Cabinet. After that, he had to move on and appoint junior Ministers. After that, he had to identify and appoint Under-Secretaries. Hon. Members will understand that one could not work out who was in the pool of Members available to serve on a Select Committee before all those appointments were made. It sometimes seems that it takes a long time for a Cabinet to be selected&#151;</p>

 I agree with the thrust of interventions from hon.

 I am grateful to the Leader of the House for being generous in giving way. She is making several presumptions about decisions that are rightly decisions for the Committee rather than for the House.

 Yes, it is possible that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, who had previously been the Chairman and remains a member of the Committee, could simply have not participated in an election of one of the existing members as an acting Chairman until October. However, my view is that it is better to offer the House another name and give the Committee an opportunity to elect a new Chairman, and set about its programme of work without having to return in October to go through the process of selection again.</p>

 The motion will enable us to replace a member of the Select Committee who has become a member of the Cabinet. Members can try to read into it all sorts of nefarious motives, but it is quite simple. We are short of time, because of when the change of Prime Minister happened. It takes a while to work out the pool for all the Under-Secretary appointments, so we have come straight to the House without going via the Committee of Selection, which would have been a more desirable procedure.

 The Home Affairs Committee&#146;s meetings are a matter for the Committee.

 I have to say to the right hon. and learned Lady that her defence of the process that the Government have used this afternoon has been woefully inadequate.

Members: &#147;It is.&#148;] Implicitly, that is what was said, and my understanding is that that is precisely the plan. The Leader of the House said that Select Committee business is not for her, but she needs to be honest with us as to whether the Government&#146;s plan&#151;not hers&#151;is that the new nominee should be the Chairman.</p>

Member for Walsall, North and the other hon. Ladies and Gentlemen from various parties were not competent to carry on the business of the Home Affairs Committee between now and October. That is not an acceptable proposition. They have served on the Committee, they have produced very good reports, and they were well served as Chairman by the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen, who gave it a very good reputation and profile and whom I commend and thank for his service. He is widely admired and respected. However, it is nonsense to argue that nobody else in the list of current members, including the hon. Member for Walsall, North, is competent or capable to carry out its business, whatever it may be&#151;at the moment, there is none&#151;over the next two and half months.</p>

It has not been prevented from doing so, and I am sure that it can do so during the first week back or the recess. It has the power to decide to meet in the recess, and to call people in front of it at that time. It is perfectly competent as a Select Committee, and it is able to continue.</p>

To depart from that style and decide to impose by a whipped vote a change to Standing Orders in two major respects, on the last-but-one day of the summer term, in order to force through a controversial change of personnel in one of the most important Select Committees, will do great discredit to the prospective, positive reforming work that she and her right hon.

It could have met last week, Monday, yesterday, or this morning. It did not meet at any of those times. It was standing by, ready to meet, and willing and able to assist.</p>

 The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) made a powerful speech, to which I want to add a relatively brief footnote. What the Leader of the House is doing is unprecedented and unnecessary. The Committee of Selection was established at the beginning of this Parliament and its job is to meet every week, to nominate people to Public Bill Committees, Select Committees, Committees on statutory instruments and Committees on private Bills. At the beginning of the Parliament, we nominated members of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, and a motion was approved by the House. Since then, we have met weekly under the impartial and efficient chairmanship of the hon. Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch, East (Rosemary McKenna).  <br>

People get promoted, become Ministers or their preferences may change. When that happens, we meet on a Wednesday, and the changes are proposed in the name of the hon. Lady. They appear on the Order Paper, the House has an opportunity to reflect on them, and if it wishes, to object. We have met every Wednesday since the last reshuffle. As has been said during the debate, we were provisionally scheduled to meet this Monday, when we could have approved any changes to Select Committees. The names would then have appeared in the hon. Lady&#146;s name on the Order Paper today, in the normal way, and we would not have this problem. We were informed on Monday that the Government had no business, and the meeting was cancelled. We could have met today; we normally meet at 4.45 pm on a Wednesday, but there was no business scheduled for the Committee of Selection today, so we did not meet.</p>

A motion has to have at least two sitting days&#146; notice and it has to be made on behalf of the Committee of Selection by the Chairman, or another member of the Committee. Suspending Standing Orders requires a much better reason than anything that we have heard so far in the debate. The Home Affairs Committee has been meeting under the chairmanship of a senior and experienced Member. I doubt whether it planned to do much during the summer recess. If it had planned any work, it could have continued to meet under the chairmanship of the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick).</p>

It matters because it is up to the House of Commons, not the Executive, to nominate Members to serve on Select Committees. The Prime Minister has spoken of his wish to empower the House of Commons and enable us better to hold the Government to account. Yet one of his first acts is to use a procedure, for which no precedent has been found, to appoint a nominee of the Executive to a Select Committee instead of a nominee of a Select Committee. Let me make it clear that my comments are no way motivated by disapproval of either the right hon. Member who is leaving the Select Committee or the right hon. Member who is nominated. My objections are principled ones to the procedure that is being used.</p>

No real reason has been given for not using that procedure in the case that we are considering. The best thing that the Leader of the House can do is stand up when I sit down and say that she plans to withdraw the motion to allow the Committee of Selection to meet on 8 or 9 October and the names to go through in the normal way. If she does not do that, I fear that the debate will continue for some time and, unless we get far better reasons than I have heard so far, I am minded to advise the House to reject the motion.</p>

She did not answer that question earlier, perhaps because in a way she did not want to. She is quite right: it is not for the House of Commons as a whole to dictate who should be the Chairman of that Committee. That is the responsibility of the Home Affairs Committee. In an earlier intervention I made certain observations about the individual being put forward.

 I suppose that we have to accept at face value what the Leader of House has told us&#151;namely that on Monday, and apparently on Tuesday, the Government had no business to put to the Selection Committee. Bearing in mind the fact that, as we have heard from a number of contributors to this debate, the Prime Minister formed his Government by appointing Cabinet Ministers, Ministers of State and Under-Secretaries some time ago, it seems strange that the Leader of the House, for whom&#151;I repeat&#151;I have considerable affection and regard, should not have put the motion to the House until the penultimate day before we break for the summer recess and that the Government should be ignoring the provisions of Standing Order No. 121 on the nomination of Select Committees.</p>

I would have thought that the Home Affairs Committee could continue its work under his chairmanship, but no contributor to the debate has told the House what work the Committee is to undertake between now and 8 October when the House meets again following the summer recess. I am going to throw in the following, as it has not been mentioned so far: if the House wants value for money, it appears strange to appoint a Chairman who will be paid the full rate as a Select Committee Chairman when he and his Committee are to do very little, if anything, on behalf of the House or the people of this country for the next two and a half months.</p>

 When the Leader of the House reads her speech on this matter, I think that she will find it rather distressing. It contained a number of contentions, some of which seemed straightforwardly contradictory. I do not wish to beat her around the head with a broom, but one of her propositions was that it was inappropriate to have a Cabinet Minister on a Select Committee, yet she herself is now going to be nominated by a member of the Executive to sit on a Select Committee. The sheer inconsistency of that is remarkable. It leaps out at us: Home Affairs, Ms. Harriet Harman, the Leader of the House. A member of the Executive&#151;a member of the Cabinet&#151;is directing to the House&#146;s attention a particular Member whom they wish to become a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee. Indeed, most of us suppose that it is the intention that the nominee should become Chairman of that Committee. I do not think for one moment that the matter was allowed to go to the Committee of Selection. We have heard from my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) and we have also heard and read out the Standing Orders. No one in the House can be unaware of the Standing Orders; they are quite clear.

If the Committee of Selection were to override all the Whips sitting on it and choose another Member, that would also be inappropriate.

Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick). That is not my point. I am not saying that they are not all competent and able. Of course they are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="70725-0018.htm_para3"><a name="07072576000057">What I am fundamentally proposing is that the House moves a currently serving member of the Constitutional Affairs Committee, which is what my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) is, to serve as a member of the Home Affairs Committee. If he is suitable, as we believe he is, for the House to vote him on to the Constitutional Affairs Committee, he is suitable also for the House to vote him on to the Home Affairs Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="70725-0018.htm_para4"><a name="07072576000058">I do not accept either that Select Committees do nothing over the summer. Whether or not they do nothing is a matter for them. I know that many of them are extremely active over the summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="70725-0018.htm_para5"><a name="07072576000059">I want to correct something. I said that the Prime Minister had to deal with the appointment of Cabinet Ministers, junior Ministers and Parliamentary Under-Secretaries. I should have added Parliamentary Private Secretaries as well, because those are subsequent to the appointment of Parliamentary Under-Secretaries. It was not until it was clear who were going to be Parliamentary Private Secretaries and to what Department they would be allocated that we were in a position to know who might be available for the Home Affairs Committee.</p>

<p><a name="st_o350"><a name="07072576000060"><a name="70725-0018.htm_spnew2"><a name="07072576000593"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</b>
 The Leader of the House said that the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) will be moved from the Constitutional Affairs Committee to the Home Affairs Committee. Where on the Order Paper does it say that he will be moved from that Committee?</p>

<p><a name="st_o351"><a name="07072576000061"><a name="70725-0018.htm_spnew3"><a name="07072576000594"><b>Ms Harman:</b>
 What I perhaps should say is that my right hon. Friend has been voted by this House on to the Constitutional Affairs Committee. Clearly, the House regarded him as suitable for that. I am asking the House to consider him&#151; <i> [Interruption.] </i>I presume he stays on both Committees unless he is removed from the Constitutional Affairs Committee. I do not, however, accept the argument that Select Committees have nothing to do over the summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="70725-0018.htm_para6"><a name="07072576000062">I was asked about the salary of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills as Chair of the Home Affairs Committee. I am advised that the House&#146;s resolution of 2003, which deals with pay for Select Committee Chairs, provides that the salary ceases if the member becomes a Minister. No Select Committee salary will have been paid to my right hon. Friend since his appointment to the Cabinet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="70725-0018.htm_para7"><a name="07072576000063">I have listened to what Members have said, and I register the vehemence with which they have stated their argument; however, I considered that argument before I brought the motion before the House. I acknowledge that this is an exceptional procedure, and that it would have been better if there had been time for the matter to go before the Committee of Selection. It would be easier on me if I could simply withdraw the motion as a new and persuasive argument had caused me to change my mind, but I anticipated the argument that has been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70725-0018.htm_para8"><a name="07072576000064">I did not anticipate, however, that Members would think that there was a conspiracy behind the motion; I had hoped that they would accept that there was a question to do with timing as we are approaching the end of the Session. As Leader of the House, I must listen to the arguments that are made and work out whether it is right to put a motion to the House. In effect, this motion places a current member of the Constitutional Affairs Committee on to the Home Affairs Committee. We must make sure that we do not fail to see the wood for the trees; we must understand that that is the subject that we would vote on.</p>

<p><a name="st_o352"><a name="07072576000065"><a name="70725-0018.htm_spnew4"><a name="07072576000595"><b>John Bercow:</b>

 No. I have given way a number of times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="70725-0018.htm_para9"><a name="07072576000067">I come to be Leader of the House at a time when there are a great many changes strengthening the position of the House, and I fully support them. We have had independent scrutiny of appointments for the first time; we will have topical debates so that Members can swiftly ask questions of Ministers on behalf of their constituents; more Bills have been published in draft; we have had pre-legislative scrutiny; we are moving on to having post-legislative scrutiny; and we are publishing for the first time the draft legislative programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="70725-0018.htm_para10"><a name="07072576000068">The work of the Leader of the House is important, and I stand by my commitment to do it in the interests of the House. However, it is also important to keep a sense of proportion. This motion is in order. It moves the Member concerned from the Constitutional Affairs Committee to the Home Affairs Committee. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Let me say that in another way; it takes a Member who has already been voted by the House on to the Constitutional Affairs Committee and places him on the Home Affairs Committee. The motion is in order, and I suggest that the House votes on it.</p>

 This motion is to keep up to date the system of Select Committee scrutiny of the Executive. Today&#146;s business has, of course, been presented in the right order, but it would probably have been better to deal with the overall picture by debating this motion before discussing the specific case of the Home Affairs Committee. However, I shall move swiftly on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="70725-0019.htm_para0"><a name="07072576000471">Before I go on to explain some of the motions in detail, I would like to set them in the context of the programme of reform announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister in his statement of 3 July, and in the Green Paper &#147;Governance of Britain&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="70725-0019.htm_para1"><a name="07072576000472">The Green Paper sets out proposals to give stronger accountability of the Government to Parliament, to assure greater engagement between Parliament and the people and between the Government and the people, and to build strong Cabinet Government. These motions reflect one of those central themes&#151;promoting the holding of Government to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="70725-0019.htm_para2"><a name="07072576000473">Select Committees are one of the House&#146;s key tools for holding Government and Ministers to account. Since 1979, the basis of the Select Committee structure has been that there should be a Committee to monitor the work of each principal Department. That was introduced by the then Conservative Government, and supported on all sides. The structure is enshrined in Standing Order No. 152, which is updated from time to time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="70725-0019.htm_para3"><a name="07072576000474">In recent months, with the establishment of the Ministry of Justice out of the former Department for Constitutional Affairs, and the more recent establishment of three new Departments, we have seen significant developments that require a number of changes to that Standing Order. Accordingly, the motion provides for new Select Committees to cover the following Departments: Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, Children, Schools and Families, Justice, and Innovation, Universities and Skills. Membership numbers for each Committee are as set out in the motion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="70725-0019.htm_para4"><a name="07072576000475">Procedural provisions are included in the motion to allow continuity between the work of old Select Committees and the new ones, so far as is possible. The new Justice Committee continues the work of the Constitutional Affairs Committee, albeit enlarged in size and with a wider remit. The other Committees are, procedurally, new Committees.</p>

Overall responsibility in Government for science and innovation issues was located in the Department of Trade and Industry until the recent machinery of government changes; it now forms a core part of the new Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. There has been great concern in the science community&#151;I have myself received a number of representations from science organisations&#151;about ensuring the continuance of the work of the Science and Technology Committee, so that science issues, particularly ones that cut across Departments, will continue to be properly scrutinised. I have received representations from the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis), Chair of the Science and Technology Committee; Professor Broers, Chair of the Lords Science and Technology Committee; the Campaign for Science and Engineering in the UK; the Chemical Industries Association;  <br>

Professor Derek Burke, who was special adviser to the Science and Technology Committee between 1995 and 2001; the Genetic Interest Group; the Royal Society; the Institute of Biology; the Association of Medical Research Charities and many more.

 I very much welcome the tone of the right hon. and learned Lady&#146;s remarks. Will the Sub-Committee have the same support, in terms of staffing and other resources, as the current Science and Technology Committee? If not, it will be unable to carry out a full cross-cutting Government role.</p>

Of course, the Committee of Selection may nominate many of the same Members to the new Committees, in which case my thanks, though very sincere, may be somewhat premature.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor. The inclusion of that work in our manifesto was a public indication of the importance that we attributed to it. I am pleased to see the way in which the House has changed for the better. The current departmental Select Committee system was introduced in 1979, but the pace of change has increased since then, particularly through the impetus of the Modernisation Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="70725-0019.htm_para11"><a name="07072576000486">The legislative changes that have taken place include the ability to carry over public Bills, more pre-legislative scrutiny, better information provided to Members and the public and the introduction of evidence-taking Public Bill Committees. For the first time this year, the Government&#146;s draft legislative programme has been published for consultation several months before the Queen&#146;s Speech. Additional opportunities have been provided for Back-Bench scrutiny via the establishment of Westminster Hall. Written ministerial statements have replaced planted questions; notice time for oral questions has been reduced; and the Prime Minister now appears before the Liaison Committee twice a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="70725-0019.htm_para12"><a name="07072576000487">A raft of measures has been aimed at improving the way in which the House engages with the public as well&#151;with changes to the language, improvements to the website, and increased facilities and resources available to the education unit.</p>

The Procedure Committee has done, and continues to do, valuable work, but there is still a role for a separate Modernisation Committee, which has wider terms of reference and can look beyond the practice and procedure of the House in the conduct of public business to consider issues such as engagement with the public and the working lives of Members. It is clear that, as in the past, the two Committees will need to be chaired in a way that ensures that both have the right and complementary work loads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70725-0019.htm_para14"><a name="07072576000489">I know, too, that some Members continue to believe that a Committee of the House should not be chaired by a Cabinet Minister. Ultimately, that is a matter for the House and for the Committee itself, but the Committee has been chaired by the Leader of the House since its inception in 1997. The Leader of the House has a unique position both as the Government&#146;s representative in the House and as the House&#146;s representative in the Government. The past Chairmen of the Modernisation Committee have chaired the Committee on a consensual, cross-party basis to deliver reforms to the benefit of the whole House. I made my position clear during my first business  <br>

 Select Committees do an extremely important job in holding the Government to account. Indeed, we should be grateful to all those who serve on Select Committees for the important work that they do. Their work brings focus to particular themes and aspects of legislation; their membership brings expertise; and in large part, their independent spirit brings an objectivity to parliamentary scrutiny, which is, of course, why we have just had such a heated debate on the previous motion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="70725-0019.htm_para16"><a name="07072576000492">Debating the Standing Orders that relate to changes in the machinery of government would normally be nothing more than a formality or perhaps undertaken in a slightly different atmosphere; but on this occasion, the Standing Orders have some political significance, because they reflect the Government&#146;s continuous changes to the make-up of Whitehall. That betrays an obsession with spin and structures, a lack of delivery and a disregard for taxpayers&#146; money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="70725-0019.htm_para17"><a name="07072576000493">Before the Prime Minister&#146;s latest reshuffle of the Whitehall pack, the Government had already wasted &#163;2 million of taxpayers&#146; money on changing the names of Departments. For example, the Department for Transport became the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions, then the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, and then the Department for Transport again. But did it deliver? A train is cancelled every five minutes; bus use is down; and the Government abandoned their pledge to reduce traffic congestion. Carbon emissions are rising, and council tax has doubled. I am sure the public were delighted that the Government&#146;s response to those failures was to change the Department&#146;s name three times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="70725-0019.htm_para18"><a name="07072576000494">One might have thought that this Prime Minister would have learned from the mistakes of the previous one, but I am afraid that he has not. He has created the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. According to written answers that I have received&#151;buried on busy news days&#151;the new Departments for Children, Schools and Families and for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform have already spent thousands of pounds on new signs and rebranding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="70725-0019.htm_para19"><a name="07072576000495">Whatever the worth of continuing to tinker with the machinery of Whitehall, it makes sense that the parliamentary Committees that scrutinise the new Departments should shadow them accurately. I therefore support the changes to the Committees&#151;with one exception. I have a strong reservation about the decision to scrap the Science and Technology  <br>

Committee. I heard what the Leader of the House said about the expansion of the number of Members on the Innovation, Universities and Skills Committee in order to enable it to have a Sub-Committee to cover that area. However, I question whether that is going to be able to provide the same degree of focus on science issues as the current Science and Technology Committee&#151;particularly in the light of the implications of the latest report of the Modernisation Committee, which will mean that questions to Chairmen of Select Committees will be allowed in the House and there will be more debates on Select Committee reports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="70725-0019.htm_para20"><a name="07072576000496">As I understand it, under the structure that the right hon. and learned Lady is setting up, questions would not be able to go to the Chairman of the Sub-Committee, whereas if we retained the Science and Technology Committee, the Chairman of that Committee, and those issues, would be able to have that focus, through questions. The Sub-Committee is no replacement for a stand-alone specialist Science and Technology Committee. Perhaps that is why, in her explanatory memorandum, the right hon. and learned Lady committed a Freudian slip and referred to the new Department as the Department for Innovation, Universities and Science&#151;rather than Skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="70725-0019.htm_para21"><a name="07072576000497">Talking of the new education Departments and Committees, I note something that will be of interest to the hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman). It seems that the term limits for Committee Chairmen will be unaffected by the changes. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman hoped that he might have the opportunity to continue to serve as Chairman of the Select Committee, so I commiserate with him. It is a poor reward for his dedicated service to successive Labour Secretaries of State for Education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="70725-0019.htm_para22"><a name="07072576000498">Perhaps the Government are putting this measure through because they have even more people to put on the Select Committees who they believe are going to take the Government line.

 I believe that the hon. Member for Huddersfield has already served coming up to the length of time that one is entitled to serve as a Chairman of a Select Committee.

There are two aspects to the matter. The first is that Parliamentary Private Secretaries are not likely to be assiduous challengers and scrutineers of the Government. The second is that if they are members of Select Committees, the number of spaces available to Labour Back Benchers is reduced, and I am surprised that the Leader of the House&#151;the defender of Members&#146; rights&#151;is accepting the proposal, although she indicated that she would in business questions last week.</p>

 I support the idea of championing the rights of Back Benchers on Select Committees, but does the right hon. Lady agree that her ideas should extend to Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen? In the previous Parliament, the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) was both a Front-Bench Defence spokesman and a member of the Defence Committee, and he had to be dragged off the Committee kicking and screaming.</p>

 The point is for members of Select Committees to challenge the Government. The Select Committees challenge not Opposition policy, but the Government. The point about Parliamentary Private Secretaries is that they are effectively members of the Government, so their ability&#151;and, I suggest, willingness&#151;to challenge the Government may be somewhat different from that of other Members.</p>

The Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, the right hon.

It is a difficult one, and, as I say, I do not share the concerns about whether a Government member should chair the Committee.

Instead of tinkering with those Committee&#151;the motion merely changes their names&#151;why does not the right hon. and learned Lady reform them properly? If she and the Prime Minister are serious about putting Parliament first, they need to improve our system for scrutinising European legislation. That means a proper scrutiny reserve, an end to the failed European Standing Committee system, and measures to hold Ministers to account on the Floor of the House. As it happens, I made a speech setting out a number of proposals in this area last week, and I would be very happy to send it to the right hon. and learned Lady if she wished to know what those were.</p>

I have just referred to the latest report of the Modernisation Committee, which dealt with enhancing the role of the Back Bencher. It contained important proposals to make Select Committees more accountable to other hon. Members. Those included questions to Select Committee Chairman and debates on Committee reports. Despite the report being approved, published and promoted by the last Leader of the House, it has still not been put into effect. When she responds to the debate, perhaps the right hon. and learned Lady will say when those proposals are likely to be brought before the House so that they can be put into practice.</p>

I support the concept. It was recommended by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) in his democracy taskforce report, which was recently published. If the Prime Minister is so keen to strengthen Parliament and so keen to give new powers to Select Committees, why has not that innovation been included in today&#146;s motion on the machinery of government?</p>

I have some questions about the role of regional Select Committees. The regional Ministers are in place, but the corresponding regional Select Committees have not been established. There are considerable problems with the concept of regional Ministers. They do nothing to address the fundamental problem of the Prime Minister&#146;s constitutional reforms, notably the West Lothian question. They will create split accountability between the regional Ministers and the departmental Ministers. They risk more frequent conflicts of interest between Members&#146; ministerial, regional and constituency concerns, and they are based on regions that exist only in bureaucrats&#146; minds.</p>

The regional Ministers do not seem to have any executive powers, in which case what is their purpose? I come back to the point that I made a little earlier.

The first inkling of the opposition in the science community to the Government&#146;s proposals was when I attended the parliamentary affairs committee of the Royal Society of Chemistry a few days after the announcements. It is not only chemists who sit round that table but members of most of the other professional organisations. Initially they were not only surprised but somewhat outraged by the proposal to disband the Science and Technology Committee. As the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) said, that Committee was created by the previous Administration to create in the House a greater focus on science and technology. The scientific community out there have recognised that focus and have been very supportive of the work of the members of the Committee throughout its lifetime.

The main departmental Committee will consider the research councils&#151;that will be one of its important remits&#151;and science, engineering and technology in the universities, but it will also have to focus on other university-related issues in the arts and humanities, as well as medical schools and so on.

My right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House has already said that things might not turn out to be as bad as some of us suspect. I remind her, however, of the volume of work that we do at the moment, with seven to nine reports a year. Even taking out the work that the main Committee will do, I doubt whether the Sub-Committee could get through annually two or three major reports such as the space policy report that we have just published, or the marine science report that is due out. It takes at least nine months to collect the evidence, written and oral, and we travel extensively collecting evidence from abroad. We in this country must constantly measure ourselves against the best, which is usually America but also Japan, Germany and France. We have to travel to see what people are doing there. Would adequate resources be available to provide sufficient Clerks and secretarial support for the Committee, and to allow its members to travel?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="70725-0020.htm_para11"><a name="07072595000008">I recognise that the Government intend to put 14 Members on the main Committee, whereas there are only 11 members of the Science and Technology Committee. Even so, I would guesstimate that there would be only five or six members on the Sub-Committee. Has my right hon. and learned Friend had any thoughts about that? I realise that the decision might be made by the main Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="70725-0020.htm_para12"><a name="07072595000009">My main point is this. I find serving on a Select Committee, if one is assiduous in turning up to most of the meetings, reading the reports and going on the visits, quite hard work, and I think that most Members would agree, whatever Committee they sit on. A scientist lucky enough to serve on the main Committee covering the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills who is also sitting on the Sub-Committee will find that they have a considerable extra volume of work, and members of the Sub-Committee will probably also want to listen to debates in the main Committee. At the same time, the Government are creating regional Committees. We are asking an awful lot of Members by creating this extra work alongside the other work that they are involved in, which I find increases all the time.</p>

It has published cross-cutting reports on many Departments, and considered agencies outside those Departments. We have turned over stones that I do not think people wanted us to turn over; we have looked into nooks and crannies. I ask my right hon. and learned Friend whether the smaller number of members on the Sub-Committee would be given a strong remit to turn over stones that need turning over and to look into nooks and crannies, bearing in mind the fact that those may be areas of other Departments&#146; work. Unless the role of the Sub-Committee, if it is created, is established very firmly and it is given those powers, its work will not be as effective as that of a main Committee. With those thoughts, I look forward to my right hon. and learned Friend&#146;s response.</p>

 This debate starts from a premise on which we all agree: it is really important that the legislature have effective scrutiny of the Executive. That is what underlies the debate. The Government have said that they are committed to that, and I have no reason&#151;apart from a blip a few minutes ago&#151;to think that that is not true.

As someone who has not sought to pursue a career in that part of Parliament&#146;s work, I say thank you to those colleagues who have, and to those whose service on particular Select Committees will come to an end as a result of the motion, if it is passed later on. The Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs is chaired very ably by my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), who was its first Chairman. It was set up relatively recently, when the Department for Constitutional Affairs was created, and it has been able to do its job effectively and well. The Select Committee on Education and Skills regularly has to do serious work on behalf of the House. The Select Committee on Trade and Industry self-evidently covers a huge gamut of work, and the Select Committee on Science and Technology, to which I shall come back later, is chaired equally forcefully and effectively by my hon.

 I can give my hon. Friend an even stronger example to bear out his argument. It is the creation of the Ministry of Justice, about which the Lord Chief Justice read in a Sunday newspaper.

The failure to sort that out carefully in advance has led to a continuing and unresolved constitutional argument between the judiciary and the Government.</p>

 Not only is my right hon. Friend correct, as I would expect him to be, but he was the first to know the facts. When the Lord Chief Justice gave evidence before his Committee, he said that he had read about the changes in a Sunday paper. Clearly, that is a disgraceful and appalling way in which to do business. We ended up with a badly constructed new development in Government. Again, Liberal Democrats supported the idea of a Ministry of Justice, so we do not object on principle. We argue that one should decide what exactly is to be included in the remit of such a Department before finalising the change. A debate should be held about it so that we get it right.</p>

It meant that that Department did all the things that we associate with justice and also dealt with the legacy of constitutional affairs, which are logically not necessarily justice matters. We have now ended up with slight confusion, as well as the great confusion to which my right hon. Friend referred.</p>

We are in favour of such Select Committees. However, I hope that the absence of a proposal on the Order Paper means that the Government are thinking more carefully about exactly what they will introduce. I hope that they have learned the benefit of delaying a bit and getting matters right. Clearly, such Committees should not include Parliamentary Private Secretaries, but should reflect the political balance of the relevant region. One cannot expect a proper discussion of regional issues if the Committees are all biased and take no account of the balance of the political views in those regions.

 I do not want to repeat many of the comments that were made earlier, so I shall try to be as brief as possible. I start on a positive note. One of the science community&#146;s major concerns has arisen because the Government have been so supportive of science. It is important to put it on the record that the resources going into science, particularly since 1999, have been a huge success story, and include &#163;3.4 billion to research councils. That has fuelled high expectations of the Government&#146;s involvement in science. It is important to start with that positive comment, rather than with some of the negative ones.</p>

Friend the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) echoed those reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="70725-0021.htm_para1"><a name="07072595000026">I support the establishment of the new Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. Bringing together the university sector, which delivers so much of our research, and the research councils, which pay for much of it, is long overdue and will mean that we are able to plan much more effectively. The whole House agrees with the need for a departmental Committee to scrutinise the new Department, as the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) made clear. That must be right. Also, certain aspects of the Science and Technology Committee&#146;s current role, particularly its scrutiny of the office of science and innovation and the office of the Government&#146;s chief scientific adviser, have moved to the Department, so I accept, too, that it is quite logical for those aspects to be scrutinised by the new Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="70725-0021.htm_para2"><a name="07072595000027">However, the main concern for the science community, for business and for members of the Committee&#151;I pay tribute to all its members, who serve it extraordinarily well and put in an enormous amount of time&#151;is about cross-governmental scrutiny of science. I know that other Committees scrutinise across Government&#151;the Public Accounts Committee is obviously the most notable one&#151;but the Science and Technology Committee looks not only at the nooks and crannies, as the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East said, but at science right across Government. Some of the examples of the former Committee&#146;s cross-cutting inquiries include its work on human technologies and the law, which has resulted in a draft Bill being considered by both Houses and a new Bill on embryos and tissues, which will be introduced in the Queen&#146;s Speech in October. All that began with the Committee&#146;s work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="70725-0021.htm_para3"><a name="07072595000028">The Committee carried out work on forensic science, and the Leader of the House appeared before the Committee during the follow-up to that inquiry. That work showed that forensic science was covered by various Government Departments, but particularly by various parts of the then Home Office. It also carried out work on identity card technology, on the classification of illegal drugs, on the regulation of hybrids and chimeras, on carbon capture and storage, on space policy and on ocean science. Those are all cross-cutting subjects that involve different Departments in making their contribution to the science agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="70725-0021.htm_para4"><a name="07072595000029">A big mistake&#151;if I may be so bold&#151;that the Leader of the House and her colleagues made when considering replacing the Science and Technology Select Committee was to believe that it mainly scrutinised the Office of Science and Innovation. In fact, most of the Ministers who appeared before it were from other Departments; they had nothing to do with science and innovation per se. This is the exciting thing about a cross-government scrutiny Committee. For example, when we were considering space policy, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was the lead Department for some of the new space technologies. Similarly, when we were looking at forensic science, we dealt with the Home Office. So such a Committee would not be a case of double jeopardy for Ministers in the new Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. In fact, the work would be spread quite widely across the arena.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="70725-0021.htm_para5"><a name="07072595000030">To be frank, the amount of support for the Committee from outside the House took me by surprise. The Leader of the House made clear reference to some of the letters that she had received. However, on 13 July, a letter was published in <i> The Times</i> which had been signed by the Royal Society of Chemistry, the  <br>

 I am grateful for the hon. Lady&#146;s intervention. As I understand it, it will be for the new Innovation, Universities and Skills Committee&#151;not the Government&#151;to establish the Sub-Committee, and it will then be that Committee&#146;s job to establish its terms of reference and agree them with the House. It is important, in my view, that it should be called the Science and Technology Sub-Committee, and it is also important that it have free rein to go wherever it likes across Government wherever science is involved.

 Motion 6, in part at least, will put in place the departmental Select Committees to mirror the new Departments. That is an eminently sensible and quite necessary process, which ought to be without issue. However, two changes cause my hon. Friends and I some concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="70725-0021.htm_para15"><a name="07072595000043">The first issue concerns the size of the Select Committee on Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, which effectively replaces the Select Committee on Trade and Industry. Innovation has been removed, but it has been replaced with regulatory reform. My hon. Friend the Member for Angus (Mr. Weir) who sat on the old DTI Committee has looked into the matter and estimated the volume of work. He sees the work load as broadly similar, so it seems odd to us that the size of the Committee should be reduced from 14 members to 11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="70725-0021.htm_para16"><a name="07072595000044">Secondly, on a related point, all Select Committees must, so far as possible, reflect opinion throughout the House; they must secure a correct level of departmental scrutiny, with questions from all parties reflecting all opinions within the Chamber. It is likely, however, that if the reduction of the new Committee from 14 members to 11 is allowed to proceed, the Scottish National party would lose its only place on a departmental Select Committee. It would leave the joint SNP-Plaid Cymru group with only one departmental Select Committee place&#151;on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee. <i> [Interruption.]</i> Notwithstanding some of the more partisan comments, surely as Leader of the House the right hon. and learned Lady must understand that, if we are to have proper scrutiny, particularly of the important role of business, enterprise and regulatory reform in a growing economy, questioning must come from people of all parties expressing all opinions.</p>

We also recognise that she is not the person to appoint or make recommendations for appointments to any Committee&#151;nor should she be&#151;but we hope that in her summing up she will reflect on the needs of Select Committees accurately and properly to reflect the full range of opinions in this House.

The Government will always win, because they are a Government by virtue of having a majority; the majoritarian principle prevails, so they will get their way. That is why the Leader of the House is the most important intermediary in terms of the fairness of the balance of debate.</p>

Through it, he proposes that these two Committees&#151;the ancient and important Select Committee on Procedure, and the Modernisation Committee&#151;should be merged and under the chairmanship of an Opposition Member. He does so because there must be a certain detachment in the assessment of what is appropriate for the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="70725-0021.htm_para30"><a name="07072595000059">I know that my objections and arguments will be brushed aside. [Hon. Members: &#147;Ah.&#148;] There you have it, but this House is nothing unless it can control more of its business. The Prime Minister asserts, and I actually believe him, that that is what he wants&#151;that we play a more meaningful role in the dispensation of power within the matters that fall to us. I therefore urge Members, for what it is worth, to think seriously on this, for there is one compelling reason why the present nomination is wrong. Among all the credits to her name, the Leader of the House is also chairman of the Labour party. I cannot think of a more partisan role, of necessity, and of a more blatant example of how the Government control this Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="70725-0022.htm_para1"><a name="07072595000062">The omen for the House of what happened in the earlier debate, on which there was a vote, is not good. Unfortunately, and despite not only my pleadings but those of a Member of the House who is highly respected in all parts of it&#151;my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)&#151;the Leader of the House, who could have withdrawn that motion, chose not to do so. I regret that. As a result, the omens for fairness and even-handedness do not herald well for Members in all parts of the House, particularly Opposition Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="70725-0022.htm_para2"><a name="07072595000063">I also support the view expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills that at some future stage, the Modernisation Committee should be merged with the Procedure Committee. We are talking now about the appointment of two people, one of whom will, in due course, be elected as Chairman of the Modernisation Committee. It is a very powerful Committee and it seems utterly wrong that it should be dominated by one party. That is why I question the appointment of a PPS as well as the Leader of the House. Unfortunately, a PPS cannot be objective. He or she cannot adopt an independent view separate from that of his or her Minister. Therefore, the two are tied together inextricably. Clearly the Committee will suffer as a result. Members are appointed to a Select Committee not just for their party view, but to take an objective view. The discussion of modernisation should have nothing directly to do with party politics: it should have everything to do with the convenience of this House and its ability to do its job of holding the Government to account and scrutinising legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="70725-0022.htm_para3"><a name="07072595000064">I have had the pleasure of serving on the Modernisation Committee since it was set up by the new Labour Government in the autumn of 1997 and I have served under several Leaders of the House. One of the most inspirational and exciting to work with was the late Robin Cook. He was committed to the House and to returning independence and integrity to it. He suffered a major setback when the Committee&#146;s proposals on the appointment procedure for Select Committees&#151;unanimously agreed by that Committee under his chairmanship&#151;were defeated by the Government. Although it was supposedly a free vote, there were Government Whips outside the Lobbies saying, &#147;Vote this way, this is the Labour Lobby.&#148; I hugely admired Robin Cook for his principles and almost unlimited ability, but he was disappointed and depressed that a proposal that would have improved the independence and integrity of the House, by getting those people on to Select Committees who had an interest in that Committee, the ability to do the job, and the knowledge and experience to serve it&#151;and by extension the House&#151;well, had been defeated.</p>

 I shall give way to the hon. Lady, whom I also admire for her courage and, occasionally, her aggression. There will come a time, perhaps in the not too distant future, when she and her colleagues will be on the Opposition side of the House. Then they will have a slightly different perspective on what the Modernisation Committee is doing and the ability of Opposition Members and parties to hold the Government to account.</p>

<p><a name="st_o388"><a name="07072595000068"><a name="70725-0022.htm_spnew3"><a name="07072595000634"><b>Ms Abbott:</b>
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I personally think that my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) will make an excellent Chair of the Home Affairs Committee. I also personally believe that my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House and my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) will be adornments of the Modernisation Committee. However, as someone who has served in the House both in opposition and in government, it concerns me that we are losing sight of the fact that the Committees are Committees of the House. I am concerned by the increasingly naked direction by Whips of who should chair them. The point is that the Committees are supposed to choose their own Chairs. The people whom we have put forward are wonderful and brilliant, but some of us remember when the assumption was that Select Committees represented the whole House and were able to appoint their own chairs.</p>

<p><a name="st_o389"><a name="07072595000069"><a name="70725-0022.htm_spnew4"><a name="07072595000635"><b>Sir Nicholas Winterton:</b>
 Of course, Select Committees are able to appoint their own Chairmen. I speak from experience: when the remits for social services and health were divided up between two Select Committees, my previous work on health meant that I was not put up by my party for the post of Chairman of the Health Committee. However, with the support of the Labour and Ulster Unionist parties, and with my own vote, I did manage to achieve that post.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="70725-0022.htm_para5"><a name="07072595000070">Like other parties, however, mine is inclined to get its way in the long term. After the 1992 election, I applied to be reappointed to the Health Committee, and I am confident that I would have been elected its Chairman, but my party did not nominate me. It invented a new rule that was no rule at all. It was a rule for the Conservative party, but not for the Labour party. That has nothing to do with this House, but the people responsible were made to look very foolish. For my part, as one door closed, another opened, but we need a Select Committee system that genuinely represents the interests of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="70725-0022.htm_para6"><a name="07072595000071">As my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills said, the previous Chairman of the Modernisation Committee, who remains a nominal member, often said that he could not take a proposal to the Government because the Whips would not accept it. That is an example of a Select Committee Chairman who is a Cabinet Minister and who openly admits that certain proposals that the Committee would like to make to the House cannot be got through the Government Whips and the Cabinet. That means that the Committee in question could not be truly independent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="70725-0022.htm_para7"><a name="07072595000072">I hope that similar problems will not arise when the present Leader of the House is Chairman of the Modernisation Committee, as she has a duty to both House and Committee as a whole. The fact that the Whips might not like a proposal is no reason why it should not form part of a report that can be debated by the House and responded to by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="st_o403"><a name="07072595000386"><a name="70725-0023.htm_spmin0"><a name="07072595000926"><b>The Leader of the House of Commons (Ms Harriet Harman):</b>
 We now debate the Government&#146;s draft legislative programme&#151;the list of Bills that we are considering for the next Session. The Prime Minister has said that he wants to see, as part of his constitutional reform agenda, stronger accountability of the Government to Parliament and greater engagement between Parliament and the people. The change in the way that we plan to announce our legislative programme marks a step forward in those respects. Here in Parliament we spend most of our time legislating, so it is right that Parliament should have early sight of the Government&#146;s thinking on what we will be asking it to consider. That will allow hon. Members to look at the overall shape of our programme before it is set in stone and will help members of the public and interested parties to give their views to hon. Members. This debate is to enable hon. Members to give their preliminary views on the draft legislative programme, which has been sent to all hon. Members and is on the Government&#146;s websites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="70725-0023.htm_para2"><a name="07072595000387">Officially, the contents of our legislative programme have always remained secret until the Queen&#146;s Speech at the state opening of Parliament. However, because of the necessary discussion that has to go on between Government Departments and stakeholders, information does of course get into the public domain, but it does so in the worst way&#151;unofficially and piecemeal. Lobbying firms and political consultancies get paid millions of pounds to guess for their clients what is likely to be in the Queen&#146;s Speech. However, while bits and pieces are glimpsed unofficially, the work of the Government in putting together their legislative programme has hitherto gone on behind closed doors, with no one outside Government able to see the overview of the legislative programme as a whole until the whole thing is ready to steam ahead into Parliament. Those outside, because they have not been allowed to know before the Queen&#146;s Speech what the Government are doing, cannot have sensible discussions with the Government. This time last year, I knew that the draft coroners Bill was not in the legislative programme. Those concerned&#151;coroners, organisations of bereaved relatives, and lawyers who specialise in inquest work&#151;were lobbying for changes to the Bill. They would have been better off lobbying for the Bill to be in the legislative programme, but I could not tell them that what mattered at that stage was not some amendments but the fact that it was not even in the programme. It makes sense for people to be able to see the work that is under way in Government before it is set in tablets of stone. This does not in any way change the state opening, the Queen&#146;s Speech and the role of Her Majesty the Queen in setting out the Government&#146;s concluded plans for the Session.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="70725-0023.htm_para3"><a name="07072595000388">The publication of our draft programme builds on a number of steps that we have taken to improve the ability of this House to scrutinise legislation. We already publish some Bills in draft. To date, we have published 58 Bills in draft since 1997. During this Session we published four bills in draft: the regulatory  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="25 July 2007">

<notus-date day="25" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>25 July 2007 : Column 969</b><br>
enforcement and sanctions Bill, the human tissue and embryos Bill, the climate change Bill and the local transport Bill. I recognise that we would all like to see more Bills published in draft. During the next Session, we intend to publish in draft an equalities Bill, a marine Bill, a heritage protection Bill and a cultural property and armed conflicts Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="70725-0023.htm_para4"><a name="07072595000389">I can announce today that following the publication of the draft coroner&#146;s Bill and its plain English translation, I have asked parliamentary counsel to produce alongside the draft marine Bill a plain language version in time for its introduction. It is my intention that in publishing our draft programme, we should work towards publishing at least one plain language version per Session.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="70725-0023.htm_para5"><a name="07072595000390">There has also been the Public Bill Committee procedure which, during the current Session, has meant that Government Bills starting in the Commons after Christmas have been subject to additional scrutiny. The UK Borders Bill and the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill have been considered in this way. From the start of the next Session, all Government Bills starting in the Commons will be subject to this procedure, which, by the taking of oral and written evidence from Ministers and other interested parties, as with the Select Committee process, means that there is more extensive scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="st_o404"><a name="07072595000391"><a name="70725-0023.htm_spnew0"><a name="07072595000927"><b>David Wright (Telford) (Lab):</b>
 I very much welcome the Government&#146;s move to increase scrutiny prior to the publication of Bills and draft Bills. Would my right hon. and learned Friend consider opportunities to lay out at an early point the amount of time each Bill will take during a Session, and how much time will be made available on the Floor of the House? In particular, could we consider opportunities to have two-day debates for the Second Reading of Bills, particularly for important ones?</p>

<p><a name="st_o405"><a name="07072595000392"><a name="70725-0023.htm_spnew1"><a name="07072595000928"><b>Ms Harman:</b>
 The Modernisation Committee has considered the amount of time available for Back Benchers when important Bills are introduced, and one of the proposals under consideration is the limitation of Front Bench speeches, so I shall move on quickly with the rest of my comments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="70725-0023.htm_para6"><a name="07072595000393">The draft legislative programme before the House is not, of course, the final programme. There will be further careful consideration of the Bills that should form part of our legislative programme both by the Cabinet Committee and by Cabinet. It is always possible that new priorities will emerge, and it is always possible that some Bills will not get to the finishing line because there are problems with the policy or the cost. Constraints of parliamentary time mean that the Government are limited to about 28 Bills per Session, so some will have to wait for the next one. If a Bill is not in the draft programme, that does not mean it is a dead duck. It may still come forward either as a gap emerges in the current programme, or in the next programme.</p>

<p><a name="st_o406"><a name="07072595000394"><a name="70725-0023.htm_spnew2"><a name="07072595000929"><b>Mrs. Theresa May (Maidenhead) (Con):</b>
 I have listened carefully to the right hon. and learned Lady&#146;s answer to the hon. Member for Telford (David Wright), and to what she has said since, and I hoped that she would be able to give a commitment to the principle  <br>

that two days would be given to Second Reading of some important Bills, and that a greater amount of time should be given to Report and Third Reading on some occasions&#151;a point raised by the Modernisation Committee. Report stage should be given this time in particular because it is an opportunity for Back Benchers who do not serve on a Bill&#146;s Committee to raise issues in the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o407"><a name="07072595000395"><a name="70725-0023.htm_spnew3"><a name="07072595000930"><b>Ms Harman:</b>
 As the right hon. Lady knows, it is important for us to see whether we can give enough time on the Floor of the House to Bills that a number of hon. Members want to speak about. From time to time, that has been done, but I understand that there are proposals that the process should be more systematic and routine. Obviously, those will have to be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="70725-0023.htm_para7"><a name="07072595000396">I said that if a Bill is not in the draft programme, that does not mean that it will not come forward in the future, and nor does the draft legislative programme substitute for, or cut across, more detailed consultations on Bills that will be led by the Departments concerned. I am a firm believer that the more open the debate, the better the final outcome, and it is in that spirit that we have published the draft legislative programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="70725-0023.htm_para8"><a name="07072595000397">I am grateful to the Liaison Committee for agreeing to give detailed scrutiny of this legislative programme. I and the Secretary of State for Justice are to give evidence to them in October. There will be public consultation meetings in each region, facilitated by the Government offices in the region, and the Cabinet Office will co-ordinate that consultation process.</p>

<p><a name="st_o408"><a name="07072595000398"><a name="70725-0023.htm_spnew4"><a name="07072595000931"><b>Simon Hughes (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD):</b>
 If consultation is to be meaningful and not thought to be a gimmick&#151;and I welcome the idea of it&#151;will the Leader of the House undertake to ensure that a summary of consultation results will be available to colleagues, and that the consultation will end in sufficient time for it to be able to influence the outcome? People would know that the consultation will end by the first week in October or something, we would see the results, and there would be a real dialogue with the Government in the month running up to the Queen&#146;s Speech.</p>

<p><a name="st_o409"><a name="07072595000399"><a name="70725-0023.htm_spnew5"><a name="07072595000932"><b>Ms Harman:</b>
 Of course we will publish the results of the consultation. Next year, one of the things we should do is start this process earlier, but it started under the new Prime Minister, so there is not as much time for people to consider the draft legislative programme as there will be next year. This is a truncated version of the process; I hope that hon. Members will bear with us and recognise that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o410"><a name="07072595000400"><a name="70725-0023.htm_spnew6"><a name="07072595000933"><b>Mark Lazarowicz (Edinburgh, North and Leith) (Lab/Co-op):</b>

 I am sure that that will be the case. Our officials have liaised with officials in the devolved Administrations and I have discussed the process with the First Ministers in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.</p>

 I will write to the right hon. Lady and refer her to the precedents that exist. I expect her, like me, to ensure that we sustain and defend the supremacy of this House.</p>

 I want to ask about the constitutional reform Bill and its relationship with other measures. Many of us welcome its proposed provisions, not only those to rebalance the relationship between Parliament and the Executive, but those on devolution to the regions. However, the devolution mechanisms in the Bill and the people power elements in, for example, the housing and regeneration Bill, should be tied together in the consultations that will take place in the regions. If reform is perceived as a dry constitutional matter, it will not fire people with the enthusiasm that it would engender if the two measures were related in the consultation.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. However, I emphasise that, this time round, it will not be a Rolls Royce process of consultation because we are starting late. We are simply putting a window on the front of Government activities. A great deal of activity goes on in preparing and planning the legislative programme. That is important in the context of what the House ultimately has to consider in the Government&#146;s proposed legislation. For the first time, people will be able to see the process before it is set in tablets of stone.</p>

 I welcome the opportunity for the House to debate the draft legislative programme. I also welcome the fact that the right hon. and learned Lady listened to hon. Members&#146; concerns and staged this debate separately from tomorrow&#146;s summer recess Adjournment debate. As she mentioned, the publication of the draft legislative programme was one of the proposals contained in the Prime Minister&#146;s statement on &#147;The Governance of Britain&#148;, which also leads to the Constitutional Reform Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="70725-0023.htm_para19"><a name="07072595000417">I wish that I could welcome the Prime Minister&#146;s new-found commitment to Parliament, if only it were genuine. Much has been made of his determination to make statements to the House before briefing them to the media. When he made his statement on the constitution to the House, everyone was impressed that he had not gone on the &#147;Today&#148; programme to talk about it there first. After the previous Prime Minister, who was so obsessed with spin, here was a new Prime Minister who put Parliament first&#151;at least so said his spin doctors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="70725-0023.htm_para20"><a name="07072595000418">The Prime Minister&#146;s statement included proposals to allow Parliament to vote on whether we go to war, to request the dissolution and recall of Parliament, to ratify international treaties, and to scrutinise public appointments, as well as proposals to remove the prime ministerial power to appoint bishops. That was in the statement made on 3 July, but on 2 July <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> reported:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="70725-0023.htm_para21"><a name="07072595000419">I imagine <i> The Daily Telegraph</i><i> </i>just made five lucky guesses. The same must be true of <i> The Independent</i>&#146;s coverage of the right to trigger legislation by petition on 28 February, <i> The Guardian</i>&#146;s prediction of citizens&#146; juries on 27 February and the predictions by <i> The Times </i>of a new ministerial code on 16 May and of a new Bill of Rights on 1 July. Before I talk about the draft legislative programme, I want to make one thing clear. All the bluster about announcing things to Parliament first was just that: bluster. There is already a whole list of examples of how the Prime Minister has treated Parliament and hon. Members with disdain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="70725-0023.htm_para22"><a name="07072595000420">The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, promised in the previous Queen&#146;s Speech, will have its Second Reading in October, just a couple of weeks before the end of the Session. It is going to be a carry-over Bill, but the carry-over procedure was introduced for Bills that had nearly completed their parliamentary stages, not Bills at the very beginning. The Prime Minister has twice reversed policy&#151;first on casinos, secondly on cannabis&#151;in response to planted questions during Prime Minister&#146;s questions rather than in an oral statement, which would have given hon. Members the chance to ask questions of the Minister concerned. The Prime Minister has since insinuated to a press conference&#151;not to Parliament&#151;that he might reverse the liberalisation of licensing laws. Those proposals are not in the draft legislative programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="70725-0023.htm_para23"><a name="07072595000421">As we discussed in a previous debate this evening, the Prime Minister has also confirmed that Parliamentary Private Secretaries will sit on Select Committees. They might not be formal members of the Government, but they work for Ministers. That is a conflict of interest, but the Prime Minister has ignored it. As I mentioned in my intervention on the right hon. and learned Lady, the Prime Minister also opted to use parliamentary privilege to override the other place, after it voted for a lifeboat fund to compensate properly the 125,000 people who have lost their pension savings. If the Prime Minister trusts Parliament, why has he completely ignored the wishes of the other place?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="70725-0023.htm_para24"><a name="07072595000422">The Prime Minister is also ready to sign the latest EU treaty, as he made clear in Prime Minister&#146;s questions today, which would subjugate the Westminster Parliament to the institutions of the European Union. The conclusions of the previous European Council state:</p>
<a name="70725-0023.htm_brev5"><a name="07072595000595"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;National parliaments shall contribute actively to the good functioning of the Union&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="70725-0023.htm_para25"><a name="07072595000423">The Prime Minister, who supposedly believes in the sovereignty of Parliament, is therefore happy to sign a treaty that places upon Parliament an obligation to do whatever the European Court of Justice decides is for the &#147;good functioning&#148; of the European Union. No, the Prime Minister does not believe in putting Parliament first.</p>

Prime Minister&#146;s career. That was down to his failure to deliver. So why should people believe that he is going to deliver now, after all this time?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para1"><a name="07072595000425">Furthermore, why should we believe that the Government will deliver what is in this legislative programme when they have failed to deliver several Bills in their previous legislative programme?

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para2"><a name="07072595000426">Three of those Bills are actually in this draft legislative programme, but that should not be a surprise, because every single one of the 23 Bills proposed in the Prime Minister&#146;s statement has been announced before. For the information of hon. Members, and for the record, here are the relevant dates: the child maintenance and other payments Bill, December 2006; the children in care Bill, June 2007; the climate change Bill, March 2007; the constitutional reform Bill, July 2007; the coroners Bill, June 2006; the counter terrorism Bill, June 2007; the criminal justice Bill, July 2006; the Crossrail Bill, February 2005; the education and skills Bill, March 2007; the employment simplification Bill, March 2007; the energy Bill, May 2007; the European Communities (Finance) Bill, June 2007; the health and social care Bill, February 2007; the housing and regeneration Bill, March 2004; the human tissues and embryos Bill, December 2006; the local transport Bill, May 2007; the national insurance contributions Bill, March 2007; the pensions Bill, May 2006; the planning reform Bill, May 2007; the planning gain supplement Bill, March 2007; the regulatory enforcement and sanctions Bill, May 2007; the sale of student loans Bill, March 2007; and the unclaimed assets Bill, May 2005.

He is not a new start; he is a broken old record. And talking of records, the Prime Minister has missed this opportunity to put right his record. On his watch, 125,000 people have lost their pension savings. Where is the legislation to compensate them properly? On his watch, home ownership started to fall for the first time since records began. So why will people trust him to deliver more housing? On his watch, the number of young people not in education, employment or training has passed 1 million. So why will people trust him to create opportunities for young people? On his watch, the NHS has been plunged into deficit and forced to make swingeing cuts. Where is the action to stop the cuts? Where is the Bill to increase NHS autonomy and accountability? On his watch, violent prisoners have been released because there is not enough space for them in jail. Where is the legislation to ensure that criminals get what they deserve?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para11"><a name="07072595000435">In 2004, the Government committed themselves to introducing a marine Bill. The 2005 Labour manifesto, on which the right hon. and learned Lady was elected, promised to introduce a marine Bill during this Parliament. Where is it? And what about women? Only last week, the right hon. and learned Lady came to the House to make a particularly vacuous statement on her agenda for women, yet there is nothing in this legislative programme specifically for women. Where is the action on equal pay? Where is the action on human trafficking? Where is the help for the families who use a relative or neighbour to care for a child?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para12"><a name="07072595000436">As the legislative programme is rolled out, there will be Bills that we support and, where we do, we will engage constructively with Ministers.

He is not a change. His disdain for Parliament, his lack of new ideas, his spin and stealth are no change. It is just the same old Labour.</p>

<meta name="Date" content="25 July 2007">

<notus-date day="25" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>25 July 2007 : Column 976</b><br>
entire House has the opportunity to participate in it. Whatever disagreements hon. Members have with the programme, the fact that we can debate it here is a very welcome step forward indeed. I believe that most Members agree with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para14"><a name="07072595000439">There is a great deal in the programme, but I shall mention three Bills that I believe will impact on my constituency and on others. Few Members, councillors or elected officials can help feeling a sense of hopelessness and anger when constituents approach them about problems with public transport services within their communities. I believe that the problem is particularly acute for Members who represent areas that are geographically isolated and have statistically low car usage. No one disagrees that bus operators should be able to make a profit, but we must ensure that they continue to provide an essential public service. They receive a substantial public subsidy, and with that should go a clear responsibility to ensure an effective public service. I hope that the draft Bill will have real teeth for elected local authorities to ensure effective public transport in their communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para15"><a name="07072595000440">Members often present petitions before the House and we sometimes meet the managing directors of our bus companies. Occasionally, we have a little bit of success, but there is a major problem, as everyone&#146;s postbag over the last few months will confirm. When these problems are compounded, they can lead to genuine hardship and isolation. It is often the elderly and, indeed, the young trying to take advantage of employment opportunities, who live in these isolated areas and experience transport problems. I believe that the local transport Bill will be widely welcomed in the House and outside in the wider community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para16"><a name="07072595000441">Secondly, I would mention the child maintenance and other payments Bill. Much attention will rightly be focused on the question of child maintenance, but I shall make particular mention of the other payments side of it. The Bill includes a commitment to set up a scheme for lump-sum compensation for people suffering from asbestos-related diseases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para17"><a name="07072595000442">My constituency used to have a chemical works, owned by Turner and Newall, which made asbestos products for 80 years. The consequences were dire not just for the work force, but for their families as well. My grandfather worked there after he left the services after the first world war and my own aunt has asbestos-related disease. She has it because my grandmother washed my grandfather&#146;s overalls. That shows how insidious this disease is and how much hardship it creates. As I said, it is not just those workers who are affected, but their families and others who worked in shipyards, plumbing and a range of other industries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para18"><a name="07072595000443">It is brave and honourable to recognise what happened there. The people who suffer from this disease have pretty dreadful lives, with all the disadvantage and pain that goes with it. This lump-sum compensation may make a little bit of difference to however many years these people have left. The Government are acting wholly honourably by including this measure in the next legislative programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para19"><a name="07072595000444">Finally, the education and skills Bill is more important than any other Bill for securing long-term economic prosperity and success for this nation. It offers an  <br>

opportunity for a national crusade to ingrain in the nation&#146;s psyche the importance of the skills and education agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para20"><a name="07072595000445">The impact of globalisation hits us all. Seven years ago, a group of women workers in my constituency who were in textiles and made garments for Marks and Spencer lost their jobs. Marks and Spencer made the commercial decision to source those goods from the far east and China. The argument then was all about low wages and low skills, and how we could compete with them. Over the next three years, by 2010, China will produce more PhDs than the whole of the United States. The argument is no longer about trying to compete on low wages and skills; it is about competing on skills alone. We need Ministers to sell the Bill. I hope that whatever specific disagreements we might have on different sides of the Chamber, we can have a form of national unity on the importance of developing the skills agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para21"><a name="07072595000446">I recently took part in a state of the city debate in the city that I represent&#151;Sunderland. I was asked a question by a member of our local Youth Parliament: what sort of jobs did I think they, as young people, would have in 30 years&#146; time? The question made me think. It was very perceptive. I thought about what the economy was like when I left school just over 30 years ago in my constituency and what we thought about the future. The economy was dominated by mining, shipbuilding and heavy and light engineering. That is what we did. In many ways, we thought that it would go on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para22"><a name="07072595000447">If I had predicted 30 years ago that we would lose shipbuilding, mining and other industries, while at the same time predicting that employment levels would be higher, people would not have believed it. If I had predicted that in 30 years&#146; time my local area would produce 380,000 cars a year&#151;remember the state of the British car industry and its reputation in the 1970s&#151;and that some would be exported to Japan, not many people would have believed it. I would not have believed it. Yet that has been the pace of change in the past 30 years. Although it is difficult to predict the future, we can say that whatever the pace of change has been in the past 30 years, the pace of change in the next decade will be as quick.</p>

<p><a name="st_o418"><a name="07072595000448"><a name="70725-0024.htm_spnew1"><a name="07072595000941"><b>David Wright:</b>
 Does my hon. Friend agree that small and medium-sized enterprises will be crucial in the crusade to upskill people in the UK economy? A key aspect of the Bill needs to be to provide support to small and medium-sized enterprises so that they can give young people time off to take advantage of training opportunities. That is crucial. I hope he agrees that we need a strong commitment to that. We need to ensure that we check up on employers to ensure that they are giving that time to young people in particular.</p>

<p><a name="st_o419"><a name="07072595000449"><a name="70725-0024.htm_spnew2"><a name="07072595000942"><b>Mr. Kemp:</b>
 I certainly agree. When I talk to employers in the constituency, particularly in small and medium-sized firms, the one thing they constantly say is, &#147;We need a work force that has constantly improving skills and levels of education.&#148; Employers recognise that if they are to be competitive within a global economy, they need a highly skilled work force. They realise that it is in their interests, to their benefit and for the profitability of their companies to ensure that we have that level of skills. Young people certainly need it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para23"><a name="07072595000450">I wanted to mention only those three Bills. We should grasp the challenges of the future. We have lived through a period of change over the past 30 years, but the speed of change will quicken in the future. The train is leaving the station and we have a choice: we can either get on it or it will leave us behind. It is crucial that education and skills are taken seriously. We must get out there and sell that message. We must convince everyone&#151;young people who have not yet entered the job market and those who are already in work. Adaptability&#151;the ability to change jobs&#151;is important. The tradition of being in the same employment for many years will disappear. Only if we sell education and skills and convince people that it is important will we have a reasonable chance of securing this country&#146;s long-term economic future.</p>

 We welcome the opportunity to discuss the programme for the coming year. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell) said on 11 July when the Prime Minister made his statement, it is right that we should move from legislation being cooked up in secret and announced on one day with a fanfare of trumpets&#151;albeit that it had usually been leaked beforehand, with everyone pretending one thing was happening when it was not&#151;to a system of honest and open discussion in which the Government say at the outset, &#147;This is what we are thinking,&#148; and at the end saying, &#147;This is our final view.&#148; That is a much better process. We welcome it, and will co-operate on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para24"><a name="07072595000452">We also welcome the honesty of the Leader of the House. This parliamentary year will operate from the arrival of the new Prime Minister at the end of June, so time is inevitably foreshortened. We understand and accept that. However, I made the point in an intervention that that should not mean that consultations should not be considered, and it will not be helpful if ideas are not taken on board. Flexibility will be required, as will hard work in October by civil servants and others employed in Departments, and Ministers must be honest about any good ideas that are made. We look forward to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para25"><a name="07072595000453">My position and that of my fellow Liberal Democrat Members can be summarised by saying&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Although none of them is present, as I have been their colleague for so many weeks, months and years, they trust me to speak for them. Our position is that Governments have often legislated in haste and introduced measures that we subsequently regret. Legislation, legislation, legislation is no substitute for good administration, but it has often been used as a substitute for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para26"><a name="07072595000454">I checked up on three Departments. In the past 10 years, we have had 11 Health Bills, four Health White Papers and seven Health Green Papers. We have had 11 Education Bills, nine Education White Papers and 11 Green Papers. We have also had 60 Home Office Bills. Much of that proposed legislation has not been thought through; much of it has been undone, as the Government have returned and said, &#147;We want to change it&#148;; and much of it has never been implemented&#151;we pass it, but it never takes effect. My strongest plea to the Leader of the House and her colleagues is, please do not introduce any Bill that we do not absolutely need. Legislation  <br>

should be the last resort, not the first resort. Usually, what is needed is administration&#151;not new laws, but other steps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para27"><a name="07072595000455">As the Leader of the House knows, one of the results of all the laws we have passed is that there are more than 3,000 new offences. That is not a healthy route to go down. The test I always apply is whether legislation increases liberty or authority. We have experienced 10 years in which the trend has been towards authority&#151;by and large, although not without exception&#151;and away from liberty. We need the trend to be in the other direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="70725-0024.htm_para28"><a name="07072595000456">My second test is whether legislation increases individual people&#146;s power and local power, rather than central power. There have been some very centralising proposals. The national health service is still one of the most centralised services in the world, and real devolution to local people and communities is desperately needed. One of the measures by which we will judge any legislative proposal is whether it gives local government a real opportunity to be influential and powerful&#151;as opposed to it being said that that will happen but it not being the case. The same test applies to the devolved Administrations. The Government need to understand that in devolving government to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, they must actually devolve it. There are bits that they still hang on to, and so far they have not been willing to go down the road of a federal United Kingdom in which its four countries can have real autonomy in many of their own affairs.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is making a very interesting point that fits in with much of what the Government have said in the past few weeks about transparency and opening matters up. How far would his party go in devolving more power? How far would he go down the route of fiscal autonomy? Would he support a call from other parties for the devolution of corporation tax to the devolved Administrations?</p>

 The honest answer is that we want to go much further. At our autumn party conference, we will debate a proposal for the same form of constitutional convention for the UK as in Scotland&#151;involving not just politicians but business, the unions and faith groups, among others&#151;so that we can achieve such devolution. That would include thinking through the financial settlement across the United Kingdom. If one believes in a federal United Kingdom, as I have all my years, that must be the consequence.</p>

 I have a very clear view about that, too, which is that if a constitutional convention for the United Kingdom comes up with proposed changes to the constitutional structure of the relationship between the four countries&#151;including, in my view, the way in which we elect our Parliament and what we do in this  <br>

building&#151;then, yes, that needs to be endorsed by a vote not just in Scotland but across the United Kingdom. One clearly cannot alter the constitutional relationship in a big way without that change. That is why we supported, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, what happened after the constitutional conventions in Scotland, and in Wales and Northern Ireland when they moved, with the assent of their populations, to that conclusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="70725-0025.htm_para0"><a name="07072595000461">On the constitutional reform Bill, the Government need to go further. So far, we have seen proposals for a welcome transfer of powers, but as our previous debates have indicated, there is still a lot further to go. Pursuant to the point made earlier by the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) and others, I hope that we will see the day when the business of Parliament is fixed by Parliament in consultation with Government, not by Government in consultation with Parliament. The agenda should be set here&#151;it should of course accommodate what the Government came to power to implement&#151;rather than the Government by grace and favour allowing Parliament opportunities to do other things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="70725-0025.htm_para1"><a name="07072595000462">I observe that in the list of the other 22 Bills, the Government have made provision literally from the cradle to the grave. Indeed, in the words of a joke one might think of, they have made provision from the womb to the tomb. There is a Human Tissue and Embryos Bill at one end of the life cycle and a coroners Bill at the other, so all the seven stages of man&#151;and woman&#151;are catered for. To that extent, the list is certainly comprehensive. The right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) made the good point, however, that none of this is new. I will not repeat the litany that she gave, but it is absolutely true that if ever we wanted evidence that this is a continuing Government, not a new one&#151;with a Prime Minister who, although a new individual, is continuing the agenda&#151;the evidence is here in front of us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="70725-0025.htm_para2"><a name="07072595000463">I want to pick out one or two important implications. There are five Bills relating to the children, young people and education agenda, which is important. I share the view expressed a moment ago by the hon. Member for Houghton and Washington, East (Mr. Kemp) that unless we have a child maintenance and other payments system that means that parents pay what they are meant to pay, all the shouting over the past 10 years about the Child Support Agency will have been in vain. That system has failed, bluntly, and it needs to work. We all have constituents who are the victims of the system not working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="70725-0025.htm_para3"><a name="07072595000464">Children in care, which is still a hugely important issue, is also on the agenda. Ministers will know that many of the people who end up in prison have been in care at some stage in their lives; there is a sad link. Many people are still waiting for adoption. We do not have adequate fostering or enough people to foster. We need to ensure that those children who, through no fault of their own, end up in care get a much better quality of care, so that the risk that they will go wrong later in life is much reduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="70725-0025.htm_para4"><a name="07072595000465">In relation to education and skills, the borough that the Leader of the House and I represent&#151;like the area represented by the hon.

docks are no longer there and the education needs have changed. However, I hope that we do not go blindly in the direction of academic education for everyone until the age of 18. Many of my constituents want vocational education, and they can benefit from experience of the workplace at the top end of primary school. They benefit from doing paid work at weekends when they are in their middle years of secondary school. They want to be able to understand the world of work, and some of them have never had the experience of anybody in their home working. It is therefore important that education and skills are not seen as being solely about academic attainment. We need skills upgrades, but we also need to train people for practical things, such as constructing buildings so that we do not have to import people&#151;as London is doing now&#151;to do it. We could use our own young people to do the construction work for not only the Olympics, but all over Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="70725-0025.htm_para5"><a name="07072595000466">I know that the Leader of the House has always been vocal about youth services and I am glad that the Government have been able to find more money for youth services through the Unclaimed Assets Bill. We will have to check whether it is entirely compatible with human rights legislation, given that someone else left that money in the bank, but we need more investment in youth services. Everybody now recognises that, and if the Bill is a quick fix way to do that, in partnership with local communities, it will be a good thing to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="70725-0025.htm_para6"><a name="07072595000467">On housing and planning, there will be three Bills. One is, sadly, insufficient and the other two on planning are controversial. On the Housing and Regeneration Bill, we do not yet see the mechanisms for delivering the social housing, at a cost people can afford, to rescue Britain from the shortage of housing, terrible debts, high mortgages and crippling rents outside the social housing sector. My borough is not untypical and we have waiting lists of thousands for social housing. We had a statement on housing the other day and there was an almost deafening silence from Ministers on council housing, which appears to be still off the agenda. Many people believe that council housing is a good thing. Many people like living in council housing and believe that councils can be more responsive than housing associations, housing trusts, arm&#146;s length management organisations or tenant management organisations. I hope that the Government have heard the message loud and clear from authorities and parties around the country that what is now called the fourth option&#151;the right of councils to say, as mine is doing, that they will not sell off their housing stock or set up an ALMO&#151;should be an option for every council, certainly in England.</p>

Reading, Washington or Maidenhead. It is a matter for community debate and decision. It is necessary to respond to needs, but they differ around the country. Decisions on how to meet need&#151;be it through council housing or selling off housing stock&#151;should be taken locally, without force or bribery. The Labour party conference has made it clear that it wants councils to be able to build and let housing. The Leader of the House is also deputy leader of the Labour party and she knows that too, but my point is that we did not hear much about that we when had exchanges on the subject here the other day. I want to make sure that the matter is kept on the agenda. We will not let up on our efforts to make sure that it is, and I hope that colleagues on the Labour Back Benches will do the same.</p>

 If we are to permit local councils to construct homes again, and if we are to provide the resources for them to do so, would the hon. Gentleman concede that there should be some sort of quality test on their ability to perform that function adequately? My instinct is very strongly in favour of what my hon.

 We certainly do not want to build poor-quality housing, and the old Parker Knoll standards were good. I applaud the fact that the Government want a decent homes initiative to make sure that standards are upgraded, and I am not arguing that councils should build frequently and build cheap. On the contrary, I am arguing that they should build to last, and the really good housing that people like to live in is housing that is built to last. We must adopt that approach again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="70725-0025.htm_para7"><a name="07072595000472">I absolutely understand that we must not compromise on standards, but the big question is whether there is a real commitment to putting in the finance and giving councils the power of general competence.

 I think that the hon.

 I am sorry: I did hear that question, but did not deal with it. In the end, the quality test is applied by the electorate, with the help of the district auditor and all the performance standards for local government that are now carried out regularly. Much better peer-group analysis is available, but the quality test that the hon.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way again, but I want to press him on this matter. Some major strategic decisions have to be made. They may involve airports, or ports, or even the third Thames bridge for the Reading area that the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) and I have advocated tirelessly. However, it is the devil&#146;s own job to get four or five councils to agree to do anything in a strategic way.

If changes were made to VAT and stamp duty&#151;I have no idea whether that is in anyone&#146;s mind&#151;such matters would certainly be decided at UK level. The Government&#146;s welcome proposals to encourage more long-term fixed-rate mortgages would benefit house buyers in all parts of the UK. Similarly, the proposals to make Government land available for housing also have relevance for Scotland, particularly given the opportunities for the development of Ministry of Defence property.</p>

 I wonder whether my hon. Friend noted in the smaller print a reference to dealing with Travellers&#146; housing needs. I hope that any such Bill will attempt to provide greater certainty both in the planning of appropriate sites for Travellers to occupy and to develop for their own housing purposes, and in greater guidance on the role of local authorities in providing accommodation and sites for them in the future.

know, that legislation will be taken forward on a UK basis. There is some debate in England and Wales about the degree to which the funds raised by the planning gain supplement, if it is introduced, will be applied locally, as opposed to centrally. It is clear that, in England at least, by far the biggest proportion of any funds raised under the planning gain supplement will be spent locally to provide for local housing and infrastructure needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o527"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para1"><a name="07072595000496">Although things may have moved forward, the proposals last year provided that in Scotland, the funds would be allocated directly to the Scottish Executive, with no provision to allocate them to the areas in which they were raised. When we have an Administration in Scotland who have proposed lots of spending plans without the means of paying for them, we have an Administration who are certainly very ready to take any extra finances made available to them, although those finances would be raised from local communities. I hope that a similar commitment to ensure that funds raised from local communities will be applied for their benefit will apply to Scotland as well. I hope that that Minister will take on board that point in the discussions on the planning gain supplement proposal.</p>

 I suspect that the hon. Gentleman may not be aware that when we debated the matter previously I opposed the planning gain supplement process for Scotland, precisely because every penny went to the Scottish Government and not one penny was guaranteed to return to the locales from which it came&#151;as he wants it to. I am sure that&#151;given that the First Minister is present&#151;the Scottish Government will take on board everything that the hon.

 I am very much aware of the arguments that were made in the House. In fact, I think&#151;although my recollection may be wrong&#151;that I was in the House for that debate at the same time as the hon. Gentleman. I think that we might even have intervened on each other. At this stage I do not want to argue for or against the planning gain supplement. I just want to make sure that the same principle as will apply in England&#151;that the purpose of any planning gain tax is to assist local communities to develop their infrastructure&#151;will also apply in Scotland. If the intervention from the hon. Gentleman, who seemed to be getting the endorsement of the right hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), means that that is also the policy of the Scottish Executive, I welcome that commitment and I am sure that colleagues in Scotland will take that on board in debates in the Scottish Parliament.</p>

The flooding reminds us that new housing has to take account of changes in the environment and should be constructed so as to ensure that it is energy-efficient and that the building sector can contribute to the reduction of the UK&#146;s greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

climate is not always as warm as it is elsewhere. Whatever else happens, it is likely that energy prices are, in the long run, going to continue to go up&#151;as a result of market trends and perhaps also of packages of measures designed to encourage reduced energy use. We all know that for some householders, rises in energy prices have led to more fuel poverty. Although there has been a drop in energy prices this year, the overall trend in energy prices has been, and will no doubt continue to be, upwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o530"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para4"><a name="07072595000501">The Government have done a lot to tackle fuel poverty, but it is essential that vulnerable consumers are protected against the effects of the increases, both through financial measures and by helping to make their homes more energy efficient. In the energy White Paper, the Government said, in effect, that they expected energy companies to do more to protect vulnerable consumers and that if they did not, the Government would consider making them do so by bringing forward legislation&#151;for example, to promote the wider use of social tariffs by energy companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o531"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para5"><a name="07072595000502">Some energy companies have risen to the challenge of recognising the social needs of more vulnerable consumers, but not all have done so. I hope that when the Government come to assess the degree to which the energy companies as a whole have responded to the call set out in the energy White Paper, they will decide whether there is a case for introducing in the energy Bill that we are promised later in the year proposals to ensure that all energy companies meet the needs of consumers who have suffered from the effects of rising energy prices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o532"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para6"><a name="07072595000503">I want to turn to two other areas of policy related to the environment. I was delighted to understand from the comments made by the Leader of the House that the marine Bill will be brought forward in draft form as part of the legislative programme. A long-running campaign, launched by WWF in particular, has had a lot of support. It highlights the fact that both wildlife and our citizens rely on a healthy and productive marine environment for their future well-being. There is a need for marine legislation. I know that marine legislation is a complex area, and the UK Government and the devolved Administrations have important issues to resolve between themselves, but I hope that draft legislation is brought forward at an early stage, so that the definitive Bill can be introduced soon after that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o533"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para7"><a name="07072595000504">Another environmental issue that is moving higher and higher up the political agenda is the Government&#146;s proposal for a Climate Change Bill. I am glad that it has been confirmed that the Bill will be in next year&#146;s legislative programme, and I hope that it will be brought forward at an early date. The Joint Committee on the Draft Climate Change Bill had a thorough discussion on the proposals in the draft Bill. My hon. Friend the Deputy Leader of the House and I have been members of the Committee, so she knows that there has been thorough consultation, and because of that, there is an opportunity to bring forward the Bill at an early stage; I hope that that will happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o534"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para8"><a name="07072595000505">When the Joint Committee examined the draft Bill, two things came home to me: first, I realised the overwhelming importance of taking action, and secondly  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="25 July 2007">

<notus-date day="25" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>25 July 2007 : Column 988</b><br>
I realised how pioneering the Bill is. In the Committee&#146;s public sessions, comments from people in China, California and the European Union made it clear that our Climate Change Bill is likely to encourage other countries to follow suit. The Bill is a good example of the Government showing real international leadership, and I certainly welcome that. That is why I hope that the Bill will be introduced at an early stage in the Government&#146;s programme for the coming year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o535"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para9"><a name="07072595000506">The Joint Committee&#146;s public discussions underlined how potentially radical the draft Bill is as a driver for influencing and changing Government policy, and ensuring action across all areas of Government to make sure that we really succeed in cutting greenhouse gas emissions in this country. Even now, I am not sure whether everyone who supported the introduction of the Bill realises its potential power; it is an important measure. All credit should go to Friends of the Earth, Christian Aid and the other organisations that campaigned last year for Bill to be introduced. The Bill could be a powerful driver of change to Government policy and to the way in which we organise government and society. It is important to underline that it is not just the Bill that should be brought forward at an early date; the climate change committee envisaged in the draft Bill should be established as early as possible, too. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o536"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para10"><a name="07072595000507">As well as undertaking an important advisory role, the climate change committee will need to help to make the case for the radical measures that will undoubtedly be necessary if we are to meet the objectives of the Climate Change Bill. I hope that that committee will be set up quickly once the Bill becomes law, and I hope that the shadow committee, which the previous Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs suggested would be set up soon, will be established very quickly. It would be helpful if my hon. Friend the Deputy Leader of the House gave some indication, today or later, of the possible timetable for the establishment of that shadow committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o537"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para11"><a name="07072595000508">In the coming year, I would like the Government to make sure that the objective of tackling climate change is a theme that is reflected not just in the Climate Change Bill, important though that is, but throughout the entire legislative programme, the entire Queen&#146;s Speech, and everything that the Government do. That needs to be done, because the challenge of climate change not only requires action across Government, but requires us to send a message that it is a theme running through all that the Government do. We need to send the public the clear message that we politicians are serious when we say that tackling climate change is a top priority. That is essential, because we all know that tackling climate change requires action not just by Governments&#151;both ours and those of other countries&#151;but by individuals. If we are to persuade the public to make their own personal contribution to tackling climate change, we have to show them that we parliamentarians, and the Government, mean what we say when we bring forward our policies, legislation and measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o538"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para12"><a name="07072595000510">It is thoroughly timely that the House should have the opportunity, thanks to the legislative programme, to review the arrangements for assisted reproduction and embryo research. That opportunity will be provided by the Human Tissue and Embryos Bill. That is good news. There will be different opinions, as properly there should be, and those opinions should be given expression in the debates in the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o539"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para13"><a name="07072595000511">I make no secret of the fact that I have always been on the side of what I call the progressives, in the sense that I reject the notion of a doctrinal opposition to embryo research. I take a pragmatic view, an instrumental view, an empiricist view that if benefits can flow from such research, the effect of which can be to mitigate the effects of congenital diseases or disorders or to remove them altogether, we should welcome that. In the deliberations that lie ahead on the Bill, I hope that the Government and right hon. and hon. Members will be significantly influenced and informed in their consideration by the body of expert scientific and in some cases medical evidence that will be presented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o540"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para14"><a name="07072595000512">However, it is an open secret that there are many people who believe that the Human Tissue and Embryos Bill is an appropriate vehicle for another review by the House&#151;a review of the law relating to abortion. I am not a lawyer&#151;I say that as a matter of some considerable pride&#151;and I am certainly not a Government lawyer, but my understanding is that the Government lawyers have advised Ministers that they would not be able safely to resist amendments on the subject of abortion in the context of the Bill. That is to say, to seek to remove them or prevent their discussion or debate on grounds of scope would almost certainly fail in legal terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o541"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para15"><a name="07072595000513">I have heard it floated that the Government are prepared to consider such matters, and that they recognise that legally they would not be able, in parliamentary terms, to resist such matters. What I have not heard is a confirmation of that highly salient point on the Floor of the House. If the Leader of the House or the Deputy Leader of the House of Commons is able to confirm when she winds up the debate that what I have read in the popular prints is correct, I would greatly welcome that. There are differences of opinion on the matter, but it is right that if there is a legislative vehicle in the programme, an opportunity to consider these issues should be provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o542"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para16"><a name="07072595000514">For my own part, I believe that the vast disparity in the availability of abortion services across the country from one area to another is a source of concern and an occasion for protest. If we look back to the latest year for which reliable figures are available, 2001, there appears to have been something of a lottery in terms both of the funding of abortion and of the waiting times to secure it. In 2001 in Coventry, 96 per cent. of abortions were funded by the national health service&#151;lucky people in need of or making a request for an abortion in that part of the west midlands. If, however, a woman were so relatively unfortunate as to live in Kingston or Richmond, the chance of securing a publicly funded abortion in that year would have been only 50 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o543"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para17"><a name="07072595000515">If we are to have a national health service, despite the avowed religion of localism that seems too frequently to be professed by members of all parties these days, I hope it would be conceded and, indeed, proudly proclaimed  <br>

that there should be a commonality of provision across the country. We either believe in the availability of an abortion service to women, on certain terms and conditions, or we do not. If we believe in it, as I confess that I passionately do and always have done, these marked differences&#151;this postcode lottery, in effect&#151;should not exist. I want that state of affairs to change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o544"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para18"><a name="07072595000516">I referred to the differential in funding, but there are also marked differences in how long people have to wait to secure an abortion. In 2001, someone who lived in north-east Lincolnshire might be quite impressed by the figures, because in that part of the country 79 per cent. of abortions were undertaken before 10 weeks had elapsed, whereas someone who lived in Great Yarmouth might be considerably disappointed, not to say horrified, by the fact that the figure was as low as 26 per cent. That simply is not right. We must make a public policy judgment in this House of Commons as to what we think appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o545"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para19"><a name="07072595000517">I am not, as the House will be relieved to learn and you will be pleased to discover, Mr. Deputy Speaker, inclined to dilate tonight on all the issues relating to the potential amendment of the law on abortion. That titillating opportunity will doubtless present itself at a later stage in the course of the consideration of the Human Tissue and Embryos Bill. I would, however, like to say something specifically about a crucial challenge for the Government and the House concerning early abortion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o546"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para20"><a name="07072595000518">The vast majority of abortions in this country are, and should be, undertaken early, but we need to do a great deal more to improve access to early and safe abortion for women who have decided that that is what they want. I put it to the Leader of the House and the Deputy Leader of the House that it is vital, in terms of the scope of the Bill and the time allowed for debate on potential amendments when it is forthcoming, that we should have a chance to consider all the germane issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o547"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para21"><a name="07072595000519">For example, I cannot for the life of me see any justification, in 2007, for the arcane&#151;dare I say it, almost antediluvian&#151;requirement that a woman who seeks an abortion should have to obtain the signatures of two doctors. That might sound like a prosaic requirement that can be easily fulfilled, but that is often not so. Doctors will sometimes say, &#147;No, you&#146;d better go elsewhere; it&#146;s not convenient for me to see you at the moment&#148;, or &#147;There&#146;s quite a long waiting list in this area.&#148; All sorts of difficulties can arise. If the basic will of Parliament is that women should be able to access abortion, they should not be put in the invidious position of having to traipse around, possibly in a condition of considerable personal and even physical distress, to access what should be their legal entitlement and what is certainly&#151;I believe that right hon. and hon. Members would judge&#151;their moral due. The &#147;two doctors&#148; requirement should be removed, but we should at least have a chance to table, debate and vote on an amendment to that effect when the legislation is considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o548"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para22"><a name="07072595000520">Similarly, there should not be long delays. If we are to have targets in other fields, why not in this case? I would suggest a target of 72 hours from the time that the woman makes the approach to request the abortion to the time that the procedure is undertaken. At the very least, it should not be more than a week. We  <br>

should not in a modern, decent, civilised democratic society entertain the idea that women faced with a very difficult situation, and possibly having to make a harrowing decision, should then have to wait for week after week, and possibly longer, before they can give effect to the decision that they have made perfectly properly, honourably and in all good conscience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o549"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para23"><a name="07072595000521">There are other oddities about the current fusty law, one of which is the requirement that the procedure take place in rather prescriptively specified locations. I believe that modern law should be rather more flexible than that. The principle that should govern the amendment of the law to localise provision and provide for a range of community settings in which abortion can take place should simply be this: clinical governance and quality assurance procedures should be comparable to those that apply to any other medical procedure that an individual might undertake within the national health service. I do not see why abortion should be set as a class apart&#151;much more difficult to obtain than other operations and far more difficult to access, logistically or possibly even geographically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o550"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para24"><a name="07072595000522">Such considerations must be looked at in the context of the law, as should the suggestion, which I think is sound, that we widen the range of people who can undertake the procedure. I see no good reason why qualified nurses who are perfectly capable of undertaking the abortion procedure should not be empowered to do so in law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o551"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para25"><a name="07072595000523">Whatever hon. or right hon. Members listening to this debate think about my views on the subject, I hope that people feel it right that the House of Commons should consider such matters&#151;a very long time after it last did so. I have been in the House since May 1997. To my knowledge, there have been no debates on substantive legislation on this subject during the 10 years and two months I have been here. There have been ten-minute rule motions put forward on the issue, but that is a wholly unsatisfactory basis on which to seek to determine the future of public policy on this subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o552"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para26"><a name="07072595000524">I hope that the Government will be open-minded on the matter. They might not want to whip their own side; I rather imagine that on the Conservative Benches there will be a free vote. As far as I am concerned, all votes are free and I tend to do what I want anyway. I am not overly preoccupied whatever any Whip might think about these matters. I hope, however, that there will be votes, and an opportunity for decent debate leading up to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o553"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para27"><a name="07072595000525">Secondly, and very much more briefly, I did not expect a single equality Bill in the draft legislative programme, but I confess that I think that there is a compelling case for one. After all, we have had the discrimination law review, and we have a single equality body. Many people&#151;not all&#151;think that a logical corollary of the creation of a single equality body is the creation of a single equality Act, the purpose and effect of which would be to simplify, synthesise and distil all other anti-discrimination legislation into a single corpus of law that would be easier for citizens to access and more readily understandable by the public and private agencies responsible for adhering to it.</p>

I have pontificated on that issue many a time and oft during the past few years in debates in Westminster Hall and in questions to the Minister for Women. A duty has been placed on public authorities, and that is important, but we cannot ignore the fact that there is persistent and, in some cases, severe discrimination in the private sector as well. Of course, we have to be careful not to overload the system, not to achieve a counter-productive result and not to frighten business, but if we know that there is serious discrimination, we have a responsibility to face up to it and be prepared to do something about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o555"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para29"><a name="07072595000529">That discrimination takes several forms: in pay; on the ground of pregnancy; through occupational segregation; and&#151;whether deliberate or inadvertent&#151;against people who have caring responsibilities. The insertion in such a Bill of a positive duty on the private sector, suitably calibrated to take account of what private companies can bear in the short, medium and long term, would make a great deal of sense and create equality between the public and private sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o556"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para30"><a name="07072595000530">The final issue that I wish to consider&#151;simplification&#151;will again warm the cockles of the heart of the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes). The Government have championed their employment simplification Bill. My understanding is that at least part of its purpose is to bolster the machinery for enforcing the national minimum wage. I said at the outset that I wanted to focus on subjects that were of particular interest to women. Let us not forget that, in 2006, 870,000 women benefited from the increase in the national minimum wage. Nevertheless, it is striking and salutary that no fewer than 202,000 women did not get the national minimum wage to which they were entitled. That is profoundly unsatisfactory. It is not only unfair to those women but corrodes the principle of the rule of law and the effect of the will of Parliament. In 2004, approximately 1,798 cases demonstrated that people did not get their entitlement, but only 62 enforcement notices and no penalty notices were issued. It is important that several criteria are fulfilled if the employment simplification Bill is to deliver effectively for women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o557"><a name="70725-0026.htm_para31"><a name="07072595000531">First, we need to publicise much more widely people&#146;s exact entitlements. Many people, especially those who operate in the twilight zone of low paid and high pressure jobs, will not know what is their due. Secondly, there needs to be a much more proactive enforcement policy if people are to get their due rather than be denied it. Thirdly, we need a robust regime of penalties to discourage rogue employers and encourage good practice.</p>

I reserve judgment on the last item, because I do not know whether the employment simplification Bill will work as the Government intend, and as I hope that it would operate. If they take account of the sort of points that I am making, I hope that the measure will command support from all parties, because it would make a great difference to the lives of many highly vulnerable people in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o559"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para1"><a name="07072595000533">The three issues are important and I hope that they will be tackled to the benefit of the country.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow). He is always eloquent and I concurred with much of what he said, especially about reproductive health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o560"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para2"><a name="07072595000535">It is a great privilege to speak in the debate. We are considering a welcome and positive process. I agree with the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) that it has the potential to be excellent and I hope that I can use it today and in years to come on behalf of my constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o561"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para3"><a name="07072595000536">I want to talk about three things. The first is the housing and regeneration Bill, about which I am especially excited because the pressure on housing in London is extreme and my borough is no exception. In Newham, housing benefit spending is currently &#163;245 million a year. Nearly one third&#151;&#163;67 million&#151;is spent on keeping homeless people in temporary accommodation. It will be a measure of our success when that is reduced through the provision of affordable housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o562"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para4"><a name="07072595000537">The expansion of affordable housing will provide an opportunity for my local council&#151;a good local council&#151;to ensure that much-needed social homes are built. I further welcome the commitment to increase the provision of affordable housing in east London and the UK as a whole, to ensure that young people who are not fortunate enough to inherit property can afford to buy their first home. There are so many young people in my constituency who see homes priced out of their reach and for whom the opportunity to buy is a vague dream for some time in the future. I hope that adequate levels of social housing will also dampen down the inflationary tendencies that have, I fear, made London the European capital for housing inequality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o563"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para5"><a name="07072595000538">I remind the House that the waiting time in my area for a four-bedroom property is more than 13 years. There are families on waiting lists who will never receive that home, because they will have grown and family members will have flown before it becomes a possibility. Let us not misunderstand what that means to those families. They are often shunted from home to home, as the lease finishes. That means that they do not have the stability that comes from making a community where they live and that the children might have to move schools or travel large distances, with long journey times, to get to school. That does not make for a community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o564"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para6"><a name="07072595000539">Moving home is also an expensive business, as many of us in the House know. When people are poor and in temporary accommodation, often paying for their rent  <br>

out of their wages, which do not meet those needs, the moving costs on top of that add costs, problems and stresses to families already under pressure. The waiting list in my community in 2006 was 29,574, which is equivalent to the entire population of San Marino&#151;I thank my researchers for that one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o565"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para7"><a name="07072595000540">There is also something to be said for not putting all our faith in supply. I would certainly welcome measures, which might be under consideration, to cool the overheated buy-to-let market, which has helped both to ratchet up the cost of temporary accommodation, at such an extreme cost to the Exchequer, and to decrease the affordability of housing for ordinary working families, above all in the capital. That is without mentioning the concurrent social difficulties experienced through unsuitably located households in multiple occupancy. I come from an Olympic borough, where we now have a population of migrant workers, who often live in small homes, with many to a room. That is causing stresses in local communities, as buy-to-let properties are inhabited in such a highly multiple-occupancy fashion&#151;if that makes sense and is good English.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o566"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para8"><a name="07072595000541">I have lost count of the number of complaints from constituents about absentee landlords, which stems from the huge increase in buy-to-let properties in Newham over the past decade. The high cost of rents in the private rented sector and the resulting overcrowding of properties by tenants often compounds those problems. More importantly, in the long term it might prove difficult to maintain West Ham&#146;s strong sense of community cohesion, of which I am immensely proud. Although I accept that the private rented sector provides much-needed flexibility and choice for those who cannot purchase a home or do not wish to, I would welcome moves to ensure that our dream of building mixed sustainable communities is not hampered by the sheer extent of buy-to-let properties in particular areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o567"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para9"><a name="07072595000542">With a significant prospect of housing gain as a consequence of the Olympics, my constituents need rock-solid assurances that our expectation of more affordable housing as a result of the regeneration of the Olympic boroughs meets the needs of the families currently on the waiting list. There is a real fear that the properties that will be built in Stratford and along the regeneration belt in the Lea valley will be one and two-bedroom properties, which will not meet the needs of our growing families, particularly those who have been waiting on the housing list for more than 13 years for a four-bedroom property in the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o568"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para10"><a name="07072595000543">A second theme of great importance for the people in my local community relates to the proposed counter-terrorism Bill, which includes a number of new proposals aimed at tackling the continuing threat from criminals bent on causing indiscriminate damage and death. When we strive to engage our communities in tackling this threat, however, it is vital that a meaningful consultation is undertaken in all our communities on proposals such as stop and question and the extension of the limit of detention without charge, to ensure that alienation and disillusionment are not the unintended result of such moves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o569"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para11"><a name="07072595000544">The wonderfully diverse communities of West Ham want to work together to defeat this threat and to contribute constructively towards its defeat. They will therefore strongly welcome the consultation on the new security and anti-terrorism measures, and it is my  <br>

genuine belief that, through honest and open consultation on the legislation, we can help to avoid community isolation and alienation and build stronger cohesive communities in the UK. I am sure that the many diverse communities in my constituency will be keen to play as constructive a role as possible in this important debate, and I welcome the Government&#146;s decision to give them the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o570"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para12"><a name="07072595000545">My third theme, like the others, seeks to strengthen the sustainability of the communities in my constituency. The Green Paper, &#147;In work, better off: next steps to full employment&#148;, has already appeared and attracted some comment. I applaud the commitment to encourage long-term benefit claimants to sustain and make progress in employment, particularly through strengthening the skills base of people who have not worked for some time. Despite recent falls in the probability of leaving work, lone parents are still almost twice as likely as non-lone parents to leave their jobs. One in five lone parents who leave income support return to it within six months, and more than a quarter do so within a year. One third do so within two years, and almost two fifths within three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o571"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para13"><a name="07072595000546">I fear that one of the reasons for that is that, when women are encouraged to go into work, the costs that they will face&#151;including travel and child care costs&#151;along with the reduction in their benefits are not properly assessed before they make the move. Having conducted a focus group&#151;for want of a better term&#151;with local communities on these issues, it has become clear that, when women leave employment in those circumstances, they feel demoralised because they have not been able to sustain a job. That is bad enough, but they also leave with heavy debts. They have often been forced out of employment because they could no longer afford to work and to live. That is particularly an issue in London, where it is related to the housing and child care costs. We need to ensure that such women receive the very best assistance before they take the step of leaving benefit in order to obtain work. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o572"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para14"><a name="07072595000547">Lisa Harker&#146;s report into child poverty at the end of last year projected that, if the rate of job exits among lone parents was reduced to that of non-lone parents, the Government&#146;s target of 70 per cent. employment could be met without any increase in the number of lone parents entering work. While skills and support are vital, messages from the Government also play an important part. Once additional skills have been achieved, with real effort and at some personal cost, the pay rise can be gained and the lone parent is ready to enjoy the fruits of their hard work. However, for some of those women, the loss of help with child care costs, rent and tax credits can mean that they face what I would call a marginal tax rate as high as 96 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o573"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para15"><a name="07072595000548">At the centre of the marginal tax rate is housing benefit. I am bombarded with evidence about how it combines with other sources of income to create a poverty trap for those already in low-paid work. At the centre of that is a 65p in the pound withdrawal rate of housing benefit as income increases. As the Hills report stated, a couple with two children paying a typical private rent of &#163;120 a week&#151;frankly, if &#163;120 a week was the price people were paying for their rent in West Ham, they would think that all their Christmases had  <br>

come at once, but let us stay with the Hills report&#151;would, as a result of reduced benefit and tax credits and a higher rate of national insurance, gain only &#163;23 if their earnings rose from &#163;100 to &#163;400. For those in temporary accommodation with high rents paid through housing benefit&#151;in my constituency, two-bedroom flats can go for more than &#163;1,000 a month&#151;those effects extend to even higher levels. If we are to make serious progress with making aspiration pay in the UK, I believe that the housing benefit regime merits further and urgent investigation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o574"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para16"><a name="07072595000549">Let me reiterate, as I draw to my conclusion, that this legislative programme is ambitious and forward looking.

Such measures can only be improved by this inaugural opportunity to debate the draft legislative programme in advance.</p>

 The hon. Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown) said that it was a privilege to speak in such a debate. She is, of course, right, but it is not a privilege of which many Members have wanted to avail themselves. It is an innovation and I welcome the opportunity to influence the Government&#146;s entire legislative programme. Clearly, though, that has not attracted an enormous number of Members to the House. That might be to do with the hour&#151;it is 9.52&#151;and we are also on the very cusp of the recess. I suspect, however, that it is more than that. I suspect rather that the Government have a credibility gap as wide as the Clyde. I do not think that hon.

The fact that that has not happened suggests to me that, as yet, the Government have not persuaded people that this innovation is meaningful in respect of influencing the Government programme. This debate compares very poorly with a debate on the Gracious Speech, for example, which we would expect to be conducted at a sensible time. Perhaps the Government would like to follow the innovation of the Scottish Parliament and time such a debate, if they truly believe that it is important, at a sensible hour. The Government are going to have to do a great deal more if they are to convince Members that this process is meaningful as opposed to some early window dressing on the part of the new Administration.</p>

We would all accept that it has to develop and improve in the future, but I hope that, after such a cynical start, the right hon.

 I welcome the innovation, but to note the poor attendance of the debate is no more than a fact. There is 33 per cent. of the Scottish National party&#146;s representation in the Chamber this evening. If there were 33 per cent. of the hon.

It will not surprise the Minister to learn that I want to devote a few remarks to that Bill and the Green Paper, and to say how it could be substantially improved. Last week, I was sitting at the British-Irish Council. Some 20 people were around the table representing two sovereign Governments, three devolved Assemblies and Parliaments, and three island groups. Out of those 20, two were members of the Labour party&#151;the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. There were no members of the Conservative party, although the Secretary of State used to be. There were also no members of the Liberal Democrats. That was the result of a self-denying ordinance, as it were, because uniquely the Liberal Democrats have turned down Administration in three Parliaments in the space of the past two months. They turned down the chance of sharing Government and sharing power in Scotland. They then turned down the chance of sharing power in Wales, and I understand&#151;at least I read in the papers&#151;that they turned down a role in Government  <br>

in this place as well. That has resulted in the unique phenomenon of a political party denying itself a role in the British-Irish Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o578"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para20"><a name="07072595000560">None the less, the point remains that out of 20 people representing the various Governments around these islands, only two were members of the governing party in this place; none were members of the Conservative party; and none were members of the Liberal Democrats&#151;in other words, the three parties that dominate this Chamber are in a tiny minority in terms of the configuration of the political geography that has arrived around these islands. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I know that it is difficult for some hon. Members in this place to understand, but there have been changes in government: in Northern Ireland, where a Government have come into being; in Scotland, where simultaneously I am in government and in opposition, which is an interesting process; and in Wales, where there has been a fundamental change in the configuration of the Government. That is a huge change in the political geography of these islands, and I saw nothing in the Government&#146;s Green Paper which persuaded me that they have caught up with that reality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o579"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para21"><a name="07072595000561">For example, way back in 1999 it was envisaged that there would be an organisation of joint ministerial committees to enable the Westminster Government, Ministers and Parliament, the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and, hopefully, the Assembly in Northern Ireland to engage in dialogue on issues of mutual concern. Those joint ministerial committees, certainly in plenary session, have not met since 2002. In terms of the sub-committees, which are part of that process, only one strand of four sub-committees has met over the past five years, and that is the sub-committee on Europe. An arrangement that was brought into being&#151;presumably, I suppose, because it envisaged a situation in which the same party would not be in government in Westminster as was in government in Scotland or Wales&#151;has fallen into total disrepair. It is important that that instrument, or something like it, is brought back into being very quickly. It is disappointing that the Government Green Paper does not address the nature and evolution of the constitutional changes that have already happened and the mechanisms to cope with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o580"><a name="70725-0027.htm_para22"><a name="07072595000562">Other matters are also not addressed in the Green Paper. There is no mention of the British-Irish Council and its potential development. There is no mention of the Act of Settlement, despite the Green Paper&#146;s explicit desire to break down barriers to inclusion within &#147;British society&#148;. There is no mention of the repeal of that Act, which has institutionalised discrimination against many sections of our current society&#151;incidentally, the Scottish Parliament on one occasion unanimously suggested that that Act should be consigned to the dustbin of history. The Green Paper is also almost silent on the West Lothian question and the disquiet felt by many English MPs and a considerable number of people in England at the absence of a forum in which to address specifically English matters and legislation. I do not think that that will be adequately coped with by a system of regional Select Committees. As I have said, there is nothing on the practical mechanisms for improving the functioning of devolved arrangements. It appears that the UK Government want a new relationship between Government and citizen but that that does not extend to examining the relationships between central and devolved Government.</p>

present moment. It is an important finding, which got relatively little publicity in the Scottish press. I am certain that if the finding had been otherwise, it would have got major publicity. It is a finding that makes me proud to be Scottish, and which should give the UK Government cause to reflect on the dangers of looking for identity that does not allow reflective diversity. Some of what is in the Green Paper seems to suggest that the Government are moving down that road.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o591"><a name="70725-0028.htm_para4"><a name="07072595000573">The Prime Minister&#146;s attempt to contrive a new-found sense of Britishness is deeply misguided. The only thing that is absolutely clear is that, after some time of trying, he has been unsuccessful thus far in his attempt. I have no doubt that if anyone in these islands is able to buck the trends that have been taking place in Scotland and elsewhere for a generation and more, it is the current Prime Minister. However, this quest for Britishness&#151;at the very time when Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are moving on a perhaps different path and exploring new avenues of expression, government and society&#151;seems to me backward-looking and misguided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o592"><a name="70725-0028.htm_para5"><a name="07072595000574">I want to draw a contrast between the approach of the Green Paper&#151;which should have been consultative, as Green Papers usually are&#151;and that of the Scottish Government&#146;s forthcoming White Paper. Rather than dictating the answers, my Government will champion the natural evolution of Scottish democracy, and consider sincerely and openly the spectrum of powers that will inevitably flow from this place to the Scottish Parliament. Let me welcome in particular the indication from the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) this evening that he is in favour of a referendum at some point to advance such arguments. I do not know whether that was inadvertent, but it is substantial progress in terms of the dialogue taking place in Scotland. So we will approach our White Paper on the constitution with the conviction that our case for an independent Scotland is the right one, but that the process will also involve genuinely listening to other people&#146;s ideas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o593"><a name="70725-0028.htm_para6"><a name="07072595000575">The Prime Minister has fundamentally misunderstood the situation. Much of Scotland is relaxed about its identity and its future. It is a country comfortable with the inevitability of further constitutional change&#151;change that is bound to repatriate further powers to Scotland. My submission this evening is that Scotland has moved on, Wales is moving on, and Northern Ireland is moving on; it is time that England moved on, as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o595"><a name="70725-0028.htm_para8"><a name="07072610000003">This is not the first time that the office of the Leader of the House has given information for debate at the very last minute. Last week, there was a discussion in Committee of the remit of the Leader of the House, and Committee members did not receive the information that was to be discussed until the morning of that Committee&#146;s sitting. I respectfully suggest that the Leader of the House take note and, in the interests of protecting the welfare and concerns of all hon. Members, rectify the situation in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o596"><a name="70725-0028.htm_para9"><a name="07072610000004">The distinguishing feature of the debate is the sheer audacity of the Government in pretending that they are presenting new policies in their draft legislative programme, when they clearly are not. I suggest that the Government take note of the words of the Minister for the Cabinet Office, the right hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband), who will write Labour&#146;s next election manifesto. Earlier this week, in an interview with <i> The Guardian</i>, he said with reference to the new Prime Minister taking over:</p>
<a name="70725-0028.htm_brev2"><a name="07072610000092"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It requires being very candid about what has gone wrong&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o597"><a name="70725-0028.htm_para10"><a name="07072610000005">As the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House have shown a reluctance towards such candour, let me assist them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o598"><a name="70725-0028.htm_para11"><a name="07072610000006">The brutal truth is that the Government have had a decade to deal with the issues that they speak of in the draft legislative programme, and they have failed to do so. The programme gives new meaning to the word recycling. It is a programme of recycled material. My right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) eloquently made that point when she listed all 23 Bills that have been previously mentioned in the public domain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o599"><a name="70725-0028.htm_para12"><a name="07072610000007">When the Prime Minister spoke of his new measures for building more houses, he should have qualified his words by saying, &#147;As I have previously mentioned, in 1994, 1998, 2005 and 2006.&#148; On education, with reference to young people staying on in education and training, the Prime Minister should have started by saying, &#147;As I said more than a decade ago, in 1996.&#148; The hon. Member for Houghton and Washington, East (Mr. Kemp) emphasised the importance of education, especially in a global market, but in the past 10 years we have seen a rise of 1 million in the number of young people who are not in education, training or work. On fixed rate interest mortgages for 20 or 25 years, the Prime Minister should have started by saying, &#147;As I said four years ago, in 2003.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o600"><a name="70725-0028.htm_para13"><a name="07072610000008">The Bills on those issues, and others in the programme, are nothing more than repetition from the past, with a huge dose of spin added to them. This programme is the result of failure, not success, in the past decade. Let us consider some of the specific issues.</p>

 I have some sympathy with the points that the hon. Gentleman makes, but does he agree that what is really at stake is the process? The issue is whether hon. Members believe that they can influence the Government in this debate. If they thought that, this would be, for obvious reasons, a hugely important parliamentary occasion. It is one thing to say that the Government&#146;s record is abysmal, but what is it about the process in which we are engaged that has not convinced the hon. Gentleman?</p>

 We welcome the process, but we criticise the end product, which will mean that the views of hon. Members will not be taken into account. If the hon. Gentleman would care to listen further, I will come to that point a little later in my speech.</p>

 As encouragement for the right hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) I wanted to point out that we started without any prospect of a separate debate. We had to battle for that and we got it. Clearly, it has not been at an ideal time of day, because other business got in the way and the Government did not organise it very well. The Government have a lot of learning to do and our view is that a good start has been made in theory, but that the practice leaves a lot for delivery.</p>

<p><a name="st_o455"><a name="07072610000014"><a name="70725-0028.htm_spnew6"><a name="07072610000106"><b>Mr. Vara:</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that comment, and repeat that I shall return to the efficacy of the process a little later. For the record, I should clarify that my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead said that she welcomed the debate. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) would do well to make sure that he uses the correct wording in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o601"><a name="70725-0028.htm_para14"><a name="07072610000015">I turn now to some of the specific issues. The Government should take no pride in the fact that they are proposing to introduce the 65th criminal justice Bill since 1997. As the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) said, it is quality not quantity that matters. As for extending the 28-day detention period for terror suspects, the Government should accept that any change should be based not on rhetoric and soundbites but on proper and compelling evidence. So far, that is clearly lacking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o602"><a name="70725-0028.htm_para15"><a name="07072610000016">The draft programme also contains a new health Bill. People all over the country are suffering from hospital closures and cuts in departments&#151;especially accident and emergency and maternity units&#151;so it beggars belief that the Government are still tinkering with our health structure after a decade in power. That is a mark of failure, not success. While I am on matters medical, I commend my hon. Friend the Member Buckingham (John Bercow) on his typically passionate and learned speech. Among other matters, he spoke about the Human Tissue and Embryos Bill, and I have no doubt that he will make a significant contribution to its discussion in this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o603"><a name="70725-0028.htm_para16"><a name="07072610000017">The draft programme is significant in that it highlights what is not included in the list of Bills. In his statement to Parliament on 11 July, the Prime Minister said that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o605"><a name="70725-0028.htm_para18"><a name="07072610000019">That is fine sounding, but if the Prime Minister and his Government genuinely care about what people think, why have they not included a Bill to have a referendum on the European treaty that is currently on the table, even though 86 per cent. of the British public want one? Incidentally, the Government&#146;s closed mind on the matter is further endorsed by the fact that there is still no English version of the treaty. There is a French version, of course, but not an English one. It is bad enough to ignore the views of 86 per cent. of the British public, but it is much worse for the Government seek to stifle debate by not having an English version of the treaty.</p>

Friend the Member for Maidenhead said, the draft legislative programme makes no mention of the proposed reclassification of cannabis, or of the U-turn on super-casinos. Those matters were left to be dealt with by planted questions. It has nothing on prisons, or on the West Lothian question mentioned by the right hon. Member for Banff and Buchan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o607"><a name="70725-0028.htm_para20"><a name="07072610000021">We are told by the Prime Minister and the Government that they will listen to the views of the public and others on various subjects, but our experience so far suggests the contrary. The Government have announced a plan to build 3 million new homes by 2020, but they have ignored the advice that they have already received from their own consultants. They have warned that building so many homes in some areas could increase the danger of flash flooding if land needed for drainage is concreted over.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o609"><a name="70725-0028.htm_para22"><a name="07072610000023">I suggest that she be less judgmental of her critics and pay a little more attention to the advice of experts in the field.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o610"><a name="70725-0028.htm_para23"><a name="07072610000024">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith spoke of first-time buyers and about helping people to get on to the housing ladder. He will be aware that after a decade of Labour government home ownership is actually falling for the first time since figures were published. The hon. Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown) spoke of the need for more social housing and highlighted the fact that there is a 13-year wait for a four-bedroom house. I have to tell her that under 10 years of Labour government less social housing was built every year than in every year of the predecessor Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o611"><a name="70725-0028.htm_para24"><a name="07072610000025">Much has been made of the Government&#146;s desire to consult on the draft legislative programme and to listen to the public, but if a member of the public visits the Cabinet Office website she or he will find that they are restricted to using only 1,000 characters in their response. After taking account of commas, full stops and spaces, that leaves about 150 words. There we have it: the Government want to hear from the public, but only if the response is confined to 150 words.

<p><a name="stpa_o617"><a name="70725-0029.htm_para0"><a name="07072610000038">The right hon. Member for Maidenhead was particularly critical of the fact that a number of the items in the draft legislative programme were already known to her, because they had been in draft Bills, White Papers and Green Papers or because of various consultations. She totally fails to realise that that is not a criticism; it is, in fact, a strength. It shows that the Government are more open and that we are providing opportunities for pre-legislative scrutiny that never existed in the years before we came to power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o618"><a name="70725-0029.htm_para1"><a name="07072610000039">My hon. Friend the Member for Houghton and Washington, East (Mr. Kemp) spoke about how the programme will benefit his constituency. In particular, he talked about the Local Transport Bill and the importance of having high-quality public transport and giving local authorities power and control over the planning of local transport. The powers that will be given to local authorities will improve the quality of transport and enable them to pull together planning for land and for transport. That will make a significant difference to the quality of local transport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o619"><a name="70725-0029.htm_para2"><a name="07072610000040">My hon. Friend spoke about his constituents&#146; problems. His constituency obviously has a significant legacy of heavy industry. He spoke movingly about his constituents&#146; problems with asbestos-related diseases, which the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill will address. It is absolutely clear that only a Labour Government would have taken steps to address that important problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o620"><a name="70725-0029.htm_para3"><a name="07072610000041">My hon. Friend also spoke about the education and skills Bill, the importance of taking a long-term, strategic approach and the difficulty of predicting the way that the economy will develop and therefore the importance of giving people a broad, flexible education as they go through life. I will draw all those points to the attention of the relevant Ministers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o621"><a name="70725-0029.htm_para4"><a name="07072610000042">The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) welcomed the new process, although he said that the timetable was a bit short. It might be appropriate for me also to comment now on the points made by the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara) on the timetable, which he felt was slightly truncated, and on the difficulty of responding to the process. I should like to tell hon. Members that, far from being limited to 1,000 characters on the website, any member of the public who wishes to respond to the legislative programme is free to e-mail the Leader of the House or myself. In fact, this afternoon I received a seven-page e-mail on the draft legislative programme from the Royal National Institute of Blind People.</p>

 Let me just describe to the hon. Gentleman what has been going on, as he seems to be so sceptical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o622"><a name="70725-0029.htm_para5"><a name="07072610000045">The RNIB&#146;s e-mail describes in detail its response to the whole legislative programme. It does not focus on health matters. It looks at transport in particular. Publishing the draft programme now gives it the opportunity to develop that kind of cross-cutting, wide-ranging approach.</p>

I would like to point out that it is this Government who introduced pre-legislative scrutiny, and who doubled the level of resources for parliamentary counsel to ensure that drafting was done properly. The constant complaints from Opposition Members about the clarity of legislation are a slur on the professionalism of parliamentary counsel.</p>

 I am very grateful. The hon. Lady knows that, as I have acknowledged, all the things that she has said are welcome. One thing that would lessen the burden on parliamentary counsel, as well as on everybody else, would be not to introduce in October a Bill that the Government propose to amend substantially in November. Will she and her colleague think again about taking the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill out until it is ready to be put in, so that everybody will be better off and less under pressure?</p>

 I hear what the hon. Gentleman says.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o625"><a name="70725-0029.htm_para8"><a name="07072610000062">The hon. Gentleman said in his speech that the key criterion that he used for judging the quality of legislation was whether it increased liberty and whether it devolved decisions. It was this Government who introduced the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000. In the current Session, we have introduced the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, which does precisely what he is calling for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o626"><a name="70725-0029.htm_para9"><a name="07072610000063">The hon. Gentleman also talked about the possible benefits, as he sees it, of having a business committee of the whole House. In this Chamber, the risk with having a business committee is that it would simply be used to obstruct the legislative programme that people have voted for, and which was in the Government&#146;s manifesto. What he is suggesting is really rather impractical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o627"><a name="70725-0029.htm_para10"><a name="07072610000064">The hon. Gentleman also spoke about the importance of children in care. He is absolutely right: we are concerned, which is why the legislation that we will introduce will enable the voice of the child to be heard, and will improve the quality and stability of placements. The hon. Gentleman said that he wanted to see more Bills in plain English, and that is precisely what we are going to do with the marine Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o628"><a name="70725-0029.htm_para11"><a name="07072610000065">The hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members said that they wanted us to put forward only necessary legislation. That is rather like the position that Opposition parties take on spending cuts and tax cuts. It is very easy to say in general, &#147;Oh yes, we don&#146;t want that piece of legislation,&#148; but not one hon. Member in the whole debate made a single suggestion about what particular measures they did not want to see.</p>

<p><a name="st_o479"><a name="07072610000066"><a name="70725-0029.htm_spnew16"><a name="07072610000130"><b>Mr. Kemp:</b>
 On that point, in the interests of cross-party consensus, does my hon. Friend think that it would be a good idea to invite Her Majesty&#146;s official Opposition to publish an alternative Queen&#146;s Speech, so that we could see what ideological direction the Tory party would take?</p>

<p><a name="st_o480"><a name="07072610000067"><a name="70725-0029.htm_spnew17"><a name="07072610000131"><b>Helen Goodman:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes an excellent suggestion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o629"><a name="70725-0029.htm_para12"><a name="07072610000068">My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) made a typically thoughtful and wide-ranging speech. In particular, he discussed housing need in his constituency.

 I know that I serve in two Chambers, and these days I am a model of consensual government and patience&#151;that patience is being rewarded&#151;but I can only be in government in one Chamber at a time. If the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) wants to transport himself to the Scottish Parliament, I am sure that I will be able to answer all his questions even better than the Deputy Leader of the House is managing to answer them.</p>

 At one point in our discussion on housing, I felt that we were about to move into a full-scale debate on housing policy. The needs of Travellers were raised, and I assure hon. Members that we will introduce legislation to address the security of tenure issues that are of particular concern to that community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o630"><a name="70725-0029.htm_para13"><a name="07072610000073">My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith made a point about planning gain supplement revenues generated in areas covered by a devolved Administration. Let me make it absolutely clear that those revenues will be returned to the country in which they are generated, but their use will be determined by the relevant Administration. He also spoke about the importance of tackling fuel poverty, and I am sure that the energy Bill will help to ensure that energy supply companies focus their efforts much more tightly than they have done hitherto.</p>

<p><a name="st_o485"><a name="07072610000074"><a name="70725-0029.htm_spnew22"><a name="07072610000136"><b>Mark Lazarowicz:</b>
 I would like to go back to my hon. Friend&#146;s previous point; I was not sure whether she was going to say any more about it. My problem is not about whether the money raised by the planning gain supplement will return to the devolved Administrations; it is clearly right that it should. My problem is about ensuring that once it returns to a devolved Administration, it goes a bit further and is passed down to the communities from which it originated. I know that that is a matter for the devolved Parliaments to discuss, and that is fine, but I hope that my hon. Friend will give me an assurance that it is for the majorities in the devolved Parliaments to decide on the matter, and that the decision will not be left to a minority Government with minority support.</p>

<p><a name="st_o486"><a name="07072610000075"><a name="70725-0029.htm_spnew23"><a name="07072610000137"><b>Helen Goodman:</b>
 That issue will have to be taken up elsewhere. My hon. Friend also talked about the importance of having a marine Bill. Through our manifesto, we are committed to introducing a marine Bill, and we will do so in the coming Parliament. We will publish a draft in the coming year, to ensure full pre-legislative scrutiny. He also spoke about the important pre-legislative scrutiny that has just been undertaken on the Climate Change Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o631"><a name="70725-0029.htm_para14"><a name="07072610000076">The hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) spoke about issues that related particularly to women. He considered the Human Tissue and Embryos Bill and asked whether it would present an opportunity for amendments on abortion to be made. He described his views on abortion, which were typically subtle and nuanced. Obviously, whether hon. Members will be able to make amendments is a matter for the House authorities. There has been pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, and I do not at this stage know whether the report from the Joint Committee on the Draft Human Tissue and Embryos Bill will address that question. By chance, the report is being published tomorrow, so the hon. Gentleman will not have to wait long to find out the answer. I caution the hon. Gentleman that the Bill is an extremely important piece of legislation about balancing the ethical and the scientific issues. Abortion is also an extremely important issue, but it may not be entirely helpful for either piece of law to handle them together.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman made it plain earlier that that was his view. He also spoke about the importance of a single equalities Bill. Again, that is a matter on which Labour made a manifesto commitment, and we will produce a draft Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny over the coming year, so that we have a thorough and well-grounded piece of legislation to introduce at a later stage, as time allows. It is particularly pleasant to listen to the hon. Member for Buckingham, who always gives such positive endorsement of the Labour Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o632"><a name="70725-0029.htm_para15"><a name="07072610000079">My hon. Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown) spoke in her usual sensitive but energetic way about the needs of her constituents. She spoke about the problems of housing and homelessness and suggested a number of practical solutions. I know that since she was elected she has been concerned about the structure of housing benefit. We will ensure that the Department for Work and Pensions reads her speech so that it can consider the matter further. My hon. Friend also spoke about counter-terrorism and the importance of making progress on that. I hope she will be satisfied with the way the Prime Minister set out in his statement this afternoon the way in which future consultation will work.</p>

Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) made a somewhat predictable speech dealing with constitutional reform, the West Lothian question, and the state of the devolved Administrations. At no point in his speech did he acknowledge that the devolved Administrations were the creation of a Labour Government. He raised the matter of a joint ministerial committee. The Government are well aware of his calls for the joint ministerial committee to meet, and will consider the proposal.</p>

<p><a name="st_o489"><a name="07072610000081"><a name="70725-0029.htm_spnew26"><a name="07072610000140"><b>Mr. Salmond:</b>
 The Scottish Parliament was established by the Scottish people in a referendum. As for the joint ministerial committee, that was a Labour Government proposal. It was a Labour Govt measure, but has fallen into disuse since 2002. What could be the argument for that mechanism not to be working, instead of falling into disuse? Perhaps the Deputy Leader of the House could think about the argument and give me a little more comfort that, having read my speech in advance, she has considered the point closely enough to be able to give me an answer.</p>

We are able to renew and reform because we understand the challenges of the modern world; that is why we have the groundbreaking and far-sighted Climate Change Bill, and why we are going to have a new scientific and ethical framework through the human tissue and embryos Bill. We are able to renew and reform because our policies are rooted in the values of social justice; that is why we are addressing child maintenance and the needs of children in care.

 I might have cut things a little fine for my question this morning, but I have had ample leisure to repent while waiting for the debate this evening. I am grateful for the opportunity to raise an important issue for many Londoners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o654"><a name="70725-0030.htm_para15"><a name="07072612000034">It is appropriate to raise population statistics compilation in London with the Exchequer Secretary, who earlier today dealt with the motion about the chair of the Statistics Board. There is a link. In the earlier debate, several hon. Members referred to the general population&#146;s lack of confidence in official statistics. I believe that the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) made the point that one of the biggest causes of lack of confidence in official statistics is that they are sometimes demonstrably plain wrong. That is exactly the problem with the methodology that produces the official population statistics for London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o655"><a name="70725-0030.htm_para16"><a name="07072612000035">London Councils, which has been most anxious to hold such a debate, compiled compelling evidence that the methodology that the Office for National Statistics used to calculate the population of London is seriously flawed. Consequently, the official population statistic significantly understates the capital&#146;s population. London Councils has repeatedly raised the matter with the ONS and the previous Treasury team of Ministers without success, hence its desire for a debate, and I am happy to do my best to oblige.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o656"><a name="70725-0030.htm_para17"><a name="07072612000036">Lack of confidence in the London population statistics is not new. Westminster city council eventually successfully challenged the population estimates for its city and borough in the 2001 census, which had to be revised upwards after manifest errors were discovered. It was able to point out precisely what had gone wrong. Regrettably, the position has not improved. For reasons that I shall describe, the current methodology of the ONS is flawed and it now proposes to move to a different methodology, which is equally flawed, as can be demonstrated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o657"><a name="70725-0030.htm_para18"><a name="07072612000037">It may seem an arcane point, but official population statistics are important. They form part of the basis of important forward planning, such as where more homes, schools and health care facilities should go, long-term policy decisions about, for example, where new transport infrastructure should go, and operational decisions about police numbers for each borough and fire service cover. The risk assessment includes population levels and it is therefore important that the statistics are accurate. They are also important because they are part of the formula to allocate Government grant to councils for local services. If they do not reflect where the people who use the services are, resources will not be directed correctly. That leads ultimately to waste. The concern of London Councils, therefore, is that the funding cake for local government should be divided up on the basis of accurate figures, whatever its size. If it is not, the risk is that London might lose out unfairly. I should like to address that issue in a little more detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o658"><a name="70725-0030.htm_para19"><a name="07072612000038">In summary, when London Councils compared the theoretically based estimations of population with detailed work that had been done on the ground in a number of London boroughs, it was able to demonstrate serious underestimation, in particular of the amount of in-migration to the capital. For example, the evidence shows an underestimation of 3,300 people in Enfield and of 2,000 people in Brent, as compared with the number of people who are demonstrably there on the ground in those boroughs. In Newham, it was possible to demonstrate that there were 750 more schoolchildren than were &#147;officially estimated&#148;&#151;the key point is that, unlike the estimates, the schoolchildren are actually there. Similar demonstrations of inaccuracy have been made in Croydon. The problem is not just a London problem. Outside London, Slough has demonstrated an under-calculation of 6,000 people in its population.</p>

<p><a name="st_o502"><a name="07072612000039"><a name="70725-0030.htm_spnew8"><a name="07072612000128"><b>Mr. Andrew Pelling (Croydon, Central) (Con):</b>
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for mentioning Croydon. The borough has also seen a downward revision on the various ONS calculations and assumptions. However, that has come at a time when the number of migrants registered with GPs was more than 37,000 in the five-year period to April 2007 and when the number of national insurance numbers given out from 2002 to 2006 was almost 18,000. I also know from correspondence with the Jobcentre Plus office that national insurance number registrations accelerated to 7,000 in the first 11 months of the following financial year. Places such as Croydon are suffering from problems in their local government settlement, such that the rate at which they are delivering universal services&#151;that is, non-social services and non-education provision&#151;is only a quarter of the rate for other London councils. Does my hon. Friend agree that the figures for migrants are having an impact on the local government financial settlements that councils enjoy?</p>

<p><a name="st_o503"><a name="07072612000040"><a name="70725-0030.htm_spnew9"><a name="07072612000129"><b>Robert Neill:</b>
 They certainly are. My hon. Friend makes a valid point. It is not good enough for the Government to say, for example, that migrants frequently move on quickly. That is not demonstrated by the evidence on the ground and nor does it deal with the point that, for a period, migrants live in London, which is often the first port of call. While they are there, they are using London services, and that has to be met in one way or another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o659"><a name="70725-0030.htm_para20"><a name="07072612000041">It is fair to say that those shortfalls are recognised by other responsible bodies, not just by the London boroughs. I remind the Exchequer Secretary of a piece in <i> The Guardian </i>in April, in which the Home Office Minister responsible for immigration said that</p>
<a name="70725-0030.htm_brev26"><a name="07072612000108"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;at the very least the Office for National Statistics needs to improve its figures on which key local financing decisions are based, but it also means the tough enforcement of immigration laws, including the prosecution of employers of illegal migrants.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o660"><a name="70725-0030.htm_para21"><a name="07072612000042">That is an acceptance by one of the Exchequer Secretary&#146;s colleagues in Government that the ONS needs to improve its act. Referring to the current method of calculating in-migration, which is based on the international passenger survey&#151;a small sample survey of people arriving&#151;the Governor of the Bank of England said last November:</p>

The Mayor has commented on the fact that the Lisson Grove estate, which contributed substantially to his majority when he was a Member of this House, seemed to have disappeared from the census calculations. It is not often that I agree with the Mayor of London, and I could not agree with him on that one.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that this is not a matter of party political tension? It is a shared view across the parties and among independent people across Greater London. Is he also aware that there is a turnover of those registered in constituencies such as mine of between 25 and 40 per cent. a year? The reality is that, unless we have a five-yearly census or, even better, an annual opportunity to count, we will never begin to catch up and accurately measure the numbers in a way that can be reflected in an accurate apportionment of grant by central Government to local government.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. There is consensus on this between all three parties in the Association of London Government, and this view was endorsed by its leaders&#146; committee in its most up-to-date report only a few weeks ago.</p>

All those issues and more depend on getting this right. The criticisms have been well set out and, with respect, it is not good enough for the Government to retreat into the position that they and the ONS have so far adopted, saying that they have used the best available statistics. In this case, the best available statistics are demonstrably wrong.</p>

That represents a 17 per cent. increase on the 2001 base population. It might shock hon. Members to learn that that survey also shows that about 20,000 people arrive at Victoria coach station every week, predominantly from eastern Europe. For at least some of the time after they arrive in the UK, they will be in London.</p>

It is suggested that the labour force survey got nearer to the estimate than the IPS in 2001, but if we go back to 1991, it was the other way round. So there is no guarantee that it is better. In fact, the labour force survey sample is even smaller than the sample used for the IPS. That is crucial, especially as we are to move to three-year local government finance settlements, starting in 2008. It is therefore all the more important that we  <br>

get this right to start with, because the problem will be much more difficult to unpick if we are locked into a three-year settlement on the basis of inaccurate and unreliable figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o666"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para4"><a name="07072612000050">The fault here is that the two methods fail to pick up short-term migrants, to whom I have already referred, or people who live in London for part of the week but are counted as resident elsewhere. Many people live in London for part of the week for their work, not a few of whom are connected to this honourable House, but their family home is regarded as elsewhere, so that is where they live for the purposes of the official population statistics. However, while they are here they use London refuse services, leisure services, street cleansing services, and so on. That is not recognised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o667"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para5"><a name="07072612000051">The figures do not take into account either the very real and well documented effect of population churn in large cities such as London. In the City of Westminster and some other central London boroughs, population churn of about a third&#151;up to 34 per cent.&#151;is well documented. That in turn creates particular costs, because it involves one set of short-term migrants being replaced by another. They are not picked up by the official statistics, but they are nevertheless using local services. The ONS has said that it will publish estimates of short-term migration later in the year, but that will be too late for the start of the three-year financial settlement in April 2008. Much more urgent action is needed, which is why I have raised the issue in the debate tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o668"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para6"><a name="07072612000052">I have set out in some detail what is wrong. London Councils does not want the Government to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate and say that it is all down to the quango&#151;the ONS. The Government have responsibility. What we need to do is accept that current estimates are not working and are not fit for purpose, and accept that there is a lack of clarity and transparency. It is reasonable to ensure that we develop a methodology that is robust, up to date and fit for purpose. There must be proper consultation with local authorities before it is changed&#151;that has not happened so far&#151;and minimum standards of accuracy should be set out on a basis that can be agreed between the Treasury, the ONS and local authorities. Perhaps the incoming chair of the Statistics Board could, with a little push from Ministers, take that into account.</p>

That is the reason for this debate at this late hour&#151;late in terms of the time and of opportunity. We must get things right before the funding settlement cuts in. We contend that the Government cannot abdicate their responsibility on this issue. Ultimately, ONS has to be accountable. So far, regrettably, it has put its head in the sand in the face of compelling evidence. What is needed is for the House and the Government to put pressure on it to accept reality and change things in available ways while there is still time to do so.</p>

the compilation of statistics on London&#146;s population. The hon. Gentleman explained that this is such an important issue because ONS population statistics are used to determine local government funding. Equally, they are used to inform local planning in respect of services for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o670"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para8"><a name="07072612000055">It is precisely because of the importance of these statistics that ONS takes a great deal of care in making them as accurate as possible. ONS is currently involved in ongoing work to improve statistics. I will come on shortly to describe how those statistics are put together, and explain why some of the suggestions about flaws in the methodology are inaccurate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o671"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para9"><a name="07072612000056">I would like to start, though, by talking briefly about how these statistics are used, because the impression is sometimes created that local government funding depends entirely upon population statistics. I will not describe in detail the funding formula used by local government&#151;we are all familiar with it, especially with how it impacts on our own areas&#151;not least because it is the responsibility of the Department for Communities and Local Government rather than the Treasury. However, I will say that it takes account of other factors, such as the ability of local authorities&#146; ability to raise revenue from council tax, alongside the population statistics, which are clearly important in themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o672"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para10"><a name="07072612000057">There is also a process known as damping, which is used to ensure that all local authorities receive a minimum increase in grant, known as the floor. That floor means that even if population statistics were to show the population decreasing in an area, the local authority&#146;s funding would still increase by a reasonable amount.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o673"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para11"><a name="07072612000059">Nevertheless, population statistics are clearly important, and they should be as accurate as possible. As well as being used for local government funding, they are used</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o674"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para12"><a name="07072612000060">to develop and monitor economic and fiscal policy and to understand social change, as well as any policy implications that stem from it. These statistics are calculated as accurately as possible, using a clear and carefully designed methodology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o675"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para13"><a name="07072612000061">One of the challenges for that methodology&#151;it is only part of the task&#151;is to factor in the impact of international migration on population levels. The hon. Gentleman has raised that matter in the House this evening. Migration is largely calculated on the basis of the international passenger survey. We have heard a number of things about the lack of accuracy in the IPS, but I should like to draw attention to areas where it is reasonably robust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o676"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para14"><a name="07072612000062">First, it has been claimed that IPS is restricted to the major airports and that it does not include Victoria coach station, for example, where 20,000 people can arrive. Actually, it sampled 16 airports, 11 seaports and the channel tunnel. Clearly, it does not sample Victoria coach station, but that is simply because coaches from other countries cannot get there without passing through a port or the channel tunnel. The IPS picks up the inhabitants of the coach on its way through to Victoria coach station.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o677"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para15"><a name="07072612000063">Secondly, it is not the case that the international passenger survey&#146;s sampling is carried out only during the working day, as critics have said. There is flexibility in when the sampling can take place, especially to  <br>

include particular flights from particular countries that may arrive early at an airport.</p>

<p><a name="st_o507"><a name="07072612000064"><a name="70725-0031.htm_spnew2"><a name="07072612000133"><b>Robert Neill:</b>
 Will the Minister accept, however, that she is missing an important point? It is important to have accuracy of statistics not just on who is coming into the country through the entry points, but in terms of calculating, for example, local need and grants when people are here. The IPS does nothing to assist in that for the reasons set out.</p>

<p><a name="st_o508"><a name="07072612000065"><a name="70725-0031.htm_spnew3"><a name="07072612000134"><b>Angela Eagle:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is right, and that is why the labour force survey offers extra insight, although I would be the first to say that it is not an actual count of all migrants wherever they are. Even if we could do that and afford to do it regularly, it would still provide only a snapshot of the situation, which, as he said, can be fluid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o678"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para16"><a name="07072612000066">The IPS is more comprehensive than is often suggested, but the ONS is committed to ensuring that population statistics are as accurate as possible. It has been working this year on improving its methodology. Plans to do that were published in April. The ONS has held meetings with a number of users, including some London local authorities, to discuss planned changes. Those meetings have led to refinements to the proposals, which were outlined in material published yesterday. There have been workshops and feedback has been given. I expect the dialogue to continue as changes to the methodology to produce more accurate figures are put into effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o679"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para17"><a name="07072612000067">The improvements that the ONS is making to its methodology make the information more accurate and improve quality. In particular, migration estimates will now draw on the labour force survey in addition to the IPS, which will help to reflect what migrants do after they have entered the country and where they settle. There is some evidence that the IPS may be particularly inaccurate for well-known places such as Westminster, Oxford or Manchester because people often fill in a place that they have heard of when asked about their destination, and that is not always where they end up living.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o680"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para18"><a name="07072612000068">Again, concerns have been raised about aspects of the labour force survey, including the suggestion that it does not take account of people in multi-occupied dwellings. Although it does not take account of people in communal establishments, such as halls of residence, it does cover all types of private households, including those that are in multi-occupied dwellings. While response rates to the survey for multi-occupied dwellings are lower than those for single household dwellings, the weighting of the sample to take account of age, gender and region goes some way to correcting that. There have been improvements and a process of ongoing dialogue with local authorities, including London local authorities. I expect there to be an ongoing liaison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o681"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para19"><a name="07072612000069">The improvements in the methodology improve in particular the regional and local distribution of international migrants in the statistics that the ONS produces. Combined sources of such statistics have strengths that increase the robustness and the likely accuracy of the results, rather than taking the results  <br>

from a single survey. The improved methodology will now be applied to revise population statistics for 2002 to 2005 and to produce 2006 mid-year population estimates, all of which will be released in August.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o682"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para20"><a name="07072612000070">The improvements will not change the trends demonstrated by the existing methodology&#146;s estimates. In particular, figures based on the improved methodology will not show either population or migration levels decreasing. Across England and Wales, the original method showed an increase in population due to long-term international migration. The improved methodology increases that slightly by 28,000. For London, the existing method implied an increase of 396,000 between 2002 and 2005 as a result of long-term international migration. The revised method reduces that increase to 336,000, but that is not the same as saying that migration is decreasing, and it is certainly not saying that the population is decreasing. Instead, the revised figures show that migration to London remains on an upward trend, but at a lower level than the estimates suggested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o683"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para21"><a name="07072612000071">I should re-emphasise that the changes are being made to improve the methodology and accuracy. As well as making the statistics more accurate this year, the ONS has planned further improvements for subsequent years. In particular, an inter-departmental taskforce on international migration statistics was set up in 2006 and has made a number of strategic recommendations for further improvements in the years to 2012. The ONS is already taking forward some of those recommendations, and will publish a full response later in the summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o684"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para22"><a name="07072612000072">The ONS also published a revisions policy earlier this month, setting out the principles for further revisions to population statistics, and it has been working with local authorities and Government Departments to identify how new and existing information sources&#151;such as GP and school registrations&#151;can be used to inform migration estimates and address local issues in population estimation. That goes to the heart of what Members have been talking about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o685"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para23"><a name="07072612000073">However, that is not as easy as it might seem. The statistics published yesterday on national insurance numbers issued to overseas nationals caught the media&#146;s attention and have been mentioned in our debate, but basing population estimates on national insurance numbers could be misleading, as some people apply for them but do not use them, while others need them only for a short period. In other words, national insurance numbers provide an inflow figure, which is not necessarily a net figure, and many of those who applied for national insurance numbers might have already left the country. National insurance numbers do not show the flow out; they only show the flow in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o686"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para24"><a name="07072612000074">That brings me on to my final point, on those who come to the UK only for a short period. The ONS population statistics that I have talked about rely upon the UN definition of a long-term migrant&#151;someone changing their country of usual residence for at least a year. We believe that that is the most appropriate and reasonable definition to use and the most realistic way of accurately determining the population levels in different areas. We recognise that short-term migration is also important, as is churn, but such trends are difficult to pick up on accurately and in a timely fashion without spending one&#146;s whole life getting  <br>

snapshots of an ever-changing situation. That is why I am particularly interested in discovering how we can use other indicators and statistics to get a closer handle on a more disaggregated level on what is happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o687"><a name="70725-0031.htm_para25"><a name="07072612000075">We believe that the annual definition is the most appropriate one to use, but the ONS has been working hard on producing innovative estimates, and will publish national figures later in the year.

national insurance numbers demonstrate only flows in; they do not give us a picture of the net situation, nor do they tell us about flows out. They can be more misleading than useful, even though they have been prayed in aid tonight as indicators.</p>
