 My hon. Friend raises an extremely important point. The guidance to local authorities on how to implement the regulations, and in particular the safeguards for vulnerable claimants, has been set out clearly. Indeed, we have provided comprehensive training and guidance material to local authorities. Like my hon. Friend, I too have been concerned that some local authorities are implementing the regulations differently from other local authorities, so we shall be reissuing the guidance. I want to make it entirely clear, and on the record, that local authorities by no means have to wait for eight weeks before reinstating direct payments to landlords. They can set their own policies in that regard and make direct payments much sooner if they think there is a likelihood that the rent will not be paid by vulnerable claimants.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman needs to check his facts. In fact, 25 per cent. of the broad rental market areas are being reviewed this year; 14 of those reviews will be published quite soon and a further 18 in the next few months, and 25 per cent. a year will be looked at. I have asked the Rent Service to prioritise areas where there was less local consensus and encourage them to involve all local authorities and interested groups, including Members, to make sure that consensus can be reached, precisely to solve the issues that the hon. Gentleman raised. However, I should also like to make it clear that local authorities have at their discretion a pot of money to ameliorate some of the effects case by case. In the vast majority of circumstances when Members have raised cases with me, the local authority has agreed the new boundaries, so the onus is on the local authority to ameliorate any unforeseen circumstances that follow.</p>

In the pathfinder evaluations, it was shown that 96 per cent. of customers had a bank, building society or Post Office account, and a quarter of those had been opened in order for those customers to pay their rent.

 My hon. Friend is right that the local housing allowance has proved quite generous. That is not a bad thing, particularly in the current economic circumstances, but it is right in looking across the whole of Government expenditure that people should not be able to claim in excess of what they pay for their rent. Once the economic circumstances improve, the issue is to be looked at again, and he is right to make that point. Every single person will have their rent paid if it is at or below the LHA level.</p>

 In response to what my right hon.

We need to push more worklessness projects that give people who are on incapacity benefit opportunities to move gradually from benefit into work. As my right hon.

The economy has not been growing for a year, yet most of the Government&#146;s measures to help businesses are only just coming into operation. Unemployment has been growing for well over a year, yet contracts for the flexible new deal have been postponed and the guarantee for young people under the future jobs fund will not come into operation until next January. Today the CIPD says that 40 per cent. of organisations have made contingency plans to make more redundancies over the next 12 months. The Government continuously claimed that Britain was well placed to weather the recession. Are we not now paying for their complacency in lost jobs?</p>

 Quite the opposite. It has been estimated that many of the macroeconomic interventions made over the past year have saved the best part of half a million jobs. The right hon. Lady is entirely wrong to suggest that the flexible new deal has been postponed in any way, shape or form. The Budget put more money into the flexible new deal, rather than otherwise. I repeat: none of these things would happen under her Government, because she cannot commit to the extra &#163;5 billion that is put in through the rapid response service, at pre-redundancy stage, all the way through to what we are doing for people at 12 months. She should listen to her Conservative colleague, the leader of Bradford council, Margaret Eaton, who welcomed the jobs guarantee fulsomely, to the point of embarrassment. I welcome that. I hope that the right hon. Lady&#146;s local council, as well as that of every other hon. Member, will be bidding for the future jobs fund and the guarantee.</p>

What does the Minister project will happen in April 2010, when the basic state pension will go up by &#163;2.40 a week but the prices of food and fuel, two of the core items of expenditure for the poorest pensioners, will no doubt be soaring away at a rate much greater than that?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is quite right. As I said, we are now spending &#163;13 billion more than we would have been spending had we pursued the policies of the previous Administration, and we are particularly targeting that extra spending on the most vulnerable pensioners. Problems with the take-up of benefits apply often not just to pension credit but to housing and council tax benefits, for which people do not necessarily apply, and that is why we have made a key change so that, from October, by making one telephone call pensioners will be able to get not only their basic state pension credit but council tax and housing benefits.

 I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s starting premise is entirely wrong. We are deliberately ensuring that the almost &#163;5 billion we are investing in Jobcentre Plus and employment opportunities goes across the piece.

It is helping people through the more enhanced packages for those with three months&#146; unemployment, six months&#146; unemployment&#151;packages to which all long-term unemployed people will be referred from June and October and beyond&#151;and 12 months&#146; unemployment.</p>

That is precisely what is happening. There is no reason at all to suggest that the FND will be introduced at any time other than in October, as planned.</p>

 The reason why we are making these changes is, in a sense, to simplify the overall system.

 The reduction in interest rates is clearly having a serious impact on pensioners&#146; income from savings, but the problem is aggravated for those on pension credit as a result of the official assumption that for every &#163;500 over the threshold, a pound a week in interest is generated. That works out in the calculations as an annual rate of 10.4 per cent., which is clearly well detached from reality. Is there nothing we can do in these particularly difficult times to reform that assumption, which has essentially been inherited from previous Administrations&#151;in the plural?</p>

 First, the assumption made in respect of the tariff income has never had anything to do with interest rates. It was laid down in legislation. We changed the position so that instead of assuming a pound for every &#163;250 of savings, which was the case under the previous Administration, we make that assumption for every &#163;500. We reduced the upper limit so that people could go much higher up the scale before they started to pay. In the recent Budget, following representations from hon. Members and a number of charities and organisations representing older people, we have changed the amount at which people have to start making a contribution from &#163;6,000 to &#163;10, 000.</p>

 All that is rooted in precisely what we are doing with the &#163;5 billion of extra investment.

However, the hon. Lady has made a fair point, and I take it seriously. Given the present downturn, we are ensuring that Jobcentre Plus is learning all the time, and that it treats people differently if, for instance, they have a history of 15 or 20 years&#146; successful employment or come from backgrounds or professions that make them unaccustomed to using its services.</p>

 Members will be aware of the unauthorised disclosure of material relating to their allowances, which has appeared in the press on Friday and over the weekend. This has caused great public concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o3"><a name="90511-0003.htm_para0"><a name="0905118000143">Leaving aside the legal aspect, to which I shall return in a moment, the House has to make serious change to the system of allowances. Right hon. and hon. Members will know that we have been working to new rules from 1 April. We also know that there will be further changes, with proper, independent audit assurance. But working to the rules and the rules alone is not what is expected of any hon. Member; it is important that the spirit of what is right must be brought in now. We are also setting up an operational assurance unit with independent oversight to secure the proper handling of claims. This will be operating very shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="90511-0003.htm_para1"><a name="0905118000144">To return to the legal aspect, the Clerk of the House immediately sought advice. He was advised that there was no real basis for seeking an injunction but that there was some basis for considering that a criminal offence or offences may have been committed. As right hon. and hon. Members will know from a communication that they received on Friday afternoon, he accordingly referred the matter to the Commissioner of the Metropolitan police. I can understand hon. Members&#146; concerns about the revealing of details of bank accounts, style of signature and verbal passwords and their concern that an individual who may have sold the data is also capable of selling this information further. That is why the police have been informed. I am also writing to the publisher of the newspaper, drawing this fact to their attention and reminding them of the serious security implications if personal data that might expose Members and others to risks to their safety were to be published. The letter will be copied to all national newspapers.</p>

The allegations&#151;I emphasise that they are allegations&#151;are that that information was handed over to a third party in order to find the highest bidder for private information. If I do not ask, or rather if the Clerk of the House does not ask, for the police to be brought in, we are saying that that employee should be left in situ with all the personal information of every hon. Member, including the hon. Lady&#146;s own information and that of her employees. Let me say that anyone who has looked at their own un-redacted information can see that the signatures of employees are exposed, that private ex-directory numbers are exposed and that passwords&#151;telephone passwords&#151;are exposed. I just say to the hon. Lady that it is easy to say to the press, &#147;This should not happen,&#148; but it is a wee bit more difficult when you have to do more than just give quotes to the <i> Express</i>&#151;or the press, rather&#151;and do nothing else; some of us in this House have other responsibilities, other than just talking to the press.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I am all in favour of owning up and apologising when we are in the wrong, but would it be in order to inquire whether the House authorities should be a little more robust in responding to the many falsehoods that have been written about our use of the allowances? On 4 April, a Mr. Ian Cowie wrote an article in the financial section of <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> in which he falsely suggested that we were all pocketing the office costs allowance, that we are subject to special tax treatment and that, on average, each of us owes the Inland Revenue &#163;54,000 in tax a year.

After Mr. Cowie&#146;s article appeared, I contacted a senior official of the House and suggested that he issue a rebuttal, only to be told that it is not your policy to respond to falsehoods of this nature. Is that the case, Mr. Speaker? If so, would you reconsider, because we are in a climate now where any nonsense can be written about anybody, and it is dragging us all down?</p>

Just remember that it was less than a year ago&#151;on 3 July&#151;that the House of Commons Commission put a report before this House, in which some of the problems that we have got today were examined and rejected, so it is wrong for him to say that the House of Commons has done nothing, but I answered his point in my statement in any case.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Yet again, our capital city has been brought to a standstill by a bunch of demonstrators who have, in effect, occupied Parliament square for about six weeks. I have raised the matter with you before. Although it is true that Members have had access, albeit not to the main entrance of the House&#151;we have had restricted access&#151;there are nevertheless hundreds of thousands of people out there going about their business, who have had their business lives and their personal lives disrupted by the demonstration, at enormous cost to them and their businesses, as well as inconvenience. I know that the Metropolitan Police Commissioner has had added to his list of things to do that which you asked him over the weekend to do, but I have raised the matter with you before. It is surely unacceptable that these people should be allowed to take over Parliament square and disrupt the entire centre of our capital city. I wonder what on earth the Metropolitan Police Commissioner is doing about it, bearing in mind that every police officer to whom I have spoken has made it clear to me that it is his view that the Commissioner will take no action, because after the G20 they are completely frit of doing anything for fear of ending up in court themselves.</p>

It is also necessary for society: a more equal society is more cohesive and at ease with itself than one marred by prejudice and discrimination. So this Labour Government are, like other Labour Governments before us, a champion of equality.</p>

It is backward societies that are marred by discrimination against lesbians and gay men, where women are expected to know their place and which are bound by rigid hierarchies.

I consider that discrimination against the vast majority of my constituents who left school at 16 without being able to speak Polish.

Despite women forming half the work force, men still earn on average 22 per cent. an hour more than women. We do not accept that that is because women work 22 per cent. less hard or are 22 per cent. less intelligent or 22 per cent. less qualified than men. It is pay discrimination, which is mostly a legacy of the idea that a woman&#146;s job is less important than a man&#146;s, because her main role is in the home.

 I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend. Does she agree that if the general public are watching the debate they will be surprised to see the Opposition so agitated at the prospect of equality legislation? The point about equality is not just that it offers fairness and justice for every group in society, but that in a globalised economy it will actually enable us to compete better and be a stronger and more effective society.</p>

<p><a name="st_o160"><a name="0905118000222"><a name="90511-0005.htm_spnew9"><a name="0905118000639"><b>Ms Harman:</b>
 I could not agree more strongly with my hon. Friend. Although the lion&#146;s share of caring for children and older relatives still falls to women, women&#146;s income is now vital for their household, and their work is important to the economy, too. It is simply unfair that they should not be paid the same as men for the work that they do. Unequal pay is not the fault of the woman; it is the responsibility of the employer, yet in the past, it has been entirely down to the individual woman to complain, and never down to the employer to explain.</p>

 Will my right hon. and learned Friend assure me that the Bill will finally ban secrecy or gagging clauses, used by firms and companies around the country, that allow and encourage firms to discriminate against women when setting their pay rates?</p>

<p><a name="st_o162"><a name="0905118000224"><a name="90511-0005.htm_spnew11"><a name="0905118000641"><b>Ms Harman:</b>
 Yes, I can reassure my hon. Friend that the Bill will do exactly that. A veil of secrecy over pay allows discrimination to flourish. The Bill will change that by means of a power in clause 73 to require employers to make a gender pay report every year. Fair employers have nothing to fear, but unfair employers will have nowhere to hide. Knowledge is power for employees, their unions, consumers, and shareholders. I hope that employers will compete for the reputation of being fair to their women employees. It is not a burdensome requirement; employers know whom they employ, whether their employees are men or women, and what they pay them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="90511-0005.htm_para4"><a name="0905118000225">The public sector will lead the way, with the Bill providing a power in clause 147 to require all public sector employers with more than 150 employees to publish annually details of their gender pay gap. However, 80 per cent. of employees are in the private sector, and gender pay discrimination there is even greater. The Equality and Human Rights Commission will bring together employers and unions to work out how gender pay reporting will operate in practice. In July this year, it will begin to consult, and it will release the first of its annual reports before the end of this year.</p>

 No, it will not. We would like to achieve our aim through voluntary action, but if we cannot, we must take a power in the Bill to make sure that we can force companies to be prepared to acknowledge their pay gap. In the first instance, we will ask private sector employers to report without a legal requirement, but because all employers must do so for the system to be  <br>

<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>11 May 2009 : Column 557</b><br>
fair, we will impose the legal requirement on all employers of more than 250 people in 2013 if sufficient progress on reporting has not been made. We hope that it will not be necessary to do so, but if there has not been sufficient openness, we will use that power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="90511-0005.htm_para5"><a name="0905118000228">Transparency is important in itself, and in every workplace where there is a yawning gap between the pay of men and the pay of women, it will spur employers to reflect on their practice and take action to change what they do. As a further measure for openness on gender pay discrimination, the Bill will ban secrecy clauses that prevent employees from discussing their pay with their colleagues, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown) asked. An estimated one fifth of employers impose secrecy clauses; those clauses will all be banned.</p>

 I am extremely grateful to the Leader of the House for giving way, because she knows that I have been a long-term supporter of many of the aims that she mentions. Does she share my view that the Government should have done more to lead by example, and does she share my concern that the gender pay gap in a number of Government Departments is far too high? In fact, it is as high as 25 per cent. in five Departments. Surely the Government should have done more to lead by example and to put their own house in order.</p>

 That is why we have acted to bring transparency not only to the private sector but to the public sector. So long as the problem remains hidden and is swept under the carpet, everybody says, &#147;We&#146;re equal; it must be somebody else who is not,&#148; and we cannot address it. I should be grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s support not only on Second Reading but in Committee and throughout the Bill&#146;s passage. I know that he is concerned about age discrimination, too, so I thank him for his support on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90511-0005.htm_para7"><a name="0905118000232">Equality for women is a public policy imperative, and that is why in 2006 we brought in the gender equality duty, which requires public bodies to tackle discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity. The duty has proved to be a lever for change, but the Bill makes it clear that the new public sector equality duty, which the Bill provides for, will apply when public bodies not only employ people or provide services, but use their &#163;175 billion purchasing power. The duty will apply to public procurement, too. The provision will enable us to take the current duty further into those organisations and companies providing goods and services that are funded by the public purse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90511-0005.htm_para8"><a name="0905118000233">I turn to the issue of positive action, which many Members have mentioned. We will allow employers to use positive action in recruitment and promotion. The purpose of the new power is to tackle the systemic and well-documented glass ceiling that stops women from going up the career ladder in organisations. That is why the Bill includes the power to take positive action. Sometimes a company has many women in its work force, but no women on its management team. Currently, if a vacancy arises and the employer is faced with two equally qualified candidates, one a man and one a woman, the employer cannot actually say, &#147;Right, we&#146;ve got two equally qualified people for this job, but I&#146;m  <br>

However, the proportion of women MPs from all parts of the House is still only 19 per cent., and that is why clause 100 extends to 2030 permission for political parties to use women-only shortlists. The Government are proud to have three times more women MPs than all the other parties put together. That is because we have used all-women shortlists, and we will continue to do so.

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="90511-0005.htm_para13"><a name="0905118000247">I am sure that the whole House will agree that, in this day and age, it is not acceptable that places exist where women can be treated as second-class citizens. Part 7 will outlaw private members&#146; clubs discriminating against their women members. So, down at the golf club, every day will be &#147;ladies day&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="90511-0005.htm_para14"><a name="0905118000248">I turn to how the Bill will tackle discrimination against older people. In 2007, pensioners outnumbered children for the first time, and in just 20 years&#146; time half the adult population will be over 50. Today we can expect to live a quarter of our lives in retirement. That is a seismic demographic change, and it demands action to tackle the prejudice that still constrains older people. Our ban on age discrimination in the workplace in 2006 was important, but we need to go further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="90511-0005.htm_para15"><a name="0905118000249">Older people are being discriminated against by those providing goods and services. We all know of examples of that from constituents&#146; complaints. For instance, a constituent of mine came to see me after he had booked a holiday to go and see his daughter in the United States. He had arranged travel insurance for &#163;175 and then had to postpone the holiday for a fortnight because his daughter was ill. During that time, he had his 70th birthday and the insurance went up from &#163;175 to &#163;831. He simply could not afford to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="90511-0005.htm_para16"><a name="0905118000250">The Bill will prohibit such unjustifiable age discrimination in the provision of goods and services. It will mean that an insurance company will not be able to discriminate arbitrarily against older people. We will outlaw the discrimination and unfairness that still persists against older people in social care and in the national health service. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health has initiated a national review led by the South West strategic health authority to look at how to implement the ban on age discrimination in health and social care, so that we can be sure that, whether treatment for mental illness or back pain is involved, older people get care every bit as good as that for younger people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="90511-0005.htm_para17"><a name="0905118000251">As the Bill goes through the House, we will consult on how the measure will be put into practice. The new provision will not prevent the justifiable preferential treatment of older people, such as free bus passes or cheaper ticket prices for pensioners.</p>

 As one who opposes all forms of discrimination, I have a lot of sympathy with the right hon. and learned Lady&#146;s point about age discrimination. However, will the Bill have any unintended consequences? Saga, for example, provides lots of great services for people over 50. Will its operations have to cease? Lots of older people get cheaper car insurance by virtue of the fact that they are older. Will that now end? There may be unintended consequences.</p>

 I am glad that the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="90511-0005.htm_para20"><a name="0905118000260">It is important to consider not only those who are older but the position of the growing number of people who care for an older relative. For most people, the care they get from their family is every bit as important as the care they get from health or social services, if not more so. The Bill will outlaw discrimination against carers. Most people who are caring for a relative also go out to work. So the woman who applies for a promotion at work will no longer be allowed to be told, &#147;Sorry&#151;we&#146;ve given the promotion to someone else because we know you have your hands full looking after your elderly mother.&#148; We will back up people who are doing the important work of caring for children and older and disabled relatives as well as going out to work.</p>

Although there are various public service agreements and targets across government to that effect, the approach has been piecemeal, not comprehensive, as it will be now.

That is what we have got so far. However, it is important for those who have rights to be able to know them and for those who have responsibilities to be able to understand them without having to pay a lawyer to interpret them.

gender pay gap which will impose unnecessary costs on business whilst failing to solve the problem, fails to implement proposals on compulsory pay audits for those organisations which are found guilty of discrimination by an employment tribunal, gives Ministers the power to amend the Act by order instead of leaving this to Parliament, and allows discrimination in recruitment and promotion decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="90511-0006.htm_para14"><a name="0905118000294">I thank the Minister for Women and Equality for bringing this Bill before the House, and we look forward to debating it with her and other hon. Members during the coming weeks and months. Indeed, I am tempted to say that this Bill has been so long in the making that I am sure I am not alone in the feeling of d&#233;j  vu that I have in speaking about it today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="90511-0006.htm_para15"><a name="0905118000295">I absolutely believe that fairness and equality of opportunity should be rights of every single individual in this country. Discrimination, unfair treatment and imposed disadvantage are wrong, and as politicians we should strive to stamp them out. However, the Bill and the Minister&#146;s speech have made it clear that we come at this issue from different perspectives, and that is why we have tabled our amendment today, on which I shall comment in detail later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="90511-0006.htm_para16"><a name="0905118000296">In the four years since the Government first pledged to introduce an Equality Bill in their 2005 manifesto, we have had false starts, empty announcements and more delays than I care to remember, so all credit to the Minister for having the staying power to stick with it. The Bill must be a labour of love for her and I am sure that hon. Members will agree that we can see her fingerprints over many of the provisions. When the right hon. and learned Lady made a statement to the House explaining the intention of the Bill, I welcomed it. We continue to welcome the fact of the Bill and I am pleased that the Government are using it to consolidate existing legislation and simplify the guidance given to businesses and other organisations. We welcome many parts of the Bill and we will be willing to work with the Government to ensure that they get on to the statute book.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="90511-0006.htm_para17"><a name="0905118000297">I must confess that I had really high hopes for this Bill, but despite the fact that the Minister has had ample time to hone it to perfection, the overwhelming sense that one gets on reading it is of an enormous missed opportunity. The Government had the opportunity to put together a meaningful and significant piece of legislation with fairness and common sense at its heart, but by including unworkable and overly bureaucratic proposals, they have undermined the benefits of the Bill and caused us to have serious misgivings about its probable outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="90511-0006.htm_para18"><a name="0905118000298">We must also address the fact that the environment in which we now find ourselves giving this Bill its Second Reading is vastly different from that in which it was first envisaged four years ago. The country is in deep recession, unemployment is soaring and businesses are struggling to stay afloat. I am on record as having said on many occasions that equality is not just something for the good times, but the Government have shown a complete lack of awareness of the changed conditions. Equality matters whatever the economic climate, but I am sure that Ministers would agree that we should be trying to work with business to develop equality policies that are not unnecessarily onerous or costly. I believe that there are ways we can champion fairness without penalising employers.</p>

the Government need to do, but have so far failed to do and show little sign of doing now, is to tackle the root causes of inequality: family breakdown, poor education, and worklessness. To push the responsibility on to local authorities is to duck the issue, and it will achieve nothing. People&#146;s lives will not be changed by the provisions in the Bill, but Ministers will no doubt feel that they have fulfilled their obligations.</p>

Surely the Minister does not believe that the provisions in part 1 will change their lives by making new opportunities available to them and lifting them out of poverty. Sadly, in the past 12 years, this Government have failed to grasp the fundamental truth that just passing a law or setting a target will not change things. It takes more than that, as the 4 million children and 7.5 million adults living in poverty right now can tell them. I hope that the Government intend their forthcoming child poverty Bill to do rather more than this Bill does.</p>

year ago, and my colleague in the other place, Baroness Morris of Bolton, has a private Member&#146;s Bill in progress. After the comments made in the other place when that Bill was debated, I was hopeful that this Equality Bill would include our proposals to address the gender pay gap, which would mean that we could work with the Government. Sadly, however, the proposals in this Bill are clumsy and ill judged. In four years&#146; time, the Government will have the power to demand that every private sector company with more than 250 employees carries out a compulsory pay audit, regardless of whether or not it has a record of discrimination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="90511-0007.htm_para3"><a name="0905118000321">By the way, there is clearly one law for the public sector and another for the private sector. There are no provisions in the Bill that would have a similar effect on public sector bodies, even though the pay gap in the public sector is far from satisfactory. Our own policy, the Conservative party policy, would compel only companies found guilty of discrimination by an employment tribunal to carry out a pay audit&#151;a punishment for those that have offended and a deterrent for those that might. Our proposal is fair and measured; the Government&#146;s is heavy-handed and obstinate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="90511-0007.htm_para4"><a name="0905118000322">The Leader of the House and Minister for Women said last week:</p>

I think that this proposal shows the Minister&#146;s complete lack of empathy for the situation in which many businesses find themselves. Adding another burden that will be costly and time consuming when many are struggling to stay afloat and keep people in jobs at all is completely insensitive. Even the Business Minister, the noble Baroness Vadera, has warned businesses not to be distracted by the Equality Bill, so I suggest that she, too, does not feel entirely comfortable with its proposals.</p>

We do not know exactly what information the companies are going to be publishing, as that will be a matter for the Equality and Human Rights Commission to determine in due course. The Bill may not therefore have the impact that my hon. Friend believes it will. I do not believe that company pay audits will have the desired impact. What is important is ensuring that we have a system under which people can take discrimination cases to a tribunal and if companies are found guilty of discrimination in individual cases, action will&#151;unlike at the moment&#151;be required of them.

She made a point that she has made many times before about the difference between the numbers of women on the Conservative and the Labour Benches in the House, and the importance of all-women shortlists in having delivered the current number of women Labour Members of Parliament. I repeat what I have said on many occasions in the past: we support the extension of the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The Solicitor-General says, from a sedentary position, that we are not going to use it. That suggests that the Solicitor-General does not understand what the legislation does. What it does is enable political parties to use positive action of a variety of sorts. It is what has enabled us to introduce our priority list. It is not necessary for a political party to start imposing all-women shortlists under that legislation.</p>

 As I was about to tell the House, if the Conservative party wins the next general election by only one seat, the number of women Conservative Members will increase from 17 to 55. The issue for the Labour party is that some of those women will have defeated Labour women. The issue for the House is that the overall number of women in this House may not rise as a result of that increase in the number of Conservative women Members.</p>

 I am most grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way. Just for the record, is she aware&#151;I suspect she is&#151;that my own seat, from which I retire at the next general election, is to be split in two, and as a result of the well-conceived A-list system that we have come up with, there are to be two candidates who are both of very high quality, one of whom is a man, while the other, who will be my MP in the future, is a woman?</p>

One example that is often given on the wider issue of positive action and its use is that in circumstances where a primary school that has only female teachers has a job vacancy for which there are two candidates of equal merit, one of whom is a man and the other a woman, the head teacher or school governors could be allowed to appoint the man in order to address the imbalance in the work force. That must only be allowed as a tie-breaker in situations where there are two genuinely equally qualified candidates. In such circumstances, I would be happy to support the proposal to allow companies to take into account the diversity of a work force when making appointments, so long as that applied only where there are two candidates of equal merit&#151;although I suspect that it might be hard to find many circumstances in which the candidates were genuinely absolutely equally qualified.</p>

What exactly will be required of a company in order to demonstrate that it is meeting acceptable equality levels? Indeed, how are acceptable equality levels to be defined, and who will define them? We all agree that there needs to be fairness in the business world and that the public sector should always take care in procurement, but as the Government have spent so much time preparing the Bill, we expected more detail. Given the concerns raised by the Glover review about small businesses and procurement, we need to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck so that equality flourishes in our business sector, but without placing unfair burdens on small companies.</p>

That reflects the way in which the debate about equality and diversity is increasingly a mainstream and not a minority issue. There are a few key points that I want to make, but I shall start with a quick reflection on just how far we have come.</p>

<p><a name="st_o248"><a name="0905118000374"><a name="90511-0008.htm_spnew3"><a name="0905118000727"><b>Mr. Goodman:</b>
 The right hon. Lady refers to the briefings that she had received, which gives me a chance to raise the matter that my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) did not have time for me to raise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="90511-0008.htm_para7"><a name="0905118000375">The briefing from the Roman Catholic Bishops conference states:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="90511-0008.htm_para8"><a name="0905118000376">I assume this is a reference to the competing claims of the so-called faith lobby and the so-called gay lobby. Does the right hon. Lady believe that the bishops conference has a point, and if so, how can these tensions be resolved?</p>

<p><a name="st_o249"><a name="0905118000377"><a name="90511-0008.htm_spnew4"><a name="0905118000728"><b>Ms Hewitt:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman raises an extremely interesting point. There is no doubt that there are occasions when there are competing rights. I dealt with that as Minister for Women when we were considering, for instance, the introduction of laws against religious discrimination and laws against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in employment. We arrived at, I believe, the right compromise in those two separate strands of legislation. I assume, although I have not checked the detail, that that is reflected in the new Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="90511-0008.htm_para9"><a name="0905118000378">That was one of the reasons I came to the view that we needed a single Equality and Human Rights Commission in place of the three predecessor bodies. Where there are conflicting rights&#151;and sometimes there will be&#151;a body is needed that can work within a broader framework, including the broader human rights framework, to help society as a whole, as well as the courts and the House, to resolve those conflicts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="90511-0008.htm_para10"><a name="0905118000379">To illustrate how far we have come, I recall, as another young campaigner for equality legislation 35 years ago, just how dismal the situation was. This morning I had the pleasure of joining an excellent organisation, Working Families. We were looking at which employers to include in our top 20 list of organisations that are helping families to balance work and caring responsibilities. What I found would have been unthinkable 35 years ago, and pretty extraordinary even 15 or 20 years ago&#151;over and over again, organisations saying that more than 90 per cent. of women who take maternity leave, which is much longer than it was, say, 20 years ago, are returning to work, often with a change in their working arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="90511-0008.htm_para11"><a name="0905118000380">Over and over again, organisations were saying that the right to request different working hours was not limited to those covered by our current laws, but had been extended to everybody, and even on that basis more than 90 per cent. of requests were granted. Those are just a few examples of the huge strides we have made.</p>

single equality commission. On balance, I think that has been right, but will she concede that in these discussions&#151;it has been rather under-represented in the debate so far&#151;we need to be very sensitive to the needs of disabled people, because the nature of their position, the remedies for their position and any discrimination against them might be somewhat different in kind from the digital situation that exists as to whether there is racial discrimination or gender discrimination?

 I strongly agree with the hon. Gentleman. I do not think there would be much disagreement in any part of the House. We carefully considered that in setting up the single equality commission, and I know that the commission takes it extremely seriously.</p>

 I agree with everything that the right hon. Lady has said so far. Does not the example that she has so eloquently given about her meeting Working Families this morning suggest that the current situation is working well, based on the Equality Act 2006, and therefore does not require the micromanagement that the Government now propose?</p>

 I disagree with the hon. Lady on that point for the reasons so eloquently expressed by the Minister for Women and Equality. The point that I wanted to make about the right to request flexible working and, more broadly, work-family balance is that the new challenge we face is how employers can make it much easier and more normal for men to vary their working hours so that they can play the full part in bringing up their children, or caring for elderly or disabled relatives, that so many would like to play but find difficult to achieve at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="90511-0008.htm_para12"><a name="0905118000385">I especially welcome certain aspects of the Bill. The new public sector duty is part of a very welcome simplification of the law. My right hon. and learned Friend, in illustrating the need for simplification, could have mentioned the appalling number of volumes now required to deal with case law on all the different strands of legislation. Having a single public sector equality duty, rather than a series of separate duties, will allow the Department of Health&#151;my old Department&#151;and the NHS to take a single view of the challenges they face and the opportunities they have to combat inequality. For instance, Departments could look at the real challenge they still face in achieving the proper representation of women in more senior positions. They might consider advertising almost all jobs on a flexible rather than a full-time basis&#151;a suggestion specifically made by Working Families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="90511-0008.htm_para13"><a name="0905118000386">I equally strongly support My right hon. and learned Friend on the measures on positive action. Clarity is badly needed in that area. When I was a governor of my children&#146;s primary school, we found it almost impossible to recruit men into the classrooms, even though we badly wanted more men to teach those young children, especially in a community in which so many children were growing up without the active presence of their father in their family.</p>

diversity in its work force or on its board&#151;solicits applications from well qualified people within the underrepresented group. Perhaps the Minister will address that point when she winds up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="90511-0008.htm_para15"><a name="0905118000388">The third aspect that I warmly welcome is the proposed new duty on public sector organisations to consider how they can narrow the gap between rich and poor. I referred to the work I had done as Minister for Women and as Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in making proposals for a single Equality and Human Rights Commission. In the end, the factor that most led me to the conclusion that we needed a single body was the fact that&#151;whatever the actual legal position&#151;some groups felt completely left out of the law and the debate on diversity and equality. In particular, white men&#151;especially white working class men&#151;simply did not see themselves represented or reflected in the equality and diversity debate. Yet we all know very well&#151;I certainly know this from my constituency&#151;that school results, for example, show that white working-class boys are typically most likely to leave school without anything resembling the skills and competences that they need to open up opportunities in the modern world.</p>

That includes utterly crass forms of discrimination, such as the woman who telephones or tells her employer that she is pregnant only to be told, practically in the next breath, that she has lost her job.

Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) about caste discrimination, because it is certainly the belief of Caste Watch UK that the current law does not adequately protect those in south Asian or, indeed, other communities who find themselves discriminated against on those grounds. I understand that the UN human rights convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination prohibits discrimination on five grounds: race, colour, national or ethnic origin, or descent. Of course, the UK ratified the convention in 1969, but I do not believe that our existing law, or indeed the Bill, is as explicit on that point as, for instance, the legislation in Australia.

How much inequality will be eradicated? My overall sense is that the Bill does not go far enough and that the length of time it has taken to reach the Floor of the House does not seem adequately reflected in the final product or the urgency to be given to some of the provisions, given the scale of inequality that the Leader of the House briefly outlined.</p>

Sixty-two per cent. of over-50s believe they have been turned down for a job because of their age, and six in 10 lesbian or gay schoolchildren experience homophobic bullying.

I would like to address some concerns of a general nature. An awful lot of very important things will not be in the Bill. A lot of powers are being left to Ministers, and powers to amend decisions&#151;on, for example, exceptions regarding age discrimination in the provision of goods and services, multiple discrimination and how equal pay should be measured&#151;are being kicked into the long grass.</p>

That is the one into which we are born, and we have very little chance of changing that. The Liberal Democrats have long argued, in this Chamber and elsewhere, that poverty and inequality are intrinsically linked. In nearly three decades of Thatcherite and new Labour Governments, Britain has steadily become a less equal and less fair society. Under this Labour Government, rates of social mobility have fallen. A person born into a poor family now is more likely to remain poor throughout their adult life than a person born 30 years ago. Educational chances are almost entirely correlated to social class, which means that children&#146;s prospects are set before they even reach school.</p>

Inequality is at its highest level since records began&#151;and that is under a Labour Government. The Government should have introduced measures to tackle stubborn, worsening inequality 10 years ago, and they should not have done so in a last-minute, throwaway clause, even though it has been put at the start of the Bill. It muddies the water; it has been jumbled into a Bill that was intended to unify, clarify and strengthen existing legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="90511-0009.htm_para3"><a name="0905118000411">The Government should have made legislative proposals to tackle socio-economic inequality in a Bill of its own, given the vital importance of narrowing the equality gap. It is the right aim, but the wrong vehicle and the wrong means. It is just a very weak measure. In some ways, the proposal in the Bill is no different from saying that when our taxes are spent by public bodies, those bodies should bear in mind whether they are damaging our environment in how they spend those taxes. It makes sense to think about the wider implications of how money should be spent. If we can use it to address and tackle more than one issue, and to achieve more than one goal, that is even better news, as it is more value for money in cash-strapped times, but the way in which the duty is laid out in the Bill is, I fear, simplistic and unfair. Its wording is broad enough to attract controversy, worry, and legal argument, but too weak to have much of a real impact or really address the equality gap, which is widening and damaging to all of us.

order? I am sorry that the Government have backed away from mandatory pay audits. What the Government propose is not a pay audit at all, but simply a statement of average pay by gender, without any context to make it truly meaningful. My goodness, the Government clearly understand the benefits of openness and transparency, because they rightly seek to end the mystery that shrouds pay by prohibiting firms from issuing gagging orders that require a vow of silence from their staff. However, they fall short of requiring a real pay audit that would evaluate the quality and nature of the work being done and then be published.</p>

That is the point: what is exposed to public scrutiny will concentrate the mind. The main benefit of such an audit, however, is that it becomes a tool for the individual who has no idea what the pay scales are and who gets what. In seeing what is what, the individual will be able to decide whether she or he is being discriminated against, and they will have the evidence and knowledge to take their case forward.</p>

The Government&#146;s hand may be forced if businesses do not change their ways, but the Bill deals only with those private sector firms that have 250 staff or more, representing 0.5 per cent. of the whole sector. As the Leader of the House pointed out, 80 per cent. of people work in the private sector, so the Bill is unlikely to right many of the wrongs ensuring that, economically, women continue to be second-class citizens.</p>

We are also disappointed that, on legal protection against pay discrimination, the Government have not introduced hypothetical comparators for equal pay claims, because that continues the disparity between the way in which different types of discrimination are dealt with. We will therefore push the Government in Committee to have the courage of their convictions.</p>

We will table an amendment to introduce a name-blank application that would apply to all written applications to work. Just as children are given an exam number to put on their exam papers so that there is no recognition, prejudice or unfairness, job applicants should be required to submit, for example, only their national insurance number. No one would know whether they were female, male, black, brown, young or old, and that first, possibly subliminal, discard would be eliminated. Obviously, when one reached the interview stage, the employer would know one&#146;s background, but prejudice would be much harder, and personality and character come through at interview in a way that they do not on a piece of paper. I hope that the Government will look favourably on that suggestion. Financially, the cost would be almost nil.</p>

themselves on that spectrum but do not necessarily want a sex change. This is about people who face discrimination because of how they express their gender but do not fit into neat boxes. As the Bill progresses, we will test the Government on exact definitions, because we are still concerned about the continued, fairly narrow definition whereby transgender is seen as part of a process on the way to a change of gender. That is only a slight advance on where we are now, and we would wish those anywhere on the spectrum to have the full protection of equality under the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="90511-0009.htm_para17"><a name="0905118000433">We are pleased with the Government&#146;s proposals on carers and welcome the enshrining in law of the Coleman case and the protection that that affords. We also welcome the measures on breastfeeding, pregnancy and new mothers. However, there are some missing strands that we will probe in Committee: for example, castes are missing from discrimination protection; and there may be separate issues to do with children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="90511-0009.htm_para18"><a name="0905118000434">We have outstanding concerns about the proposed changes to restrictions on who can give blood. Obviously, the safety of the blood supply is paramount. However, prohibiting homosexuals as a group from giving blood, as has been the case, bears close examination. It is, without a doubt, discrimination to say, in blanket terms, that all homosexuals should not give blood because they pose such a tremendous risk. Surely we need some sort of risk-based system that assesses the risk posed by an individual, given that there will be overactive heterosexuals who practise unsafe sex and abstinent homosexuals.</p>

However, given the arduous and extensive arguments on the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill&#151;on which the Government, I hate to remind them, were defeated&#151;we hold to the view that religion and belief should not be a protected characteristic. Of course, we all believe that people should not face discrimination in their work because of their religion, and subscribe to promoting good relations to advance equality of opportunity and eliminate discrimination. However, religious views on matters such as abortion, alcohol, homosexuality and sex education in schools are varied and often at odds, and it would be absurd to require public authorities to accommodate all those views in public policies that affect us all. We are also worried that if exceptions for religious organisations in employment are too broad, there will be abuse of that protection. It is obviously acceptable to discriminate in some circumstances, such as advertising for a Catholic to fill the job of a Catholic priest&#151;that makes complete theological sense&#151;but it would be unacceptable if we then found it specified that only a Catholic caretaker could work in a religious school. I have no doubt that my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) will spend many hours in Committee happily arguing our case, particularly in relation to harassment, where there is a balance to be struck between protection from harassment and free speech.</p>

 Absolutely, and the Bill is an important foot solider in that regard. It sends out a clear and determined message about how the world will have to change. However, legislation must will the means, not just the ends, and we have to ensure that what we put down in law is matched by the will and resources to ensure its delivery. That will come into play when procurement is considered. Equality has advanced, but there is still a long way to go. If we do not continue to advance the cause and deliver a much fairer and more equal world, the cost to us as individuals and collectively as a country will be huge. A fairer and more equal world will mean that all of us fare much better, and I look forward to the battles ahead.</p>

Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) has for doing so&#151;one should give it a Second Reading and try to amend it in Committee and on Report.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention and urge the Conservative party to support the Bill today so that the whole House is united in its proposals for equality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="90511-0010.htm_para0"><a name="09051113000009">As the Bill is so wide ranging and there are so many aspects that could be raised in this debate&#151;I am sure that, like me, other Members have received many briefings, showing the extent of interest in the Bill from so many different sectors of the community&#151;I want to use this opportunity to raise some of the issues that have been brought to my attention that I hope can be considered further in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="90511-0010.htm_para1"><a name="09051113000010">As an MP from Wales, I have been approached by many Welsh organisations about different aspects of the Bill. The Equality and Human Rights Commission in Wales recently produced a document about the road to equality for women in Wales, which it says is too slow. That report showed the huge inequalities that still exist for women in Wales. When the Welsh Assembly was set up, the balance of women and men was nearly 50:50, which was a huge achievement. In her opening remarks, my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister for Women and Equality said that the positive action that Labour has taken has made a huge difference to the number of women MPs in this place and the number of Labour representatives in the devolved bodies. In 2003, the Assembly was the only body in the world to have parity&#151;a 50:50 balance&#151;between women and men. That was a huge achievement. I welcome the fact that the permission to have mechanisms such as the twinning mechanism that we used in the Welsh Assembly and all-women shortlists will be extended for a further period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="90511-0010.htm_para2"><a name="09051113000011">However, in other parts of life in Wales, outside the political sphere of the Assembly, there is still a huge way to go. For example, 74 per cent. of all teachers in Wales are women, but only 16 per cent. of secondary school head teachers and heads of further education colleges are women. That is a huge disparity, and it cannot be a good model for pupils or students. It is very important to address that. Also, 73 per cent. of all staff in local authorities are women, but only 21 per cent. of local authority chief executives are women, which again is a huge disparity. It is important to do what we can to address those issues. In Wales&#146;s top 100 private companies  <br>

<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>11 May 2009 : Column 586</b><br>
there are no women chief executives. Achieving a more equal society in Wales has been a very slow process, despite the fact that we have such a good gender balance in the Assembly. I welcome the measures in the Bill that will tackle those issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="90511-0010.htm_para3"><a name="09051113000012">One of the biggest issues in Wales, as elsewhere in the UK, is the pay gap. In some areas of work, the pay gap is particularly stark. My right hon. and learned Friend has drawn attention to the huge gender pay gaps&#151;up to 60 per cent.&#151;in the finance sector. Research into the finance sector has shown that women are overwhelmingly concentrated in lower-paid administrative jobs. In Wales, the latest available figures show that the pay gap has widened to 12 per cent. The pay gap has always been somewhat narrower in Wales, but that is because more men there are on low pay than the British average.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="90511-0010.htm_para4"><a name="09051113000013">We need to tackle the pay gap, not only, as has been said, for reasons of equality and fairness, but for strong economic reasons. The women and work commission&#146;s report of 2006 concluded that removing the barriers to women working in occupations traditionally undertaken by men and increasing women&#146;s participation in the labour market would be worth between &#163;15 billion and &#163;23 billion. The gap is wider in the private sector than in the public sector. I therefore welcome the proposals in the Bill to tackle the pay gap. We have been trying to do that for a long time, but progress has been slow; indeed, the pay gap has recently risen in Wales, although it is still lower than in the UK as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="90511-0010.htm_para5"><a name="09051113000014">Unison in Wales reckons that, putting together all its members with claims in all branches, there are now 9,000 outstanding claims, many of which are equal value claims. There are huge issues in respect of such claims, because there is a shortage of ACAS-approved independent experts in Wales, which means that huge legal bills are being built up. I understand that about six months ago, Cardiff council, whose area I represent, had paid out &#163;160,000 in legal fees to just one firm of solicitors&#151;something that will be reflected all over the country. The pay gap in local authorities is a problem. The money that local authorities are having to pay out to solicitors is causing a huge problem, when really that money should go on services. We need to do something to try to speed the process up and sort it out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="90511-0010.htm_para6"><a name="09051113000015">Unison and the Fawcett Society have made some proposals in their briefings. They both strongly support the Bill, but believe that it should be strengthened in some ways. They believe that as well as mandatory pay audits there should be representative actions so that individuals can make a claim as a group, which would cut the costs and perhaps the delay. I wonder whether that could be considered during the passage of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="90511-0010.htm_para7"><a name="09051113000016">The Bill requires private sector companies that employ 250 or more people to report on their gender pay gap, and public authorities with 150 employees will also have to report on equality issues. I think that that will be consulted on this summer, which would be a good opportunity to consider what issues will be raised. Will the Minister confirm the position in Wales as regards the list of public bodies that will be included? What role will the Welsh Assembly Government play in deciding which bodies are included?</p>

rich and the poor, but I feel that the Government and the Labour party are determined to address it. It is very important. Will the Minister say who will make decisions about which public bodies in Wales are included in the list? I also have some concerns about the exception in that clause of people who are subject to immigration control. Will she expand on the thinking behind that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="90511-0010.htm_para9"><a name="09051113000018">Another issue that has been raised constantly with me by voluntary bodies and children&#146;s groups is age discrimination and young people. I know that children and young people need to be treated in an age-appropriate way, but many of the young people who have spoken to me feel that they are discriminated against and not listened to just because they are young. The last Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales, Peter Clarke, said that one of the most common complaints that he received from young people was that they were not listened to. The Young Equals campaign highlighted the fact that 43 per cent. of those under 18 felt that they had been treated unfairly because of their age. I have been in correspondence with the Minister about that issue and have asked why age discrimination against those aged under 18 is not included as part of the Bill. I hope that we can explore that issue a bit more, because the young people and children who speak to me and the bodies that represent them do not understand the logic of why they are not part of this Bill with the appropriate exceptions built in.</p>

 I agree very much with the hon. Lady&#146;s last few remarks. Does she agree that that issue is particularly important when young people are subject to residency orders? Their parents might be going through difficulties so that residency is an issue, and too often the courts and the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service do not take into account the views of the children and young people who are involved.</p>

 The general feedback that I have received from many bodies is that children and young people&#146;s views are not given enough due attention. Those children who are active in such movements see it as a slight that they are not included in the Bill. I understand the reasons behind that decision, because of the many exceptions that would have to be made, but the bodies and young people involved do not understand. We need to discuss that subject at greater length.</p>

well as computer games. That sort of development is exactly what we should be encouraging, because it is appropriate for the age of those young people. They are not children, and they are not adults, but in the health service in general about two thirds of those who are at that in-between age are not in appropriate accommodation. Those are the sorts of issues that have been brought to me by young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="90511-0010.htm_para11"><a name="09051113000024">Another point made to me by the Young Equals campaign in particular&#151;I have met a lot of these groups&#151;was that research has shown that children do not expect the police necessarily to take them seriously when they make serious points. Sometimes, groups of young people are not allowed access to leisure facilities and shops. A shop near my office allowed in only two young people at any one time. That is labelling all young people as potentially disruptive, and I wonder how young people who feel very deeply about such issues can be protected from such discrimination. How will such issues be addressed under the Bill? That is an important point, and I hope that we can have a further discussion so that it can become clear to young people, who often feel strongly about such issues, that the Government are considering their role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="90511-0010.htm_para12"><a name="09051113000025">I want to mention other welcome provisions. Many of us have campaigned for a ban on discrimination in private clubs for years, and have even stood outside such clubs making our views known, so it is great that that is now happening. I also welcome the measures to protect pregnant women and new mothers, and to make it illegal to eject breastfeeding mothers from caf&#233;s, restaurants and public places&#151;I know that that has happened. Many of us have suffered from such discrimination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="90511-0010.htm_para13"><a name="09051113000026">The Bill will reinforce some of the good initiatives that are already happening. In Cardiff, there is a &#147;Breastfeeding Welcome&#148; scheme. Businesses put up a sign saying, &#147;Breastfeeding mothers are welcome.&#148; The scheme has spread all over Cardiff and is particularly strong in the Cardiff Bay area, which is a tourist area. The Bill will strengthen the scheme. We can make the legislation, but we also need efforts to encourage women and to say, &#147;We are pleased that you are breastfeeding here. We think that breastfeeding is good for you and good for the children and we want to do all we can to help you feel welcome.&#148; We have the legislation to back up that approach, but we still need the schemes to reinforce the message and to make people feel welcome.</p>

I want to conclude by mentioning one particular group. I am chair of the all-party group on Gypsy and Traveller law reform and I know that Gypsies and Travellers are among the most discriminated-against groups in this society.

This subtle passage of time might have led me to take a progressively greater interest in ageism, although I do not intend to say much about that tonight.

My main experience has been on disability issues, and I still chair my party&#146;s disability group. For other reasons, I have an interest in race relations and community cohesion, and I have a further interest given the gender make-up of my own family. When listening to the speech of the Minister for Women and Equality, I vividly remembered her tabling an amendment to national health service legislation some 20 years ago, in which she called for a gender quota of at least 40 per cent. women in the membership of NHS bodies. I countered at that point by saying that, as I was the only male in my own family, the gender ratio was already 4:1.</p>

We are not going to get into the business of abolishing inequalities overnight, but almost everyone in the Chamber would accept the principles of equality under the law and of equality of opportunity as being important for a healthy society. I am happy to say that I believe there is a moral case for greater equality, because we all deserve decent treatment. There is also a social case, because a society that is not frustrated by inequalities is more likely to be a happy and cohesive one. There is also an economic  <br>

case, although the evidence for that is not conclusive, because gross income inequalities are likely to depress national output and competitiveness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90511-0010.htm_para20"><a name="09051113000036">I go on from that to support the broad approach to the single Bill and the body of law that bridges the various strands of discrimination. I admire the work led by Trevor Phillips in his equalities review, not least because it brought the question of outcomes&#151;to which I have already referred in relation to the Gypsy and Traveller population&#151;to the fore, and the careful, painstaking, parallel review of equality law that took place. Both reviews have informed this legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="90511-0010.htm_para21"><a name="09051113000037">It is surely sensible to unite concepts and process in a piece of overarching legislation. I would add for consideration, possibly in Committee, that we need to give some attention to equality of access, and I can mention two areas in which there have been difficulties historically. The first is educational discrimination in relation to special educational needs. When there is a special educational needs and disability&#151;SEND&#151;tribunal in the compulsory years, access is much more likely to take place than it is in further or higher education, where there might have to be recourse to the county court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="90511-0010.htm_para22"><a name="09051113000038">Secondly, disability discrimination duties are expressed in part II of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 in relation to employment and, in part III, in relation to goods and services. I am not saying that a tribunal is always the right approach, but the fact is that more people use them than go to the courts. All these points should be subject to detailed scrutiny in Committee, and I am particularly anxious that there should be no perceived dilution of the Bill&#146;s coverage of disability, which is a more complex case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="90511-0010.htm_para23"><a name="09051113000039">Having said that, I am happy to have a single codification of the law, and I do not rule that out as an important factor in driving social progress. It is, to some extent, a lever of desirable change. However, given the experience with equal pay&#151;the relevant legislation is now more than 30 years old&#151;very few people would argue that the law itself will achieve an immediate or conclusive result. I hope that we will have a common aim of equality and that we will use the law appropriately, and not unduly puff its ability to deliver. At the same time, for moral reasons, neither direct nor indirect discrimination should be acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="90511-0010.htm_para24"><a name="09051113000040">I shall move on from the body of law&#151;important though that is&#151;to examine some wider and more positive concepts, some vision matters and some matters of culture, where things can be a little more difficult to deliver. My unease&#151;such as it is&#151;about the detailed provisions of the Bill echoes some of the concerns set out by my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) in her speech and in the reasoned amendment. The Bill is sometimes waffly and unspecific on public duties, which are not yet adequately defined or costed in regard to compliance. At the same time, however, it is unduly intrusive on the private sector. This is not a good time to introduce further costs, not least those involved in familiarising industry with the legislation. There are likely to be substantial one-off costs and continuing compliance costs, at a time when industry already has considerable burdens of its own.</p>

 I am quite sure that there will be cost savings in the long run, and that the situation will settle down. There is a difficulty in the short term, however.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="90511-0011.htm_para0"><a name="09051113000043">I want to turn to public sector bodies. Even if we drop the argument that the pursuit, in one clause, of socio-economic equality amounts to socialism, as I have heard it described, it does provide a charter for politically motivated interference. In some cases, it could even threaten equality under the law. For example, should we wind up the public library service because it is allegedly used by middle-class people rather than by the population as a whole? Worse, the public sector duty could become a cop-out from doing the real work that is needed in other parts of the public sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90511-0011.htm_para1"><a name="09051113000044">In some respects, the public sector and the civil service, of which I have some knowledge, are good employers and meet many of the requirements in the Bill. I know a bit about job share in the civil service, for example. Nevertheless, there is still a gender pay gap in the public service. A recent issue of <i> Westminster &amp; Whitehall World</i> highlighted a problem in recruitment advertising that could deter a substantial amount of part-time applicants from applying for certain jobs&#151;I think that the estimate was that 25 per cent. of jobs were not open to job sharers or part-timers. That would mean that many women with family responsibilities could not apply for those jobs. There also continues to be a lack of gender balance in public board appointments, although positive discrimination is perhaps not the right way to address the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="90511-0011.htm_para2"><a name="09051113000045">Yet the Government are somehow exempting themselves from many of the duties relating to publishing information on the gender pay gap. Characteristically, however, they go on to impose mandatory gender pay audits across the private sector, not on a targeted basis, and such an imposition on hard-pressed businesses is particularly difficult in present circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="90511-0011.htm_para3"><a name="09051113000046">We also need to remember the social implications of the Bill. Not to put too fine a point on it, people will know that I do not go along with what is sometimes unfairly implied about the white working class. In a very interesting speech, the right hon. Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt) spoke about the interests of the white working class. However, wherever we come from in this debate, we have to understand that there is a very fine line to tread between the social progress most of us&#151;nearly everybody in this Chamber&#151;would want and the risk of a backlash from grass-roots opinion. It is not always racist to protest if people feel that they are being treated unfairly because of a body of law or how it is interpreted; if that happens, we could have social unrest, particularly at a time of economic difficulty and unemployment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="90511-0011.htm_para4"><a name="09051113000047">At the same time as the Bill focuses on one or two headline-catching initiatives, which are obviously part of the particular Minister&#146;s agenda, it does not go far enough or give a sufficient lead in other directions. In respect of the private sector, there is, of course, no direct lever that Parliament or Ministers can pull other than setting out particular legal provisions. In terms of example, however, I have always felt that the best results come from the private sector when the moral and social case for equality and inclusion coincides with the business case. I have shared platforms with the Institute of Directors and other such bodies and argued that that coincidence of interest is the best way of guaranteeing social progress.</p>

Of course that will be the case, because that is the characteristic and make-up of the population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="90511-0011.htm_para7"><a name="09051113000050">In the public sector, there is also the question of principles and people debate whether the Bill should have a principles clause. I tend to agree with the Equality and Human Rights Commission that we should have such a clause. It is a &#147;King Charles&#146; Head&#148; issue for me, so I was delighted that the Mental Capacity Act 2005 kept such a principles clause in, and I have drafted them for other Bills. I did not have much success with them, but I believe that there is a strength to having such clauses. I can understand exactly why Government lawyers are uncomfortable about principles-based laws; they think that they are somehow a foreign invention that could create a clash between specific requirements and wider principles of good behaviour. Actually, however, these clauses enable tribunals or courts of law to look behind the fulfilment of box-ticking and to move towards compliance with the underlying principles, meeting the challenges that the legislation is designed to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="90511-0011.htm_para9"><a name="09051113000052">In truth, my personal vision of equality is, in a sense, motivated less by discrimination&#151;I am not, however, a lawyer&#151;than by an approach informed by human rights. I believe that employers should have to treat all their staff&#151;and, of course, job applicants, too&#151;decently. Equally, for those offering public services, we know that they are difficult to resource and to join up, but what should motivate all public officials is the offering of considerate, personal, holistic and decent treatment. Doing that properly in the interests of the person concerned should transcend the mere letter of the law. Passing this Bill, notwithstanding its many virtues, is at best a step towards that wider social advance.</p>

 I am happy that areas of disagreement can be debated, but that is different from throwing the whole Bill out, which is what the Conservative Opposition are suggesting. That seems to me to be a total negation of what the hon. Lady has just said. By all means let us fight in Committee on all the issues that are worrying, but anyone seriously in favour of equality should back the Bill so that there is a vehicle in place to argue about.

In bringing all equality strands into one Bill, it creates, if I may put it this way, an equality of inequalities. In other words, whatever the inequality is, &#147;We&#146;re agin it, and we are agin it to the same degree.&#148; I think that that is an entirely healthy development of a kind that will lead to the cultural change that several Members have mentioned. That is what we really need at the end of the day. Yes, we set legal frameworks, and it is important to do so; but unless those legal frameworks end up creating a culture change in society or are met by such a change, the overall outcome will not be the one that we wish to see. I believe that the legal framework is at least one half of that broader picture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="90511-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09051113000058">I am pleased that the Bill places an equal duty on public sector and private sector bodies in respect of equalities in the delivery of services. At this point, I must advise my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General that I shall introduce what I hope will be regarded as a helpful amendment because there seems to be a small oversight in clause 1, which specifies a list of public bodies. Unfortunately, it leaves out unitary councils while including the council of the Isles of Scilly. I think that rather more people are represented by unitary councils than by the council of the Isles of Scilly. Similarly, when it comes to the health service the Bill specifies primary care trusts, but I think it would be much wiser for it to cover all NHS trusts. It should be made clear that any arm of the NHS that deals with patients and the public in general must observe the equalities duty.</p>

 I thank my hon. and learned Friend for her helpful response. As she says, it is possible to infer that all such bodies are covered, but it is always good to have things spelt out clearly. Otherwise, members of the profession that she so lately graced will always be trying to find loopholes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="90511-0011.htm_para14"><a name="09051113000064">Among the new provisions, the socio-economic strand represents a legislative breakthrough. Given that since 1997 we have placed attempts to achieve socio-economic equality at the top of our agenda, it is disappointing that, in some respects, the gap seems to be widening. That tells us two things. It tells us that socio-economic equality of opportunity is extremely hard to achieve, and it tells us that there can be confusion between absolute poverty and relative poverty. There has undoubtedly been an increase in relative poverty, but examination of the figures will almost certainly demonstrate a decrease in absolute poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="90511-0011.htm_para15"><a name="09051113000065">This problem is very difficult to define and very, very difficult to tackle. In that context, public sector bodies have a vital role to play. Councils, for instance, can deliver education. The Bill provides for positive bias and discrimination, and I believe that we need local authorities to exercise more of it towards people from socio-economic backgrounds that are deprived not only financially but in terms of parental aspirations, and all the other factors involved in the complex mix that we are discussing. The Bill gives local authorities an opportunity to do more than they do now. The extent to which they take their duty seriously is variable at present, and we need to make them all recognise that it is a prime duty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="90511-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09051113000066">Age has always been with us, and I am very pleased about the advances that the Bill makes in tackling age discrimination. I am pleased about the emphasis on goods and services, and I am pleased that while wrinklies will not lose the advantages provided by Saga Holidays, older members of our society may also be given greater opportunities. I have always believed that, in some respects, we could learn quite a few lessons from the United States, where people are not automatically disregarded or discriminated against on the basis of age. If they are still up to the job and can still deliver, people in the States are able to operate until they are in their eighties, and I see nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="90511-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09051113000067">I hate to say it, but I agreed with the Liberal Democrat spokesman, the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone), on the subject of the compulsory retirement age, which strikes me as a discrimination in itself. I wish that it had been covered by the Bill, but there is still an opportunity for that to happen. Certainly it should be dealt with in the near future. The existence of a range of compulsory retirement ages defies logic. In the armed services, the police and the fire services the retirement age is about 50, while the general retirement age of 65 is enforced, in my view inappropriately, by many institutions.</p>

It is the only way we can finally achieve results, because there will always be resistance. Talking of resistance, I wonder if the nub of the attitude of Conservative Front Benchers can be traced back to the CBI&#146;s briefing paper, which, while welcoming the Bill in principle, devoted its entire length to opposing and criticising the measures on gender-related pay discrimination. It claims that business will always say, &#147;You can&#146;t do that; it will ruin us.&#148; However, if we had listened to that argument, we would never have made any social progress in this country. It is the old story of the roads to ruin. It applies to the minimum wage&#151;you name it.</p>

If reporting is carried out selectively after the event, it will take so long to eliminate such discrimination that we will all be 6 ft under long before it happens. This is therefore vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="90511-0011.htm_para22"><a name="09051113000072">The Bill clears up some matters that should have been dealt with previously. The insurance provisions are a particular case in point. Insurance companies have been allowed to discriminate too freely for too long, such as through age discrimination in insurance. When someone reaches 70, they are normally immediately rejected by the insurance industry for travel insurance. One day they are perfectly healthy, the next day they are thought to be a calamitous risk; that is clearly nonsense. Unless insurance companies are required to undertake a proper assessment of the insured&#146;s risks instead of simply having an arbitrary age descriptor, this discrimination will continue and that is totally unjustifiable. Travel insurance becoming unavailable at 70 is also ridiculous. People who are 70 nowadays are like the 50-year-olds of 50 years ago, and preventing them from travelling is dreadful discrimination. I am very glad we are putting a stop to that.</p>

 Yes, I would, and, in fact, that is the current situation: when someone reaches 70, they just have to satisfy the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency that they are still fit to drive.

 I am a committed campaigner for equality&#151;I always have been, and I always will be&#151;and I welcome most of this Bill. It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Brighton, Kemptown (Dr. Turner), who gave a balanced analysis of the Bill and pointed out many of its good aspects. I particularly welcome the parts of the Bill that simplify and consolidate previous equality legislation, the main principles of which we Conservatives have wholeheartedly supported. I also very much welcome the positive equality duty imposed on public authorities; that will go a long way towards changing the cultural attitudes to equality in all its manifestations and in all walks of life in our country. That is right, because equality of opportunity is a basic moral imperative. As the hon.

I am not against the drive for equality&#151;not at all. Labour Members have frequently peppered their speeches and interventions with attacks on Opposition Members for doing our job of holding the Government to account. It is extremely important that we dissect the Bill, and look at its outcomes as well as its good intentions. I do not agree with every proposal in it, because no political system&#151;neither the most liberal, nor the most totalitarian&#151;can make people equal by passing laws that say that equality is desirable. Therefore, the good parts of the Bill are, sadly, undermined and diminished by the unworthy parts, which revert to the worst excesses of old-fashioned unreconstructed socialism. <i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

danger that parts of this Bill will reduce, rather than increase, equality in the workplace, and I want equality in the workplace to become universal. There is, of course, a delicate balance to be struck, especially at times of economic downturn such as now. If too great a burden is put on businesses, businesses will fail and not only the employer, but the employees, will become jobless. That is surely not the Government&#146;s intention.</p>

<p><a name="st_o297"><a name="09051113000083"><a name="90511-0012.htm_spnew0"><a name="09051113000184"><b>Lynne Featherstone:</b>
 We have heard a lot about the costs to business, but does the hon. Lady think that business might support the introduction of compulsory pay audit measures in the first quarter following the economy having returned to growth&#151;or might businesses welcome such measures after two quarters of growth, perhaps?</p>

<p><a name="st_o298"><a name="09051113000084"><a name="90511-0012.htm_spnew1"><a name="09051113000185"><b>Mrs. Laing:</b>
 I think that the hon. Lady has a reasonable point; I cannot imagine quite how it would work in practice, but, in principle, it is quite a good point. My concern, however, is that if the measures go too far, not only will that damage the economy itself and hinder growth, but it will damage the prospects for individuals, who might not be given the chance of employment that they would otherwise have had. If the pendulum swings too far in the direction of protection of employment rights, the potential employee will lose the opportunity for the job, and therefore for the right, because the reality is that most businesses do not exist to act altruistically; they exist to make money, keep their businesses going, pay their employees and satisfy their customers. Statistics show that companies that have good equality practices benefit in terms of business success. The right hon. Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt) made that point extremely well at the beginning of her speech. The Government should encourage all employers to do what good employers have been doing for years. That is what the previous equality Act did very successfully and, as she showed in the very good examples that she gave, we are succeeding to that extent. I am concerned that if the pendulum swings too far, people will lose the rights we want to give them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="90511-0012.htm_para1"><a name="09051113000085">I am also concerned about the imposition of targets, especially those on the gender pay gap. We all want sensible measures to be taken to close that gap, which remains a scandal in this country. It is particularly bad in respect of how it affects women who earn least and, often, work the hardest: part-time casual employees. They suffer most and they are the ones whom I want to benefit, but I am concerned that the Bill will require a focus on just one indicator and thus risk ignoring the underlying causes of inequality. Those causes have to be remedied to create the equality and the economy of the future that we wish to see. Proper growth will come back to our country only if we have the right conditions in which business and industry can flourish and thereby benefit everyone who works in them, employer and employee alike.</p>

That approach is far more effective than centrally imposed political imperatives&#151;history has shown, throughout the ages, that they simply do not work.</p>

It has been introduced step by step, and that is what the Government should be doing; they should be understanding how business and employers work. By proving the business case step by step, we will take employers and businesses with us in the quest for equality, instead of imposing top-down conditions that they may have difficulty meeting. We can build on that business case to try not only to achieve the equality that we all wish to achieve, but to rebuild our shattered economy&#151;more than a decade of Labour&#146;s good ideas has destroyed it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="90511-0012.htm_para4"><a name="09051113000088">I dare mention, just for a moment, the difficult issue of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is a private matter. I entirely agree that, of course, it should be encouraged, as all the medical professionals tell us but, like all these matters, it should be dealt with in a reasonable way and with discretion. In some places it is appropriate to breastfeed one&#146;s child and in some places it is not, yet the measures in this Bill outlaw someone&#146;s ability to suggest reasonably that breastfeeding should not occur in one place or another. In matters such as this, we should proceed with discretion, reason and respect for everybody concerned, including, of course, the mother and the baby. This is not a matter where the Government can dictate that mothers should be allowed to breastfeed everywhere and anywhere without having due consideration to those around them and the circumstances in which they find themselves. We have all managed it, Madam Deputy Speaker, even in this building and the matter can easily be dealt with by discretion; we do not need primary legislation in a Bill such as this in order to bring this about. The reason this makes me angry is that the measures on breastfeeding are just one example of where the Bill goes too far.</p>

By adding on all these extra conditions, the Government make it much more difficult for this Bill to be supported and for it to work in practice were it to become law&#151;it would be so much better to concentrate on what really needs to be done. It is very sad that, after 12 years of a Labour Government, the gap between rich and poor in Britain is greater than it has been for decades; opportunities, particularly educational ones for young people from disadvantaged families, are worse than they have been for decades; and social mobility is very much reduced compared with what it was 40 years ago, when a young person from a poorer background had a far greater chance of succeeding in whatever they set out to do than such a person would today&#151;the Government know that. They have failed, and they are not going to put their record straight by introducing all the extra rules and regulations in this Bill. What a condemnation that is of 12 years of a Labour Government.</p>

 It is a pleasure to speak in this debate. I welcome the Bill most warmly, and I congratulate my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister for Women and Equality, and her colleagues, on producing this measure after what have clearly been Herculean efforts. Bringing together a lot of the existing equality legislation, with harmonisation, in part, into a comprehensible whole is clearly challenging. There have been debates along the way and many people have expressed reservations from time to time about the direction in which things might be going, such as in respect of public sector duty. It takes time for Ministers to consider comments that have been made, for example after the Green Paper, and return with a good document.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="90511-0012.htm_para7"><a name="09051113000092">This is an excellent Bill, which is why it has been almost universally welcomed.

In fact, I could find only one organisation that has not welcomed the Bill: the Conservative Opposition. When I intervened to ask the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May), who spoke for the Opposition, whether she could name a single organisation, nay individual, who had expressed concern and opposition to this Bill, no example was forthcoming. Reference has been made to the CBI and its concern about the proposal for gender pay gap reports. In fact, the CBI&#146;s document starts by saying:</p>

 I am well aware that there are Members in all parts of the House, including the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and one or two others who I hope will speak soon, who support improvements in equality legislation. I must, however, comment on the one or two Members who, from a sedentary position, in response to the comment from the Minister for Women and Equality that it was the Labour Government who introduced the Race Relations Act, the Equal Pay Act, the Sex Discrimination Act and so on, objected to the idea that nothing at all had been introduced by the previous Conservative Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="90511-0012.htm_para10"><a name="09051113000101">It is correct to say that the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 was introduced by a Conservative Government. I remember it well. It is well documented. I will not detain the House, other than to say that the only reason why the DDA was introduced in 1995, with all the loopholes&#151;it was like a string vest&#151;was that various hon. Members, with support from all parties, had on several occasions tried to introduce the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill. Following the way in which the then Conservative Government blocked that Bill, when I happened to be the promoter that year, and how three Members of the House had to apologise to the House for using tactics that were misleading, the Government were so embarrassed by the public opposition that they introduced the DDA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="90511-0012.htm_para11"><a name="09051113000102">Like my colleagues, I genuinely thought we had got past that. We have had cross-party support for almost all the equalities legislation since. We had support for the Disability Rights Commission Act 1999, the Special Educational Needs and Disabilities Act 2001, the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, and the Equality Act 2006. Those are only the disabilities measures that spring to mind. Therefore I was hoping that we would get cross-party support this evening, and I am sure we will, but the official Opposition will not be with us.</p>

some wonderful things in it. Does he agree that we need to examine it carefully in Committee to strengthen it if we can? For instance, public bodies are told by the Bill that they may take into account the impediments of disabled people. There are many disabled people with serious impediments who think that public authorities should always take those impediments into account.</p>

<p><a name="st_o307"><a name="09051113000105"><a name="90511-0012.htm_spnew10"><a name="09051113000194"><b>Roger Berry:</b>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="90511-0012.htm_para13"><a name="09051113000106">I shall focus on the disability provisions, but there are three general issues that I want to raise. First, I strongly support the extension of the rights of older people facing discrimination in goods and services. That is good news for older people, which of course means it is good news for many disabled people and many carers as well. It is terrible news for the organisation referred to earlier, but good news for such people. Secondly, the more effective use of public procurement for delivering equality is to be welcomed. Thirdly, the empowerment of employment tribunals to make wider recommendations to stop future discrimination in employment is also welcome. I may say a little more about that in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="90511-0012.htm_para14"><a name="09051113000107">In relation to disability, there has been significant progress in recent years. Ten per cent. more disabled people are in employment than 10 years ago. Many service providers now provide a more accessible environment, but sadly it is still the case that disabled people are twice as likely to be unemployed as non-disabled people, twice as likely to lack qualifications as non-disabled people, and twice as likely to live in poverty. There has been progress, but there is still a long way to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="90511-0012.htm_para15"><a name="09051113000108">In relation to disability issues, the Bill should be tested against three criteria. The first, as I said, is that the Bill is in large measure about harmonisation, but it must ensure that the distinctive aspects of the DDA are not lost, in particular the fundamental principle that equality for disabled people is emphatically not about equal treatment. It is about different treatment to produce equal opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="90511-0012.htm_para16"><a name="09051113000109">Secondly, gaps in existing legislation must be plugged. There are still areas where discriminatory legislation is condoned, such as, yet again, the Ministry of Defence&#146;s exemption from the employment provisions of the DDA. Goodness gracious me. The third point is that enforcement is a real issue. Hon. Members are right when they say that passing legislation itself is not enough. There are important questions that need to be asked about the best ways to enforce that legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="90511-0012.htm_para17"><a name="09051113000110">Let me say a few words about each of those things. As the hon. Member for Daventry said, the DDA differs fundamentally from other forms of anti-discrimination legislation. It is asymmetric. It creates rights for disabled people to be protected against discrimination, without a corresponding right for non-disabled people. Treating disabled people the same as non-disabled people will not deliver equality. Wheelchair users do not experience equal opportunities by being treated the same way as non-wheelchair uses. Women with learning disabilities are less likely to use breast-screening services. That is a matter of fact. This is likely to arise not as a result of direct discrimination, but as a result of the provision of information in exactly the same way as it is provided for those without learning disabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="90511-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09051113000111">That is why the public sector duty, introduced in effect in December 2006, required health authorities as public authorities to do something about such situations. If it is observed that some patients are not accessing a service equally, questions need to be asked about what can be done to give them equal access. The fundamental distinction in disability discrimination legislation is the recognition of the need for more favourable treatment&#151;in specific ways&#151;for disabled people. As I read the Bill, I think that it contains a recognition of the importance of more favourable treatment, but I would like an assurance from Ministers that the new public sector duty indeed addresses that issue and would in no way dilute the provision in the DDA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="90511-0012.htm_para19"><a name="09051113000112">I welcome the many areas where the Bill will extend rights for disabled people. For example, it will extend protection against direct discrimination and harassment to people who are perceived to have a disability and to those associated with someone who has a disability. Some of us remember the debates about the DDA in 1995 and the Americans with Disabilities Act&#151; a wonderful piece of legislation that we aspired to emulate. It made specific reference to protection from discrimination for those perceived as having a disability. The argument is obvious: if someone is discriminated against by, for example, an employer, because he or she thinks that that person has a disability, and the person turns out not to have a disability, the employer has done nothing wrong. That is a bit daft. Similarly, if a carer for someone with a disability is discriminated against by an employer or a service provider for that reason, that is surely wrong&#151;that was the issue in the Sharon Coleman case. I therefore welcome those improvements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="90511-0012.htm_para20"><a name="09051113000113">I welcome the fact that the provisions on age discrimination in relation to access to goods and services will help older people and therefore many disabled people. I also welcome the duty on landlords and management companies to make reasonable adjustments in relation to communal areas, such as hallways and stairs. I also welcome the fact that political parties will be allowed to do more to enable disabled people and others to seek selection as candidates.

 I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry), who is a sincere man who has achieved much in this area. I pay tribute to him for that. However, at one or two points in his remarks, he fell into the great paradox of this issue in that some of the most fervent advocates of equality exhibit a degree of intolerance of the views of others. He and the hon. Member for Brighton, Kemptown (Dr. Turner) both appeared to be slightly bemused that others could take a different view of this Bill. I hope to help them with my remarks.</p>

I do not like the way in which the issue is addressed in this Bill, but I believe perhaps more in social mobility&#151;as one of the factors that has brought me to this House&#151;than in anything else. However, I profoundly reject the Bill. My right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) spoke about the difference between now and the time when the Bill was first conceived some four years ago. She said that equality matters, whatever the economic climate, and I agree. But competitiveness also matters. This would have been a bad Bill four years ago and it is a bad Bill now, for a variety of reasons.</p>

Well, I agree with most if not all of the constituent parts, but the hon. Gentleman also said that some philosophical changes are at stake in the Bill. Some of those are quite worrying. Some of the concerns are about bizarre definitions, and some people may not understand why they are a necessary part of the Bill&#151;I have struggled with them. Clause 11 states that</p>
<a name="90511-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="09051113000147"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a reference to a person who has a particular protected characteristic is a reference to a man or to a woman&#148;.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_brev2"><a name="09051113000149"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it is not discrimination to treat a disabled person more favourably than a person who is not disabled&#148;,</p>

I raised with the Leader of the House earlier of the example in the explanatory notes. They state:</p>
<a name="90511-0013.htm_brev4"><a name="09051113000151"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If an employer advertising a vacancy makes it clear in the advert that Roma need not apply, this would amount to direct race discrimination against a Roma who might reasonably have considered applying&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="90511-0013.htm_para9"><a name="09051113000128">As I put it to the Minister for Women and Equality, is it not the case that, under these proposals, an employer could choose to employ a white woman in preference to an equally well-qualified black man? She did not directly answer the question, because the answer is yes. So we are actually setting out a hierarchy of different, competing equalities. My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) was laughing earlier, when he saw me scribbling down the phrase, &#147;Equality disappearing up its own backside.&#148; This is becoming so complicated that, in seeking to protect some groups quite properly from discrimination, there is a risk of inflicting discrimination on others.</p>

 I see the cause of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s worry, but it would not be right to say that the Bill will allow the phrase, &#147;Romany need not apply&#148; to be put into an advertisement, as that would discriminate against the Roma because they were Roma. If everyone applied&#151;we would want them to do so&#151;and there were two equally well-qualified candidates, the person from the under-represented community could be picked. That is the size of it. The Roma would probably be picked, because they would be under-represented. It is a telling, nice notion that the Roma might be over-represented, but that is not all that likely to happen right now. I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands that the provision is totally voluntary; it is up to the business to decide whether it wants to rebalance the community.</p>

 Absolutely. I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for that clarification. My concern is that, in the example that I gave earlier to the Minister, if a business chose to avoid employing people from an ethnic minority, for example, and its work force were therefore 100 per cent. white, it might be that employer&#146;s preference to retain a 100 per cent. white work force. We are giving that employer the choice, as the Solicitor-General puts it&#151;not the requirement or the obligation&#151;to continue to discriminate against ethnic minorities, by choosing to tackle the under-representation of women in that work place.</p>

 I am happy to take a further intervention if the Solicitor-General thinks that I have got the wrong end of the stick.

balance in under-represented communities, and he is beginning to grasp that point. It is totally voluntary for the person running the business to do that. So I am not quite sure what the source of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern continues to be. He seems to regard it as possible to use the provision in a racist way to maintain all-white representation, but that is completely at variance with its purpose, which is to redress the balance of the community, so it could not be used in that way.</p>

<p><a name="st_o316"><a name="09051113000134"><a name="90511-0013.htm_spnew3"><a name="09051113000203"><b>Mr. Brady:</b>
 I think that the Solicitor-General is mistaken. Clearly, the provision could be used in that way, given that it is also possible to discriminate in favour of women to rebalance the work force on gender grounds. That would be entirely possible, and she seems to have a misplaced confidence that that could never happen. Either she must believe that no employer would ever want to discriminate against ethnic minorities, in which case the Bill would be clearly unnecessary, or she must believe that some people wish to discriminate on those grounds, in which case she is giving them a tool by which they can do so if they wish.</p>

 My understanding from business is that that is done already. For instance, if someone has an all-white sales force and wants to market to an ethnic minority area, they will want to be free to choose from two equally qualified people the ethnic minority person to sell in the community where they will feel at home and where they are likely to be welcome. The trouble is that, if someone does that now, it could be discriminatory. The Bill will protect businesses that want to do that, but it will not compel anyone to do so.</p>

I believe in merit and that people should be judged on who they are&#151;on their own abilities and efforts&#151;and not on what they are. The move to positive discrimination risks negating that approach. It is damaging to the principle of merit, and it is damaging to democracy.

On health, according to the instances given in the explanatory notes, the Bill sets out what is already done but does it differently. Clearly, in guidelines and through the allocation of resources, there is a recognition of social inequality in the way that the national health service is funded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="90511-0013.htm_para13"><a name="09051113000142">On education, the Bill is more worrying, because it seeks to enshrine the damaging and absurd approach that has been taken in recent years, in seeking to improve the prospects of people from less affluent backgrounds and communities getting to university by making the process easier and lowering the threshold for them. The really worrying thing about that and the reason that this is such a damaging approach is that it removes the pressure from the point in the system where it should operate. Schools in our less affluent, typically urban, areas have more excuses to underperform if we say that because children who go to such schools cannot be expected to have the best exam results, we should lower the threshold for them to get into university. Instead, we should say that failure is not acceptable in the provision of education in any community. We should be raising the standard&#151;raising the bar&#151;for everybody, but the approach of the proposals in the Bill works in the opposite direction.</p>

 I was listening to the hon. Gentleman, who expressed himself clearly, but I stand by every word I have just said. There is no need for him to apologise. He represents a strong point of view held by some Tory Members and certainly by Tories outside, who have always been suspicious, to say the least, about legislation dealing with discrimination. It goes without saying that I am all in favour of it. One would not expect otherwise from a Labour Member of Parliament. We should combat the remaining discrimination against women.

The Bill&#146;s provisions on age discrimination are certain to be most welcome.

In the 1960s, one of the arguments made about race discrimination was that major organisations&#151;certainly in the media&#151;could give a lead. For example, non-white people could present programmes to make it clear that they were all part of our society. To some degree, the same thing applies to women nowadays. I find it difficult to understand why women television presenters who are getting older&#151;I am taking great care with my words&#151;are considered no longer the right people to read the news or front programmes when they reach a certain age. That does not apply to men. Obviously, I am pleased that there is no such problem for men in their 50s or 60s. They continue to do their job and do it very well, yet the story is different for females. Progress could be made if the BBC in particular took a somewhat different attitude.</p>

The Bill includes measures to deal with age discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services. As people grow older, it is important that they are not made to feel like second-class citizens. However, I have some criticism because clause 190 gives wide-ranging powers of exemption and I hope that will be looked at in Committee. It is all very well to set out anti-discriminatory legislation on goods, facilities and services, but that is no good if the Government have wide-ranging powers of exemption from such provisions in future.</p>

with illusions about that should talk to some of their constituents. At a time of high unemployment, the problems become all the more acute. Even when we had near full employment, employers took the view that once a person had reached a certain age there was no particular reason to take them on in preference to younger people. Of course I am against any form of discrimination on age grounds, but the situation seems much more unfortunate for someone made redundant at the age of 50, 52 or 53&#151;even more so, if they are trying to find a job against great competition.</p>

If it is all right for us to continue to work past 65&#151;and no one has suggested otherwise, fortunately as far as I am concerned&#151;why should we deny such rights to our constituents?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="90511-0013.htm_para22"><a name="09051134000015">Moreover, very often, those who make the decision in industry&#151;the leading people, managing directors, chairs of companies and so on&#151;are, in many instances, over 65. They would not dream of retiring simply because they had reached a certain age. I therefore feel that the default retirement age should go, as I said in an intervention on my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister for Women and Equality. The Government&#146;s position was established a few years ago and is clear: it was to be reviewed within five years&#151;that would bring us to 2011&#151;but that is all. The default retirement age is being challenged in the courts. We shall see the outcome, but of course we would not have to wait to see the outcome if the Bill were so amended in Committee that the default retirement were abolished.</p>

Of course, there are certain occupations&#151;it would not be difficult to name them&#151;where a person is only too pleased to go. I am not suggesting for one moment that someone should be forced to go on working beyond 65. I am saying that if someone wants to do so, and unless there is a very strong case against it&#151;on health grounds, or because of the nature of the occupation or whatever&#151;that person should be allowed to continue working, at least until 70.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick), who made an interesting speech. Unfortunately, I may possibly repeat one or two of his points, although I shall make them slightly differently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para0"><a name="09051134000019">The Bill is very much welcomed by Members on the Plaid Cymru Bench. Ensuring fairness, regardless of race, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, religion or belief, is right and likely to be effective in the long term in developing our countries&#146; economies. In respect of my particular concern, age discrimination, banning ageism in the provision of goods, facilities and services is a significant step forward. However, I have two reservations that I should like to outline briefly. They might be addressed in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09051134000020">First, and unsurprisingly to some Members, I am concerned about the fact that discrimination on the basis of language is not included. Earlier, we heard complaints from a Conservative Member, the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous), about a requirement to speak Polish. He was dismayed at a requirement to speak Polish for a certain job, but if speaking Polish is a legitimate occupational qualification, that is no problem whatever. I cannot see why he is so exercised about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09051134000021">My concern is both broader, in a sense, because it concerns all of society, and more specific, because it is about my country, Wales. It is about the treatment of the Welsh language and the fact that the subject does not appear in the Bill. The Bill does not reflect the social, economic and legal reality in Wales, where both Welsh and English are used widely and are, to quote the Welsh Language Act 1993,</p>
<a name="90511-0014.htm_brev0"><a name="09051134000137"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;on a basis of equality&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para3"><a name="09051134000022">&#147;Equality&#148; is the important word here. That Act treats the Welsh and English languages on a basis of equality, yet the Equality Bill makes no reference to Welsh, and that might lead to problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para4"><a name="09051134000023">To go back to my earlier remarks about the Polish language, or any other language, for that matter, Welsh is different, in that it has a certain legal status&#151;a status that clearly does not seem to have impressed itself sufficiently on the people who drew up the Bill, despite the attempted persuasion of the Welsh Language Board; I know that there was some correspondence. On the legal status of the language, as I said earlier, the 1993 Act says that English and Welsh are to be treated on a  <br>

basis of equality, and there are various ways in which that should be achieved. Historically, there have been separate arrangements for Wales, in respect of the language, for a very long time, starting with the official ban on the use of Welsh in the early 16th century under the Acts of Union. That was nearly 500 years ago, so we in this place have a bit of experience of dealing with that language issue, whatever complexities might arise with regard to Polish, or any other of the 60, 70 or 80 languages that might be heard outside this place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09051134000024">There have been further legislative moves. The Welsh Courts Act 1942 and the Welsh Language Acts of 1967 and 1993 were passed by a national Government, a Labour Government and a Conservative Government respectively, so the issue is not party political. Of course, the Conservative 1993 Act set up the Welsh Language Board. On the language issue and the law, the Welsh Affairs Committee is currently considering a legislative competence order that would transfer the right to pass laws on the Welsh language to the National Assembly for Wales. Eventually, laws will be passed in the Welsh Assembly on the Welsh language, but the Bill is silent on any relationship or possible clash between such laws passed in the Assembly and any other laws passed in this place. The legislative competence order would transfer most, but not all, language legislation to the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09051134000025">One intention of the Welsh Assembly Government is to create a language commissioner. Such a commissioner might pass judgment on employment issues. Conservative Members have voiced concerns about a clash, or a hierarchy of discrimination; the concern is that some sorts of discrimination might be viewed more seriously than others. We might have a clash between the Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s intentions for the Welsh language and any provision passed in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09051134000026">Unfortunately, there is a long history of discrimination on the basis of language in Wales in modern times, from the infamous Brewer Spinks case of the early 1960s, in which an entire work force were banned from speaking Welsh in a factory, until the owner changed his mind, to the recent case of Thomas Cook, which tried to ban its workers from speaking Welsh in the workplace. Again, it later overturned its decision. The Welsh Assembly Government intend to establish a right to speak Welsh; they have told us that. That measure relating to the Welsh language might&#151;I do not know&#151;in some way clash with the intentions of the Bill. That is why I am slightly concerned about the fact that the Bill is silent on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para8"><a name="09051134000027">Another question that came to mind was how the post of language commissioner would work. Hon. Members might not know that we already have two other sorts of commissioners in Wales. We have a Commissioner for Older People in Wales, and a Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales, who have powers. Of course, there is a Children&#146;s Commissioner for England, too. The interrelationship worries me, and I would be interested to hear the Solicitor-General&#146;s response on that subject in her winding-up speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para9"><a name="09051134000028">The second issue to do with the Bill that causes me concern is that of age discrimination, which the hon. Member for Walsall, North mentioned. I have a long-standing interest in the matter; in fact, the first amendment that I ever moved in Committee was on the Employment Bill in 2002. It was aimed at extending protection from  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="11 May 2009">

unfair dismissal to people who are over retirement age. I was helped then, as I am now, by Age Concern. The amendment was unsuccessful, and we waited until 2006, when the Government acted&#151;albeit only partially. My concern, which Members from all parts of the House share, is that the Bill fails to remove compulsory retirement&#151;the so-called mandatory or default retirement age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para10"><a name="09051134000029">However, as Members might expect, I commend the proposed steps to outlaw age discrimination. Age discrimination is the most common discrimination of all and, alas, one that we are all in danger of facing, some sooner rather than later. Any steps that are taken to combat age discrimination are therefore very welcome. There has been a long-standing call to make age discrimination illegal, and it is a live and important issue for many of our constituents, particularly those in my part of the world, north Wales, where we have a higher than average proportion of older people. It is a particularly salient issue there, but it is an issue throughout the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para11"><a name="09051134000030">I understand that the Government will look separately at the mandatory retirement age, as the Minister for Women and Equality said earlier, but that we will apparently have to wait until 2012. In the context of the current political situation, however, who knows who will be in power in 2012, or whether they will be inclined to implement any change?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para12"><a name="09051134000031">I am also concerned that the omission of action on the mandatory retirement age may contribute both to some people&#146;s false impression that such age discrimination is acceptable in this particular circumstance&#151;albeit in the short term&#151;and to a climate of opinion. Most Members will know someone who has been the victim of age discrimination, as will most of our constituents, because, in the real world of work, older employees, who may be valued by enlightened employers for their commitment, skills and experience, may be undervalued by other employers who see their age as a proxy for many undesirable qualities, from an inability to turn up in the morning to the likelihood of being ill, in poor health or inflexible. All those negative connotations might lead a bad employer, at a time of redundancies, to select older people for redundancy. That proxy is unfortunate and misplaced, but the assumptions, which are not based on the individual&#146;s health or qualities, may be very influential in their future employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para13"><a name="09051134000032">The age discrimination that many workers face often leads them to feel that their right to work is less certain, but it is not limited to people who are 64 and a half, as was mentioned earlier in the debate; it affects people in their 50s and, even, late 40s. They look to the future with some trepidation, concerned that a climate of opinion has not been fostered, because the Bill fails to address the mandatory retirement age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para14"><a name="09051134000033">Many people find retirement to be a time of freedom and opportunity, and their right to choose to retire should be protected. Others, however, want to work into later life, and it is an entirely laudable desire. They may want to maintain their network of colleagues and friends, and they may want and need to maintain their incomes by earning money for work that they have done. As has been said, it is ironic that this House, which legislates on matters such as mandatory retirement age, benefits from the contribution of Members who  <br>

have long passed their retirement age but still have a great contribution to make. It is even more ironic in respect of the other place. I have often been impressed by the clarity, incisiveness and, indeed, sheer trouble-making genius of people in the other place&#151;people who might, in other situations, be regarded as beyond working age or on the scrap heap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para15"><a name="09051134000034">Those are my concerns about the mandatory retirement age, and I hope to see them addressed in Committee. There is a great deal to welcome in the Bill. I have reservations, but Plaid Cymru Members will not support the Conservative amendment tonight.</p>

 I welcome the Bill and am pleased to speak in the debate. It is very important to bring together in a single Act those measures that have accumulated over many years, and I am delighted that we are extending protection to a number of groups, such as disabled people, carers and older people. On the consolidation of those measures, however, I contest totally what the Tory Opposition say. The Bill will make it easier, not more difficult, for individuals and businesses to understand and to use the legislation.</p>

I will return later to the questions that I wanted to ask the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May), because I am astonished that the Conservative Opposition are opposed to giving the Bill a Second Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para21"><a name="09051134000040">The promotion of equality has been central to my work since I became involved in politics&#151;indeed, in thinking about anything. Part of the motivating force for my becoming involved was to try to promote equality in all its facets, but the first time that I became involved in this place in its promotion was when we were trying to incorporate the provisions of the Good Friday agreement into what became the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Astonishingly, that legislation and agreement was way ahead of any that we had for England, Wales and Scotland. Interestingly, too, many groups in Northern Ireland, which were at the extremes of the political divide at the time, understood the power of tackling equality to undermine some of the worst things that were happening in society. It was a powerful tool for dealing with the disadvantaged and the causes of their suffering in that country, in respect of religion and other areas of equality. They strongly supported trying through the Good Friday agreement and then the 1998 Act to promote a view of equality that was way in advance of what we had on this side of the water.</p>

As I, and all of us, get older, the issue hits home more clearly. The mother of a woman who called Age Concern was buying something for &#163;150 at a leading department store. At the till, she was asked whether she wanted to apply for a charge card so that she could get a 10 per cent. discount. As soon as she said that she was 65, however, the cashier apologised and said that she could not have the card because she was too old. Why? Her money was good enough. I cannot get my head around why she should not have been entitled to the card just because she was older. If she had been about to get ill and drop dead, she would not have been able to buy the next item and get the 10 per cent. off. What was the problem?</p>

(Dr. Turner) made an interesting contribution on how we might address the issue. I hope that those points will be looked at further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para27"><a name="09051134000045">Some employers really welcome older employees. The management at the B&amp;Q in my area go out of their way to get older employees. The last thing that they want is a young whippersnapper who has never done any work on houses pretending that he knows how to advise customers on how to do things in the home; they want the person who has been doing the work for the past 40 years and knows what people want and need and knows what did not work when they were doing work on their house. That B&amp;Q goes out of its way to employ older people, so it is not all doom and gloom when it comes to ageism. The Bill provides a welcome move in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para28"><a name="09051134000046">On addressing socio-economic inequalities, I should say that the Conservative amendment misses the point. One of the party&#146;s reasons for not wanting the Bill to have a Second Reading is thatthe Bill</p>
<a name="90511-0014.htm_brev3"><a name="09051134000140"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;fails to address the root causes of the reduction in social mobility in recent years&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para29"><a name="09051134000047">The whole point of placing a new duty on Ministers, Departments and public bodies to consider what action they can take to reduce inequalities on socio-economic grounds is that there will be a mechanism to consider issues such as why we are not dealing with social mobility and why there are still socio-economic inequalities. That will be able to be done systematically across Departments. The Bill gives the precise mechanism that would address one of the criticisms in the Conservative motion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para30"><a name="09051134000048">I hope that the Conservative party will consider the issue again; it is valuable that at last we are saying that we need to address inequality in relation to class and socio-economic advantage. According to how I read it, the Bill is careful to say that that will not mean that a front-line decision by a service provider will suddenly be dealt with in that way; we will not suddenly find a doctor saying, &#147;I&#146;m not treating you because you come from too advantaged an area and you&#146;re too rich.&#148; However, it will require my primary care trust and local authority to consider health disparities and inequalities and how we can deal with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="90511-0014.htm_para31"><a name="09051134000049">The Bill makes positive inroads into one area of health inequality: it promotes women&#146;s ability to breastfeed in public. I was astonished by the bizarre intervention made by the hon. Member for Epping Forest; I am sorry that she is not still here. One would hardly know that most women whom I see breastfeeding in public are doing it; they are so discreet that they would not offend anybody. I do not know why it would, however. If it does, the problem belongs to the person being offended and not to the woman and child who are doing something that makes a vital contribution to reducing health inequalities. The World Health Organisation says that mothers should breastfeed.</p>

That puts them off doing it at all. If when they are   <br>

There is one in the Langley Mill Sure Start centre, recently visited by my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister for Women and Equality, and in other Sure Start centres. In the run-up to the elections, I am worried in case Derbyshire county council stops being Labour and our wonderful Sure Start centres are closed. They provide fantastic help, including on this issue, to less advantaged families to make sure that the kids have a good start in life. That would be threatened if we ended up with a Tory county council and a Tory Government; I just throw in that comment in passing. The breastfeeding element of the Bill is valuable.</p>

When I served on the Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Committee and we were writing the report on public procurement and the one entitled &#147;Jobs for the Girls&#148;, which was about trying to address the gender pay gap and inequalities, we heard public organisations say that public procurement could not be used in this context. We argued, however, that if public authorities have a duty to promote gender equality, they will fail if they do not ensure that those to whom they give contracts take suitable steps to try to address inequality in their employment and service practices. We saw a number of positive examples of how the &#163;175 billion of public procurement can be used to promote equality, and I am pleased at that.</p>

In 2007-08, 62,000 equal pay claims were brought, but the tribunals dealt with only 9,000 of them and only 678 were successful at tribunal.

We could not agree in the Committee on whether we should go forward with compulsory pay audits. However, we did say that if in future there was still limited progress on eliminating the gap, we should consider either introducing compulsory pay audits or imposing the equality duty on the private as well as the public sector.

A sprawling and complex mosaic of enactments has grown like Topsy over a period of 40 years, and it is high time that that was consolidated and distilled into one readily intelligible and accessible piece of legislation. It is a considerable tribute to the parliamentary draftspeople, intellectually and administratively, that they have accomplished that task.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="90511-0015.htm_para6"><a name="09051134000063">We should not then say, &#147;Well, it ends there&#148;, because consolidation is necessary but, frankly, not sufficient. Those who admire only the consolidatory features of the Bill are, in a sense, resting content with exiguous achievements. We need to go rather further than that. Let us look at the context and background to the unveiling of new and further measures. As the Minister for Women and Equality pointed out, it is 40 years next year since the passage of the Equal Pay Act 1970 and, despite all that has been achieved, the pay gap, though on a lesser scale, nevertheless stubbornly persists. People with disabilities are twice as likely to be out of work. Members of the ethnic minorities are 13 per cent. less likely to get a job. In schools, despite all the changes in legislation and, to a degree, in culture, children who are, or who are wrongly thought to be, lesbian, gay or bisexual are harassed and bullied on a monumental scale. Therefore, we cannot be self-satisfied. I am always suspicious of people who say, &#147;I&#146;m all in favour of equality, but it isn&#146;t really necessary to do anything about it&#148;, or, &#147;We&#146;re all in favour of equality&#148;&#151;end of argument, no requirement for legislation, and by the way, would it not be socially desirable to talk about some other subject altogether?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="90511-0015.htm_para7"><a name="09051134000064">The fact is that much remains to be done. I want, if I may, to focus on a number of features of the Bill that seem to lie at its heart. I mentioned some of the disadvantage that persists, but in a sense the biggest single problem with which we are confronted in all parties in this House is that social mobility, which is palpably a good after which we should all strive, has stalled at best and regressed at worse. That has happened under successive Governments, with attempts to do good here and there. It is a long-standing phenomenon, and we have to seek to arrest and reverse that trend. Hence the introduction of clause 1, with its imposition of the socio-economic duty. If one believed some of the more hysterical headlines and articles beneath them in the newspapers, one would think that this heralded the emergence of the vanguard of the revolution, and that truly one had to be a Marxist-Leninist, a Trotskyist or a workerist to believe in the imposition of such a clause. In fact, it simply entails an acknowledgment and a recognition that leaving things entirely to the market and the free play of those forces is not enough&#151;one must have some action from Government and Parliament of a protective and enabling character.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="90511-0015.htm_para8"><a name="09051134000065">Let me consider what attempts to reduce inequalities of outcome by the imposition of the socio-economic duty on public sector bodies might mean in practical terms. It might mean that in a particular area of notable disadvantage a health trust decides to focus its anti-smoking policy, or its smoking cessation service, on a disadvantaged community, in which there might be evidence to show that the incidence of nicotine addiction was much greater than elsewhere. That is an extremely good thing in the name of reducing health inequalities and encouraging and making more likely decent longevity in that community.</p>

On the other hand, someone who is uneducated, inarticulate, unaccustomed to expressing themselves in writing, fearful of appearing in front of some sort of formal panel or hearing, or simply weighed down by the multiplicity of other problems with which in their life they must daily contend will probably not get what their child needs. There is therefore a powerful case for saying &#147;Let&#146;s have the duty.&#148; My own Front Benchers are committed to a pupil premium, which is a form of positive action, and I cannot see what the great terror of this clause is.

and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) is an admirable parliamentarian, but his sense that there will be a competitive hierarchy of disadvantage, or alternatively of cases of positive action, will probably not be realised in practice. My view is that if a primary school has real difficulty in getting male teachers, and there are two candidates of equal merit, it should be permitted&#151;not prescribed&#151;for the school to opt for the man. Similarly, if there is a bank with an all-male, besuited board and not a woman in sight, and there is a strong woman candidate on the shortlist, it should be open to the bank to say, &#147;We will have the woman in the name of the diversity of the work force that will thereby result.&#148;</p>

progress will be made. Of course, it will apply only to approximately 0.5 per cent. of all businesses, so the idea that the decimation of the industrial or commercial base of the country and mass unemployment will result from this relatively modest and well-overdue provision seems somewhat far fetched.

 Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the plans whereby it would be very easy to do a pay audit of a company?

 I rather agree with that, and actually I think that that is true both of large companies and, to some extent, of small. In the case of large companies, it is probably relatively easy to collate and publish the material, because there will be an in-house personnel department.

for&#151;that is, my class and my background. The Bill will ensure, as much as we can, that employers and even educators will never be able to cite someone&#146;s accent as a reason for turning them down for a job or anything else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="90511-0016.htm_para1"><a name="09051134000094">In many ways, I am one of the lucky ones. I never wanted to be an MP when I was younger, because&#151;well, I would never have dreamed it was possible, coming from my background and with my life circumstances, and especially not because I am a woman. Working-class men from the north-east had made it here for generations, but not many working-class women had, if any. I am not totally sure, but I think I may have been the first working-class woman born and bred in the north-east to make it here to represent a north-east constituency, or any other type of constituency for that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="90511-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09051134000095">I have come a long way from doing the accounts and payroll at Tyneside Safety Glass. I left school at 16 to get a job, in order to help my mam financially with my two younger brothers, as she was on her own. That was at a time when the north-east was being ravaged by the consequences of the Conservative party&#146;s assault on industry, our communities and the way of life in the north-east. My breaks in life came through hard work, aspiration, determination and workplace education, which this Government have widened and enshrined in statute, through union learning reps and return to learn programmes, which have given hundreds of thousands of people, especially those from my generation&#151;the Thatcher generation&#151;a second chance in life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="90511-0016.htm_para3"><a name="09051134000096">Through membership of the Labour party, I found a passion for politics and a way to make a difference by trying to redress the balance and make life fairer for people like me across the country. Just as we cannot help the family circumstances we are born into, we cannot help where in the country we are born. However, when I was growing up, being born in the north-east made such a difference to my life opportunities and those of everyone around me. Some might say that it still does, but I believe that, thankfully, it does to a much lesser extent. The injustice of the north-south divide was&#151;and still is&#151;a huge driving force in my politics.</p>

My eventual selection came from an all-woman shortlist. I am currently the only woman MP in Tyne and Wear&#151;there is me and 12 men&#151;although hopefully that will change quite a bit at the next election, as my party has continued with that policy and selected more women to contest safe seats. That is the difference: women have to contest winnable seats, not just be allowed to stand in the marginals. However, none of that would have been possible had it not been for the determination of a few to create chances for the many. Those people were Labour people. I believe that this Bill, more than many others that I have seen in this House, reflects those deeply held values of fairness and equality.</p>

thereabouts in this Parliament. I do not know the total for all Parliaments ever, but a rough calculation suggests that it must be many thousands, if not tens of thousands. Two-hundred and ninety-one women and 120 still here makes 170 women MPs or thereabouts&#151;I might be a few out&#151;who have gone before us. Indeed, there are a few women MPs&#151;just a few though&#151;here now.</p>

That is why the Bill is doing just that. It is thanks to women on our Front Bench, and my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister for Women and Equality in particular, that we are in this position.</p>

 I am listening with great respect to the hon. Lady&#146;s speech. I accept that the Bill is fundamentally a social democratic or new Labour piece of legislation&#151;that is pretty unarguable&#151;but that does not mean that we should not support it when it is fundamentally right. I put it to the hon. Lady that although the Bill can be honourably opposed, some of the people out there in the country who oppose it do so because they are so comfortable with either their prejudices or their privileges that they do not want them to be disturbed.</p>

I wholeheartedly support the measures in the Bill to extend permission for all-women shortlists to 2030. The discrepancies that we see between the numbers of men and women in Parliament are still played out in society as a whole. Although the minimum wage has decreased the gender pay gap by 5 per cent., the gulf between male and female wage packets is still an unbelievable 21 per cent. In an enlightened society, where we women work just as hard as men, that is simply inexcusable. I congratulate the Minister on bringing an end to the tired excuses that we have heard so many times before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="90511-0016.htm_para8"><a name="09051134000103">We also need to bolster skills among women. That is why the public sector equality duty will be so vital in continuing to unlock talent. According to the women and work commission, closing the gender skills gap could increase GDP by between &#163;15 billion and &#163;23 billion a year. I cannot imagine the naysayers sniffing at that, especially not during such difficult times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="90511-0016.htm_para9"><a name="09051134000104">In our current economic climate, we sometimes find that women are harder hit than men. In the north-east, figures show that female unemployment increased three months before men had to face the same problems. Although those figures have begun to level off, it just goes to show how much variety exists between the typical &#147;male&#148; job market and the typical &#147;female&#148; job market, which is more often than not part time and low paid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="90511-0016.htm_para10"><a name="09051134000105">We know that legislation is not a catch-all solution.

I am ever so pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) is in the Chamber and will speak, too. He has led a fantastic campaign on this matter. I am really pleased, as I am sure he will be, that that has been recognised and that provision has been made in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="90511-0016.htm_para11"><a name="09051134000106">It is a well-established fact that wherever possible, breast is best. I breastfed both my children, my second until 18 months&#151;she was very eager, and it took some work to bring it to an end&#151;and I evangelise on the merits of doing so, as does Bosom Buddies, which runs schemes at Sure Starts units and children&#146;s centres in my constituency and, I am sure, across the country. Bosom Buddies is a project where breastfeeding mums partner and mentor pregnant mums and new mums. They encourage and help them to start to breastfeed and to continue to do so. It is a very good project and I fully endorse it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="90511-0016.htm_para12"><a name="09051134000107">In numerous studies, breastfeeding has been shown to be the healthiest way to feed babies. In addition to providing the essential nutrients and sustenance, it greatly reduces the risk of babies developing health problems such as gastroenteritis, asthma, diabetes and obesity and helps to protect women from breast and ovarian cancer. In comparison with a formula-fed baby, a breastfed baby is five times less likely to be hospitalised with gastroenteritis. It is estimated that if all babies were breastfed the NHS would save up to &#163;50 million a year in dealing with such illnesses. I know that that is just one example, but it is a real example of how this Bill will make small changes that will have a big impact on individual lives as well as on the fabric of our nation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="90511-0016.htm_para13"><a name="09051134000108">One group of people for whom the Bill can have a transformative impact are carers. I was pleased to receive a briefing from Carers UK that sets out its support for the Bill and in particular welcomes the provisions that extend protection against discrimination and harassment to someone who is associated with caring for a disabled person, in effect giving carers new rights in the workplace and in the provision of services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="90511-0016.htm_para14"><a name="09051134000109">We need to look more closely in the Committee&#151;on which I hope to be able to serve&#151;at the true effect of a handful of provisions. The right to request adjustments and flexible working practices is one of the significant steps taken by the Government to boost workplace opportunities for all. As the Bill stands, those rights will be created for disabled people but not for carers, many of whom would benefit hugely from receiving the same rights. Given the already ambitious nature of the Bill, I wonder whether my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister for Women and Equality might be willing to go that one extra step for the carers who already save the economy billions of pounds a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="90511-0016.htm_para15"><a name="09051134000110">We also need to ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place so that the duties and rights set out in the Bill are properly enforced. In short, we should be wary of missing a trick. There remains a real difficulty for disabled passengers travelling by air. I have had to table early-day motions in the past to draw the House&#146;s attention to the less than exemplary practice of one airline that insists on disabled customers telephoning premium rate telephone numbers to secure seats, incurring extortionate extra costs.</p>

 I would certainly agree that the Labour party had a very good record on equality up to the 1997 general election. Indeed, I think that it was the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow), who has contributed enormously well to the debate on a number of occasions, who pointed out that it was a social democratic approach&#151;I would say that it is also liberal. It is no surprise, therefore, that Roy Jenkins was so heavily involved in the Labour party in the moves to provide equality in certain areas at a time when it was less popular to do so and less acceptable than it is now.</p>

That is a sign that the Government are pushing against an extremely open door in a way that the Labour party could not when it introduced earlier legislative proposals to provide for equality. The Government are implementing, quite rightly, their manifesto commitment to abolish unjustified discrimination wherever it exists. My regret is that that was a 1997 election manifesto commitment. Over the 12 years for which I have been a Member of this House, I have questioned why it has taken so long for the Government and the House to do some of the things that could have been done many years previously.</p>

We opposed section 28 when it was introduced, for example, and pressed for an early end to discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation. We first tabled amendments to the criminal law in 1998 to bring in laws on sexual offences that treated people equally, regardless of sexual orientation. That legislation was enacted in 2003. The Government were forced by European judgments to bring in equality on the ground of sexual orientation in the armed forces, but they should have done so before. We also urged them to introduce civil partnerships legislation, which they have now done, and supported them to the hilt when they introduced the controversial&#151;for some&#151;regulations on the provision of goods and services without discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90511-0016.htm_para22"><a name="09051134000118">I ought to declare a couple of interests. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which has performed significant scrutiny of previous equality legislation and proposes to do much more on this Bill. We have already had a very useful and mutually beneficial meeting with officials from the equalities team. I also hold honorary positions with the British Humanist Association, the Liberal Democrat lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender campaign, and the National Secular Society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="90511-0016.htm_para23"><a name="09051134000119">Before I start on my three topics, I want to point out that inequality is a vital issue in this country. It is terrible that the gap between the rich and the poor has got wider. The rich, even in this recession, are far richer than they were 12 years ago, and, even before the recession, the poor were relatively poorer than they were before. Radical action is needed, and my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone) has already said that she does not think that the provisions in the Bill represent that radical action. It is policies that will bring about the end of inequality, including policies on taxation. I am still astounded about what has happened on tax policy over the last three Parliaments. The fair taxes have not been increased, but the regressive ones have. For the Conservative party to say that it wants to do something about the inequality in wealth between the rich and the poor while its flagship policy is to cut the tax payable by the richest estates in the country is simply astonishing.</p>

Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry) to make a point about political correctness, and I should like to say to him that the Campaign Against Political Correctness might be against the Bill, but political correctness can work both ways. If it is politically correct to say that it is not acceptable&#151;I mean socially acceptable; I am not arguing about criminality here&#151;to call people &#147;cripples&#148; or &#147;spastics&#148;, then I support political correctness. If supporting political correctness means that it becomes unacceptable&#151;even in private, where it would not be against the law&#151;to call people &#147;sooty&#148; or &#147;Paki&#148;, then I support political correctness. The hon. Gentleman needs to define what he means by political correctness. If he defines it very narrowly, I might agree with him, but it is not enough just to talk about it as the tabloids do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="90511-0016.htm_para25"><a name="09051134000121">My first topic is the balance between free speech and laws that protect people. What kind of protection are we talking about in anti-harassment provisions? We are talking about the freedom from being offended, or worse. I certainly accept that this is not just about being offended. This can occur in public, in employment and in the provision of goods and services, including a special case involving public services and the delivery of public functions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="90511-0016.htm_para26"><a name="09051134000122">In public, the Government have rightly accepted that there is a difference between homophobic or religious hatred and, for example, racial hatred, because the offence involved is very narrow.

religious beliefs of others. Similarly, I have argued for amendment of section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986, which criminalises the use of insult as being likely to cause distress, goes too far and could lead to bizarre prosecutions or investigations by the police.

Even if there were no prosecution under harassment law, as it were, I think it would be wrong if employers decided to take a strong view simply because someone felt that their dignity was violated because they were gay or knew someone who was gay and could not accept anyone sincerely disagreeing with them and using non-abusive language. I believe that that is going too far; we should not have to read that sort of press story or hear about that sort of activity. Here, I stand four-square with religious people who feel that they are not allowed to say those sorts of things. I do not recommend it, of course, but if they avoid abusive language, that is acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="90511-0016.htm_para32"><a name="09051134000128">With goods and services, the Government are right not to include harassment provisions relating to sexual orientation or religion. It was right that the Northern Ireland provisions were essentially struck down and have not been reintroduced in the Bill. It is impossible to restrict people&#146;s ability to explain their point of view when not providing goods and services. When it comes to the provision of public services and public functions, the question remains whether there might be scope for introducing some protection from harassment; gross harassment, of course, is discrimination.</p>

unjustified discrimination in our constitution. My Bill received support from all political parties, but it was talked out by the Lord Chancellor, no less, on Second Reading. I think that religious organisations, however, show too great a willingness to want to discriminate against other people. They accept the protections that they have been given, but want the scope to discriminate against other people&#151;for example, on grounds of sexual orientation or religion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para1"><a name="09051134000130">Schedule 9 deals with exemptions for religions in respect of employment. I recognise that the drafting here is better than it was in the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003. The import of the Amicus case has been included, where the provision states that a post with a sexual orientation test has to be one clearly involved in proselytising and not another. The subsequent provisions on page 182 of the Bill are, sadly, weaker, allowing organisations with a religious ethos not to have to justify the discrimination that they may wish to indulge in on grounds of religion, for example. Nevertheless, even that is better than the coach and horses run through the spirit of the Bill by the Schools Standards and Frameworks Act 1998, particularly sections 68, 69 and 70. As I was told by a maths teacher working in a state school funded 100 per cent. by the taxpayer, those provisions allow schools to tell teachers&#151;regardless of whether they are teaching religious education&#151;that they must have &#147;Jesus in your heart&#148;. Is that really necessary for someone teaching maths in a primary school? What is going on? I find it regrettable that the Government have not taken the opportunity to recognise that organisations with a certain ethos can, if necessary, be governed by provisions that already operate in relation to a religious test, as opposed to a broad exception involving many other posts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para2"><a name="09051134000131">As for the provision of goods and services, the problem still exists that schools are allowed to discriminate and segregate on the basis of religion. In an area containing, say, four schools, where one has a religious intake and can segregate and discriminate, children or families adhering to the religion concerned can choose any of those four schools, while everyone else has a choice of only three. If that is coupled with the public duty to provide equality of opportunity, a huge amount of pressure will be exerted for everyone to have their own school that discriminates, and I do not think that that is a good idea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para3"><a name="09051134000132">The provision of public services involves a key question. Should there be a right to discriminate on grounds of religion, or indeed sexual orientation? I hope that, in Committee, the Government will recognise that the Employment Appeal Tribunal was correct in saying, in the case of the Islington registrar Lillian Ladele, that it was wrong for someone providing a public service to be allowed to discriminate, and that the council was right to say that everyone doing that job must not treat people differently according to their sexual orientation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para4"><a name="09051134000133">We have read of a dentist who wants to require his women patients to wear a hijab before being able to access health care either on the NHS or privately. That cannot be right. Reasonable adjustment may be possible. For example, a cook may not want to cook pork. That does not involve discriminating against human beings, at least in respect of what they are doing, and it does not necessarily involve a public function.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para5"><a name="09051134000134">Finally, let me say something about the positive duty in regard to religion. Religion is different from the other strands. For example, it is not essential or immutable in the same way as race or gender. Religious beliefs give rise to policies and practices that are highly contested, unlike the other strands. Representatives of religions &#151;rightly, in many cases&#151;feel the need to proselytise in order to secure new followers, unlike representatives of other strands. Some religions campaign actively against equal treatment in relation to other strands, as they have a right to do. They are unique in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para6"><a name="09051134000135">For that reason, I think that, while we should ensure that there is a public duty to end discrimination on religious grounds and promote social cohesion, tackling inequality relating to religion may actually increase religious sensitivities. People may feel that they are not being given what someone else is being given because of historic service provision in that area, and may want the same for themselves. An example is the demand for it to be considered that sharia law might be given more status in relation to other religious laws.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para7"><a name="09051134000136">Those are the issues that I hope to raise in Committee.</p>

Friend the Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt), who is not here at the moment, said in her excellent speech, hon. Members have received a number of excellent briefings. I want to begin by quoting from the TUC briefing, because it sums up what I think about the Bill:</p>
<a name="90511-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="0905122001125"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The TUC welcomes the introduction of a single Equality Bill. It has long campaigned for a single Act to bring together the numerous discrimination laws that have developed over many decades. It also welcomes the fact that the Government has used this opportunity to harmonise upwards and to strengthen protection in some areas&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para9"><a name="0905122000010">most notably age and carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para10"><a name="0905122000011">I also want to begin by thanking my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister for Women and Equality and my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General for steering this Bill through to its Second Reading. They have both long championed equalities issues when it was not necessarily fashionable to do so, and all Labour Members owe them a huge debt of gratitude for their excellent legislation, which we now have on the statute book because of their efforts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para11"><a name="0905122000012">The Bill is very much about developing Labour&#146;s fairness agenda. One of its most important aspects is the new duty on public bodies to consider how to reduce socio-economic inequalities. That is important in two key respects. First, imposing that duty on public bodies and Ministers may ensure that, across government, we get much closer attention to how policies and policy development will reduce socio-economic inequalities. That has been some time in coming. Labour has had an important agenda to tackle inequalities, but we must recognise that we need to do more, in particular to foster the cause of social mobility. I hope that this duty helps us to continue to develop policies to support  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="11 May 2009">

<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>11 May 2009 : Column 630</b><br>
social mobility. Secondly, the duty will enable all of us in society to have a stronger look at what is happening in local government and other public sector bodies. It has long been my contention that sometimes local government and other bodies have managed to subvert Labour&#146;s equality agenda and not implement policies effectively locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para12"><a name="0905122000013">I am truly sorry that the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone) is not present at the moment. She gave a very thoughtful and well-considered speech, and I agreed with a great deal of it. I must say, however, that my own local authority of Durham City had a truly appalling record on tackling inequality. In fact, its policies achieved the opposite end. When the authority in question was in power, by selling off land in some of our most disadvantaged communities and reinvesting the capital gain from that land not in the local villages, but in city centre projects mostly used by the very affluent or upper middle class, it ensured that a transfer of resources did, indeed, take place, but it was from disadvantaged areas to the more advantaged areas. Similarly, the authority did not use the considerable house building that was taking place through planning law to enable it to build more affordable housing. It did exactly the opposite: where possible, it gave planning permission without any requirement to produce any affordable housing either within the development concerned or anywhere else in the city. I therefore want to check with my hon. Friends on the Labour Front Bench that this duty would require local authorities to explain why they wanted to implement policies that would exacerbate inequalities rather than attempt to reduce them.</p>

 I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention, which demonstrates that we need to take further action with regard to local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para14"><a name="0905122000021">Other measures that I wish specifically to mention are those banning age discrimination outside the workplace and, importantly, those removing discrimination against carers. I cannot understand why the Conservative party is going to vote against the Bill, because it is so important that we continue to support carers and to remove discrimination against them. I had to re-read the first sentence of the Conservatives&#146; reasoned amendment a few times, because I thought that they had missed something. Obviously the Bill seeks to address</p>
<a name="90511-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="0905122001126"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the root causes of the reduction in social mobility&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para15"><a name="0905122000022">The Bill does attempt to address the root causes of social inequality. If the socio-economic duty been provided for at the back end of clause 194, I might have understood the Conservatives&#146; missing it, but of course the duty falls within the first clause. Labour Members may find it interesting to be given further explanation by the Conservative party as to why it is not supporting the Bill this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para16"><a name="0905122000023">Other key features of the Bill are equally important, and for some of us they have, as I said, been a long time coming. They include the further action to promote equal pay. As we know, public sector bodies will have to produce a gender pay report&#151;the Government are going to consult the public bodies on how they might do that&#151;and for private sector companies with more than 250 employees this will not be compulsory until after 2015. That is an important step forward in gaining a fuller understanding of why we still have the gender pay gap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para17"><a name="0905122000024">There are two areas that we might wish to examine further, however, and discuss in Committee. The first is what we need to do to get rid of occupational segregation. It remains a problem and it is one of the reasons why women continue to have lower earnings than men. We must examine our education policies and our learning and skills policies across the board to see what more we can do to attract both men and women into a wider range of occupations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para18"><a name="0905122000025">The second issue, which the Bill goes some way towards addressing, is the need to get rid of secrecy in respect of people&#146;s pay. Unless we have a full understanding of what people are paid, we will not be fully able to develop policies to address the issue. I know that there are key areas that we could cite&#151;I hate to say it, but academia is one&#151;where it is not always clear what people are earning. We know that in private sector companies it is also not clear and transparent what people are earning. We need to take further action on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para19"><a name="0905122000026">Other hon. Members have mentioned the importance of measures to protect women who are breastfeeding from being removed from places such as restaurants and public galleries. The measures in the Bill are greatly to be welcomed. It is disgraceful that in the 21st century we have to legislate to ensure that women will not be discriminated against because they are breastfeeding. Hon. Friends stressed earlier how important breastfeeding is in reducing inequalities right from day one of a child&#146;s life. We know that it is women from socially disadvantaged backgrounds who are less likely to breastfeed their children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para20"><a name="0905122000027">I have experience of working in a project for Save the Children many years ago in Sunderland, where a community health project was working with local women and desperately trying to support them in breastfeeding. It was very difficult. We had many cultural hurdles to overcome, and years of work were undone in an instant by somebody going into one of the shops in the city centre and being asked to leave. That spread around the local community and rendered useless much of the work that had been done. We know that Sure Start projects are doing a great deal of work to encourage breastfeeding and we do not want that work to be undermined by women being excluded or made to feel uncomfortable. As was said earlier, most women who breastfeed in public manage to do it discreetly and should be encouraged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para21"><a name="0905122000028">I turn to public sector procurement. Public sector contracts account for about &#163;175 billion-worth of expenditure. It is important that when contracts are awarded by the public sector, they are given to companies that are exemplars of good industrial relations across the board and have excellent equal opportunities policies. I also want to make sure that public sector procurement is used to support the green agenda, and I am sure it is possible to marry the two.</p>

I know that this is a minor or a side issue, but I am pleased that the Government are addressing it. I remember a teatime conversation many years ago at home with my brothers and some of their friends, who are all golf enthusiasts. They were talking about a motion that was coming before their committee from the women, asking if they could play one of the days at the weekend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para23"><a name="0905122000032">My brothers were discussing what they would do about that. They were probably sorry that they asked for my opinion. I asked, &#147;Why wouldn&#146;t women be able to play at weekends?&#148; They said, &#147;The issue is that women can play during the week, but men can&#146;t because they are at work.&#148; This was the early 1980s, and I gave them a mini-lecture on the percentage of women who were employed outside the home. That proportion has continued to rise since the early 1980s, so the rationale for restricting women&#146;s playing time, which was ridiculous then, is even more so now. I am pleased that, thanks to the Bill, a golf club will not be able to prohibit its female members from playing on certain days, while allowing men to play whenever they like. It might be a peripheral issue in some ways, but I am pleased that we have got there. It is about time, too.</p>

we should not be so surprised. Their progress has been very slow&#151;much slower than ours&#151;mainly because they have not taken the difficult decisions, such as introducing all-women shortlists, to increase women&#146;s representation. We know that informal mechanisms are important and we all need to do more to encourage women, young people and those from ethnic minorities to come forward and think about entering formal politics, but without formal mechanisms progress is too slow.</p>

 If the Government decide to call something the Equality Bill, they expect everyone to support it because we are, of course, all in favour of equality. But this is the most incredibly misleadingly titled Bill, as one of its central planks is not to enshrine equality in law but to reintroduce discrimination into the workplace. We heard earlier how 40 years ago Labour Governments banned race and sex discrimination in the workplace, but this Bill tries to bring it back via the back door and&#151;unbelievably&#151;in the name of equality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="90511-0017.htm_para27"><a name="0905122000037">The Bill has nothing to do with equality. It is all about the politically correct extremism of the Leader of the House and her trendy, left-wing prejudices. Most people who support the concept of equality support the concept of equality of opportunity, but this Bill is not interested in that. It is about a socialist, 1980s Labour party agenda of equality of outcome. Indeed, page 1 of this long-winded Bill explicitly says that it is</p>
<a name="90511-0017.htm_brev2"><a name="0905122001127"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;designed to reduce the inequalities of outcome which result from socio-economic disadvantage&#148;.</p>

They have the nerve in their explanatory notes to give the example that this would lead to a duty on local education authorities to ensure that children from deprived areas have a better chance of securing a place at their school of choice. This from the Government who hate grammar schools, which probably did more than anything else to enable kids from the poorest backgrounds to access the best schools, and who scrapped the assisted places scheme, which paid for the brightest kids from the poorest backgrounds to get the best education at top private schools. Perhaps the Solicitor-General will make it clear when she winds up that this provision will mean that many of the parents in my constituency, who live in villages close to popular primary schools such as Eldwick, Burley-in-Wharfedale and Bingley, will be unable to send their children to their local school as pupils from poorer areas will be bussed in to take their place. Is that really what the Bill proposes?</p>

My question to all those Labour Members who say, &#147;It&#146;s so important that we have more women in Parliament&#148; is: will they support Conservative women candidates who stand against Labour men in marginal seats? If it is so important to have more women in Parliament, come what may, I might presume that they would.

Birmingham. Good public sector authorities, such as local councils and health authorities, do consider and map deprivation and poverty, and try to focus policy on the most disadvantaged to get the best out of the area. They certainly do so in Poole, and the Bournemouth and Poole teaching primary care trust certainly does so. There is an awful lot that can be done.</p>

It is quite clear that we live in an age in which one of the principal problems is longevity. People&#151;particularly men&#151;are pretty fit and able to go on working at 65. We need to take a radical look at the issue. I know that there are all sorts of problems to do with the national insurance system and the benefit system. I have recently dealt with cases in which people who have become disabled before 65 could claim all sorts of things, but those who become disabled after 65 could not do so. We must think creatively about how we can keep people productively in the economy, if that is what they wish. We know that there is a major pension problem, and, if people wish to work longer not only to enhance their retirement, public policy should try to do everything to make it possible.</p>

However, it means that the injustice that occurs when people are discriminated against simply because of age is becoming more acute, and that is why we must act: no more refusing the store card, travel insurance or the hire car simply because of age. I agree with him that other big issues must be confronted, too, such as why carer&#146;s allowance stops when a person reaches the state retirement and pension age.

I do not think the House should support that solution; one of the things that Ministers need to do&#151;it is one of the reasons for our reasoned amendment&#151;is to go away and think again about that element of the Bill. With the parliamentary draftsmen, they should draft a clause that will be of comfort to businesses such as Saga and the others that have been mentioned so that those companies can have confidence in their business models.

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="90511-0019.htm_para3"><a name="0905122000087">Many Members have spoken about the gender pay gap. According to the Government&#146;s own &#147;Framework for a Fairer Future&#148; White Paper, the gender pay gap is 12.6 per cent. in respect of full-time earnings. However, hon. Members may not be aware that there is also a disability pay gap in many businesses&#151;and, indeed, in the Government. The pay gap between disabled and non-disabled employees in the civil service is larger than the gender pay gap. In some Departments, such as the Home Office, disabled employees are paid 30 per cent. less on average than non-disabled employees. There is a way to go on that issue. In its Second Reading brief, RADAR said that the disability pay gap had been sorely neglected and it demanded that it be given a higher priority. That neglect is not fair, and it backs up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Poole about being able to hire the best talent and enabling people to be successful in organisations through promotion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="90511-0019.htm_para4"><a name="0905122000088">Another key test for the Bill will be whether it makes it easier rather than more difficult for the public sector and businesses to promote equality. The single public sector duty in the Bill will replace the three existing ones. It is important that the new duty should focus on outcomes, not processes. We need to see more fairness in the delivery of public services, not just an obligation for them to comply with ever more bureaucracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="90511-0019.htm_para5"><a name="0905122000089">We have a difference with the Government on pay audits. We think that their proposal is bureaucratic and burdensome and that there is no guarantee that the issues will be addressed. I also note that the audits are not to apply to the public sector. Ministers have said that they plan to use regulation-making powers in the  <br>

Bill to impose similar burdens on the public sector, but those specific proposals are not in the Bill. If they are saying that the private sector should have to comply with certain requirements, then exactly the same ones should apply to the public sector: there should not be one law for one and another law for the other. Our proposals for having compulsory pay audits in force when tribunals have found employees guilty of discrimination are a more proportionate solution.</p>

<p><a name="st_o368"><a name="0905122000090"><a name="90511-0019.htm_spnew0"><a name="0905122001202"><b>Judy Mallaber:</b>
 Has the hon. Gentleman done any research on exactly how many employers have been found guilty? We know how many cases there have been, but has he done any analysis of how many employers are in that position compared with the far larger number of cases that have been settled and the infinitely larger number of cases that have not even got through the tribunals? How much research has been done on whether the Conservative proposal would be in any way effective?</p>

<p><a name="st_o369"><a name="0905122000091"><a name="90511-0019.htm_spnew1"><a name="0905122001203"><b>Mr. Harper:</b>
 It is for the Government to prove their case. Clearly, the hon. Lady has concerns about the way the Government run the tribunals service, which is not effective. It may be for Ministers in the Ministry of Justice to look at how that is working and how effective it is before she complains about our reasonable and proportionate proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="90511-0019.htm_para6"><a name="0905122000092">On positive action&#151;or positive discrimination, as the Minister perhaps more accurately, albeit inadvertently, called it in her opening remarks&#151;the Bill&#146;s proposals seem to allow employers to discriminate in favour of candidates who are not the most qualified for the job. The argument that has been advanced, and is indeed supported by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, concerns the example of a primary school where there are two equally qualified candidates and it was wished to hire one rather than the other because of the diversity of the work force. It seems to me that if those candidates are truly equally qualified, and it genuinely is a tie-break situation, there is nothing in the existing law that would stop that happening. If, however, the Bill allows organisations to go further and have a wholesale choosing of candidates when they are not the most qualified for the job, that would be discrimination. It could give rise to situations such as that which recently occurred in my own county of Gloucestershire when our police force was actively discriminating against white people; that was found to be unlawful, and it had to stop it. That had a very negative effect on diversity and gave fairness and diversity a bad name. We should not be promoting that sort of behaviour, and if that is what the Bill allows, as I fear it does, we should not be in favour of these proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="90511-0019.htm_para7"><a name="0905122000093">Let me turn to disability. The hon. Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry) is right to say that we must recognise that disability discrimination needs to be approached differently. Indeed, that was the conclusion of the Work and Pensions Committee in its report. As he said, in order to create a level playing field and have genuine equality of opportunity, it is often necessary to take positive steps to ensure that disabled people are treated fairly. We are glad that that has been recognised in the Bill and that the Government have responded to the judgment in the Malcolm case, and we will be testing to see how their proposals work in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="90511-0019.htm_para8"><a name="0905122000094">The hon. Gentleman also referred to improvements in disabled people getting into work. I have checked the official figures, and some progress has been made; I pay tribute to the Government for that. In 1999, the employment rate for disabled people stood at 46 per cent., and it has now risen to about 50 per cent. There has been some progress, but there is a considerable way to go. We have come up with some ambitious welfare reform proposals because we want that to go further and faster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="90511-0019.htm_para9"><a name="0905122000095">The socio-economic part of the Bill&#151;part 1&#151;is the biggest disappointment. No one will disagree that the widening gap between the rich and poor and declining social mobility under this Government need to be addressed. Indeed, a recent study from the London School of Economics showed that in Britain social mobility had declined and that the gap between rich and poor was getting wider. A careful comparison of several countries revealed that the United States and Britain were at the bottom, with the lowest social mobility, but in Britain it was getting worse. Those problems clearly need to be tackled: we cannot just wish them away or legislate them away. The Government thought they had legislated away fuel poverty, but it still exists. They plan to pass a Bill to eliminate child poverty, but last week it rose, yet again, by 100,000. It is going in the wrong direction, and simply passing a Bill will not solve the problem. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead said at the start of the debate, if we are to tackle these problems we need to tackle the root causes&#151;family breakdown, poor education and worklessness. Real action will solve them, such as our proposals to give parents more power and allow good schools to expand and new schools to open where there is demand.</p>

 No, because I want to come to that at the end of my speech, for which the hon. Gentleman will have to wait with bated breath. First, I wish to touch on some of the contributions that hon. Members have made. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous), in an intervention on the Minister for Women and Equality, made an important point about discrimination in employment. One of his local businesses placed an advert that said, &#147;If you do not speak Polish, please do not apply as your application will not be considered.&#148; That was not for a job involving translation but for a job on the minimum wage as a picker-packer in a factory environment. Such discrimination should be unlawful. Rather than saying that the worker had to speak Polish because there were other Polish employees, perhaps the company should have ensured that all those other employees could speak English. It should not be acceptable to say that someone has to be able to speak a minority language in order to get a job of which that is not an essential part. I would be grateful if the Solicitor-General could confirm whether such an advertisement is lawful today. If so, perhaps she will confirm whether the Bill will change that.</p>

Friend was worried that action against discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy and maternity had become weaker, but clauses 16 and 17 will make it stronger.

The proposals in the Bill will help enormously. She would impose mandatory pay audits on all businesses. What do we do, then, about those that have already done audits and are working by consensus with their work forces towards equality? What do we do about those businesses that do not necessarily know that they have systemic pay inequality, but which, when our transparency provisions start to work, will see it and move consensually towards equality?

Equal pay progress has been far too slow, because much of it is hidden, sometimes perhaps even to the employer, but knowledge of inequity is power to get rid of it, and that is what we will give. She suggested representative action, and there is a lot to be said for taking the burden off an individual when discrimination is systemic.

and minority ethnic people we say: here is your future. Heightened opportunities and fair treatment are in sight; this Bill is for you. To women&#151;half the population, hamstrung by low pay and historic discrimination&#151;here at last is a great lever to change culture. This Bill is undoubtedly for us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="90511-0020.htm_para7"><a name="0905122000129">The Bill has been supported by practically all the stakeholder groups in all the sectors that it addresses. When those who would oppose it were pressed to name the groups that support voting it down at this stage, the best the Tories could come up with was&#151;what is it called?&#151;the society against political correctness. [Hon. Members: &#147;You couldn&#146;t make it up!&#148;] I have not made it up. Shall I say it again? The society against political correctness was the only group the Tories could cite that wants them to vote down the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_o375"><a name="0905122000130"><a name="90511-0020.htm_spnew0"><a name="0905122001209"><b>Mrs. Laing:</b>
 I thank the hon. and learned Lady for giving way. She knows perfectly well that the joke by my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) about the society against political correctness does not reflect the view of the Conservative party in general, which is in favour of the consolidation measures in the Bill, as we have said again and again. The hon. and learned Lady has denied knowing that, but we are in favour of those measures, and of the issue of equality. She is misrepresenting our views, but the reasoned amendment is more reasonable than the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_o376"><a name="0905122000131"><a name="90511-0020.htm_spmin0"><a name="0905122001210"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b>
 I am really sorry; I have wound the hon. Lady up again. I suspect that it is Shipley, not Maidenhead, that governs the Tory party when it comes to equality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="90511-0020.htm_para8"><a name="0905122000132">I say to all these groups: the Tories will streamline your current rights that have been hard fought for over 40 years. They will tidy them up, but they will vote against this Bill. They will say to you: &#147;You&#146;ve come far enough. Not a single step more! You&#146;ve come as far as you&#146;re getting. You&#146;ve had all you can have, and you&#146;ll never get further.&#148; I say to you: under Labour, this Bill is your future. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

 It is 80 years and one day precisely since Alexander Fleming&#146;s research paper &#147;On the antibacterial action of cultures of a Penicillium&#148; was submitted for publication in <i> The British Journal of Experimental Pathology</i>. In the paper he wrote:</p>
<a name="90511-0021.htm_brev12"><a name="0905122001160"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;While working with staphylococcus variants a number of culture plates were set aside on the laboratory bench and examined from time to time. In the examinations these plates were necessarily exposed to the air and they became contaminated with various micro-organisms. It was noticed that around a large colony of a contaminating mould the staphylococcus colonies became transparent and were obviously undergoing lysis.</p>
</ul><a name="90511-0021.htm_brev13"><a name="0905122001161"><ul><p class="tabletext">Subcultures of the mould were made...it was found that broth in which the mould had been grown....had acquired marked inhibitory, bactericidal and bacteriolytic properties to many of the more common pathogenic bacteria.</p>
</ul><a name="90511-0021.htm_brev14"><a name="0905122001162"><ul><p class="tabletext">In the rest of this article allusion will be made to experiments with filtrates of broth cultures of this mould. For convenience and to avoid the repetition of the rather cumbersome phrase &#145;Mould broth filtrate&#146; the name &#145;penicillin&#146; will be used.&#148;</p>

The history tells us much about the nature of scientific discovery, the development of treatments and some of the outside factors that can influence the direction of research, development and human benefit, both positively and negatively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para13"><a name="0905122001093">On 6 August 1881, Alexander Fleming was born at Lochfield farm, near Darvel, the youngest of eight children. He received his first schooling at Loudoun Moor school, went to the village school in Darvel at the age of 10, then two years later, continued his education at Kilmarnock academy. On 24 April this year, standing in the garden of the isolated Lochfield farm, now restored by Phillip and Heather Scott, surveying the landscape that the young Fleming had crossed daily just to get to the place of his early education, I sensed the determination to learn that must have driven him on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para14"><a name="0905122001094">On the same day, examining the contemporary Kilmarnock academy school register, preserved with other Fleming memorabilia by Carole Ford, the head teacher, and Stephen King, the school librarian and archivist, and noting just how many of Fleming&#146;s contemporaries died prematurely of infections, I got a sense of what may have motivated his zeal for fighting those very infections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para15"><a name="0905122001095">Any school that boasts two Nobel laureates merits a special word of public recognition. Kilmarnock academy is entitled to that boast, because of Alexander Fleming and John Boyd Orr, the Scottish teacher, doctor, biologist and politician. When Fleming was 14 he joined an elder brother in London, where after two more years of education he commenced work as a clerk in a shipping company. Four years later, a legacy enabled him to enter St. Mary&#146;s hospital medical school, Paddington, where he excelled in his studies and in numerous sports. He qualified in 1908 and, attracted by research work, entered  <br>

the laboratories of Sir Almroth Wright at St. Mary&#146;s, working on the nature of immunity and the treatment of bacterial infection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para16"><a name="0905122001096">In 1909, the German chemist-physician Paul Ehrlich developed a chemical treatment for syphilis. He had tried hundreds of compounds, and the 666th worked. It was named salvarsan, which means &#147;that which saves by arsenic&#148;. The only previous treatments for the disease had been so toxic as often to kill the patient. Ehrlich brought news of his treatment to London, where Fleming became one of very few physicians to administer salvarsan. He did so with the new and difficult technique of intravenous injection. He soon developed such a busy practice that he got the nickname &#147;Private 606&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para17"><a name="0905122001097">That was the beginning of the age of chemotherapy of infections, with the use of salvarsan, and the beginning of Fleming&#146;s long interest in the use of chemical antiseptics in the treatment of infections, and in ways of aiding the body&#146;s natural protective mechanisms against infection. During the first world war, Fleming served in the Royal Army Medical Corps, working in a laboratory in France to study the treatment of infected war wounds. In 1921, back at St. Mary&#146;s, he discovered lysozyme,</p>
<a name="90511-0021.htm_brev15"><a name="0905122001163"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a substance present in the tissues and secretions of the body which is rapidly capable of dissolving certain bacteria.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para18"><a name="0905122001098">Like Fleming&#146;s discovery of penicillin, his discovery of lysozyme was the result of shrewd observation and the investigation of an unplanned event: he had a cold and observed that the drips from his nose caused lysis of bacteria where they were mixed on the culture plate. He long considered the discovery of lysozyme more important than that of penicillin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para19"><a name="0905122001099">In September 1928, Fleming discovered penicillin when he returned from a six-week holiday and observed the classic clearing or lysis of the bacterial colonies around the contaminating mould, later identified as penicillium notatum. The irony is that modern &#147;good laboratory practice&#148; would probably have dictated that the old culture plates would have been disposed of long since and not left lying around for the mould to grow. The discovery was made and Fleming is reported to have remarked of his observation, &#147;That&#146;s funny.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para20"><a name="0905122001100">Fleming was fortunate as a researcher to have had the freedom to follow up on the unexpected, and his classic 1929 paper includes an extensive study of the production of penicillin by the mould, and of its inhibitory effects against different species of bacteria. However, the crude penicillin was unstable, and Fleming&#146;s laboratory did not have the chemical expertise to purify it in its stable form for further study, so he was unable to pursue its development for clinical use. His later work with penicillin was mainly by using it for selective culture for the isolation of penicillin-insensitive bacteria for study.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para21"><a name="0905122001101">Fleming provided samples of the mould to other laboratories, including the Sir William Dunn school of pathology at Oxford. There in 1939, Howard Florey, professor of pathology, and Ernst Chain, a biochemist and refugee from Nazi Germany, began their studies with the purely academic aims of discovering the chemical nature of penicillin and its mode of action. However, they quickly became aware of its clinical potential, and the onset of the second world war brought treatment of infected wounds back into high profile.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para22"><a name="0905122001102">With the biochemist Norman Heatley, the Oxford team improvised equipment for bulk culture of the mould, and developed methods for the partial purification  <br>

of penicillin. Fleming was involved in demonstrating the high potency of those penicillin preparations against cultured streptococcus and staphylococcus. By 1941, the Oxford team had purified penicillin to a stable enough form to use on a patient&#151;an Oxford policeman dying of septicaemia. The patient improved markedly, but unfortunately the penicillin ran out, the infection strengthened and the poor man died.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para23"><a name="0905122001103">However, by 1943, Fleming was able to use penicillin successfully to treat a girl with streptococcal meningitis; the rapid cure of an almost moribund patient led him to bring penicillin to the notice of the Government. That led to the setting up of the Penicillin Committee and the production of penicillin on an industrial scale, especially in the United States.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para24"><a name="0905122001104">Fleming was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1943, knighted in 1944, and shared the 1945 Nobel prize in physiology or medicine with Florey and Chain. In 1945, Fleming was elected the first president of the new Society for General Microbiology, which was formed to provide a common meeting ground for those interested in the study of microbes of all types&#151;bacteria, fungi and viruses and others. The society&#146;s members came from all backgrounds, including medicine, veterinary medicine, agriculture, universities, research institutes and industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para25"><a name="0905122001105">The society grew rapidly and still thrives today, with more than 5,000 members worldwide. Its main activities are publishing scientific journals, organising conferences, and supporting microbiology education. It is in that context that the society is sponsoring an event for school students in my constituency in November to emphasise the importance of Fleming&#146;s work in the discovery of penicillin, and how that led to an explosion in the discovery of antibiotics, which have brought tremendous benefits in terms of the control of human and animal disease. Over the years, antibiotics must have saved the lives of countless millions of human beings and animals. It is in that context that the society has offered to sponsor prizes for science in both Loudoun academy and Fleming&#146;s old school, Kilmarnock academy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para26"><a name="0905122001106">But what of the future? How secure are we in reliance on antibiotics? The next major step after the introduction of penicillin was the discovery of streptomycin in 1943 by Selman Waksman&#146;s group. He coined the term &#147;antibiotic&#148; for any substance produced by a micro-organism that interferes with the growth of other micro-organisms. Unlike penicillin, which is produced by a fungus, streptomycin was produced by a bacterium. In the 1950s and 1960s, many other antibacterial and anti-fungal agents were discovered in bacteria and fungi in the so-called golden age of antibiotic discovery. In the late 1960s, US Surgeon General William H. Stewart famously stated that we could</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para27"><a name="0905122001107">and others said similar things. We now know that that is far from being the case for a number of reasons. For a start, he ignored virus diseases, which cannot be treated with antibiotics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para28"><a name="0905122001108">Although thousands of antibiotics have been discovered, and more than 100 are currently approved for medical use, they belong mainly to a rather small number of types of chemical structure, and the rate of discovery in  <br>

<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>11 May 2009 : Column 660</b><br>
the golden age was followed by decades in which far fewer useful natural products were discovered. In the 1990s, drug companies invested heavily in synthetic chemistry and robotic synthesis in attempts to develop &#147;unnatural&#148; new drugs, and in genome sequencing of pathogens to identify genes that encode proteins not present in human cells as possible targets for newly synthesised antibiotics. Those efforts have been disappointing, and have shown little success. It appears that naturally occurring antibiotics and the interactions with their targets have been highly refined in nature over millions of years of natural selection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para29"><a name="0905122001109">More recent methods of trying to create new types of antibiotics include the genetic manipulation of natural products by altering the biosynthetic &#147;assembly line&#148;; the first new products are entering clinical trials. Also, sequencing the genomes of some antibiotic-producing micro-organisms such as streptomyces has shown that there may be &#147;sleeping&#148; antibiotic genes, used only under special conditions infrequently encountered. However, the difficulties of commercial development of any new antibiotics are immense. First, they must be devoid of side effects, unlike new anti-cancer drugs, the drawbacks of which may be considered to be outweighed by benefits. The costs are enormous, and the end product may not be profitable. Many of the antibiotics launched in the 1940s simply would not have been brought to market in the present regulatory climate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para30"><a name="0905122001110">The pressing need for new antibiotics and more types of antibiotics is due to the development of antibiotic resistance in the target pathogens. Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and multi-drug-resistant human tuberculosis are only two of many examples. Bacteria have evolved over millions of years to survive the insults of their environments, and coping with the production of antibiotics by other micro-organisms has resulted in the evolution of antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Genes for antibiotic resistance have also undoubtedly been transferred between different types of bacteria in the process of horizontal gene transfer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="90511-0021.htm_para31"><a name="0905122001111">If we are to maintain and expand our ability to control disease, there is a need for continued research on the fundamental biology of pathogens and their interactions with the host, and on the development of new antibiotics. We could persuade the pharmaceutical industry back to the task by re-examining some of the commercial and regulatory caveats, and develop other mechanisms for disease control such as bacteriophage therapy. The legacy of Fleming and others was the golden age of antibiotic discovery, and all the countless benefits that it brought.</p>

modern medicine. My right hon. Friend and his constituents are of course rightly proud of the fact that Alexander Fleming is one of their own, and my right hon. Friend is right to celebrate this landmark anniversary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="90511-0022.htm_para0"><a name="0905122001114">The events of 80 years ago are hugely significant, as my right hon. Friend demonstrated. They marked the start of a revolution in health care that no one at the time, least of all Sir Alexander Fleming, predicted. The story of penicillin&#146;s discovery is a remarkable one: an object lesson for all of us to be ready for the unexpected and to act with courage, determination and vision in seeing through the ideas that we believe in&#151;even in the face of setbacks and disappointments. Indeed, there were some for Fleming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="90511-0022.htm_para1"><a name="0905122001115">Fleming&#146;s research, drawn from his observations of the way cultured mould attacked certain gram-positive bacteria, triggered a chain of events that involved an extraordinary combination of people and circumstances, and my right hon. Friend implored science and investment to build on them. Yet, as he knows and the House may be aware, we came dangerously close to losing the secret that Fleming&#146;s Petri dish had inadvertently unlocked. By 1932, Fleming had effectively abandoned his work on penicillin, believing that it would not survive long enough in the human body to kill bacteria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="90511-0022.htm_para2"><a name="0905122001116">It took a decade for penicillin to reach the people&#151;perhaps the only people&#151;capable of purifying it and doing the research that demonstrated, in record-breaking time, that it could cure deadly infections. That breakthrough ushered in the antibiotic era. Pneumonia, syphilis, gonorrhoea, diphtheria, scarlet fever and many wound and childbirth infections that killed indiscriminately suddenly became treatable. As my right hon. Friend said, millions of lives have been saved, including millions in the second world war. But, of course, penicillin was just the start. It was followed by the discovery and introduction of a steady stream of different antibiotics over the next 40 years. Those antibiotics transformed the treatment of classical infections such as meningitis and pneumonia, and invasive streptococcal infections, all of which previously carried a high mortality rate. They remain essential for modern medical practice, and, as my right hon. Friend said, it is difficult even now to comprehend the number of lives that have been saved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="90511-0022.htm_para3"><a name="0905122001117">The ability to treat infections and to provide antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery has unlocked other key developments in medical science. It has allowed huge advances in complex surgery, cancer therapy and transplantation, because, without those antibiotics, compromised and immuno-suppressed patients would quickly succumb to infections. The other striking fact about antibiotics is their unique status as a therapeutic agent. They are aimed at the bacteria not the patient, massively reducing the side effects that are associated with more aggressive drug treatments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="90511-0022.htm_para4"><a name="0905122001118">We have also come to recognise, however, that the effectiveness of the current generation of antibiotics is finite and self-limiting. Alexander Fleming was himself clear that bacteria had the ability to develop resistance&#151;or, as my right hon. Friend said, to &#147;fight back&#148;. The emergence of so-called superbugs such as MRSA in the  <br>

past two decades has showed the potential for damage that over-reliance on antibiotic medicine can cause. The issue demands vigilance and action across the medical community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="90511-0022.htm_para5"><a name="0905122001119">It is absolutely imperative that while we rightly celebrate the landmark achievements made 80 years ago, we also look to the future to continue to promote the safe and proportionate use of antibiotics. We must also push the boundaries to ensure that Fleming&#146;s legacy lives on in the new forms of antibiotic treatment. As my right hon. Friend mentioned, the pharmaceutical companies, which have tended to cut back their antibiotic research programmes, have perhaps compounded the problem, creating some of the cycles that we now see. They need, with the Government, to build on the legacy now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="90511-0022.htm_para6"><a name="0905122001120">The new anti-infectives, which work well against MRSA, have come on stream in the past three years and research on other new anti-infective agents continues. Equally important is the emergence of novel approaches. That is the challenge that the international, big health research players in Government and industry face. We are playing our part as a Government. The Medical Research Council supports a substantial body of infection research and is currently spending &#163;72 million a year on it. The United Kingdom clinical research collaboration has invested &#163;16.5 million in its translational infection research initiative. That will help to boost research capacity and infrastructure and establish new career development and training programmes for scientists and researchers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="90511-0022.htm_para7"><a name="0905122001121">The Technology Strategy Board&#146;s new detection and identification of infectious agents platform will make &#163;55 million available to encourage researchers to work together to produce faster diagnostic tests to identify infections in humans and animals. Like my right hon. Friend, I am utterly convinced that the potential for development of more traditional antibiotics has not been exhausted. It is absolutely vital to the future of medicine, health and humanity that we should continue to sow the seeds for future discoveries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="90511-0022.htm_para8"><a name="0905122001122">Vaccines, of course, play a huge part in our strategy for combating infections&#151;prevention is better than cure&#151;but we are a long way from removing the need for antibiotics. The basic researches and determinations of Alexander Fleming have profoundly shaped the development of medical science and treatment across all health care systems. It is right that we should be celebrating his life and contribution today. As my right hon. Friend implored, we should also recognise that just a fraction of the potential that Fleming identified has been exploited to date. There are new ideas and ways of operating and of treatment. The legacy is not only about the past standing us in good stead, but about the past still shaping our future. It gives me great pleasure to join my right hon. Friend in recognising the achievements of this great scientist and in making sure that we, as a Government, play our part in funding the great scientists who continue to build on that legacy.</p>
