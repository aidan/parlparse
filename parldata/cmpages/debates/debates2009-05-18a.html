 To reassure my hon.

Officers equipped with Tasers raided a residence in an operation to arrest individuals suspected of criminal damage at the G20 protest. My hon.

 Three weeks ago, four environmental protesters dressed as suffragettes superglued themselves to a statue of Viscount Falkland in Parliament. They were arrested for demonstrating unlawfully, held in detention for a total of 18 hours and given hugely restrictive police bail conditions, such as not being allowed even any contact with each other, although they were friends. Does the Minister accept that there is widespread controversy about the way in which lawful and peaceful protests are policed&#151;as evidenced by the solicitors of the climate camp protestors today echoing our call for a full judicial inquiry?

The hon.

about the whole issue of protest. In this country, people have a right to protest. That is what is going on outside, and in my view and that of many people, the policing of that demonstration, by facilitating protest but as far as possible allowing the public and Parliament to go about their business, is a testament to the police. It is sometimes difficult for the police, because people may say that something ought to be done about Tamils who are sitting in the road, for example, but the only way to move them, if they will not move, is by force. The way in which the police have tried to persuade people to conform is the right way forward.</p>

 Does the Minister not accept that what is going on in Parliament square is an absolute disgrace? It is an abuse of the right to protest. For seven weeks, the square has effectively been under semi-permanent occupation by the Tamils, and people going about their business in London have been disrupted. Why will the Minister not answer me when I ask how many police days have been devoted to the demonstration and how much it has cost? The Minister has told me that the Home Office does not keep those figures and that they are a matter for the Metropolitan Police Commissioner. Who is in charge of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner? The people of London should be told how much the demonstration is costing.</p>

 The fact is that the number of officers and the amount of resources deployed are an operational matter for the Metropolitan Police Commissioner. The only point that I make to the hon. Gentleman is that, far from being an affront to democracy, what is going on out there is a victory for democracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o0"><a name="90518-0001.htm_para0"><a name="0905186000037">Having said that, I should also say that of course there are issues about how any demonstration is policed. However, I pose this question to the hon. Gentleman: what would be the effect were the police to conduct a clearance operation, bring the tents down and forcibly remove people, including women and children? Then we would see a protest from the other side of the argument. We have to look at the issue in a proportionate, sensible and measured way. We have to try to facilitate protest while trying, as far as we can, to ensure that people can go about their lawful business.</p>

 I agree completely with what the Minister just said. However, it raises the point of what counts as the &#147;community&#148; for the purposes of the Association of Chief Police Officers guidance on keeping the peace, for example. That says that the impact on the community is the first consideration in these circumstances. Does the Minister think that when protests are being policed, the &#147;community&#148; must include the interests of peaceful protesters themselves and that the matter is not exclusively about keeping the traffic running?</p>

 I absolutely agree, and I think that anybody would. Part of a protest is the individual demonstrator&#146;s being able to demonstrate and to say and do what they want, within reason. Alongside that, the police, while facilitating the protest, have a responsibility to try to ensure, as far as possible, that traffic keeps moving and that people who are not interested in the demonstration can go about their business.

point that I was making was that the police are doing a very good job with what is happening in Parliament square at present. To go back to the original question about the use of water cannon and other such equipment, it is encouraging to see our police policing such a demonstration in normal uniform, by and large.</p>

 I think that this is the third time that I have asked this question of the Home Secretary and the Minister, but I am totally bewildered. Why can the Minister not get on top of cases of mums or dads who are married to or partners of British citizens&#151;their kids, who are British children, run around my surgery&#151;but cannot resolve their status? They might, yonks ago, have arrived here as illegal immigrants, but the problem is a no-brainer: they are not going back anywhere, so why cannot we get their papers regularised so that they can work and enjoy life? The problem is not small, but endemic. I have it every week in my constituency, and I do not want to wait till 2010 and 2011 to resolve it. When can those cases be resolved?

 I can give my hon. Friend the reassurance. I refer him to the comprehensive information that we have provided to the Select Committee. The legacy cases for failed asylum and immigration problems are being got through at a pace. Under policy and law, we rightly have to look at each case on its merits.

 The answers to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s questions are yes and yes. It is important that temporary settlement rights do not automatically become permanent settlement rights and that that is made clear. One of the advantages of the points-based system is exactly that. It is backed up by the border control of counting in and counting out, which I know my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and he have supported. We have today introduced two new countries to the effective visa regime, and it is also important that those visas are counted in and counted out. I am grateful for the hon.

I presume that Opposition Members are not turning their backs on what every other Schengen country is going to do: put fingerprints into secure biometric passports. The operational costs of issuing ID cards in addition to that will be recovered largely from fees, so, as I said earlier, the Opposition&#146;s suggestion that there is a large amount of money to be saved by scrapping the ID card scheme suggests that there is a black hole not only in their plans but in their finances.</p>

That is why it is important that we work in those countries to stop the flow of those people. We must also work hard here: it is not always easy to identify the age of a trafficked child, so we must have the mechanisms in place to proceed to identify exactly who the individuals are.</p>

We all know that it is the tradition of this House that the Speaker speaks to the whole House, but in doing so please allow me to say to the men and women of the United Kingdom that we have let you down very badly indeed. We must all accept blame and, to the extent that I have contributed to the situation, I am profoundly sorry. Now, each and every Member, including myself, must work hard to regain your trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="90518-0003.htm_para7"><a name="0905186000149">As a matter of urgency, and within 48 hours, I am calling the Prime Minister and party leaders, including those of the minority parties, to meet me and the other members of the House of Commons Commission. Also present will be the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="90518-0003.htm_para8"><a name="0905186000150">Leaders of all parties have made announcements on what should be done. Some of their proposals are very similar to those put to the House on 3 July last year by the Members Estimate Committee&#151;which I chair&#151;copies of which are lodged in the Vote Office. I want discussion to centre on the additional costs allowance and all those matters that have caused the greatest controversy and most anger with the public, and I include in that the early publication of the additional costs allowance, office costs and travel material.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="90518-0003.htm_para9"><a name="0905186000151">While we await the work of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, we must search for agreement, so that the Leader of the House can bring forward resolutions to give an opportunity for the House to deal with the immediate situation. In the meantime, I do urge all hon. Members not to submit claims for approval. Last week, I had a most productive meeting with Sir Christopher Kelly, who explained to me his hopes to bring forward reasoned proposals in the autumn. While we await the outcome of his work, it is imperative that we continue to improve our accounts and practice in the interim, and get in place measures that work and are seen to be working. I say again that we all bear a heavy responsibility for the terrible damage to the reputation of this House. We must do everything we possibly can to regain the trust and confidence of the people.</p>

He mentioned transparency, and, yes, as I have stated, I have heard leaders of the parties and others talk about many issues, some of which were brought up on 3 July by the Committee that I chair. What I can say about that point is that anything about transparency can be on the agenda at the meeting that will take place within 48 hours and can hopefully be translated into a resolution that this House can consider.</p>

The Opposition&#146;s fear is that young people in particular will be the victims of the recession, one estimate being that if, tragically, unemployment were to rise to 3 million, more than 1.25 million of those unemployed people would be aged under 25.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a valid point. It is certainly an idea that needs to be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90518-0005.htm_para0"><a name="0905186000208">Although the recession has increased unemployment already, it is worth remembering that even in the boom years when the economy was growing, we were suffering from an increase in the rate of youth unemployment. The rate of unemployment among people aged 16 to 24 grew from 13.4 per cent. in 1997 to 14.4 per cent. in 2007, so even in the good times before the recession hit we were already going backwards and losing ground, compared with other OECD countries.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is very generous with his time. I agree that skills are important, not only for young people but for everyone. Does he share my belief that we should be investing in skills and keeping people in employment through the short-time working subsidy, rather than allowing them to go to the job centre and trying to reskill them there? Would we not be better off investing in employment through the short-time working subsidy?</p>

 That is an interesting idea that is worth considering. Indeed, that is something else&#151;going back to the intervention from my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)&#151;that we introduced in the early 1980s, when unemployment was high before.</p>

 I have an unresolved concern about clause 84 of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill. My hon. Friend has at least two brains and probably an exemplary memory, so I trust he will recall that both on Second Reading of that Bill and at questions to the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills&#151;that is to say, on two separate occasions&#151;I raised my concern that clause 84 as it stands is overly prescriptive because it would preclude from participation in apprenticeship schemes people with special educational needs, who might be well suited to an apprenticeship but who do not have level 2 and level 3 qualifications. The Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon), and the Minister of State, the right hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Lammy), said that that concern would be addressed. I hope that in the other place it will be.</p>

 For a terrible moment I thought my hon. Friend expected me to remember what was in that clause, without jogging my memory. I am grateful to him for reminding us. It is an issue about which he is rightly passionate, and he is correct. One of our concerns about the Government&#146;s approach to skills is that they are so obsessed with funding only the production of paper qualifications that people who, for whatever reason, may not be capable of getting a national vocational qualification level 2 are often deprived of access to training under the Government&#146;s new model.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90518-0005.htm_para1"><a name="0905186000213">I remember a conversation at, I think, Coventry college, with a young lady with learning difficulties who was doing a course in horticulture. Because that course would not get her to an NVQ level 2, it was no longer going to be provided because of the priorities that the Government had set for the Learning and Skills Council. It is very important that people who can benefit from learning and from the most basic training, even if it will not get them an NVQ level 2, continue to have access to training and apprenticeships. My hon. Friend is absolutely right on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90518-0005.htm_para2"><a name="0905186000231">The bone that I have to pick concerns what is happening to the number of young people not in education, employment or training. On the Government&#146;s own figures, which we obtained in a parliamentary answer, and which have been constructed in a consistent series only since 2000, the number of young people not in education, employment or training in 2000 was 630,000. In 2008, eight years later, the figure had increased shockingly to 860,000. When I released the Government&#146;s figures, the Secretary of State responded by saying that there had been a &#147;straightforward deception&#148;. He added:</p>
<a name="90518-0005.htm_brev0"><a name="0905186000436"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;What the Conservatives don&#146;t take into account is that there are far more young people of that age group in our society than there were 10 years ago.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="90518-0005.htm_para3"><a name="0905186000232">He therefore says that, because there has been such a big increase in the number of young people, it is misleading to count the absolute figures. However, I invite him to make that point to the Prime Minister, who, when challenged in this Chamber on the number of NEETs, said:</p>
<a name="90518-0005.htm_brev1"><a name="0905186000437"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In 1997, 5.2 million 16 to-24-year-olds were in full-time education or employment. The figure is now 6.1 million.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 22 April 2009; Vol. 491, c. 229.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90518-0005.htm_para4"><a name="0905186000233">If the Secretary of State believes that referring to absolute figures is a straightforward deception, I invite him to agree that the Prime Minister&#146;s use of absolute figures in that answer in the House was clearly a straightforward deception. If the Secretary of State looks not simply at the absolute figures but at the proportions in respect of what is indeed a growing number of young people, he will find that in 2000&#151;the base from which we have to take these statistics&#151;12.3 per cent. of young people were NEETs, and that by 2008 that proportion had gone up to 14.2 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90518-0005.htm_para5"><a name="0905186000234">There has been an increase in both the absolute figure and the proportion of young people not in education, employment or training&#151;and it happened even during the boom years. It is important that the Government recognise the scale of the problem over which they have presided and do not attempt to avoid the implications of the failure of their own policies.</p>

I recruited and served youth training scheme trainees, youth opportunities programme, or YOP, trainees, community enterprise scheme trainees and community programme participants. I have to say to the hon. Gentleman that in those days, his Government&#146;s provisions were make-work programmes without technical and training content.

 We have put forward practical proposals on how, in this very financial year, we could put in more money&#151;particularly, for example, to help young people who need training in science, technology, engineering or maths, also known as the STEM subjects. However, we need a mix. We need work experience; it is better to be doing something than to be doing nothing.

It is not true that the Government did not make efforts to reduce the figures. My area of Barnsley has traditionally had a low take-up of post-16 education and training; last year, however, it managed to reduce its number of NEETS from about 15 to 8 per cent. thanks to the valiant efforts of the Connexions service and Government funding. If a constituency such as mine can do that, other areas obviously can. We managed to do it through Government funding and very hard work by our local Connexions service.</p>

 I completely agree that it is possible to reduce the number of NEETs. Indeed, I have visited some fantastic programmes, often run by social enterprises, that do just that.

However, as in the example of those with learning difficulties, I was told that when the programmes do not yield a level 2 or level 3 national vocational qualification rapidly enough, the LSC cuts back the funding. A lot of programmes help to get young NEETs doing something&#151;motorbike repair or whatever. However, programmes that do not immediately get students a paper qualification of the type that the LSC is willing to fund are suffering. That is partly why the number of NEETs is going up&#151;it has gone up in absolute terms and as a percentage of the number of young people&#151;and why the Secretary of State&#146;s attempt to escape the implications of those figures was so irresponsible.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The reason for this debate, and the point that we make in the motion, is that there is an enormous gap between the rhetoric from the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and the Secretary of State, which is all about the importance of investing in skills in the recession, and the reality on the ground, which is the complete opposite of what they talk about in this Chamber. Further education colleges cannot secure the capital funding that they need to improve their provision, and many practical training courses are being cut because of the inability of DIUS and the LSC properly to manage their funding streams.</p>

 South Thames college, which is just outside my constituency and used by many of my constituents, received the other piece of bad advice that colleges got.

 My hon. Friend is right. Some colleges have already started demolishing part of their fabric, and lessons are taking place in temporary classrooms as they wait for permission for a capital project.

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90518-0006.htm_para1"><a name="0905186000267">We know from Sir Andrew Foster&#146;s excellent report that alarm bells were sounding as early as February 2008, when the LSC&#146;s director of property and infrastructure prepared a report. Its analysis of the capital promises being made concluded:</p>
<a name="90518-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="0905186000438"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This simply proves that the continuation of the current payment profile of projects is unaffordable to the Council.&#148;</p>

We also know from Sir Andrew Foster&#146;s report that the Department attended all the meetings of these groups at a senior level as an observer. Nevertheless, the Secretary of State said, and I accept his word, that he knew about the problems with the capital funding of FE only in November 2008.</p>

 The one thing that colleges all say is that when they were funded by the Further Education Funding Council, they were trusted to exercise discretion, which meant that they could tackle local problems such as NEETs without being funded by the Learning and Skills Council simply to produce paper qualifications. Colleges look back upon that freedom to run their own affairs very fondly indeed, and we are committed to restoring it to them. The best way to ensure efficiency and high performance from colleges is to give them the freedom to run their own affairs, and that is what we are committed to doing.</p>

The minutes of the meeting on 17 December 2008, which was attended by the Secretary of State&#146;s senior officials, as all the previous ones were, show the following crucial item, when the problem was finally confronted:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="90518-0006.htm_para10"><a name="0905186000285">That was what the minutes of the November meeting stated. This is what was added subsequently:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="90518-0006.htm_para12"><a name="0905186000287">The problem reached the stage that the minute-taking in the Learning and Skills Council was deceitful, in that it was not willing to acknowledge the capital problem.

We need him to tell us, authoritatively, how many colleges are affected by this problem. The figure of 144 comes from a letter that I received from the Learning and Skills Council after I had asked questions in the House, but we need the Secretary of State to give us an updated account. As soon as the list of colleges was released, I started getting e-mails from people asking why their college was not on it. We then discovered that there were other colleges involved that had not been on the first, official list, but we have not had a further, authoritative update from the Department on how many colleges it thinks are affected by the crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="90518-0006.htm_para14"><a name="0905186000293">May I also ask the Secretary of State what criteria will be applied as he tries to get the further education colleges out of the appalling mess that they find themselves in? We realise that there will have to be priorities, because there is a capital overhang of &#163;3 billion or more, and that the needs of all the colleges cannot be met easily or rapidly. However, there needs to be far more public information than we have had so far on the criteria that will be applied and on how the limited amount of money will be dispensed.</p>

What about the projects that are part of the wider regeneration of a town or district, for example? What priority will go to them? We also need to know what will happen to those colleges that have made commitments to buy land or commitments to move. How much weight will be attached to that consideration?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="90518-0006.htm_para16"><a name="0905186000297">It will be tempting&#151;and I suspect that the Secretary of State will succumb to the temptation&#151;to say that the crucial issue will be to knock down the building costs charged by the building industry, and indeed there might be some savings to be made in that way. Will he acknowledge, however, that one reason that these projects have turned out to be so expensive is the extraordinarily cumbersome regulatory procedures surrounding them, involving preferred builders and preferred planning consultants who might be approved of for one region but not for another?

Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) in his place. He, too, has raised that matter, because it affects his local college.

The Secretary of State would not need to read even the executive summary; all he needs to read are the statistics on the cover, which show the international ranking for the three levels of skills. For the highest level, the UK&#146;s position is 12th internationally. The Government&#146;s ambition is that we should be eighth by 2020, but the report projects that, on current policies, we will be 10th. For intermediate skills, we are currently 18th in the international league table. The Government&#146;s aim is for us to be in the top eight, but the report says that on current policies we will go down to 21st by 2020. As regards low skills&#151;we have a particular obligation to people with low skills because the issue is fundamental to social mobility&#151;our current international position is 17th. The Government&#146;s aim is for us to be eighth by 2020, but the independent report suggests that, at this rate under this Government&#146;s policies, we will be 23rd internationally in 2020.

That success means that we are training tens of thousands of people today who might otherwise have started their training only late this year or next year, and who would not have been trained at all if the Opposition had their way.

That backs up the changes that we made to make Train to Gain more flexible and better tailored to company needs, particularly those of small businesses. Obviously no budget can be unlimited, and in the longer term we need to ensure that the commitments made do not outstrip our resources. Because the programme has been so successful, I have considered every way in which I can find more resources. Today, I am confident that the number of people who start Train to Gain this year will be in line with our published plans.

sustain investment to grow our way out of recession, so they could not have introduced the guaranteed offer of work or training for young people who are out of work for a long period. As part of that package of &#163;1.7 billion of investment, my Department will be able offer more than 80,000 training places for young adults who have been unemployed for more than 12 months. We will start that from the autumn. The Opposition also could not match the extra &#163;250 million we are already putting in place to help people with flexible training and advice to improve employability skills and to get them back into work, including 75,000 training places for people who have been out of work for six months. People will be able to start that training when they are out of work by going to college, and then continue it when they are in work through Train to Gain.</p>

 Keighley is doing very well, with a new-build college, which will be excellent, and I appreciate that. Does my right hon.

 The Secretary of State talks a great deal about the investment he plans to put into this sector but, as my hon.

 The hon. Lady clearly has not quite grasped the gist of the debate so far. What I have said&#151;very clearly&#151;is that we have far more people in training today than we had planned to have in training today. I have also said that in the coming year we will train the same amount of people that we had planned to train. Because we have had the great success of training people early and because budgets are not unlimited, we are having to adjust the budgets of training providers, but I say to the hon. Lady that this is not a cut. We are not reducing the number of people being trained. More people will have been trained over this two-year period than we had planned. Next year, as many people will be planned for as the providers would have been expecting. I have acknowledged tensions in the handling of that, but that is the picture that she needs to take back to her college. She should say to it, &#147;The good news is that, despite the fact that the training system in this country is currently training more people than it had planned, it is still confident that it will be planning for as many people next year as it had set out.&#148; That is enormously good news, and I hope I can rely on the hon. Lady&#151;I am absolutely sure that I can&#151;to take that message back to Basingstoke, rather than to return there and say that the situation is different. The LSC will send the detailed allocations out to colleges as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="90518-0007.htm_para12"><a name="0905186000342">I have talked about the investment that the Budget enables us to make in the future of young people, and which the hon. Member for Havant and his party would not match. That is why it is so extraordinary that the hon. Gentleman raises the NEETs issue. There is an old debate here, and at the crux of it are two issues. The first issue is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s reluctance to give the Government the credit for having 1 million more young people in education, work and training than 10 years ago. That was not an act of God or an accident; it was something that Government policy set out to achieve. The second reason we have disagreed with him is that he has always made the most of the figures by including in his list of NEETs young mothers who are at home bringing up families. I always feel that he comes here to attack the Government over NEETs and then goes outside to make speeches about the importance of family policy. I have always acknowledged that we should focus on a smaller group of young people who seriously are detached from the labour market&#151;from education, work and training. In some ways, that is the debate that he and I have had with great regularity over the past two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="90518-0007.htm_para13"><a name="0905186000343">Let us acknowledge that today there is a more pressing debate, because times are harder for young people. We are determined not to write off a generation of young people, as the Conservative party did in the recession of the late 80s and early 90s. That is why we are raising the participation age over the next few years to keep young people in education and training and work with training&#151;that practical measure to help young people is opposed by the Conservatives&#151;and why we are putting a further &#163;655 million into 16 to 18 learning this year and next to enable colleges and sixth forms to meet rising demand. The Conservatives&#146; policies could not match that investment, and the hon. Gentleman cannot honestly match our guaranteed offer of work and training to young people who cannot find work for a long time. I am happy to debate NEETs. It is a serious issue and we recognise the challenges facing young people today, so I must say to him that investing in those young people and creating opportunities for work, for training and for education is how we must tackle the number of young people who are doing none of those things, not cutting the support we provide for them.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend acknowledge that work-based learning is a key element and that in my own county of Lancashire that grew by 30 to 35 per cent. between 2006 and 2007? Does he also agree that part of this is about using frameworks and structures in which employers and the general public can have confidence and that the Conservative party, by its failure to get wholeheartedly behind the diplomas process and, indeed, aspects of the apprenticeships process, has hindered rather than assisted the process?</p>

 Yes, it has always been a matter of shame that the Conservative party has blown so hot and cold on the development of the diplomas. For many young people, they provide a range of options of learning that has not been in place previously, including the important work-based learning.</p>

have happened. I have made that clear and, as Secretary of State, I have also come to the House to apologise to those who have been affected. It was me who asked Sir Andrew Foster to carry out the review, and I, like the hon. Member for Havant, think that his report has set out fairly the mismanagement that led to the problem. But let us be clear about the background to this debate. Twelve years ago, when the Opposition were in power, there was no budget for FE capital.<i>  [Interruption.]</i> This is rather important, because when hon. Members talk movingly about their dilapidated 1960s buildings, as happened today, we must ask how long buildings&#151;sometimes those much older than that&#151;were left to be dilapidated. It is relevant that the starting point<i> &#151;[Interruption.]</i></p>

 The hon. Gentleman asks me about 12 years and whether a Government should have managed, within that period, to transform all the legacy that his party left. I have to say no, but we have made a very good start&#151;we have done much better than we would have done with the zero capital budget that we found.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="90518-0008.htm_para1"><a name="0905186000349">The second point to make about the background is that the Conservative party, despite its history, fails to give any credit&#151;ever&#151;to the huge scale of investment that has been and is being made in FE capital. I would have a lot more time for the criticisms that are made by the Conservatives if they acknowledged the scale of what is being achieved. Since 2001, 700 projects, at nearly 330 colleges, have been funded and in those areas that has transformed the FE estate for learners. In the current spending review we were committed to, and will spend, &#163;2.3 billion, and that was on top of the &#163;2 billion spent between 1997 and 2008. It is true that despite the huge scale of that programme, its management by the LSC has raised the expectations and hopes of colleges. I can understand the feelings of those who do not know where they stand or feel that they might not get their colleges within the time scale that they had hoped. That is why, in the recent Budget, my Department was allocated &#163;1.2 billion on top of the investment that we had already received, enabling us to get vital schemes going within the next two years and to plan for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="90518-0008.htm_para2"><a name="0905186000350">By contrast, the hon. Member for Havant went to the Association of Colleges conference last October, where he was asked whether he could guarantee that the Conservatives would deliver the planned spending even for 2010-11. He told the conference that he could not. That is the truth. While we are working through the LSC and with the AOC to begin to prioritise more schemes and to get them under way, a Government with the hon. Gentleman in it would cut the schemes that are already under way.</p>

The LSC is out to consultation at the moment and is working with the AOC on those criteria. When I have received advice from the LSC on that, it will be in a position to publish the criteria.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is trying to intervene as if there is a major issue here. This has to be got right. We know that large numbers of colleges are anxiously awaiting these decisions and that is why it is important that the LSC, working with people in the sector, gets this right.</p>

<p><a name="st_o248"><a name="0905186000354"><a name="90518-0008.htm_spnew4"><a name="0905186000723"><b>Mr. Hayes:</b>
 I acknowledge the investment that the Government have made in FE capital in the past, but there is a major issue, so will the Secretary of State answer two very simple questions? First, how many colleges are affected&#151;140, 150, 180 or 200? Secondly, did the officials in his Department know about the problem in the first half of last year?</p>

<p><a name="st_o249"><a name="0905186000355"><a name="90518-0008.htm_spnew5"><a name="0905186000724"><b>Mr. Denham:</b>
 The figure of 144 colleges that we have published is the information supplied to us in March by the LSC through its analysis. I understand that it has been suggested that other colleges felt that they had schemes in preparation, regarded those schemes as being in the pipeline, had been in discussions and so on. In reality, that is the latest and most accurate figure with which I have been provided by the LSC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="90518-0008.htm_para4"><a name="0905186000356">The Foster report sets out in some detail the meetings that took place where my Department was represented at official level in the early part of last year. Foster&#146;s conclusion is that opportunities were not taken to prevent this problem from happening. That is undoubtedly a fair judgment. I would say two things about that. First, there is no ambiguity that Ministers were first alerted to the existence of a problem&#151;not the problem as we now define it, but a potential or emerging problem&#151;in November. Secondly, Foster raised the core issue of the clarity or otherwise of how accountability is exercised between a Department and its non-departmental bodies. The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) will know that when we published the Foster review, I asked the permanent secretary of my Department to carry out a view of the accountability arrangements. We have many non-departmental bodies, and they are all different in nature. It is critical that officials know precisely what level of authority they are expected to exercise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="90518-0008.htm_para5"><a name="0905186000357">The hon. Gentleman will know that in the case of the LSC the previous chief executive, who was himself not informed until late in the day, took responsibility for what happened and left the LSC. The hon. Gentleman will also know that the LSC is being replaced by the Skills Funding Agency, which will not be a non-departmental public body. I think that that will help. I hope that something like this will not happen in the future, but in such a situation the lines of accountability and responsibility will be much clearer.</p>

 I recognise that the Secretary of State has come to the House and said that there are problems, and that he takes responsibility for putting those problems right. However, in respect of the Foster review and the discussions taking place between the Learning and Skills Council, further education colleges and their associations, it is critical that he looks at the role of regeneration in places where communities need to be transformed. I welcome the fact that on 4 March he announced to the House that detailed consent would now go ahead for the Building Colleges for the Future programme in Stoke-on-Trent and for seven other colleges. I have already had a meeting with a Minister in his Department  <br>

on that. The Stoke-on-Trent college application related to a phased programme, which included two new builds on the Shelton and Burslem sites. It is critical that regeneration and the ability of people to change their aspirations and skills are part of the new review, so that the much-needed investment in the Burslem campus in Stoke-on-Trent can go ahead, too.</p>

 I recognise the points that my hon. Friend raises, and the way in which she has argued the case for her constituency. Of course she is right that the relationship between a college programme and regeneration must be one of the criteria. I do not want to get drawn into the criteria debate. I simply say, and I hope that the House will understand, that it is relatively simple to list the issues that should be taken into account; the challenge is to decide what weighting should be given to the different factors, so that when everybody looks at the final outcome, people at least feel that it is fair and consistent, although it will be impossible to produce an outcome in which everybody is happy. That work is going on at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="90518-0008.htm_para6"><a name="0905186000360">I should make some progress, and bring my remarks to a close. The hon. Member for Havant repeated his criticism about the reduction in the number of non-vocational leisure courses as a result of our having prioritised training for work. That is one of the reasons he wants to scrap Train to Gain, but his priority is wrong. It is not just me saying so; the CBI and the Institute of Directors have both said that Train to Gain is the right policy. The CBI said that it was</p>

<a name="90518-0008.htm_brev1"><a name="0905186000448"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to divert money from the Train to Gain programme, as this is designed to ensure that public funds are invested in training that delivers improved business and workforce performance.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="90518-0008.htm_para8"><a name="0905186000362">The Institute of Directors said, in response to the Opposition&#146;s proposal:</p>
<a name="90518-0008.htm_brev2"><a name="0905186000449"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Train to Gain scheme is not perfect, requires greater flexibility and needs to promote higher level skills as well as the basics. But the principle of the initiative has great merit and the focus of policy should be on improving the service rather than diverting funds away.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="90518-0008.htm_para9"><a name="0905186000363">I am as keen on learning for its own sake as anyone. That is why I worked across Government to launch the White Paper, &#147;The Learning Revolution&#148;, and why we have just opened bids for a &#163;20-million fund to get informal learning going in new ways and new venues. However, the real priority today must be the skills that we need to get Britain out of recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="90518-0008.htm_para10"><a name="0905186000364">Finally, let me turn to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposals for new investment, because I find them a little distasteful. We are talking about not party political point-scoring, but the hopes and aspirations of an anxious generation of young people, who deserve to be treated honestly and with respect. When he announced his &#163;600-million package, we could not understand where the money was coming from. Then the Conservatives told us: it was to come from the cuts that they had already announced&#151;the &#163;610 million of cuts to my Department&#146;s budget for this year, announced by the Leader of the Opposition on 5 January. I wrote to the hon. Member for Havant on 15 January, asking what he would cut. He never replied. That is the disgraceful scam revealed. The idea is to claim that one could cut &#163;600 million without saying how, and then publish a really attractive list of proposals funded from the same non-existent cuts. The point is  <br>

 Investment in skills and training is always important, whether we are in the middle of a period of prosperity or a recession; the latter is the background to this debate. I am sure that all three Front-Bench spokesmen visit many further education colleges as part of our work. I certainly visit the City of Bristol college and Filton college in Greater Bristol, and see the important work that is done in those colleges to upskill the population of Bristol. I have seen the skills work that they do in construction, and in catering. I have even had several lunches at City of Bristol college prepared by its excellent catering students, and served by those who are learning waitressing and waitering skills, if that is the right word, in the college.</p>

You and I have something in common, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I do not think that tonsorial assistance in those matters would be very productive. I have had to decline several offers to have my legs waxed. However, I was interested to learn that accountancy training was offered in further education colleges. I am the only Member of the House to hold a professional qualification in taxation and business as a member of the Chartered Institute of Taxation. Given Mr. Speaker&#146;s earlier statement, an innovation urgently required for all hon. Members would be a crash course in accountancy, audit, transparency, disclosure and perhaps in some cases, professional ethics. The reputation of the House and the skills sets of all hon. Members would benefit from such a course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="90518-0008.htm_para12"><a name="0905186000367">Last week was adult learners week, and the Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon), the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) and I spoke at the excellent reception on the Terrace to promote adult learning. Several reports from the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education were discussed. One stark finding was that after 12 years of a Labour Government, while much has indeed been done, there is still a real social mobility gap affecting those who participate in adult education and learning. People from the top two social classes are twice as likely to participate in learning post-school as people from the two lower socio-economic groups. At the reception, I quoted Helena Kennedy, a Member of the other place, who some time ago said that the problem with English education in particular was as follows:</p>
<a name="90518-0008.htm_brev3"><a name="0905186000450"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If at first you don&#146;t succeed, you don&#146;t succeed.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="90518-0008.htm_para14"><a name="0905186000369">That is not helped by the Government&#146;s fixation on the belief that learning should lead to an accredited qualification or certificate. Learning, as the Secretary of State acknowledged in his closing remarks, can have other purposes relating to emotional well-being. This morning, in Bristol, I visited the charity Studio Upstairs, which works with adults with emotional and mental  <br>

health problems through the medium of art. It invited me to do a drawing, and I did a not-very-good illustration of the Houses of Parliament as seen from the other side of the Thames. None the less, the work that the charity does is important, and learning does not necessarily need to lead to an accredited qualification&#151;it has other purposes as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="90518-0008.htm_para15"><a name="0905186000370">The motion tabled by the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) rightly mentioned the fact that far too many people are not in education, employment or training. We can have a debate about the number of people involved and what the situation was in 1997, and what the situation is in 2009, but I must tell the Secretary of State that the Education and Skills Act 2008, which raises the age of compulsory participation in education and training, is not the answer. Engagement, particularly with young people, is much more important. If, at the age of 14, people have mentally dropped out of education and at 16 are deemed to have failed the academic education offered to them under existing arrangements, forcing them to stay until they are 17 or 18 is probably not going to lead to a significant improvement in their life chances. Positive engagement with those young people, however, could make a difference. Many of us are well aware of the work of the Prince&#146;s Trust, and in my constituency, the charity Fairbridge does excellent work with young people who have been marginalised, perhaps from their families, and have certainly not achieved well in education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="90518-0008.htm_para16"><a name="0905186000371">There is an important role, too, for social enterprise&#151;a new type of business model that should be encouraged. Last week, I visited the social enterprise, Aspire Bristol. It works with adults who have been unemployed for a significant time, or people who have recently been homeless but who are now seeking to return to a productive role in society. It takes them on and pays them just above the national minimum wage in order to learn such skills as window cleaning, gardening and decorating. Social enterprise could be more encouraged and would be able to earn a decent income that it could pass on to participants if local government and central Government were able to find more of a place for it in their multimillion pound&#151;or, in the case of central Government, multibillion pound&#151;contracts and procurement programme.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman, as ever, is making a well-informed case, but before he moves on to the nub of the FE issue, will he acknowledge what the Secretary of State did not acknowledge&#151;that many of what the Secretary of State calls non-vocational, recreational courses are the very routes by which some of the most difficult disengaged people are able to re-engage in education and training, and that they provide opportunities for further training, leading to employment, for those such as women returning to work after having time out?</p>

 As usual, the hon. Gentleman makes a pertinent point. I could be cruel and mention the mistake that the Government made in their decision on equivalent and lower qualifications cuts last year.

lead to a certificate at the end of it&#151;will be taken away. Many universities will probably start closing down continuing education departments in the future as a direct result of a decision that the Secretary of State instructed the Higher Education Funding Council to take, and many people will lose out on the introduction to learning that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="90518-0008.htm_para18"><a name="0905186000375">I come back to further education colleges. I shall not repeat everything that the hon. Member for Havant said, or all the many points that have been made as we discussed the issue over recent months, both in the Chamber and in Westminster Hall. Last week I visited Sussex Downs college and met the principal there, and the principal of Plumpton college, along with my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker). These colleges are in a difficult situation. They have not, under the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s criteria, got as far as approval in detail, but none the less, they have well worked-up schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="90518-0008.htm_para19"><a name="0905186000376">Plumpton college had a three-stage scheme. Stages one and two have already progressed and stage three was the conclusion. Sussex Downs college has invested millions of pound in professional fees in building up the case that the LSC required for it to make its application. It was specifically encouraged by the LSC to come forward with ambitious plans. The Secretary of State asked the hon. Member for Havant for an example of encouragement having been given to a college to come forward with ambitious plans. There is one for him. But now those ambitious plans do not look as though they will be realised. Many other colleges throughout the country are in the same situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="90518-0008.htm_para20"><a name="0905186000377">We need certainty from the Government soon as to what will happen both to those capital schemes and to the professional costs that the colleges have already incurred in working up their plans. As the hon. Gentleman said, we also need some transparency from the Learning and Skills Council. Unlike the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the LSC does not routinely publish its minutes on its website to show how it arrived at its decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="90518-0008.htm_para21"><a name="0905186000378">The Budget, which has not featured much in the discussion so far, announced a further &#163;300 million in order to try and apply some sticking-plaster solutions to the further education capital funding fiasco. As well as that sum being given to the FE sector, the Budget contains a target for efficiency gains for the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills to find. I understand that the target over the rest of the comprehensive spending review period for the FE and skills part of the Department is &#163;340 million. On the one hand, the Government promise something to sort out a problem that they have created, but, on the other, they are going to take it away through efficiency savings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="90518-0008.htm_para22"><a name="0905186000379">The provision of adequate buildings is not the only barrier to participation in learning; there are other costs, too. The motion refers to the training costs of those who are</p>

There is, nevertheless, an absurd anomaly in our financial structure, whereby, once someone reaches 25, it is not deemed appropriate for the state to fund their first participation in a level 3  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="18 May 2009">

<notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2009 : Column 1236</b><br>
qualification. We are in a time of recession and the work force are ageing, and people in a dynamic economy, whether in a recession or prosperous, will have to retrain throughout their working lives, so enabling adults over the age of 25 to acquire a level 3 qualification free of cost should be a priority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para1"><a name="0905186000382">There is also the question of encouraging employers to take on more apprentices. For small employers, in particular, the cost of off-the-job training is often an important barrier, so re-allocating the growth in the Train to Gain budget of &#163;500 million over the forthcoming years would make an enormous difference to employers and their ability to take more people into adult apprenticeships. The Government have set themselves some ambitious training and educational attainment targets for 2020 as a result of the Leitch report. However, they will be much harder to realise if we do not have investment in further education and skills or ensure that it is secure for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para2"><a name="0905186000383">One of the most interesting parts of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s motion which, again, he seemed to skate over in his speech, was the section about science, technology, engineering and maths&#151;STEM&#151;subjects. Last week, it was my pleasure to welcome to the House some Bristol university young engineers and a graduate engineer who are working with Airbus in Bristol. They are taking part in a national project, sponsored by Airbus, to discuss the relationship between aviation and climate change. I have said many times in such debates that there is a consensus around what we are going to do about our other 2020 targets&#151;apart from the Leitch targets&#151;on climate change. If we are to meet our ambitious targets for a carbon neutral economy, or for a much lower dependence on carbon, we will need more scientists, engineers and technicians. Otherwise, it will be impossible to realise those aims. If we do not have the people to construct the wind farms, service the dynamos or expand nuclear energy, although my party does not support that, we will not be able to meet our 2020 climate change targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para3"><a name="0905186000384">The problem with STEM subjects begins right the way back in our secondary schools, as do many of our problems in education, so we need to enthuse children to take part in science and engineering subjects. In that respect, I praise the work of Bristol university&#146;s ChemLabS outreach programme, which goes to schools all over the west country and invites pupils and teachers into the chemistry laboratories at Bristol university to show children experiments, retrain teachers in experimentation and make science exciting and appealing. As ever, information, advice and guidance are absolutely essential, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para4"><a name="0905186000385">There is a big gender balance in engineering. When I met those five individuals last week, I said to them, &#147;There&#146;s only one problem with you: you&#146;re all men.&#148; That is a problem for the engineering profession, but the profession itself has to do some work, too. Government is not always the answer to every problem; the engineering profession must do more to raise the esteem in which it is held. Two or three years ago in Bristol, we commemorated the bicentenary of Brunel&#146;s birth. In the 19th century, Brunel was a celebrity figure comparable to many well-known politicians, authors and artists, but we do not have a celebrity engineer at the moment. There is a gender balance and high participation in catering; perhaps engineering needs to find equivalents to Jamie and Delia to encourage young people to take part.</p>

In his concluding remarks, the Secretary of State referred to the &#147;anxious generation&#148; of young people who are leaving school and do not know what is ahead of them&#151;particularly if they aspire to go to university. As we already know, there is to be a crisis in respect of finding sufficient places for those who get the right A-levels or other level 3 qualifications sufficient for university entry in September this year; it looks as if there will not be enough university places to meet the demand. Those who will leave as graduates in just a couple of months&#146; time, after doing their finals and receiving their degrees, will enter the most uncertain graduate job market for decades.</p>

Many such people in south Wales, where I grew up, and other depressed industrial areas of the country, did not find another job for a couple of decades afterwards; they were never able to return to full productive work. In this recession, we must all agree that investment in skills for those people is absolutely essential. The issue is not only about young people.</p>

 I want to make a few comments about Barnsley college in the context of the motion and the amendment to it. Obviously, I will speak about the Building Colleges for the Future programme as it affects the college. I shall go on to say a little about the college&#146;s performance in relation to the motions before the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para8"><a name="0905186000394">As the House knows from previous debates, Barnsley college was part of the Building Colleges for the Future programme. Like other colleges, it had a four-phase college programme. Two phases have been completed on budget and to time, but unfortunately the third phase, which started towards the end of 2008, was halted in January when the funding was stopped. Unfortunately, the college had started demolition work on its Old Mill Lane site. The town centre has been left with a completely demolished area, which was the flagship part of Barnsley college.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para9"><a name="0905186000395">Construction stopped. Miller Construction, the contractors, had to stop work; its contractors have been laid off and some have been made redundant. We are now waiting for the results of the Foster review and  <br>

what follows on from it. We Barnsley MPs have had meetings with Ministers and the Prime Minister to try to find a way forward. We have a real difficulty: there is a demolition site where part of the college once was. The building programme has been delayed for several months and it looks as if that will continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para10"><a name="0905186000396">When we met with representatives of the Yorkshire and the Humber learning and skills council, we were told that the Foster review would draw up criteria that, hopefully, would be considered by the end of April. We were also told that decisions would be made by the beginning of May. That has not happened. The Foster report has been produced, the criteria are being drawn up and the meetings are being held. However, the announcement on which colleges will go forward will be made, we hope, on 3 June&#151;that, at least, is what the colleges were led to believe. Since then, it looks as though the timetable may have been reviewed. In discussions with the college principal as recently as Friday, it came to light that perhaps the decisions will be made only tentatively on 3 June. It should be borne in mind that the applications of 145 colleges will be decided on, and only a handful will go forward. We are obviously anxious, as are all the other colleges, that our application should be proceeded with, because we do not have accommodation for our students. We will have temporary buildings, but not the buildings that we had hoped for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para11"><a name="0905186000397">The LSC drew up its so-called &#147;Key Steps and Timetable&#148;, with five steps and a timetable for progressing the situation:</p>

I sincerely hope not. We hear about a value for money process to reduce costs and to achieve savings, but Barnsley college has already been required by the Foster review to reduce the third-phase costs from &#163;42 million to &#163;33 million, and the programme had to be quickly redesigned to accommodate that, so we have already lost &#163;9 million of our project funding through the consultation process  <br>

and the problems that have been created. In addition, the college has spent &#163;12 million of its reserves and borrowings and has a substantial interest bill to meet in 2010. If our college is not selected on 3 June, it will face real financial difficulties, because it cannot expand its student base on the basis that it had hoped in order to meet the extra costs. The refurbishment and redevelopment were carried out on the basis that the student body would increase and the college would receive further funding to help to meet the costs of what has been spent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para16"><a name="0905186000402">It is extremely important to Barnsley that the college capital rebuilding programme is completed. We are extremely concerned not only for the third phase, which is to rebuild a demolition site, but for the fourth phase, which is to rebuild the sixth-form college provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para17"><a name="0905186000403">Barnsley college deals with 90 per cent. of sixth-form teaching in Barnsley, yet we are contemplating not having a sixth-form college if the final phase of the project goes by the wayside. It is important to look at those items, and the time scale and the reason for its sliding further from 3 June&#151;as far as September. Given the intervention of summer holidays and so on, that start date is likely to slip even further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para18"><a name="0905186000404">The refurbishment programme is important to Barnsley college because our record on post-16 education has historically never been good, but it has improved in recent years and continues to improve, and the college is in a strong position to ensure that it meets Government and local priorities. That was shown in its annual Ofsted inspection, which took place in March and resulted in four &#147;significant progress&#148; and three &#147;reasonable progress&#148; judgments&#151;one of the best results in the country. The college has an ambitious business plan to consolidate and grow its success in surpassing targets and meeting national and local priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para19"><a name="0905186000405">We will have 300 more FE-funded learners later this year&#151;a 9 per cent. increase on last year. Student numbers in that category are currently 241 above the LSC target. We have recruited 1,830 adult FE-funded learners&#151;100 more than the LSC target. There are approximately 150 more learners than the previous year in that category&#151;a 6 per cent. increase. We have heard much about Train to Gain this afternoon. The number of learners under that scheme is 198 more than the LSC target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para20"><a name="0905186000406">There are currently 20 per cent. more applications for the 16-to-18 programmes. That is wonderful news for Barnsley. We have heard about the problems of NEETs&#151;indeed, I intervened on the Opposition spokesperson because we have worked hard in Barnsley to try to reduce the number of young people in that category. A 20 per cent. increase in the number of applications for post-16 education is therefore encouraging.</p>

I am concerned about whether we can deliver all that increased education provision in the forthcoming academic year and the subsequent one. Without the college rebuilding programme, we will struggle. Again, I urge my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to examine the timetable and try to encourage the LSC to stick to the time scales that it has set out in its programme. I also urge him to try to get decisions made and, particularly for Barnsley, allow the programme to continue. Otherwise, we have only half a college.</p>

 Although we are, of course, all interested in how we got into this mess, I am much more interested in how we get out of it. It would be easy to give a litany of complaints and simply recite the virtues of one&#146;s own college&#151;I will not omit to do that. However, I want to pay tribute to the LSC&#146;s regional staff, who deal with Yorkshire and Humber. They are deeply embarrassed by what has happened, they are doing their best to help and I would not like the contamination of mismanagement at the centre to be attributed to everybody who works for that organisation, which will be replaced in any case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para25"><a name="0905186000412">I want to begin by talking about the district of Craven. The north Pennines is fairly remote and has an economy that rests on extremely fragile pillars. A lot of the area is a national park, but tourism has a relatively low value and is predominantly made up of day visitors&#151;indeed, many people spend precious little when they get into the dales. The area depends on agriculture, and we all know that some sectors have experienced extraordinary difficulties. Indeed, the Rural Payments Agency was probably ahead in the charts as the agency that had made the biggest financial mess, until the Learning and Skills Council came along as a late competitor for that accolade, and there are still problems in getting the money to farmers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para26"><a name="0905186000413">There is also the hidden industry of all areas of the countryside, which is looking after the elderly. Anyone who goes to any significant village in my constituency will find households looking after elderly people and an awful lot of people working part time to make money to supplement low income being earned elsewhere in the family, enabling people to maintain, for example, an agriculture holding. There is also a host of small businesses. We have the Skipton building society, which is the giant in the area&#151;a very prudent giant, as a matter of fact&#151;but there is also a huge constellation of small businesses, ranging from micro breweries, of which there has been a refreshing multiplication, to those involved in package recycling and other tiny operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para27"><a name="0905186000414">Craven is therefore an area of high employment. I do not claim that the demands of Craven rest on economic hardship in the way that it might be experienced in places such as Barnsley, which the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) spoke about. However, although there is high employment, there is also low pay and a lot of part-time employment. If anything were to illustrate the vulnerability of Craven&#146;s economy,  <br>

it is foot and mouth disease, which simultaneously shut down agriculture and tourism. That demonstrates the urgency of finding an economic base that is more diversified and less vulnerable to catastrophic events.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para28"><a name="0905186000415">Many people in Craven would also complain of a draining of public services from the area, as there has been pressure to introduce economies in public expenditure. The police presence, as well as the rank of the police establishment, and many other public services, if not the ability of the people doing the serving, have been seen to be reduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para29"><a name="0905186000416">What Craven needs is a much better skills base. Indeed, Skipton building society and the smallest small businesses both complain about their difficulty in recruiting people with sufficient skills, whether they be IT or more basic skills. Craven also needs much better facilities in winter, so that there is a tourist offer in the winter months to supplement the tourist offer in the summer, and a vigorous small business sector that can take advantage of the spread of broadband, which is not yet universal in my constituency, and the exceptional environmental advantages of Craven. Broughton hall, with its sophisticated business park, is the exception, not the rule.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para30"><a name="0905186000417">There are also particular needs that stem from the fact that Craven is not merely a rural area; rather, a great deal of it is upland, which is the most difficult kind of rural area. There is a huge difference between a rural area in East Anglia, where someone could strike a billiard ball and watch it go for miles, and my constituency, which straddles the Pennines. In addition, Craven is the only area in North Yorkshire that has selective education. The two excellent selective schools in Skipton&#151;Ermysted&#146;s and Skipton girls high school&#151;are outstanding, but they ought to be outstanding, given the sociology of North Yorkshire and the selection process. However, that means that it is incredibly important to ensure adequate provision for the 16 to 18-year-olds who do not come out of the selective system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para31"><a name="0905186000418">That brings me to Craven college in Skipton, which is at the heart of a series of interlocking programmes designed to address the broad economic disadvantages and the particular sociology of Craven. Ten years ago, Craven college had between 500 and 600 full-time students in one year group, and about 2,000 part-time students. Now it has 1,600 full-time students, of whom 1,250 are 16 to 18-year-olds drawn from some 80 schools&#151;the college serves not only Craven but a huge rural constituency that goes way beyond the boundaries of Craven itself&#151;and some 5,000 people in part-time employment in any one year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="90518-0009.htm_para32"><a name="0905186000419">So the college&#146;s expansion has been constant, and it has taken place using very limited resources and in the context of certain disadvantages, which I shall explain. First, it operates on 11 sites. My hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) was complaining that his college had to operate in 1960s buildings. How lucky it is! Two of our buildings are Victorian, and the college operates in 11 sites across Skipton. This has two implications: the first relates to costs and the division of effort; the second is the very real health and safety problem of operating in buildings that are far from being fit for purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para0"><a name="0905186000420">A further disadvantage of being in a rural catchment area is that it is often difficult to achieve the necessary critical mass of students to make a course viable. It might not be too difficult to assemble nine or 10 people who want to study the same subject at the same time and in the same place in a metropolitan area, but it is difficult to do so in a rural area. That means that the college is punished in the sense that it does not get the funding, but there are also fewer opportunities because it cannot achieve the critical mass necessary to realise them. The rurality issue has not been addressed in the funding of colleges of further education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para1"><a name="0905186000421">I said that Craven college was at the heart of the regeneration programme for the Craven area. There is a new campus planned. It is in the third tier of progress; the work is awaiting approval, but the plan is very well developed. It is part of one of the wider regeneration programmes that so many colleagues have mentioned today. In particular, it will incorporate a complex for climbing and caving. That might sound eccentric, but climbing and caving are major tourist attractions in that part of the Pennines and the Yorkshire dales, and a knowledge of those subjects will assist the development of winter facilities and enhance what is a unique selling point economically in the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para2"><a name="0905186000422">If the activities of the college could be brought together on one site, it would gain through much greater economies of scale in terms of costs and teaching efficiency, and such a move would also make a huge difference to the social environment of the college. It would enable all sorts of interactions to take place between the students that are impossible if they end their day in 11 different places around the town.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para3"><a name="0905186000423">So what is going to happen? There have been two recent events, on the first of which I would like the advice of the Minister. Within the past few days, the Learning and Skills Council has offered to pay half the &#163;356,000 fees that have been spent on developing the Craven college project, provided that the head of the college signs on the dotted line by noon tomorrow. Should he sign, or is the LSC offering an out-of-court settlement against the threat of a legal action to recover a greater proportion of the fees, such as I understand some colleges are nurturing?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para4"><a name="0905186000424">I have had discussions with Craven college, with which I have dealt in every year since I have been a Member of Parliament, and I have to say that we have not carried the fiery cross around the countryside. We have not said that the college was going to collapse or that further education in Craven was going to come to a halt. We will struggle through, as we have always done. So we are not being alarmist. We are trying to be responsible in dealing with this very real issue, but the head of the college faces a real dilemma over how he should respond to that offer. I pay tribute to the regional staff of the LSC for that offer, because I think they are trying to be helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para5"><a name="0905186000425">We have also talked about Train to Gain. Craven college was harried to step up its Train to Gain activities. It was positively cajoled to expand its programme. It has done so, and it was expecting to spend about &#163;1.6 million on such provision up to the end of the academic year that we have been talking about. That money has been stopped in its tracks overnight, and the provision has been capped at some &#163;1 million. There was no warning of that at all. So having gone out to  <br>

employers to persuade them to sign up to the Train to Gain programme, the college now has to go back and say, &#147;Sorry, we can&#146;t deliver on the very programmes that we encouraged you to sign up for a short while ago.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para6"><a name="0905186000426">What is the way forward? We know that the Government have promised &#163;300 million a year in capital expenditure until 2013, and we also know that there are going to be some transparent new criteria based on need rather than on &#147;first come, first served&#148;, with the deadline set for spring 2010&#151;still a long way away. I ask the Minister to ensure that when those criteria are drawn up, there is a fair assessment of rural needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para7"><a name="0905186000427">Rural needs are not simply an offshoot of a national need; they respond to difference economic and social circumstances, and entirely different definitions of how to be efficient apply in serving the sort of wide rural area that my college serves. I do not want to do down any of the metropolitan areas; we are on the edge of Keighley, and we take students from Keighley as a matter of fact. What I do want to ensure, however, is that there is fair crack of the whip for the rural areas I am talking about. In other words, whether we are judged to have succeeded or not, we want to able to say that at least it was a fair call and a fair judgment. We want to be judged by meaningful criteria that we are capable of delivering and fulfilling, not against criteria that are designed for entirely different circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para8"><a name="0905186000428">I would ask that all programmes be started from scratch. We should start with a blank sheet of paper and the all programmes that have reached a certain degree of maturity should be examined in the light of those different criteria in the different circumstances. A set of programme priorities should be drawn up that reflect the new criteria&#151;not simply the &#147;first come, first served&#148; basis. If the Government really want the best bang for their buck, if they really want to ensure that their money is being spent as well as possible and if they really want to be assured of value for money, they must do that. If they want to be able to turn around and say they have sorted out an appalling mess in an equitable way so that people feel that fairness has been applied to all sections of the country in all the different circumstances of the country, that is what they should do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para9"><a name="0905186000429">I hope that the Government will be fair in addressing those problems. I have not gone into too much detail today, as we will be joining the long procession of people intending to meet the poor Minister&#151;he will be able to do a &#147;Mastermind&#148; on colleges of further education, I suspect, in a couple of months&#146; time&#151;and we can provide the detail then. If the Minister does do what I have suggested, Craven will continue to give him, as it has always has done, the biggest possible bang for the buck. The benefits will then be spread over a huge area of rural England.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to follow two other Yorkshire Members in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para10"><a name="09051815000003">Our country is in the middle of an extremely severe recession&#151;the first global recession since the 1930s. It is global in the sense that, for the first time since the 1930s, global output is likely to fall. This recession, as we all know, was triggered by the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States. It spread quickly around the world because of the globalised nature of the banking  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="18 May 2009">

and financial services sector these days, and it was amplified by light-touch regulation in this and other OECD countries. One of the lessons to be learned from this recession is that the Thatcher-Reagan doctrine that private institutions are always best regulated by themselves rather than the state has come to an end. I do not want more regulation, but I do want smarter regulation so that the lessons of the recession are learned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para11"><a name="09051815000004">Before I turn specifically to deal with further education, let me say that I chair the Economics and Security Committee of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. The week before last, our committee was in Washington DC to meet the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to discuss the recession. They predicted that, from the peak to the trough of the recession, global output is likely to fall by 3 to 4 per cent. They also say that if Governments such as ours and other OECD Governments had not adopted fiscal stimulus packages, global output would fall by something like 9 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para12"><a name="09051815000005">Let me explain the difference. If global output falls by 3 or 4 per cent., it will mean a very severe recession&#151;more severe than any since the second world war. But if output falls by 9 per cent., we will be in the territory that existed between the two world wars when there was a decade-long depression and unemployment soared for years at a time. The fiscal stimulus is a necessary response and it is right to put Government funding behind education and training, particularly vocational training. I was pleased to see hundreds of millions of pounds being set aside in the Budget for that purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para13"><a name="09051815000006">It is extremely important to invest in skills&#151;both in vocational training and in broad liberal education&#151;so that we see benefits in our national economy and so that individual citizens in our country see the benefits of jobs and job security. It is important to do so now, so that the country benefits when the upturn comes. We do not want to make the same mistake as was made when the Conservatives were in power and people were simply parked on benefits during the recession, without the funding for training, and vocational training in particular, that we have at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para14"><a name="09051815000007">During the 12 years that the Labour party has been in government, a strong platform has been created within further education to provide the skills training that we need. In my constituency, in 1996-97, some &#163;12.1 million was allocated to York college and the York sixth-form college, which was a separate institution. Since then, the two have merged, and in 2008-09, the budget was &#163;20.5 million&#151;an increase of &#163;8.4 million, or 69 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para15"><a name="09051815000008">It is not just in York that additional resources have gone into further education. There are eight colleges in York and North Yorkshire. Two are specialist colleges&#151;Henshaws college, a specialist college in Harrogate that provides education and training for people with visual impairment and additional physical or learning difficulties, and Askham Bryan college, one of the largest land-based colleges in the country&#151;and there are six more general further education or sixth-form colleges. Between them, and including Craven college, which the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) spoke about, they work with some 50,000 young people and have a combined turnover of &#163;70 million a year.</p>

and train some 7,000 employees a year. They have degree and higher-level programmes for more than 2,000 students. The colleges in York and North Yorkshire educate nearly 12,000 16 to 18-year-olds&#151;more than all the school sixth forms in York and North Yorkshire put together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para17"><a name="09051815000010">It is important to have the right balance of numbers to guarantee choice for young people at the age of 16 between courses and between settings&#151;school and further education. The two Departments&#151;the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and the Department for Children, Schools and Families&#151;need to talk further about how the school sixth form presumption works. In 2007-08, which is the latest year for which I have figures, there were 4,129 16 to 19-year-olds from York in college and 1,079 in school sixth forms. Each individual 16-year-old has a choice about whether to attend one of the five schools in York that has a sixth form or whether to go to York college, or indeed one of the other colleges, such as Askham Bryan or another further education college close to York.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para18"><a name="09051815000011">The schools provide continuity and familiarity for the students. They are smaller and, as a result, provide a narrower range of subjects. They provide extremely good education. York college, like the schools, achieves excellent A-level results, but its curriculum provides about 40 subjects, including a full range of modern languages, which none of the school sixth forms can provide; specialist subjects such as archaeology and ancient history, which have a particular purpose and which we have a need for in a city such as York; and specialist art courses such as photography. Indeed, Freddy Bulmer, an 18-year-old at York college, has just won first prize in the national Colleges on Camera competition. His winning photograph shows the impact that the &#163;65 million investment by the Government and the college in the new York college has had on him and his fellow students. It is good to see excellence coming from a further education college.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para19"><a name="09051815000012">Perhaps I should tell hon. Members that four years ago, after the general election, I did what I usually do after elections&#151;commissioned a local artist to make a limited-edition print to celebrate life in York. The artist I commissioned on that occasion was a young man from York college, Michael Kirkman, who produced a fabulous print of building work at York hospital. That was his choice of subject, which he felt summed up the type of life that people live in York now. I am pleased to say that one of his prints is in the collection of York art gallery while another hangs in the boardroom of York hospital. Several others hang in GP surgeries around the city&#151;it is marvellous work. That, again, shows that colleges can provide excellence at the highest level.</p>

There were concerns from other 16-to-18 educational providers in the area that it might dilute provision elsewhere. There were discussions between the head of Archbishop Holgate&#146;s school&#151;an old and venerable institution headed by John Harris, who is a head teacher I respect enormously&#151;and the local education authority. They agreed that there was already good level 3 A-level provision in York, but that more level 1 provision was needed for the 4 or 5 per cent. of students who are not  <br>

in education, employment or training. Archbishop&#146;s sixth form is making a real contribution in that field, focusing on the needs of the NEET group and of young people aged 16 to 18 who have disabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para21"><a name="09051815000014">However, there are other schools&#151;good schools&#151;in York seeking sixth forms. If they were all to take individual decisions, we could end up with poorer 16-to-19 provision overall. There is a tension between school choice on the one hand and the LEA&#146;s commissioning role on the other. I believe that a different balance is needed on who can take a decision. The Government&#146;s decision to give LEAs responsibility for further education and schools will help a new balance to be struck.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para22"><a name="09051815000015">It is important for the Government and LEAs to recognise that learner choice is not the same as school choice. We need learner-centred provision so that young people in York and the surrounding area can choose between school or sixth-form college and between a wide range of subjects&#151;not just A-levels, but vocational provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para23"><a name="09051815000016">I also want to say a word or two about the discrepancy in funding between school sixth forms and further education. School sixth forms receive a premium of about 5.6 per cent. If York college received the same funding as school sixth forms, it would get about &#163;900,000 more per year. Quite quickly, as I have been raising the matter for several years, I would like to see that gap being closed. It is more likely that that will be achieved now that LEAs have responsibility for further education as well as schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para24"><a name="09051815000017">I congratulate the Government on their capital funding for schools and for colleges. In 1996-97, schools in York received capital funding of less than &#163;1 million a year. In the 12 years since then, they have received, on average each year, more than &#163;10 million&#151;a tenfold increase for York&#146;s schools. As I said, we have a brand new York college, built at a cost of &#163;65 million, more than &#163;20 million of which came in the form of Government grant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para25"><a name="09051815000018">Once again, however, there is a gap between the capital regime for further education and that for school sixth forms, which receive 100 per cent. capital funding whereas further education does not. In order to build a new college building, York college had to borrow some &#163;4.5 million on its own account, and a proportion of its general income is used to pay back that loan. Schools do not pay VAT on services and equipment, but colleges do. Although both school and college-goers receive the education maintenance allowance, which is an important Labour innovation because it makes it possible for people from low-income families to continue in education after 16, in schools young people from low-income families also receive the benefit of free school meals, which are not available in FE. If one takes all the funding differences together, the gap is not 5.6 per cent., which is what the Government acknowledge, but rather more&#151;possibly as much as 15 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para26"><a name="09051815000019">Colleges admit a greater proportion of students from disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Some 29 per cent. of those in FE come from such neighbourhoods, compared with 19 per cent. of those in school sixth forms and, for comparative purposes, some 20 per cent. of those in universities. It is important that students from more disadvantaged neighbourhoods get the same quality and level of funding as those in schools, and LEAs must address that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para30"><a name="09051815000024">Many of us took part in a debate in Westminster Hall in March, when the Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills had an uncomfortable 90 minutes being beaten up by Members of all parties. If I may give him some respectful advice, perhaps his response to this debate might be less pugnacious than it was on that occasion and a little more constructive, bridge-building and conciliatory. Whereas other Ministers have come to the House and told us that they are bringing forward the capital programme for counter-cyclical reasons, he has had to tell us of a freeze in the further education capital programme with projects, far from being brought forward, being indefinitely postponed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="90518-0010.htm_para31"><a name="09051815000025">Two years ago Cricklade college in Andover merged with Sparsholt college, just outside Winchester. Thanks to the energy and commitment of the principal, Tim Jackson, and his team, the quality of education in Andover has been driven up since the merger. They are doing a fantastic job in challenging circumstances, but they have not been assisted by recent events. At the time of the merger, the LSC wrote to me:</p>
<a name="90518-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="09051815000102"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Current thinking is that there will be a required investment of up to &#163;30 million in Andover and &#163;20 million in Winchester.&#148;</p>

administrative building would be knocked down and replaced because it looked dreadful. It was not, and that is not in the plan at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para1"><a name="09051815000028">The college applied for in-principle approval in Andover last November, expecting the go-ahead in February or March. In the meantime, it got planning consent from Test Valley borough council. The scheme was an integral part of the regeneration of Andover town centre, complementing plans that have already been introduced in one part of the town and are about to be in another. Then, along with 143 other colleges, in March we were told that the deal was off. There is great disappointment in the town.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para2"><a name="09051815000029">To pick up on points that have been made in the debate, I understand that decisions are about to be taken on how to spend the money that is available, topped up by the funds announced in the Budget, which I welcome. It seems that schemes that are &#147;shovel-ready&#148;, to use the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Havant, will get the go-ahead, while other schemes that might have progressed in the near future will go to the back of the queue. It would be helpful if the Minister said a little more in his winding-up speech about the criteria that will be applied when deciding who goes first and who comes last, and if he could indicate for local consumption the earliest date at which the project in Andover might now get the go-ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para3"><a name="09051815000030">On top of the capital debacle, there is also a revenue headache as a result of the gamble that colleges were encouraged to take by the LSC in bidding for funds. Some will now turn in financial deficits, which would not have been the case, unless the LSC is able to step in and refund their fees. I was interested to hear my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon say that his local college has had an offer of a contribution towards abortive fees, although I am not quite sure why it has to decide so quickly. In the case of Andover, about 70 per cent. of the &#163;2 million spent in fees is now abortive. That risks turning a potential surplus of &#163;500,000 into a potential deficit of &#163;900,000. Will the Minister say something about which colleges are getting help, and of what sort, in meeting the abortive fees?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para4"><a name="09051815000031">The other frustrating thing is that the LSC is responsible for monitoring the financial health of colleges. In many cases, the reason for the deterioration has nothing to do with the college but is entirely due to the LSC. Unless it can come up with the necessary help with abortive fees, some colleges will go into deficit and may breach financial covenants. Many will have to borrow funds from the bank, incurring interest payments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para5"><a name="09051815000032">I move on to a subject that has not been touched on at all&#151;provision for adults with learning difficulties and disabilities. There is a need for much greater clarity about what is done for adults on the education side of the equation and what is done by social service departments on the social and personal development side. A few years ago, colleges would accept those with learning difficulties on courses, and would interpret the rules broadly. People would continue to attend college year after year, even though they were not really progressing. It was an important part of their life and self-development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para6"><a name="09051815000033">A few years ago the rules were tightened, and colleges are now required to ensure that courses attended by adults with LDD lead to clear, successful outcomes in qualifications.

anything appropriate for them to progress to, they are unable to be recycled year after year, so they stop going. That change was made a few years ago at the point of transition. That issue might not be one for the Minister, but it is certainly one for the Government if we are to have joined-up government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para7"><a name="09051815000034">This morning I was rereading &#147;Valuing people now&#148;, the Government&#146;s three-year strategy for people with learning disabilities. It is very much a health-focused document, with not a lot in it about education, but I found one sentence about education that I will have to read out, in the hope that the House will understand what it means better than I can. It states:</p>
<a name="90518-0011.htm_brev0"><a name="09051815000104"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The cross-government Work, Education and Life Group will also lead implementation of &#145;Progression through Partnership&#146; (the post-16 education strategy) and the Getting a Life project, which aims to achieve an integrated assessment and decision-making process that will allow people to use public resources flexibly to get the outcomes they want&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para8"><a name="09051815000035">I hope that that means that folk will be able to go on courses that are suitable for them, but I say to the Minister that it is by no means clear how the education-social services interface will work. I hope that he will ensure that there are suitable courses for people with learning difficulties that are provided either by social services or by education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para9"><a name="09051815000036">I turn briefly to some other issues in the motion. The number of NEETs in my constituency, as in those of other colleagues, has risen. It is now at 185, having risen from 135 in December, five months ago. Many fewer adults are now attending training courses at Andover college than was the case in 2005. I suspect that that is because in some cases there is a real issue of affordability when it comes to the fees. There was a 29 per cent. drop in 2007-08 compared to 2006-07, and a 41 per cent. drop in 2007-08 compared to 2005-06. I hope that the Minister will say a little about the Government&#146;s response to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para10"><a name="09051815000037">We heard a great deal from the Secretary of State about Train to Gain, which, in a sense, has been too successful. In my constituency, as in Skipton and Ripon, we now have a moratorium on new starts. Private providers and colleges have been told to stop, current activity with employers has been curtailed, and future contracts are being held back to avoid over-commitment in the forthcoming year. There is considerable frustration about the fact that after everyone has been geared up, they are having to be geared down again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para11"><a name="09051815000038">The subject of unfunded students was raised earlier, and I need to see what the Secretary of State said in response. At present there are about 120 unfunded places for the autumn in my constituency. The college has submitted a bid. The Secretary of State&#146;s speech suggested that we might be given answers about the bids; perhaps the Minister could shed some light on that. As for apprentices, there is understandably less capacity in the workplace to take on, in particular, young and inexperienced trainees. Sadly, in Andover we have seen a rise in the number of apprenticeship redundancies, which has pushed up the number of NEETs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09051815000039">Let me make a general point. Further education colleges find sudden changes in funding flows very challenging. When commitments to engaging additional  <br>

staff are required, the stop-start approach to funding is very difficult to manage. As all Members have pointed out, colleges are crucial to the economic and social well-being of the areas in which they operate. They cannot be expected to operate as a very small business might be expected to, moving resources in and out from one week to the next.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para13"><a name="09051815000040">I hope that the Government will exercise continuing stewardship over the financial well-being of colleges. That is especially important when the commissioning of much of their work switches to local authorities, with funding supplied via the Department for Children, Schools and Families, while the overarching stewardship of colleges rests with the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para14"><a name="09051815000041">Finally, let me say to my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Evennett), who will wind up the debate, that it would be interesting to hear whether he considers that we are totally satisfied with the rather blurred responsibility for the age group that we are discussing, or whether he thinks that the issue might need to be revisited in a year&#146;s time.</p>

 It is possible that I am the only Member present who served a full apprenticeship, although I stand to be corrected on that. When I served an apprenticeship as a mechanic, there was respect for the traditions of people who had served apprenticeships for many years. We felt, as apprentices and as craftsmen, that we were part of a culture in which what was learnt was passed on, and it was part and parcel of the pride that we took in doing the job that young people were introduced to it. It was heartening for me to become a time-served craftsman and work with young people in learning skills. However, it was disheartening for me to be part of a generation that saw the last of the apprenticeships in the industry in which I worked, the coal industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para15"><a name="09051815000043">It was directly owing to the policy of the Conservative party that we saw a decline in apprenticeships. It made policy decisions that largely destroyed the coal industry, decimated the railway industry, did away with the shipyards, cut back the steelworks and privatised British Gas, the electricity boards, the water boards and BT. All those were national companies with major training schemes, which employed many, many young people. What happened to young people in my village was that, instead of working with people like me&#151;as apprenticeship mechanics, electricians or welders&#151;they ended up as apprentice burglars and apprentice drug-takers, and became very good at taking cars without the owners&#146; consent and taking radios from cars. That is not much to pass on to the next generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09051815000044">In the days when I trained with the National Coal Board, everyone had some form of education, right up to degree level. People were not just given vocational training; they were taught how to stay alive underground and, importantly, how to keep their fellow workers alive. A huge vacuum was created at the end of the 1980s and during the 1990s, but I am thankful that my party&#146;s Government have begun to fill it. It is true that things are not perfect, but we have, without a doubt, modernised and restructured apprenticeships in a way that addresses the challenges of the 21st century. Those  <br>

challenges are, and will continue to be, different from the challenges that I faced when I became an apprentice. The fact remains that the Government have invested additional money this year. They have agreed to provide a further &#163;140 million, which will fund 35,000 apprenticeships. That is good for the public, and for the people for whom the apprentices are working. In 1997 there were only 65,000 apprenticeships in the country; today there are a quarter of a million, and completion rates are at an all-time high. That is something we can be very proud of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09051815000045">During the Secretary of State&#146;s speech, I raised the subject of union learning reps, which is never mentioned by the Conservative party. That may appear unsurprising, given its attitude to trade unions. There are 22,000 accredited union learning reps out there working with people. I was involved, with the National Union of Public Employees, in a scheme called Return to Learn, which helped people many of whom had no literacy or numeracy skills, and experienced great problems even in reading or writing. For the first time since leaving school, in many cases as young as 15, people were told &#147;We value you. You may only be doing menial, manual work in society&#146;s eyes, but your contribution is important, and because of that we want you to become re-engaged in the world of education.&#148; Such schemes have been one of the keystones of workplace learning in this country. Last year, a quarter of a million people were given access to learning at work through union learning reps.</p>

I was talking to people such as David Smith, who has helped many young people, as well as older people, into the workplace. They benefited from real dedication and real praise from their employers and others who took part in the schemes. Last year I was very proud when an old colleague of mine, Felicity Mendelson, who works for Newcastle city council, was recognised by the Queen for the great work that she had done as a union learning rep.

problems, and it would be wrong for me or any other Member to deny that the LSC has let people down, but I do not think that the Secretary of State intends to do the same.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para20"><a name="09051815000052">Last week I met representatives of Balfour Beatty, who are worried about what may happen if we do not put right what has gone wrong in the last few months. I know that the Conservatives do not agree with this, but I strongly believe that we should be building our way out of the recession. We should be using that terrible term &#147;fiscal stimulus&#148;, and companies such as Balfour Beatty&#151;along with many other people&#151;should be rebuilding colleges and schools. The Balfour Beatty representatives told me that a potential 40,000 jobs are available to people who could be employed in the building industry, but may not be. The Government must start to address that. I hope that, when he responds, the Minister will go some way towards allaying my fears.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para21"><a name="09051815000053">Like every other Member who has spoken so far, I shall say something about the colleges in my area. I want to tell the success story of Gateshead college, which has never been afraid of embarking on partnerships. It does not believe in standing about whingeing, or in promoting doom and gloom. It wants to get on with the real work. That is why last year it moved out of the building in Durham road where it had been for many years, sold that building and went forward in partnership. It has been given &#163;60 million by the Government to build the new Baltic college on the regenerated Gateshead quayside. It has been a tremendous success. There are 7,000 students and 500 staff, working at a college that is a source of great pride to me and the people who live in the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para22"><a name="09051815000054">A &#163;5.5 million skills academy on a nearby industrial estate has done tremendous work with companies such as Nissan and others in the automotive industry, which is so important to our local economy. A &#163;15 million academy for sport has also been developed on the former Gateshead stadium site, and I hope it will play a major part in the development of Olympic athletes for this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para23"><a name="09051815000055">The college has been recognised across the board. In the last two years it gained &#147;outstanding&#148; grade 1 marks in Ofsted inspections in all six areas tested. It has a success rate of 83 per cent. and it is within the top 10 per cent. of colleges in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="90518-0011.htm_para24"><a name="09051815000056">The college completed the renovation of its estate with the opening of the Baltic campus and the skills academy, the result of a &#163;60 million investment. It has been recognised by the LSC for outstanding financial performance in a very challenging environment, and by Ofsted for providing outstanding value for money. It has provided more than &#163;10 million to local companies for Train to Gain, and turnover has increased by more than 25 per cent. In 2008-09, it also achieved growth in the number of full-time 16 to 18-year-old students, which rose from 1,757 to 2,272. It has been officially named as the top college in the region for delivery of apprenticeships and the lead provider for the National Skills Academy for Manufacturing. It secured the Ford master apprenticeship programme for the north-east and it is the preferred training provider for Nissan. It has also been awarded many other accolades.</p>

Working with MPs, and with a great contribution from the Secretary of State concerned, the college and Nissan drove forward training programmes from this year to the back end of last year, which extended the working life of hundreds of Nissan employees in Sunderland. Although for some of them it was extended only for a short period, it at least meant they were able to get to Christmas without facing the threat of the dole.</p>

The college is working closely with the local council, which has decided to bring forward its capital programme. It is helping the council create 500 new apprenticeships, and it is also working with local businesses to get even more apprentices into work.

 The importance of this debate is underlined by the OECD&#146;s economic outlook; it says that unemployment in our country could rise to 10 per cent., and it said in November that it could rise faster than in any other G7 country. Accurate and promptly published analysis of unemployment trends is important for the providers of training and further education, particularly in a recession, which is also an opportunity for reskilling. In terms of the data available to inform training providers, the jobseeker figures provided by Jobcentre Plus and the Office for National Statistics seem to vary by between 10 per cent. and 15 per cent. That is concerning in itself, but when we add in the number of those who are economically inactive but who want a job, the unemployment figure in Gravesham is almost trebled.</p>

difficult step of deciding to learn to read and write and had filled in all the forms. Some of them were motivated to do so because they wanted to start to do homework with their children, some because they wanted to expand their businesses, while others just wanted to achieve their potential. They went to their local FE college and, to its credit, they found a great class that they enjoyed, but there was a problem: the Government&#146;s policy to phase out funding on equivalent or lower qualifications. They had taken a huge step in admitting that they could not read or write, and had grasped the basics, but they wanted to do more advanced things such as write job application letters. That was deemed to be a bit too advanced to be funded, however. Indeed, the policy required members of the group to learn individually using a specially designed computer programme. The group set itself up in a local church hall, and a saint-like teacher from the local college agreed to work on a much lower rate of pay. Some of the adult learners valued what they were learning so much that they funded the course from their benefit payments. I am delighted that this community group was able to fund and deliver that learning and development, and such community-organised solutions are always refreshing, but do we want motivated people to be turned away from training?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="90518-0012.htm_para1"><a name="09051815000064">Another group I wish to highlight is those who are already skilled but who want to retrain for work in sectors that are offering jobs. Let me offer the examples from Gravesham of a construction worker who had a back injury and a bus driver who had suffered a stroke, which prevented them from performing manual work and driving. Both men enjoyed computing and wanted to be retrained in that field, where one could expect a motivated and qualified person to find a job. The man with the stroke was expected to recover fully over about three years and, rather than sit around on disability benefits during that period, he wanted to spend the time retraining. He faced some hurdles, however. Under the current rules, jobseekers can wait up to 18 months before they are able to take a full-time training course while claiming benefits. Nevertheless, jobcentres can help to arrange shorter training courses sooner than that. The problem is that the choice is fairly limited unless one wants training in basic English or maths, which many newly unemployed people do not need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="90518-0012.htm_para2"><a name="09051815000065">I can also offer the example of a man who was a service manager in a car dealership, which is not a good organisation to be employed in right now. He therefore wants to reskill as a locksmith as he has identified a gap in the market, but he is finding it very difficult to get help to retrain to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="90518-0012.htm_para3"><a name="09051815000066">Another problem is that any additional training can be limited to what are described as &#147;growth areas&#148;. I identified Gravesham&#146;s only growth area when making representations following a visit to 50 employees who had worked for the local branch of Woolworths. They were mainly women in their mid-40s and 50s, and a fair number of them had left school without qualifications, and had gone to work for Woolworths after raising a family. I made inquiries on their behalf at our jobcentre to determine what training they would receive, and was told that the only identified growth area was the care sector. The care sector offer good careers in Gravesham, of course, but what struck me was the idea that that was the only available option, because not everybody is suited to working in the care sector.</p>

We must keep the recently unemployed keen, motivated and focused and then get them back into work. The Government must do more to distinguish between the recently unemployed and the long-term unemployed. Of course all unemployed people should remain on our radar, but we must avoid the recently, first-time unemployed joining the long-term unemployed&#151;their needs are not very subtly different. The newly unemployed need rapid training to avoid their joining the benefits-cycle club.</p>

 This has been an important and interesting debate on the vital subject of skills in the recession. Regrettably, Britain is in a serious recession and there is a serious skills shortage within our society. A new approach is absolutely necessary, because this Government have undoubtedly failed in their attempt to improve skills. In the main, we have had a constructive debate about the issues highlighted in our motion, and Conservative Members have presented the Government&#146;s failings in the areas of college capital funding, apprenticeships, training, skills shortages and adult education. In our motion and in a number of speeches made by my Conservative colleagues, we have put forward an alternative approach with policies designed to ensure that we have the necessary skills for the future.</p>

Regrettably, in his speech, the Secretary of State floundered and gave the usual Government gloss<i> &#151;[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown) laughs, but he did flounder and did give a gloss, and he was very selective in his responses. He was terribly party political, backward-looking, disappointing, faltering and unconvincing&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><i> </i>And he enters the Chamber at this very moment. Even he did not appear to be convinced of his arguments and explanations, let alone the rest of us. Regrettably, he made wide generalisations and, as always, his contribution was rather lacking in detail. He said that the college failings should not have happened, but they did&#151;they happened on his watch. Why was that? We heard too much history, not enough of the contemporary and not a lot for the future&#151;it was very disappointing.</p>

May I reassure him, as he wanted Conservative Front Benchers to do, that our further education funding council will have a simple funding flow? It will be one body and it will be less bureaucratic.

He went on to discuss NEETs and young people with disabilities, all of which are crucial issues that we should be addressing, as we have tried to do today. I did not agree with him on local education authorities taking responsibility for 16 to 19-year-olds, as per the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill, which is going through Parliament at this time.

 My hon. Friend the Member for Havant has already answered that by saying that we are looking at things very sympathetically. We must move on, because the time available to us is very short. <i> [Interruption.]</i><i> </i>The hon. Member for West Ham, who is a Parliamentary Private Secretary, seems to want to make a contribution&#151;she has made more of a contribution from a sedentary position than many others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="90518-0012.htm_para11"><a name="09051815000081">In the short time available I wish to concentrate on two things: NEETs; and the college capital programme. Unemployment is a real tragedy and the failure of young people to be in training, education or employment is a real concern. This current recession is hitting the younger people in our community even harder. The level of youth unemployment is rising and we are very concerned that it will continue to rise, with the result that there will be more people in this situation. A record number of people are not in any form of education, employment or training, as shown in the official figures. That is a tragedy for individuals, for local communities and for our country&#146;s future, thus it is so important that we look constructively at dealing with the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="90518-0012.htm_para12"><a name="09051815000082">In the past, the UK&#146;s position on youth unemployment was a lot better than the OECD average, but I regret to say that it is deteriorating. We have heard in speeches today how much more it will deteriorate&#151;even by the Government&#146;s own admission&#151;in the forthcoming future. This is a disaster and it is an indictment of what the Government have failed to do in their term in office.</p>

As my hon. Friend the Member for Havant said, this Government always have good intentions and they are good on rhetoric, but the reality is always something quite different. That is terribly disappointing. The Association of Colleges says that existing problems include a funding system that is &#147;too slow&#148;, rules that restrict the movement of &#147;money between funding pots&#148; and an obsession with</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="90518-0012.htm_para15"><a name="09051815000085">Restrictions on other training providers are also causing problems. A number of training providers with tried-and-tested ways of helping young people engage with learning and the labour market have found that they are ineligible for public funding because they do not tick the right boxes. In some instances, they have had to halt all provision as a result. Training providers face a difficult and uncertain future due to constant internal reorganisation at the LSC and the Government&#146;s education Bill, which is going through Parliament at the moment and will create more new quangos, more bureaucracy and more ineffective delivery of facilities for training and opportunities for our young people.</p>

My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) has given me more details. The college is in partnership with others&#151;with businesses and the local community&#151;to regenerate the centre of King&#146;s Lynn. It cannot do that if it does not get its part of the funding. That is the reality on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="90518-0012.htm_para23"><a name="09051815000095">The Secretary of State is always unwilling to answer direct questions on these matters, but I want to put a couple to him. He did not answer my hon. Friend the Member for Havant on the subject of the criteria that will be set, which the Secretary of State highlighted and which will go through shortly. I want his colleague, the Under-Secretary, to respond to three points to do with the criteria. First, what are the criteria? Will regeneration be a top priority for the funding that will be available for the colleges&#146; future? What is the chronology, and will it be the people who put in first&#151;those who are &#147;shovel ready&#148;&#151;who get the funding or not? What will be the effect on the other players, providers and agencies?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="90518-0012.htm_para24"><a name="09051815000096">Most importantly, as mentioned in a brief from the Association of Colleges, the Government must confirm what happens to the money. For example, &#163;215 million is being spent on capital expenditure on stalled projects; &#163;187 million will be written off in colleges&#146; accounts if the projects do not go forward, which will put most colleges in deficit and wipe out their reserves; and there will be &#163;269 million spent on extra costs, such as maintenance, in the next five years. There needs to be a full, fair and fast compensation scheme that we run to a clear timetable and the Government need to get a grip of that&#151;they should do so now&#151;and to let us know openly what their priorities will be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="90518-0012.htm_para26"><a name="09051815000100">What do we really need? The capital funding programme should have fairness, transparency and clarity, and rigorous criteria should be applied to the projects awaiting approval. On apprenticeships, we need an expansion of real, work-based programmes. We must make it easier for companies to mix apprenticeships by cutting excessive paperwork, instituting direct payment to employers and injecting support for apprentices of all ages, delivered through lifelong learning accounts. We need more community learning and employability, and to provide funds specifically for NEETs, targeting help to those most in need after leaving school. We also need investment in an adult and community learning fund for much-needed courses to help people to update their skills or to gain new skills. We need to set FE colleges free from the bureaucracy of the LSC and its planned successors. We need a revolution to improve the careers service, which is, at present, inadequate. In too many areas, the focus is just on universities. Funds should be refocused from the current provision to provide a new all-age service and to set up a new web-based skills matching service.</p>

 Non-leg waxing.</p>

<p><a name="st_o282"><a name="09051826000004"><a name="90518-0013.htm_spnew1"><a name="09051826000535"><b>Mr. Simon:</b>
 About his non-leg waxing and tonsorial treatments at his local FE college. Amusing though that was, he went on to make the point, &#147;My local FE college even does accountancy.&#148; That was a good point, well made. People can do more at an FE college now than was traditionally the case. I recently went to Matthew Boulton college in Birmingham city centre. It is a fantastic college that was built four years ago but is still a state-of-the-art beacon of what can be done&#151;and of what we have done all over this country, as we have built new FE colleges to allow vocational learners to do all kinds of training. At Matthew Boulton, students can not only do accountancy but dentistry, too. There are mini operating theatres and a state-of-the-art broadband wireless fitting thing on which all the Sky installation engineers in the country are trained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="90518-0013.htm_para0"><a name="09051826000005">That is what one can do in an FE college these days, and that is what people are doing, up and down the land, in the colleges that we have built and that we are continuing to build. However, having said that, there has been a serious problem in the future funding for the FE colleges that we plan to build. The hon. Member for Bristol, West began the debate on that subject by talking about the numbers of colleges involved in the current difficulties. It was also mentioned by the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) and a couple of other Members, and I shall come back to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="90518-0013.htm_para1"><a name="09051826000006">Before I mention the capital, which is the next issue that I shall deal with, I want to mention the thrust of the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson). He spoke with great passion, and from experience, about the union learning fund, its representatives, what they do and achieve, and how important they are. The Secretary of State mentioned them in his opening speech, and said that he had recently been to a union learning facility in his constituency. A week or two before I was appointed to my current job, I visited a union learning facility in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="90518-0013.htm_para2"><a name="09051826000007">It is notable that the shadow Secretary of State did not mention union learning in his speech, and his party&#146;s lengthy documents never mention it. He intervened on my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon to say that he had recently had a meeting with the Trades Union Congress, at which his attitude had been sympathetic. I have to say that to those of us on the Labour Benches it seemed more pathetic than sympathetic that he would not guarantee the &#163;21.5 million that we invest in that learning. There was even a parliamentary question tabled by an hon. Member from his party about unionlearn, the thrust of which was, &#147;Why are we spending public money funding people to learn about how to be trade unionists?&#148; As hon. Members will know, that is not what unionlearn is about. It is about union representatives in the workplace signposting and directing into learning workers who otherwise would not get there. It is a great programme, and my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon does great work by bringing it up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="90518-0013.htm_para3"><a name="09051826000008">I have a feeling that in the time available to me, I might not get very much further than the subject of capital. The hon. Member for Bristol, West, talked about the number of colleges affected by the current problem. There are 144 colleges directly affected; 79 have already received approval in principle, and a further 65 have submitted their applications in principle but have not yet received approval. As I have said on many occasions in this House and elsewhere, and to many college principals whom I have met, many other colleges will have invested time, money in some cases, and certainly energy and commitment in drawing up putative plans for future investment, but will not yet have submitted their papers. We are, and have always been, conscious&#151;I have said this many times in the House&#151;that in addition to the 144 colleges mentioned, another subset of colleges is affected in a real but lesser way. The 144 colleges mentioned are those that are directly involved in the current scheme.</p>

<p><a name="st_o283"><a name="09051826000009"><a name="90518-0013.htm_spnew2"><a name="09051826000536"><b>Mr. Hayes:</b>
 The Minister is indeed giving a less pugnacious summing-up than he did on a previous occasion, as my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) recommended he should. The Minister must by now have come to a conclusion about what that extra number is. It is inconceivable that the civil servants working with him would not have come up with a figure. How many colleges are we talking about? Is it 160, 180 or 200? He must know; it is time that he came clean.</p>

<p><a name="st_o284"><a name="09051826000010"><a name="90518-0013.htm_spnew3"><a name="09051826000537"><b>Mr. Simon:</b>
 I was about to deal with the &#147;pugnacious&#148; slur, but then I found myself wanting to respond that if the hon. Gentleman had the slightest understanding of the issue, he could not possibly ask such a daft question. Of course we could not possibly put a figure on the number of people who may have been thinking about applying to have a new college in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="90518-0013.htm_para4"><a name="09051826000011">Moving on to the serious points made on the issue, my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) asked about the timetable. Again, we have gone through that subject on several occasions. The Learning and Skills Council has convened a panel of college principals, which has met and is looking into the issue. The LSC will write to college principals shortly, letting them know what the prioritisation criteria will be. Subject to the publication of those criteria, decisions will be made very quickly about which colleges can go forward with the work. My hon. Friend suggested that that might be done not in one hit, but in a two-stage process. He suggested that in the first instance, a larger number of colleges would be deemed to have met the criteria, and then a value for money process would be undergone before there was a second phase, in which a final, formal allocation was made. As far as I am aware, the LSC has not made that decision yet, although I am aware that it has been having discussions of that nature. The fundamental point remains that it and we have committed to giving firm answers to colleges about the first tranche, or this year&#146;s tranche, of funding by the early summer&#151;that is, imminently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="90518-0013.htm_para5"><a name="09051826000012">The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry), who I see is in the Chamber, mentioned regional LSC staff. I want to take this opportunity to  <br>

<notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2009 : Column 1262</b><br>
agree with him: all the college principals I meet&#151;and I meet dozens and dozens of them to talk about the issue&#151;make it clear, time and again, that the regional LSC staff with whom they deal are doing a good job. They have no problems with those staff at all. This is a good opportunity to congratulate regional LSC staff from the Dispatch Box on the work that they do in a committed and successful way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="90518-0013.htm_para6"><a name="09051826000013">The right hon. Gentleman talked about Craven college and the importance of the rural. He has mentioned that issue before. I have spoken to principals who were on the reference panel that drew up the criteria. One principal of a land-based college assured me that he had raised the issue, that it had been considered by the reference panel, and that it would go forward and influence the decision on the criteria that college principals come up with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="90518-0013.htm_para7"><a name="09051826000014">My hon. Friend the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley) made the case for his local colleges, at least two of which I have visited; both are, as he says, extraordinary. He made slightly mistaken use of the word &#147;cuts&#148; when talking about his early-day motion. I hope it does not say &#147;cuts&#148; in his early-day motion; we should be clear that we were going to spend &#163;2.3 billion on college capital this year anyway, and we are now going to spend &#163;2.6 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="90518-0013.htm_para8"><a name="09051826000015">The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young), who I see is in the Chamber, and who bizarrely said that I was pugnacious in the Westminster Hall debate, asked whether the schemes that do not go ahead in the current tranche will go to the back of the queue. It is important for people to understand that that is not the case. There will be two processes, one of which starts now; the gateway criterion for that process is shovel readiness, if I may use that phrase. There will then be a second process, using the same criteria that were drawn up in the first process except that of shovel readiness. Through that second process, the second set of colleges will be put through. It is not a question of those colleges going to the back of the queue; they will effectively be dealt with in the same way as the first lot, but more slowly and later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="90518-0013.htm_para9"><a name="09051826000016">I do not have time to deal with apprenticeships or NEETs, or the many other issues that hon. Members raised. All that I would say in conclusion is that I hope today&#146;s debate has caused the hon. Member for Havant to reconsider his calls for cuts in the skills budget, and caused him to recognise, as we do, that skills are the bedrock of our economic future. Neither issue&#151;neither skills nor our economic future&#151;can be trusted to the Tories.</p>

In Professor Sir George Alberti&#146;s case, the report was no more than a snapshot of what is happening in relation to Stafford general hospital.</p>

course, the issue goes further. Indeed, the issues under discussion range widely: many people, wherever they live, were shocked by what they read in the Healthcare Commission&#146;s report and wanted to know not just what happened but why it happened; and people in the hospital knew what was happening but were not listened to when they tried to do something about it, or they did not have an opportunity to do so.</p>

 If I may, let me just make this point. The Government promised an oral statement on the two reviews that were published on 13 April, and I wish not that we had had to table this motion, but that the Government had made an oral statement and accepted that the reviews did not answer the questions before us, and that the Secretary of State had come to the House and said that he was going to institute a public inquiry on the terms we seek. I am sorry that we have had to move the motion, but it now seems to be necessary.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend accept that people in Staffordshire who have been personally affected by the matter ask for an inquiry, which needs to be independent, not to apportion blame, but to ensure that something like this can never happen again&#151;not just in Staffordshire hospitals but in other hospitals? Rightly or wrongly, they believe that if the inquiry is not independent, it will be a whitewash.</p>

 I understand exactly what my hon. Friend says, and he knows the matter very well through his constituency and his constituents who visit Staffordshire general hospital and those who, no doubt, work there. His point is right, because Peter Carter, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, visited Staffordshire general a few weeks ago and met nurses from throughout the hospital. He told me that the RCN itself now wants a public inquiry. Although it represents the largest group of staff employed at the hospital, it does not consider a public inquiry being for one minute a distraction or diversion from the delivery of the best quality of care in that hospital. From its point of view, finding out not only what happened but why, and learning those lessons for the future at Staffordshire general and in the wider NHS community, is absolutely vital. The RCN was quite right to make that point.</p>

 My hon. Friend knows, because I have told him, that my mother died at Staffordshire general hospital just over 15 years ago. She received fantastic treatment and care at the hospital, and, importantly, many people who have worked there for a very long time and dedicated their lives to giving public service to the health service are, whether we like it or not, blighted by that period. For their sake as well as the sakes of the people who rightly feel most aggrieved, a public inquiry must take place.</p>

However, they, like anyone, know that the performance and failings of organisations are often systemic rather than personal. We therefore want not only to identify personal responsibility on the part of senior executives, a point to which I shall return, but to understand the systemic problems that meant that good staff, trying to do their best, found that they were unable to do so, because of either staffing and financial decisions, or a lack of performance management and scrutiny by other organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="90518-0014.htm_para4"><a name="09051826000517">My right hon. Friend makes an important point. One clear example of what the published reviews lack is that Dr. Colin-Thom&#233;, in his report, addressed three recommendations to the Department of Health, as though the Department has serious responsibilities to ensure that the system must change, but no part of it to whether the Department, in the past, took its responsibilities seriously and discharged them. It is as if the Department did not exist before now&#151;that, somehow, it is the solution for the future but did nothing in the past. The Department, however, did a great deal in the past that may have contributed directly to the matter.</p>

 I shall of course give way in a second, but let me clarify what I mean. For example, it is abundantly clear that strategic health authorities and primary care trusts, whatever their failings, were significantly damaged by NHS reorganisations and the utter chaos that flowed from them. The Department and the previous Secretary of State were directly responsible for sending the foundation trust&#146;s application to Monitor, but, in Dr. Colin-Thom&#233;&#146;s report, there was no evidence of the scrutiny that should have been applied, or any reason why it was not. The appointment to SHAs and PCTs of senior staff, and their performance, is a responsibility of the Department, but that was not discharged. Indeed, I shall come on to the central issue of targets and the responsibility of the Department.</p>

 My hon. Friend quite rightly refers to the past and its connection with the present. He will also be aware that the current NHS chief executive is David Nicholson, who, at the critical time, was chief executive of Shropshire and Staffordshire strategic health authority and West Midlands South strategic health authority, and that there is a direct connection between those two matters.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who understands these matters extremely well. He is right about that, but let me anticipate what I was in any case going to say. Dr. Colin-Thom&#233; points out how the SHA and the PCT failed to meet their responsibilities, saying that the</p>

adversely, were exactly the same in 2008. Up until the trust became a foundation trust, the SHAs were responsible for the scrutiny of its performance, and they, in particular, clearly failed to address themselves to the quality of care that the trust provided&#151;to the point at which, in March 2008, when the SHA board received the University of Birmingham&#146;s report on data, it said that</p>
<a name="90518-0014.htm_brev3"><a name="09051826000529"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there appeared to be nothing to indicate that anything out of the ordinary was taking place on mortality.&#148;</p>

Notwithstanding the fact that Dr. Colin-Thom&#233; makes it clear that there was such a failure, there is no indication in his review of who was responsible. On the issue of who was responsible, we are talking about David Nicholson, for about a year, who is now chief executive of the NHS, and Cynthia Bowers, subsequently, who is now chief executive of the Care Quality Commission. Standing at the Dispatch Box, I do not know whether I can say that they were directly&#151;personally&#151;responsible for those failings in a way that should be substantively criticised; I do know, however, that the motion is not about criticising any individual, but about establishing a public inquiry. However, I do not want anyone to think that, by calling for an inquiry, we have neglected the fact that the proper purpose of such a public inquiry is to find out whether two of the most senior people in the NHS, with responsibility for its services, have shown that they are credible or capable of such responsibility.</p>

I want to illustrate further why I feel that the reviews thus far have not answered the questions that must be answered. In his report, Dr. Colin-Thom&#233; says:</p>
<a name="90518-0014.htm_brev4"><a name="09051827000023"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I feel very strongly that a lack of good patient engagement is the key to why Mid Staffordshire hospital trust continued to provide poor care for a protracted period of time.&#148;</p>

Is there any analysis of how the Government, through the abolition of community health councils and the emasculation of patients&#146; forums, led to a reduction of patient engagement in a way that was a tragic failure? Is there any examination of how foundation trusts are engaging or failing to engage with the public?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="90518-0014.htm_para9"><a name="09051827000004">The many of us who represent foundation trusts believed that they should be a mechanism for engaging the public, as members of the trusts, more effectively. Clearly, that mechanism failed in this case, but Dr. Colin-Thom&#233; gives us no sense of that. Frankly, all we have from him is what seems to be no more than a bland expression of hope that local involvement networks, or LINks, which were set up by the Department under recent legislation, will somehow be better at all this&#151;without independent powers to investigate, follow up complaints or act as an advocate. In his report Dr. Colin-Thom&#233; seems to think that LINks will be useful, but he did not meet LINks representatives in Stafford, so it is all pure pie in the sky.</p>

 Will my hon. Friend make it clear that the investigation would be of considerable importance to the whole country?

The services that patients would receive at Papworth hospital would be among the finest anywhere in the world, as it is in my constituency.

 Does the hon. Gentleman share my concern at the apparent drift towards more secrecy for board meetings at foundation trusts? More and more foundation trusts are routinely excluding the public and hospital governors. That is a trend in the wrong direction; there should be more openness and more accountability.</p>

 I do share that concern. In that context, I should like to make another important point on which a public inquiry would further add to our knowledge. Just before the Healthcare Commission report was published, Martin Yeates, then chief executive of Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, &#147;stepped down&#148;&#151;that, apparently is a term of art. After the commission&#146;s report was published, the board took the view that he should be suspended. It instituted an investigation by Peter Garland, a senior former NHS chief executive. Apparently, Mr. Garland has reported to the trust board and told its members the extent to which he believes Mr. Yeates met or did not meet his duties to the board and the trust. That report, however, has not been published and, as I understand it, the trust board does not intend to publish it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="90518-0014.htm_para10"><a name="09051827000009">Yet on Friday afternoon&#151;we all know what happens to Friday afternoon press releases&#151;the board announced that Mr. Martin Yeates had tendered his resignation, which the board had accepted. As a consequence, Mr. Yeates will receive his notice period; in addition to his two months&#146; pay on gardening leave, he will get six months&#146; pay. He has effectively been put beyond the scope of disciplinary action, unless a breach of duty can be demonstrated. Clearly, that will not happen unless all the evidence is brought out in a public inquiry. I am not accusing Mr. Yeates of anything, but we are not being given access to any of the information on which a judgment can be based.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="90518-0014.htm_para11"><a name="09051827000010">I turn to another important point, to which Dr. Colin-Thom&#233; referred. It is about complaints.

will somehow make things better. There is no evidence to suggest that. On the contrary, there is the idea that the new Care Quality Commission will not have a responsibility in the scrutiny of second-stage complaints; that will disappear off to the ombudsman. That undermines further, as compared with the past, the ability of Care Quality Commission performance assessment to be combined with intimate knowledge of what is happening inside a trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="90518-0014.htm_para12"><a name="09051827000011">Frankly, there are already questions about the extent to which the Healthcare Commission acted; second-stage complaints should have been getting to it, but they were not. Where were the complaints going? That is the interesting question. The Healthcare Commission report says that some of them were going to strategic health authorities, others to the National Patient Safety Agency and some to the Healthcare Commission itself&#151;there was no rhyme or reason about it. The system in relation to the complaints is dysfunctional, and the Healthcare Commission, which most needed to know&#151;its statutory responsibility is to investigate when patients&#146; quality of care is being compromised&#151;did not know. If it did, we need to understand to what extent it was acting on the complaints.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="90518-0014.htm_para13"><a name="09051827000012">Individual complaints were investigated by the commission; one has come to me. The commission concluded that there had been gross professional negligence and demanded that Staffordshire hospital prepare an action plan in response within five weeks. That happened in October 2008, but did the commission get such a response? Not at all&#151;there was no response. Even as recently as the early part of this year, Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust was failing to respond to serious conclusions drawn by the Healthcare Commission. That is another reason why it seems to us that the Healthcare Commission was not by any means the last word.</p>

We have been talking endlessly about the importance of focusing on outcomes rather than targets. What have Ministers been doing? They have been talking about the desirability of using targets as the be-all and end-all. Even now, as the new Health Bill is discussed in another place, there is a view that emergency services are measured sufficiently by simple reference to whether the four-hour A and E target is adhered to or not. That ignores the enormous spike when people are discharged from accident and emergency departments after three hours and 59 minutes. Furthermore, the Healthcare Commission report makes it clear that patients were being discharged elsewhere rather than getting the treatment that they needed at the time they needed it in the emergency department.</p>

Sir George Alberti has written, to explain that. Dr. Colin-Thom&#233; simply says that it happened&#151;he does not know why. As I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) will agree, the starting point in finding out what really happened, and why, is to ensure that people at the trust&#151;some of whom, until very recently, felt too intimidated to speak out&#151;feel that they have the protection of giving evidence to a public inquiry under oath, with all the statutory powers that go with that. We have proposals for improving whistleblowing. The Government should have the humility to recognise that nobody contacted Public Concern at Work and nothing was done to bring forward into the public domain the concerns that were clearly held by staff at the trust.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises concerns about a bullying culture. There is also the issue of the duty, or responsibility, of the clinicians themselves. It appears that some clinicians ultimately failed to meet that duty by reporting the serious concerns that they must have had. Does not that also need to be addressed, because someone needs to be held to account in terms of clinical behaviour?</p>

 Yes, it does. It may be excessive to expect that even a public inquiry would be able to identify, in all cases, where and to what extent that had happened. However, if a review of case notes gives rise to serious concerns about a significant number of cases, at least a public inquiry would provide a mechanism for those to be considered in the round in terms of what that tells us about the clinical governance that was being undertaken and how it may need to be reformed in future.</p>

For several years, the Government have had the National Patient Safety Agency. One of its principal tasks involves the national reporting and learning system, which should in itself give rise to alerts about the compromise of patient care and errors and inefficiencies. I have failed to see any evidence anywhere in the reviews that the National Patient Safety Agency exists, let alone that it has done anything. If a public inquiry were to look into failings of policy, and needs for the future, that would clearly be one of them.</p>

The reports thus far have not given the public in Staffordshire a voice, and they have not provided a public opportunity, with protection, for evidence to be taken. The reports were not independent, and they have failed to investigate the direct role of the Department of Health and its policies. Until recently, both the authors were civil servants in the Department of Health: they are not independent, and we should not see them as such. Neither report contained critical scrutiny of the impact of targets. There was no critical examination of the role of the chief executives of the strategic health authorities over the period in question.

Safety Agency. There was no discussion of how the complaints processes have worked or how patient engagement has worked, and no substantive proposals about how they can be reformed in future, as they clearly must be. Instead of robust criticism, all we have is a bureaucratic process. Dr. Colin-Thom&#233;&#146;s report, in particular, suggests that the things that the Government were already planning to do, such as practice-based commissioning, world-class commissioning and LINks, will somehow solve everything. There is no evidence that that will happen&#151;far from it. Indeed, some initiatives, such as practice-based commissioning and LINks, are stalling rather than making the progress that they should.</p>

I again pay tribute to Julie Bailey and all her colleagues at the Cure the NHS campaign, who persisted when the situation was very difficult and it took courage to do so in the face of a bureaucracy that was determined that they would not expose what was happening at Stafford hospital. They want an inquiry now, and say that only when we know why and how this happened will the commitment to say &#147;Never again&#148; truly be credible. Ministers have been to see them and have promised to think again, but I do not see the evidence that they have done so. It is therefore incumbent on Parliament to require them to think again, and I commend the motion to the House.</p>

Professor Alberti looked into the hospital&#146;s current procedures for emergency admissions and treatment, its progress against the recommendations in the Healthcare Commission&#146;s report, while Dr. Colin-Thom&#233; looked into the circumstances surrounding the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust prior to the Healthcare Commission&#146;s investigation to learn lessons about how the primary care trust and strategic health authority, within the commissioning and performance management systems that they operated, had failed to expose what was happening at the hospital.

Secondly, in the past, patients&#146; views were not taken seriously enough and were too easily dismissed. Thirdly, there was a lamentable failure of clinical leadership in the trust and the wider health community. Fourthly, the commissioners of local health services were not sufficiently aware of the poor-quality care in the hospital or active in addressing it. Fifthly, all parts of the system should have worked together better in the interests of patients.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman, again from a sedentary position, says, &#147;Rubbish.&#148; The Healthcare Commission&#151;the independent regulator&#151;made that decision because of the danger that if, for example, those working in a psychiatric hospital were asked whether they would like to be treated in their hospital, a lot would obviously say no. We have agreed with the Care Quality Commission to reintroduce the question asking staff how they rate the quality of care in their hospitals, albeit avoiding the problematic wording of the question contained in the earlier survey.</p>

<p><a name="st_o329"><a name="09051828000036"><a name="90518-0015.htm_spnew21"><a name="09051828000079"><b>Mr. Lansley:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman said the decision was taken by the independent health regulator, but will he confirm that the decision to drop the question&#151;not the decision to reform it&#151;was made in direct consultation with his Department?</p>

<p><a name="st_o330"><a name="09051828000037"><a name="90518-0015.htm_spnew22"><a name="09051828000080"><b>Mr. Bradshaw:</b>
 No, the survey belongs to the independent regulator. The regulator consulted the Department and, for the reasons that I have explained to the hon. Gentleman, we accepted its concern that the wording could distort the responses of those working in psychiatric hospitals, in mental health and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="90518-0015.htm_para16"><a name="09051828000038">The hon. Gentleman also talked about whistleblowing. Although the board at Mid Staffordshire did not listen to the concerns of patients or staff, we share his surprise that more professionals in the trust did not put their concerns on the record. The NHS exists to meet the needs of patients. Individual members of staff have a right&#151;indeed, a duty&#151;to raise any concerns that they may have about the quality of patient care with their employer. It is important to remind all staff who work in the NHS and their managers that whistleblowers have full protection under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. Furthermore, the new NHS constitution includes an explicit right for staff who report wrongdoing to be protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="90518-0015.htm_para17"><a name="09051828000039">Let me deal with the central issue of the Opposition motion, which is the call for a public inquiry. Public inquiries can be an important mechanism to establish independently the cause of a problem or disaster. I can understand that there are many who consider that a public inquiry into the events at Mid Staffordshire is both appropriate and necessary. A number of people have recalled the Bristol heart babies inquiry. In our view the critical difference is that that inquiry was initiated when, under the previous Conservative Government, there was no independent watchdog or regulator for the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="90518-0015.htm_para18"><a name="09051828000040">The whole point of establishing the Commission for Health Improvement in 2000 and the subsequent regulators since was to provide the public with the confidence that any concerns that they might have about NHS care in their areas would be properly and independently investigated. I have not heard any criticism of the Healthcare Commission&#146;s investigation or any suggestions that it did not get to the bottom of what went wrong at Stafford hospital. Given that, as well as the two subsequent inquiries and the action flowing from them, the Government remain unconvinced at this time that a public inquiry would add anything to our understanding of what went wrong or of what needs to be done to prevent such terrible events from happening again.</p>

 I understand that concern, and all hon.

The local leadership absolutely has to take responsibility for what happened, but the Government&#146;s strategy appears to be to apologise on its behalf and to move on. That will not do. It is right that those in a position of leadership at the hospital should be held to account, but that strategy fails to recognise that wider lessons need to be learned from this awful horror. The former chairman of the Healthcare Commission described the events as the worst care ever witnessed in the NHS. That in itself is a pretty compelling reason for a public inquiry in this case. Those wider lessons seem to have been brushed aside by the Government, reflecting their stubborn resistance to recognising that, for example, the four-hour target played any part in what happened.</p>

The Minister said that he was concerned because the board had allowed Mr. Yeates to resign without going through a disciplinary process. I am pleased that the Minister said he expected the report into these events to be published. He said that the Government would need to see it first, but it should be placed in the public domain irrespective of what it says.

 I think so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="90518-0016.htm_para11"><a name="09051831000014">In regard to the resignation, it is now too late to institute disciplinary proceedings. We have been presented with a fait accompli, and the former chief executive is now being paid to be on gardening leave for the rest of his notice period. The NHS is paying for that, despite the fact that there appears to be good evidence to justify a disciplinary inquiry. I also agree with the hon. Gentleman that the report should have gone to the Secretary of State, given that it was commissioned by him.</p>

<p><a name="st_o348"><a name="09051831000015"><a name="90518-0016.htm_spnew16"><a name="09051831000060"><b>Mr. Lansley:</b>
 I hesitate to intervene on the hon. Gentleman again, because he is an employment lawyer by profession. Mr. Yeates might not necessarily be beyond disciplinary action, but would there not need to be substantive evidence of a breach of his fiduciary duties to the board in order for such penalties to be contemplated? A public inquiry might be a principal mechanism by which such evidence could be gathered.</p>

 It might be helpful to both hon. Members if I clarify who commissioned the report. As a foundation trust was involved, the report was of course commissioned by the trust itself, but that decision came out of the overall response to the Healthcare Commission inquiry by the Secretary of State, in conjunction with Monitor. So in legal terms, it is absolutely right that the report should go back to the trust, but that does not take away from the points that I made earlier about what needs to happen now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="90518-0016.htm_para12"><a name="09051831000019">The second reason there should be a public inquiry is the role of the clinicians in the hospital. Many people have expressed their concern that, despite the awful things going on there&#151;the dreadful care to which the former chair of the Healthcare Commission referred&#151;it appears that no clinician saw fit to report their concerns to senior management or elsewhere, with the possible exception of one nurse, about whom we heard last weekend. It could be argued that they felt prevented from doing so by the bullying culture in the organisation. However, they have a professional clinical duty to their patients, and, irrespective of the extent to which the unit was understaffed, if they saw that there was inadequate care, it was their duty to report their concerns and to get something done about it. That did not happen, and that in itself is a scandal that should be investigated by way of a public inquiry. It is not being looked at in any other way. None of the reports that the Secretary of State has commissioned has looked at that issue. As things stand, those clinicians who participated in the care that has been so heavily criticised are presumably continuing to work in the NHS. Should we not be concerned about that? That issue is not being addressed, and it ought to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="90518-0016.htm_para16"><a name="09051831000025">The third reason why there should be a public inquiry is to secure justice for the families that have been so horrendously affected by this awful scandal. So many of them have refused to be fobbed off, but the fundamental question remains about how justice will be secured for families of the victims of this dreadful care. That is another issue that is not being properly addressed in any systematic way other than by this review of patient notes&#151;a review that looks at each case individually, which is not sufficient if we want to see the whole picture and understand how this happened. We need to give those families a real sense that their concerns are being properly addressed.</p>

Surely, however, we need to address the fact that there is potential for coroners to obstruct inquiries, so we need clear rules and clear guidelines about coroners&#146; responsibilities to co-operate fully in such circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="90518-0016.htm_para18"><a name="09051831000027">When the Minister referred to legislation going through Parliament, I assume he meant the Coroners and Justice Bill. He said that there were measures in it to address some of these concerns, but will he clarify whether any thought is being given to the possibility of tabling an amendment to place a specific statutory duty on coroners to co-operate in inquiries of this sort? I would be happy to allow him to intervene&#151;now or later&#151;to confirm that it will be possible to amend this draft legislation.</p>

departments, and this is a credit to the Government, is that the four-hour target has transformed how A and E and hospitals operate. I accept that it has been transformational: we all know it was unacceptable for people to be left waiting in corridors on trolleys for 10 or 11 hours. The Minister must recognise that there are nevertheless concerns in hospitals up and down the country about how the target is enforced, particularly when it becomes a straitjacket. If the Minister talks to clinicians, as I know he has done, I am sure he will also be aware of concerns expressed about the operation of this target in many hospitals. The Royal College of Nursing has made it very clear that strict adherence to 98 per cent. compliance with the four-hour target has caused real difficulties.</p>

 Is the hon. Gentleman aware that a nearby hospital in Westminster provides an example? The system there is that when people enter a room, there is effectively no system until they eventually get to see a nurse for triage&#151;and it is fairly chaotic at times. When I asked why it was like that, I was told that if people were given a number as at a delicatessen counter in a supermarket, the four-hour clock would have to start. What happens, then, is that the patient dripping with blood fails to get to see the triage nurse; meanwhile, the patient who is relatively fit does get to see that nurse when the four-hour clock starts ticking. That is the sort of distortion that occurs.</p>

 I am grateful for that intervention, as precisely that point was made in the Healthcare Commission report:</p>
<a name="90518-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="09051832000033"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Doctors were moved from treating seriously ill patients to deal with those with more minor ailments, in order to avoid breaching the four-hour waiting time target. Patients were moved to the clinical decision unit to &#145;stop the clock&#146; but were then not properly monitored, since this area was not staffed.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para3"><a name="09051832000002">The hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant) has made that point, but the Minister seems blind to the possibility that such concerns might exist elsewhere and that patient care might have been compromised. That is a fundamental reason why a public inquiry needs to explore that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para4"><a name="09051832000003">The Healthcare Commission report also included a graph showing a spike just before the four-hour point, with large numbers of patients being discharged as the clocked ticked away towards it. Surely we need to explore whether the same pattern of discharge applies in other hospitals to see whether the same pressures might be applying elsewhere. The Government seem blind even to considering that possibility and so defensive about the four-hour target that they are not prepared even to consider whether any potentially adverse aspects apply to it. The conclusions of the Colin-Thom&#233; report appear also to contradict the Minister with regard to the role of the four-hour target and how it has been implemented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para5"><a name="09051832000004">The next reason there needs to be an independent inquiry is the implications of the scandal for the regulators. The process that this hospital went through to become a foundation trust without anyone stopping the hospital in its tracks to demand improvements before it happened beggars belief. It is extraordinary that it was signed off by the primary care trust, the strategic health authority, the Department of Health, the Secretary of State himself, as I understand it, and the Monitor board.</p>

At the critical time when all these things were happening, the right hon. Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt) was Secretary of State and 17,000 jobs were being cut out of the health service.

 That is the sort of evidence that needs to be properly and fully considered by a public inquiry.

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para7"><a name="09051832000008">A lot of work on Staffordshire hospital has been done by <i> The Sunday Telegraph</i>, which reported:</p>

Were the public ever told in all those cases that there were concerns about patient care quality? That is very much not the message that the Government gave when foundation trusts came into being. That status was supposed to be a symbol of absolute quality&#151;quality assurance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para10"><a name="09051832000011">We must bear it in mind that for the chief executives of hospital trusts there is a big financial incentive.

 As a Labour Member of Parliament I am committed to the NHS, and as Stafford&#146;s Member of Parliament I am committed to a hospital in Stafford, so it broke my heart to read in the Healthcare Commission&#146;s report that patients had been severely, appallingly let down by the NHS and the local hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para13"><a name="09051832000017">I support a full, independent public inquiry into every aspect of what went wrong, why, and how it can be put right for the future. I shall vote for an inquiry tonight. Yes, an inquiry will take some time to complete its investigations and deliberations and produce a report, and, yes, it can be distracting for people who have a job to do at the hospital while the investigations are ongoing. However, the work has to be done. One thing we can usefully do is talk about the form and terms of reference of the inquiry. If the Government will not give way on this today, one way in which we can continue the pressure is to start to get ready for an inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para14"><a name="09051832000018">I wish to say a word about my hospital&#151;if I may call it that&#151;and what my public and my patients want today. An inquiry will take some time, but there are things that need urgent attention at Stafford hospital, and I do not want us to lose sight of that urgency because we are also talking about a public inquiry. For example, the Healthcare Commission&#146;s report told us about the severe understaffing on wards and the urgent need for more staff. It told us about missing medical equipment and the urgent need for it to be provided. Six weeks later, Professor Alberti produced his report and said that there were staffing shortages and that more staff urgently needed to be appointed. He said that there was an urgent need to provide some medical equipment that was still missing. Six weeks on, the urgency had not been accepted and implemented. We must not overlook the fact that those things are still urgent today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para15"><a name="09051832000019">I remind the House that the Healthcare Commission produced damning evidence about three aspects of the hospital: accident and emergency, emergency care and some nursing care. However, in the same report it mentioned positive things about the hospital. There were no concerns about elective care, and during the three-year period investigated there was a decline in the number of complaints about out-patient care. There was praise for the acute coronary care unit and the critical care unit. It is important to retain a sense of balance. People going into that hospital had good experiences in some parts of it at some times, just as others had bad, sometimes appallingly bad or fatal experiences. I ask the House to bear that in mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para16"><a name="09051832000020">When Professor Alberti went in after the Healthcare Commission, he was able to talk about improvements in A and E and say that there had been some improvements in emergency care, although not enough. He mapped the way to continuing that improvement. He said that even when he was there, there were still instances of poor nursing care that needed addressing. He made a warts-and-all assessment, which showed that we still need urgent attention given to some things. It is very important to remember that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para17"><a name="09051832000021">Imagine the effects of working at that hospital today, given all the bad publicity that has appeared nationally, and the likelihood that people will complain about anything for fear it will not be spotted if a complaint is not made about it. Imagine every story that someone chooses to publicise becoming a headline in the local newspaper. Morale is very low at the hospital. There are fears that even now, as it recruits extra staff, some people will not want to work there because they have seen the publicity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para18"><a name="09051832000022">Into that worrying situation I stepped, with four simple proposals. I wrote to my constituents asking whether they agreed with them. I proposed that those responsible for the management of the hospital on whose failings the Healthcare Commission reported should be replaced, that staffing levels should be corrected and retained, that there should be stronger powers for patients and the public, and that there should be an independent inquiry. So far more than 3,500 constituents have responded, and more than 90 per cent. of them agree with my proposals. I emphasise to the Minister that 3,500 people in the Stafford constituency think that there should be an independent inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para19"><a name="09051832000023">Let me say something about the rebuilding of the trust board. We heard that the chair had resigned just before the publication of the Healthcare Commission&#146;s report. I shall not elaborate on what was said by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) about the treatment of the chief executive. Let me merely say how angry local people are about the fact that &#147;step down&#148; did not mean &#147;resign&#148; at the outset, the fact that he received pay while suspended, and the fact that he is now apparently being allowed to resign with no consequences while still receiving that pay. People are very, very angry about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para20"><a name="09051832000024">We are recruiting a new chair, a new chief executive and new non-executive directors, and there will be a new board. At present, however, the trust faces the greatest challenges. An interim chair with another job in Sheffield and an interim executive with another job in Chesterfield are managing and leading the hospital. It is still a worrying time, and I ask for Members&#146; support for the management and staff of the hospital as they try to do all the things that need to be done in the present circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para21"><a name="09051832000025">It is true that the board needs to move from a closed to an open culture, but it has reverted to holding its meetings in public, and at the first of those meetings it reaffirmed its policy on whistleblowing. I showed the whisteblowing policy to Public Concern at Work, which made constructive suggestions for its improvement. The trust has agreed to write to every employee about the policy in this month&#146;s pay packet, confirming that people are free to make their concerns known if they have them. Those are all valuable developments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para22"><a name="09051832000026">It should also be remembered that the board is yet still to present its action plan in response to the report.

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para23"><a name="09051832000027">I should like to say much more about staffing levels, but we are short of time. Although there is no agreed level for wards in this country&#151;or internationally&#151;the Royal College of Nursing has valuable policy guidance, which reminds us that a number of factors must be taken into account. In my view, the dependency levels of patients are an especially important factor; but so, of course, are nursing experience, a skills mix, a settled staff, minimum sickness and absenteeism and less reliance on agency cover, and all those factors affected hospital staff during the time we are discussing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para24"><a name="09051832000028">I agree that the handling of complaints was atrocious, and that we must adopt an &#147;open and learning&#148; culture. That will require constant dialogue between patients, their relatives, the public, and those who work at the hospital. It should not be a big thing to say that something is wrong at the hospital: people should be able to accept that and act on it. I have told Ministers before today that the LINk in Staffordshire is particularly poorly developed. We need to be helped to make it the best of its kind, not one of the weaker of its kind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para25"><a name="09051832000029">Let me now deal with the arguments for an inquiry. We do need an inquiry. The trust pulled the wool over the eyes of the Healthcare Commission for three years. In each of those three years, the commission produced improving assessments of a trust that it later said was so bad. Is the problem self-assessment? Does it constitute a failing of the commission itself that it received more complaints about this trust, in relation to its size, than about any other, and that it produced action plans in response to stage 2 complaints but did not pursue them to establish whether they were implemented? The chairman of that body said there was no need for a public inquiry, but one of the things such an inquiry would look into is the performance of his organisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para26"><a name="09051832000030">There should be an investigation. The trust pulled the wool over the eyes of Monitor, as we have heard. The big black hole was about clinical care, where Ministers now accept there was a lacuna, but that has now been put right. Even in terms of Monitor&#146;s expert area of governance, management and leadership, the Healthcare Commission report tears the trust apart for secrecy, for as little as possible being reported to the board, and for as little as possible of the board&#146;s conduct being made public. Those issues should be investigated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para27"><a name="09051832000031">For me, the biggest issue is the independence of the case reviews for the relatives of deceased patients, because the trust has organised those reviews&#151;albeit while bringing in outside clinicians who are independent of it. How can people feel trust in that system? Such reviews should be anchored in a public inquiry; and if there is a role to be considered for the coroner, that needs to be looked into as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para28"><a name="09051832000032">All I want to say in conclusion is that 3,500 of my constituents have said there should be an inquiry, and the local councils&#151;Stafford borough and Cannock Chase district&#151;have resolved that there should an inquiry as well. The Patients Association has a national petition that people are signing, and the RCN supports this, and P.A.C.E. 2000, an organisation of elderly people in my constituency, also thinks there should be an inquiry. That is a lot of people, and the Minister should listen to them.</p>

 This is a debate about freedom of information. It is a tale of cover-ups by two closed cultures: a cover-up by the hospital and its superior organisations, and a cover-up by the Government and their subordinate public organisations. That has resulted in a pincer movement of both death and despair. My constituents and the people representing the interests of the victims and the bereaved demand justice, and they will get justice only if they have a proper inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005 because that will call for evidence on oath, and have compulsion of witnesses and proper legal protection for whistleblowers, which is not available under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 as it is bypassed. I am saying not that the 1998 Act is bad in itself, but that it does not operate when certain people get to work on it. There are also good people at the hospital who need to be exonerated, and a public inquiry would provide for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90518-0017.htm_para29"><a name="09051839000002">There is now to be a Select Committee inquiry. That will give us the opportunity to present measured evidence, which we cannot do in 10 minutes tonight. I also ask my party&#146;s shadow Secretary of State to assure us that we would be able to have a public inquiry if and when we get into government next year, because that would be a good opportunity. I strongly suggest that the credibility of the Government is at stake&#151;and I must say that I dismiss with contempt the Minister&#146;s recent trivial speech. Already, two governors have called for a public inquiry of the kind that is required and, as the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) has said, Stafford borough council was unanimous in its demand for one.</p>

I shall tell both him and the House why: when I did anonymise it, in a letter to the Secretary of State relating to a hospital nearby, the next thing I knew, after a considerable pause, was that the consultant in question had been suspended. Only last week, he was summoned for a Kafkaesque trial as if he needed to have a psychiatric assessment. I can tell the House that that consultant and the patient in question are constituents of mine and that consultant had saved the child&#146;s life. I am so furious that I cannot speak about it.

I must be careful, because I do not want to expose others to the kind of treatment that the consultant to whom I have referred has received. He was suspended with after such a short a notice period on the issue of antibiotic policy and the non-availability of nurses on consultant ward rounds. This is a national disgrace and the legislation does not protect such people properly. The reality is that the allegations that I am making need to be properly examined by the Select Committee, when we have more time to do the job.</p>

up with a different version about the value of public inquiries. That was the point I was making. Ian Kennedy had said:</p>
<a name="90518-0018.htm_brev7"><a name="09051839000081"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A Public Inquiry cannot turn back the clock. It can, however, offer an opportunity to let all those touched by the events, in our case Bristol, be heard and to listen to others.&#148;</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that Ian Kennedy&#151;understandably, in the case of Stafford&#151;was defending the Healthcare Commission, not least because when the Healthcare Commission undertook an investigation it would like not to feel that a precedent had been set that meant that it could be second guessed by a call for a public inquiry? Does my hon. Friend accept that I do not see this necessarily as setting a precedent? We did not ask for an inquiry after Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells, nor would we set out to do so in other cases. The evidence in this case seems to point to such a wide range of unresolved issues that it demands that we go down that path.</p>

 I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend, and so does the Royal College of Nursing, which said that the focus on achieving financial targets at Mid Staffordshire was at the expense of appropriate and safe staffing levels and talked about cuts in the number of nurses.</p>

Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt) and also under that of the present Secretary of State. They are all about targets, finance and matters of that kind. Also involved is Mr. Bill Moyes. There is a conflict of interest for the university of Birmingham, which was commissioned by the West Midlands strategic health authority, and a conflict of interest for Mrs. Cynthia Bower, who is now chief executive of the Care Quality Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="90518-0018.htm_para14"><a name="09051839000022">The problem that troubles me is the continual conflicts of interest.

The people who were on the study that led to the analysis of the mortality rates in Mid Staffordshire included the medical director of the SHA and people from the trusts, including the information manager of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. That is a blatant example of conflict of interest.</p>

 It might not be entirely evident from the previous contribution, but we Staffordshire MPs are a rather happy and consensual bunch. We meet regularly on a cross-party basis, and that is certainly unusual&#151;it might even be unique in the House. We have been doing so for many years. When we met just last week, we obviously discussed this topic, and we came up with what we thought was a positive idea, which was that we should get all the various people involved in the case&#151;the hospital trust, the primary care trust, the strategic health authority and the regulator&#151;into a room to ensure that they were making things better. The emphasis today&#151;quite rightly, as it is the focus of the motion&#151;has been on settling the issues with the past. The other, and in some ways more pressing, side of the argument is the need to settle the issues with the future.</p>

We know that in some respects, at least, they are still being repeated. In some respects, however, they are not: as far as we can tell, the particular acute problems in the accident and emergency department have been resolved by increased staffing, better organisation and so on. However, the Alberti report tells us that there are still problems on the medical wards. The kind of problems that people come to my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) or to me with are basic care issues on the wards. Indeed, this weekend I was dealing with a problem, relating to exactly those issues, that is happening now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="90518-0018.htm_para18"><a name="09051839000027">Alberti tells us that there is still a real staffing issue on those wards. The implication is that the care is not good enough. It is to that that we must urgently turn our attention. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford said, Alberti also tells us that there are issues with staff not wanting to work in the hospital. &#147;Who wants to work in Stafford hospital?&#148;&#151;so it goes inside the system. The hospital is desperately trying to get agency nurses in, because it cannot recruit normally. Real reputational damage has been done to the hospital, and there has been a real loss of public confidence locally. Those are all matters that need to be attended to.</p>

It is difficult to say that we do not know what to do, because we do know what to do to remedy the problems identified. I agree that there are outstanding issues; in a sense, there always will be.

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="90518-0018.htm_para20"><a name="09051839000029">For me, the devastating part of the reports&#151;devastating because it confirms the impression that I formed of the hospital from cases I had dealt with&#151;was that there was a complete inattention to patients. There was a preoccupation with process. All the reports that have been produced say that. They all identify that as the key issue. That raises many questions about how on earth a hospital could have taken its eye off the ball so comprehensively as far as patients were concerned. How could it not have understood that the quality of patient care is central to all that it does? The reports talk about the problem of culture inside the institution. &#147;Problem of culture&#148; means not understanding that patient care is central. It means not having set a standard of patient care, around which everything is organised. I am afraid that what the reports tell us about the failure to use complaints intelligently is simply part of that. I speak as someone who has taken a perverse, obsessive interest in complaints over many years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="90518-0018.htm_para21"><a name="09051839000030">We all know, if we are honest, that we never got the system of complaints inside the health service right. I remember sitting on inquiries into complaints in the health service under the previous Government, when it was widely recognised that we had a problem. There have been endless inquiries since then into how we can improve complaints systems. We have set up different systems and tried them out; they have failed, and we have tried new ones.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="90518-0018.htm_para22"><a name="09051839000031">I remember listening a few years ago to the permanent secretary of the Department of Health, I think it was, describing how he wanted every patient who came into an NHS hospital to be given what he called a &#147;three Cs&#148; form. The three Cs were comment, complaint and congratulation. I thought that that was sensible, but when I asked him whether the forms would be universally available in every hospital, he said no; they would simply be available if people wanted to use them. I think we ought systematically to make sure that every in-patient in every hospital in the country is asked for their comments, complaints and congratulations. Having done that, however, we must ensure that in every institution we learn in a systematic and serious way. It is no good simply getting people to tell us things if we do not learn from what they have told us and act on it. There is no reason at all not to do so. Lord Darzi&#146;s intervention is extremely valuable in reminding us of something of which we should not need to be reminded: that the quality of patient experience is absolutely central to what the health service ought to be about.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way in the interests of comity in Staffordshire. Does he agree that there is a serious problem with targets and money?

day on which the Healthcare Commission report was published, its chairman, Sir Ian Kennedy, to whom reference has been made, went on the radio to say that the NHS was steadily improving. I believe that that is the case, and I speak as someone who uses the NHS heavily. Indeed, I was in hospital this morning being attended to. My experience over the past 10 years is that it is steadily improving. However, there is no question of its improving over the years in Stafford, because the trust did not understand the centrality of patient care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="90518-0018.htm_para23"><a name="09051839000034">I want to spend the last couple of minutes on the inquiry. I am not going to vote against the motion, but I am not going to vote for it, either. There is a real problem with capturing the advantages of a further inquiry, given some pretty demonstrable disadvantages. The advantages are clear: there are questions still to be answered, and there are certainly people on the ground who have been personally affected and whose questions remain unresolved. However, we must not think that a further inquiry does not involve costs. If we are to achieve a relentless focus on improvement, I am not sure that that will be aided by a relentless focus on the past. I want assurances that we can have a further inquiry to tell us things we do not know, but without it carrying the great disadvantage of our taking our eye off the ball and failing to do the things locally that we have to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="90518-0018.htm_para24"><a name="09051839000035">Five years ago, the Committee that I have the privilege of chairing produced a big report on the whole question of inquiries. The Inquiries Act 2005 was being introduced, and the Government gave evidence to us. We had asked them in what circumstances they would hold an inquiry, and they said:</p>
<a name="90518-0018.htm_brev10"><a name="09051839000084"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There is no standard blueprint for the type of circumstances in which an inquiry might be needed. Matters triggering inquiries are by their nature difficult to foresee.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="90518-0018.htm_para25"><a name="09051839000036">They added:</p>
<a name="90518-0018.htm_brev11"><a name="09051839000085"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A common theme tends to be that the subject matter of the inquiry has exposed some possible failing in systems or services, and so has shaken public confidence in these systems or services either locally or nationally&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="90518-0018.htm_para26"><a name="09051839000037">On those grounds, there is no question but that Stafford fits: it has shaken public confidence, and the problem is of sufficient severity. We tried to do a little better&#151;I do not have much time, so I shall abbreviate my remarks&#151;by producing a checklist of questions that were sensible to ask when the issue of an inquiry arose. As MPs, we ask for inquiries like children ask for sweets&#151;it is what we do&#151;so there is a discipline in having to ask such questions. I do not have time to recite them all.</p>

 Given the point that the hon. Gentleman made about diversion, does he not accept that nurses working at Staffordshire general hospital, as reported to me by the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, wanted a public inquiry?</p>

 Indeed, and I want an inquiry that tells us some of the things we do not know, but if we are being fair, those people urging a further inquiry have also to be fair and recognise that there are potential risks and dangers in having one. We all want to settle accounts with the past, but we also want to make sure that urgent improvements are made now.</p>

 The hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright), whom it is my privilege to follow, spoke about the criteria that the Government believe in for a public inquiry. One of the criteria he mentioned was that of systemic failure. The problem that faces us in Staffordshire is one of systemic failure, but it is systemic failure that exists in other hospitals too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90518-0018.htm_para30"><a name="09051839000044">Before I go any further, I echo the opening words of my friend the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="90518-0018.htm_para31"><a name="09051839000045">I said that there have been systemic failures. My hon.

At a previous Health questions I said to the Secretary of State for Health that there was another example provided by two people who work in my constituency&#151;I did not give their names because they are terrified that if their names were known, they would lose their job. They work at another hospital in the west midlands and showed me photographs that show disgraceful and unhygienic conditions in that hospital, but they would not leave the evidence with me, which left me in a paralysed situation because I could not do anything without the evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="90518-0018.htm_para32"><a name="09051839000046">At the time, the Secretary of State told me that he was amazed that despite the protections that exist for whistleblowers, such huge fear still exists. Once again, the Secretary of State, who, I have no doubt, is a good man and has the best interests of the national health service at heart, said that he was &#147;amazed&#148; that whistleblowers did not speak out at Stafford hospital. As my constituents said to me, with nurses, doctors and even consultants being made redundant, would they be next? That is the issue that faces all those who work at Stafford hospital or other hospitals that may not have such acute problems but nevertheless require the shining light of publicity, or at least exposure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="90518-0019.htm_para0"><a name="09051839000047">The report came out a few months ago and spoke of systemic weaknesses that have existed over the past three or four years. However, I spent a day with a paramedic crew from the old Staffordshire ambulance service, before it became a part of the West Midlands ambulance service. The crew said to me in 2000, &#147;Mr. Fabricant, if, God forbid, anything happens to you or your dearest, don&#146;t send them to Stafford. If you have to go to A and E, go to Burton hospital, because the survival rate is far greater there.&#148; I believe that the problem has existed for many years and is not just a recent occurrence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="90518-0019.htm_para1"><a name="09051839000048">We have heard about the evidence from nurses. One nurse provided senior managers with details of her concerns in November 2007, but they were ignored. Her report talked about doctors and nurses being ordered to discharge people who were critically ill and, as we have already heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), to lie about how long others were waiting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="90518-0019.htm_para2"><a name="09051839000049">The nurse documented cases, including that of an elderly patient who died the day after being sent home against her doctor&#146;s wishes. The lady concerned, who suffered from a bowel condition, had been taken to A and E suffering from acute abdominal pain, and anyone who has been to medical school for just a year and a half, let alone longer, will know that acute abdominal pain needs to be examined very seriously. It turned out that she had a perforated bowel, but she was sent home because that was the ethos at Stafford general hospital. The nurse said:</p>
<a name="90518-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="09051839000087"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I will never forgive the moment when the patient clasped my hand and said &#145;Am I going to die?&#146; I can&#146;t say that she would definitely have been saved if she had been given the right care, but at the very least she should have been given some comfort and dignity.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="90518-0019.htm_para3"><a name="09051839000050">Despite the disadvantages that the Minister and the hon. Member for Cannock Chase have pointed out, I passionately believe that we still need a public inquiry, not to look to the past, but to provide lessons so that we can avoid the situation in the future at Stafford general hospital and stop the instances that I discussed a few moments ago which prevent whistleblowers in other hospitals making their views known. A public inquiry is important for our constituents, and I commend the hon. Member for Stafford for having the courage of his convictions and saying that he will vote tonight for an inquiry. His constituents, like mine and others in Staffordshire, all want to feel that justice will not only be done, but be seen to be done, and that there will be lessons learned and additional protections not only at Stafford general hospital but at hospitals in other parts of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="90518-0019.htm_para4"><a name="09051839000051">The Under-Secretary of State for Health needs to answer some questions, and I should be grateful if she addressed them in her winding-up speech. First, does she think it right that the former chairman of the West Midlands strategic health authority, Cynthia Bower, is now in charge of the Care Quality Commission, the actual body that is responsible for monitoring the progress of Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust? Surely that is a conflict of interest. If there is not a public inquiry, what action can the Minister take to restore faith in Stafford general hospital among the residents not only of Stafford but of other parts of Staffordshire?</p>

Still we hear that medical care on the wards is not as it should be. What progress is being made towards recruiting experienced surgeons for night shifts at the hospital? That is still a real problem for a hospital with an accident and emergency department. Finally, can the Minister give assurances that, at hospitals nationwide and not just at Stafford, patients are not simply being dumped outside accident and emergency wards so that the four-hour waiting-time targets can be hit?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="90518-0019.htm_para7"><a name="09051839000054">As I mentioned earlier in an intervention, such things happen not only at Stafford hospital, but here in Westminster&#151;I have seen it for myself.

I have changed the mind of only one MP during my whole career here&#151;but as I have done it once, I have every hope of doing it again. My presence here shows that the concerns go wider than Stafford. The hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) implied that we know why it all happened, but I do not think that we know enough.

<a name="90518-0019.htm_brev3"><a name="09051839000090"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In April 2005, the medical division identified a risk that there would be too few staff to support the service due to failing to replace staff who terminated their employment. This was recorded on the risk register, but no review date was provided. In July 2005, it was noted that future demands of the service may not be met due to insufficient levels of staff in the department. From these entries, it is evident that staffing levels were considered to be inadequate as far back as 2005.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="90518-0019.htm_para13"><a name="09051839000061">Page 47 also refers to a review by the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust that was critical of the level of nursing supervision. Page 62 describes reconfiguration of the medical wards in 2006, which led to changes in the skills mix of the nursing staff that were unacceptable to many consultants.</p>

<p><a name="st_o373"><a name="09051839000062"><a name="90518-0019.htm_spnew1"><a name="09051839000110"><b>Mr. Cash:</b>
 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the details of the Healthcare Commission report clearly demonstrate that the board was spending too much time on finance and matters of that kind? As I demonstrated from the minutes, this goes right the way back to the early decisions that were taken by the strategic health authorities, which were based on targets that are part and parcel of the national health system as a whole, as run by the current chief executive of the NHS.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I will come to exactly that point a little later, because there is a quote about it in the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="90518-0019.htm_para14"><a name="09051839000064">Another important part of the report, on page 63, concerns high levels of staff sickness and complaints to the commission that had not been taken up. On page 93, there is an absolutely vital table that summarises some of the findings about the trust&#146;s approach to levels of nursing staff. It says:</p>
<a name="90518-0019.htm_brev4"><a name="09051839000091"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In 2002, the review of clinical governance by the Commission for Health Improvement pointed out that the number of nurses was low compared with other similar hospitals.&#148;</p>

<a name="90518-0019.htm_brev5"><a name="09051839000092"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In 2005, the trust had more wards with below the national average number of nurses than wards with above the average, by almost two to one.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="90518-0019.htm_para16"><a name="09051839000066">Anybody who reads page 93 can pick up on several similar points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="90518-0019.htm_para17"><a name="09051839000067">Why did all the long-standing concerns that had been expressed never get through? We have to find out where the blockage was. Was it between the working doctors and nurses and their clinical directors or nurse managers, or between the clinical directors or nurse managers and the medical director and the director of nursing? Was it held up above that level, by the chief executive preventing it from getting to the board? There are some clues about why senior staff perhaps did not make more effort to take matters wider. Page 101 of the report says:</p>
<a name="90518-0019.htm_brev6"><a name="09051839000093"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Staff, including senior staff, had little confidence that the trust learned from incidents.&#148;</p>

We want the people who have got us into this state, not those who are trying to get us out of it, to appear before an inquiry. We know that many new young consultants have been appointed who have nothing to do with what has happened and that there are new interim executives. Surely we could separate the people responsible for what has happened from those who are interested in the future. I strongly support the plea for an independent inquiry to satisfy staff&#151;and exonerate those who had nothing to do with it&#151;relatives and patients. At the same time, it is crucial to continue to make improvements for the future.

They want to listen to other people&#146;s evidence. That is important for not only the grieving process, but the community around the hospital, who look to it to care for their family and friends, and feel let down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="90518-0019.htm_para27"><a name="09051844000014">I welcome the Minister&#146;s comments at the beginning of the debate about the steps that have been taken to improve the service. The Care Quality Commission, the PCT and Monitor will monitor the hospital after three months and six months and devise further action plans to improve its outcomes.</p>

We have moved through various different models and, to be honest, there is not a big enough voice for patient organisations, which pick up what is being said at the grass roots.

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="90518-0019.htm_para32"><a name="09051844000022">We must remember that, at its heart, we are talking about the avoidable deaths of up to 1,200 people. Each of those deaths represents family and friends who are left with the heavy burden of grief, which is only intensified by the serious questions that need answering. Furthermore, those deaths can only be correlative to many hundreds more patients who did not receive the treatment that they deserved&#151;treatment that they rightly expect of our NHS. Before going any farther, we must take a moment to remember all those who have suffered and who continue to suffer and grieve because of the failings at the Mid-Staffordshire trust. Equally, let us keep in mind the wonderful work of the individuals and teams working across the NHS who have been so badly let down by what has happened in Stafford general hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="90518-0019.htm_para33"><a name="09051844000023">We have brought a very simple motion before the House today. This is not the moment to knock the Government particularly harshly, although it is clear that there is a continuum of culpability, which extends from the local decision makers to Ministers and, more significantly, calls into question Government policies. Our motion this evening does not seek to apportion blame for the Mid-Staffordshire tragedy. Indeed, every speaker has agreed with us and with our motion, other than the Minister and the honourable exception of the Chairman of the Public Administration Committee, the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright). He said that he would not vote against the motion. He remains to be convinced whether to join us in the Lobby and might just be able to be persuaded, and I hope to try.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="90518-0019.htm_para34"><a name="09051844000024">Our motion simply calls for an independent inquiry, which the relatives of those who died and the survivors of poor care at the trust both need and deserve. The important point is not just what went wrong, but how and why it did&#151;a point forcefully made by the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor), who, with his professional point of view, has a double interest in understanding that&#151;and what must now be done to prevent it from happening again. That is a point to impress upon the hon. Member for Cannock Chase, because unless one understands the past, it is very difficult to move on and ensure that the right things are done for the future.</p>

Friend the Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) said in an intervention, when he gave personal testimony of the most wonderful care that his mother received. The problem extends way beyond the people in Staffordshire, but we heard powerful arguments from my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), whose speech not only carried the House, but was redolent of what it means to try to seek justice. He argued forcefully, using evidence that he was able to give only partially, but which would be available in a public inquiry, that the only way to secure that justice would be in a public and independent inquiry.</p>

They will only have had to listen to the excellent speech of my hon. Friend.

I emphasise that today&#146;s debate is taking place because the people of Staffordshire and beyond want an inquiry to be set up now, so our efforts need to be focused on that, not least to persuade the Government to do just that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="90518-0020.htm_para1"><a name="09051844000027">My hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant) focused on the justice of the case, and on what lessons could be learned straight away, right across the NHS. He said that it was necessary to have an inquiry in order to assuage the public&#146;s concerns from the past and to learn all the necessary lessons for the future. With local and national health officials, Ministers and Government policy implicated in the problems, it is difficult to contend that a review conducted by officials in the Department of Health will deliver the thorough, all-encompassing, plain appraisal needed to reduce the chance of this happening again.</p>

He said that the reports lacked the independence required to give them sufficient perspective on the events, to call people properly to account, or to satisfy the needs of families and survivors in Staffordshire and beyond. The reports have not given the people of Staffordshire an opportunity to make the points and to ask the questions that they feel are important. Neither Colin-Thom&#233; nor Alberti held public evidence sessions to provide an opportunity for depositions and questions to be asked by the bereaved and the survivors. As a result, the reports do not show the necessary rigour in relation to the culpability of NHS officials, the Department and the Government, either in political or executive terms. Such rigour is necessary to provide the answers for the people of Staffordshire, and to prevent such a tragedy from occurring again.</p>

forward to welcoming him into our Lobby this evening. I also welcome the opportunity for questions that he has just mentioned. However, as I have just said, the opportunity for those people to answer is limited by the scope of their reviews, which is never going to be as wide or as deep as that of an independent public inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="90518-0020.htm_para3"><a name="09051844000033">We need to ensure that we keep our discussion focused on the Ministers who have the power to make this decision, rather than on two well-respected people from civil service and departmental backgrounds. I hope that the Minister will recognise that we need to understand why lacunae exist in both reports, and tell us what role Ministers had to play in that. David Colin-Thom&#233; and Sir George Alberti are civil servants employed by the Department of Health, and have been for a number of years. They may take to heart the independence of the civil service, but I think that the House would agree that they lack independence so far as their interest as members of the Executive, through the Department, is concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="90518-0020.htm_para4"><a name="09051844000034">For example, the House will be aware that the chief executive of the Shropshire and Staffordshire strategic health authority in 2005 to 2006 is now the chief executive of the NHS, and that the subsequent chief executive of West Midlands SHA is now the chief executive of the Care Quality Commission. A necessary requirement of any review should be to lay bare the management of the SHA between 2002 and 2008, and to provide an opportunity for the reputations of these two very senior civil servants in our NHS and the Care Quality Commission to be cleared.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="90518-0020.htm_para5"><a name="09051844000035">It is clear that West Midlands SHA failed in its duty of performance management; it was more bothered about Department of Health initiatives, finance and reconfigurations and relied on performance assessment bodies to consider the quality of patient care. Cynthia Bower, now of the Care Quality Commission, only once raised mortality rates, for instance, in her routine briefings to the board. It would be helpful to have an independent public inquiry at which many other issues could be addressed and Cynthia Bower and others would have an opportunity to give their side of the story.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="90518-0020.htm_para6"><a name="09051844000036">In the Alberti and Colin-Thom&#233; reports, there is little evidence of any rigorous treatment of the impact of the Government&#146;s policies on the trust. Although Ministers might say that the policies are in no way linked to the events that occurred, if they were that confident, would not an independent public inquiry provide a stronger opportunity for them to disprove any such link between their policies and anything that took place at Stafford general hospital?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="90518-0020.htm_para7"><a name="09051844000037">Three of the solutions identified by David Colin-Thom&#233; are actions that should be taken by the Department of Health. That suggests that, in his mind, there are three actions that the Department might have taken to avoid the tragedy happening. Hon. Members might assume from that that the Department of Health would be mentioned at least three times in the body of the review&#151;yet the Department of Health is not mentioned once in its substantive body.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="90518-0020.htm_para8"><a name="09051844000038">Clearly, we can see the effect of the chaos arising from the near-perennial reorganisations of the NHS and the suppression of a powerful patient and public voice. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Poole  <br>

(Mr. Syms), I hark back to the late lamented community health councils that were killed off by this Government, as they were independent and able to aggregate individual circumstances to draw general conclusions that were extremely helpful in advising Governments and the public about the performance of the NHS. We also have to remember the failure to act on events at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells. They all had a part to play in the tragedy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="90518-0020.htm_para9"><a name="09051844000039">It is vital to remember that, in his opening remarks, the Minister mentioned that there was continuing contempt&#151;certainly on the basis of the discussions we have had&#151;for a real complaints process in the Care Quality Commission and the Healthcare Commission. We have advocated proper complaints processes, but they were refused by the Government, who have relied on an over-burdened and under-resourced health services ombudsman. An independent public inquiry would be able to demonstrate how these processes should work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="90518-0020.htm_para10"><a name="09051844000040">In arguing the case for an independent public inquiry, it is important that both the policy and the individuals are properly scrutinised. The Secretary of State said that he remained unconvinced, but we hope that the right hon. Gentleman, who promised Julie Bailey of the Cure the NHS campaign that he would think again, will actually do so. We salute that campaign and we hope that when the Under-Secretary replies, she will do the right thing, support our motion and launch the public inquiry. On behalf of all those who are grieving and those who have suffered, we hope that she makes the best and shortest speech she has ever made and simply says &#147;yes&#148;.</p>

I worked as a nurse in the NHS for more than 25 years and whenever the tragedies, complaints and reality of what happened at Mid Staffordshire become clear to us when we read these reports, we feel shame and we feel that we have let many people down.</p>

In addition, the trust has invited in people who are not just concerned, but devastated, about the care that they or a close relative&#151;a mum or a dad&#151;received.

It is our understanding that since the publication of the two reviews, the RCN is calling no longer for a full public inquiry but rather for a review of any new issues.</p>

Members have taken part in the debate, but the issues that the Opposition Front Benchers raised shared the theme of whistleblowing. I intend to address that, but I am sure that hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="90518-0020.htm_para21"><a name="09051844000067">The reality is that Sir George Alberti and Dr. Colin-Thom&#233; have agreed to present their findings about what happened at Stafford at a public meeting in Staffordshire. I understand that my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford is facilitating that meeting, and I congratulate him on that. He is aware of the importance of the recruitment of good-quality staff at Mid Staffordshire, and that issue was raised by the hon. Members for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant), for Stone (Mr. Cash), for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) and for Poole (Mr. Syms). My hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) reminded the House of how we have to work together to see that these incidents do not happen again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="90518-0020.htm_para22"><a name="09051844000068">If I go may into the heart of the problem at Mid Staffordshire, it is about reporting bad care and whistleblowing. Our next stage review by Lord Darzi is about quality and safety. We cannot have quality and safety in patient care, which is paramount to every health professional, if we do not have the appropriate work force. Every patient journey must start by having quality and being safe. We cannot have safety if we do not operate in an environment of an open culture and a management who show real leadership. That encouragement of leadership at all times throughout the review has raised the quality of leadership within the Mid Staffordshire trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="90518-0020.htm_para23"><a name="09051844000069">It was this Government who brought in a whistleblowing charter. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Opposition Members may shout, but if they are concerned about the reality and quality of patient care and safety, I suggest that they work  <br>

within the next stage review at all times, because the quality and safety of patient care are paramount. I appeal to the new leadership that is in place at Mid Staffordshire to get in place the consultants, nurses and health professionals who can provide a quality work force, so that they can lead quality patient care and so that Mid Staffordshire is known as a centre of excellence in future. We shall bring that about through our education and training system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="90518-0020.htm_para24"><a name="09051844000070">The Prime Minister has commissioned a commission on nursing and midwifery, which I am privileged to chair. I shall attend Mid Staffordshire trust to consult nurses about how they feel things went wrong. With the serious comments that have been made in the House, we need to address why people did not feel they could report such serious incidents. From the top doctors to everyone else who works at the hospital, from the ward to the board, every one of us is responsible for patient care, and every one of us will continue to administer the quality and safety that our national health service should deliver, and that our patients have every right to expect us to deliver.</p>

 It is a pleasure to open this debate. I have been seeking a debate on this subject for about five months, and I am delighted to have finally secured it, but it is disappointing that the issue has not moved on in those five months. We are still debating the funding of the crossing over the River Forth. This time five months ago, I was deeply concerned about the arrangements that were in place, and the worry that the issue was causing within the community in Fife. The slow pace of progress on this important issue is matched only by the increasing concern in the local community. The longer the process takes, the more that concern grows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="90518-0021.htm_para11"><a name="09051844000575">The Forth bridge was opened by the Queen in 1964, replacing the ferry from north to south. At the time, there were about 4 million crossings a year. Now the figure is about 21 million, which is much more than was expected when the bridge was constructed. That fivefold increase has put a huge strain on the bridge, leading to deterioration that means it cannot support the current volume of traffic for more than a further decade. If action is not taken to build a new crossing, we may be asking the Queen to return to launch a new set of ferries to secure the lifeline link between Fife and Edinburgh.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="90518-0021.htm_para12"><a name="09051844000576">The bridge is a crucial part of the east coast transport artery. A blockage at Queensferry would have major consequences for the economy of the whole of Scotland. Many businesses locate in Fife because of the transport links to Edinburgh, Glasgow and the north, and because it has easy access to the east coast main line and the airport. Thousands of commuters have moved from Edinburgh to Fife to enjoy the benefits of living in Fife while maintaining their jobs in the capital. There is no doubt that the bridge is essential, no matter what some protesters say. We cannot do without the bridge at Queensferry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="90518-0021.htm_para13"><a name="09051844000577">The technical problem is that the hundreds of little cables that hold the bridge up are snapping. The deterioration is considerable, but the rate of decline is unknown, as the snapping was discovered only about four years ago. Current estimates are that the bridge has only another decade of life in it. Those estimates may change, however, as we get a better assessment of how the deterioration is advancing. If the deterioration is discovered to have slowed, the length of the life of the bridge will be longer. However, by the time that we know for sure how long the bridge has, it will be too late, so we need to construct the bridge as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="90518-0021.htm_para14"><a name="09051844000578">Despite the need to start building the bridge in 2011, there remains considerable uncertainty about the funding package. I simply do not buy the assurances of the Scottish Government that they have the funding in place. Some may say that we do not need to have the funding in place until about 2011, but businesses crave certainty, especially in these difficult economic times. We need absolute certainty so that we can give businesses in Fife the confidence that they need.</p>

They want an assurance that a bridge will be built, but they have not received one. Two years ago, John Swinney, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth, agreed:</p>

It is not because we lack patriotic Scots, but because there is a lack of sensible thinking in the SNP. As a result, the SNP has not built one school, one road, one railway or one hospital since it came to power, through that method&#151;absolutely nothing.</p>

 I obviously want to stick to the narrow remit of the debate, but the hon. Gentleman will understand that the ability to take money for bonds is not permitted at the moment by the UK Government. I am sure he will confirm that the First Minister has since made the position clear, and has described the project as</p>

 I am highly sceptical about those remarks, because of the First Minister&#146;s hyperbole in 2006: he knew the rules&#151;he knew the game&#151;but he made those overblown, overcommitted comments, giving people confidence that things would happen. The hon. Gentleman should not be surprised that I do not have a great deal of confidence in the First Minister&#146;s remarks or in the Cabinet Secretary&#146;s comments that it would be through capital spending that the bridge would be constructed. The First Minister must give us a greater assurance, and must spell out the sacrifices required, which he has so far refused to do. If, over three years, we spend &#163;700 million a year, there will be massive consequences for infrastructure projects&#151;hospitals and schools&#151;throughout Scotland during that period. Almost nothing else will be built. The First Minister, however, has refused to spell that out, and will not name the projects that will be cancelled.  <br>

The hon. Gentleman will therefore understand why I do not have a great deal of confidence in the First Minister&#146;s remarks in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="90518-0021.htm_para22"><a name="09051844000589">The Civil Engineering Contractors Association confirmed my belief and is deeply concerned about the situation:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="90518-0021.htm_para24"><a name="09051844000591">I do not wish this contribution to be dominated by Scottish Executive powers, so I shall move on to the reasons why we need to reach some kind of resolution. If the SNP refuses point blank to use the powers it has within its grasp, we must seek alternative methods. After two years in power, during which the SNP Government pondered their Scottish future strategy and eventually decided that that would not be possible, they have come cap in hand to the Westminster Government for additional support. That is a humiliating U-turn on which, unsurprisingly, the SNP has gone silent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="90518-0021.htm_para25"><a name="09051844000592">I give credit to Gavin Brown, a Conservative Member of the Scottish Parliament, for this analogy&#151;there seems to be a dangerous game of chicken going on between the Westminster Government and the Scottish Government. Who blinks first? Who ducks out of the road of the oncoming juggernauts? Meanwhile, uncertainty in Fife and the east of Scotland grows. Because the stakes are so high, it is essential that we achieve a resolution to the problem as soon as possible.</p>

 When the hon. Gentleman describes a humiliating U-turn, I take it that he is describing the rather sensible proposal to go to the UK Government and ask to pay for a major capital project over a longer period than the two or three years for which the UK Government have allowed. I hope the hon. Gentleman will agree that that is not humiliating. It is a rather sensible way to repay the cost of a major capital project.</p>

 Spreading payment over 20 years is not the way the Westminster Government usually work. I do not think most Governments would commit future Governments to such spending, so it is not particularly sensible. It is humiliating, because of the First Minister&#146;s overblown hyperbole in 2006 and 2007. That is why the SNP Administration should reflect on their ideological obsession with opposing public-private partnership. I am not a strong advocate of PPP, but I recognise that it is the only game in town. It is a way of delivering projects for our communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="90518-0021.htm_para26"><a name="09051844000595">Rather than maintaining their ideological opposition, and their support for alternative methods, the SNP Administration should recognise that the bridge is more important than their ideology. Patriotic bonds sound great in opposition, but in practice they have turned out to be patriotic tosh. We need an alternative way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="90518-0021.htm_para27"><a name="09051844000596">I am almost pleading with the Westminster Government, who I believe have a significant responsibility. By offering &#163;1 billion, they have accepted the principle that in the   <br>

present circumstance they should help the Scottish Government out of their difficulties. The trouble is that that was not new money. About &#163;500 million was from Crossrail, which was coming anyway, and other moneys were always designated as Scottish Government funds. So the Westminster Government were not assisting with the difficulty. None the less, I welcome the fact that they have accepted in principle that they should help the Scottish Government out of their obvious difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="90518-0021.htm_para28"><a name="09051844000597">I plead with the Minister to come up with a new package of support so that we can get this essential bridge built across the Forth&#151;some real new money that would resolve the difficulty. The Westminster Government have accepted in principle. Now it would be nice to see some real cash that could get us out of the present difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="90518-0021.htm_para29"><a name="09051844000598">However, there is a second option that the Minister could consider. If the Government were to legislate quickly, we could introduce new borrowing powers. They have been considered by the Calman commission which has been set up by the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Government. We are considering all the options&#151;all the funding mechanisms&#151;that could be given to the Scottish Parliament so that it might have the real powers of a real Parliament. If the Scottish Parliament did have them, the Scottish Government would be able to use the borrowing powers to spread the cost of building that massive bridge&#151;about &#163;1.7 billion to &#163;2.3 billion&#151;over quite a long period. There would be a benefit in giving the Scottish Government the necessary powers to deliver the bridge on time, because building it on time is the absolute priority.</p>

Such an offer would bring certainty to the businesses and commuters of Fife, who need it, and avoid the childish game of chicken that seems to be taking place between the Westminster and Scottish Governments.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie) on securing this important debate about funding for the new crossing over the Forth. I should clarify at the outset, however, that the Forth bridge is a devolved project, so its funding, as I think those listening to the debate will have worked out by now, is also a devolved matter.

The project is designed to enhance the connections between the transport networks of south-east and central Scotland, improving journey times and contributing to the growth of the Scottish economy. Given the position of his constituency, I can see why he is keen to see the project go forward as quickly as possible. That is why the Government have taken steps to support the Scottish Executive in proceeding with the second crossing, but, because the Government recognise that this is a devolved issue, it is for the Scottish Executive to decide whether the new bridge is necessary, which designs they should follow and how to fund it.</p>

Since devolution in 1999, the capital provision made available to the Scottish Executive has more than tripled from &#163;1 billion to more than &#163;3 billion a year today. That increase is enabling the Scottish Executive to modernise Scotland&#146;s infrastructure&#151;its schools, hospitals, transport&#151;and provide sound foundations for future growth and prosperity.</p>

In total, the PBR fiscal stimulus was worth about &#163;2 billion for Scotland, including reduced VAT. I am pleased that the Scottish Executive announced in January that, through their Scottish economic recovery programme, they are accelerating &#163;227 million of capital spending and supporting almost 4,700 jobs in the Scottish economy. Beyond that, we recently announced in the Budget a further &#163;104 million for the Scottish Executive to strengthen investment in Scotland during the recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="90518-0022.htm_para4"><a name="09051844000606">The Government are working with the Scottish Executive to deliver improved infrastructure and to tackle the recession. If they wish, the Scottish Executive can seek funding for private finance initiative projects from the Treasury&#146;s new PFI fund, to assist projects adversely affected by the current financial conditions to come to a successful conclusion. To date, the Executive have chosen not to do that; I suspect that that is due to an ideological objection to PFI. However, PFI is a potential route for the Executive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="90518-0022.htm_para5"><a name="09051844000607">As I have said, the UK Government are keen to support progress on the new Forth crossing, and we have been proactive in seeking innovative solutions. To be helpful, my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury initiated a meeting with the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth on 4 March to discuss methods of funding that the Scottish Executive might choose; the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife was right to point out that that would bring nearly &#163;1 billion to bear. The package was one of innovative flexibilities and it was designed to try to facilitate the development of the funding package.</p>

coming to the Scottish Government anyway. The Minister has accepted the principle that new funding should come from Westminster. Perhaps she will consider a new package.</p>

<p><a name="st_o410"><a name="09051844000609"><a name="90518-0022.htm_spnew1"><a name="09051844001162"><b>Angela Eagle:</b>
 The principle that has been accepted is in respect of increased flexibilities, some certainty on end-of-year funding, the Barnett consequentials of Crossrail and a range of other things. We are trying to say in advance to the Scottish Executive that if they were to put together a package in such a way, there would be no doubt about some of the decisions on end-of-year flexibility, so they could act with confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="90518-0022.htm_para6"><a name="09051844000610">It is easy to say that the flexibilities contain no new money, but they account for nearly &#163;1 billion of extra assistance. Obviously, &#163;500 million of Crossrail-Barnett consequentials were going to Scotland anyway. It is perfectly reasonable of the Government to say that if the Scottish Executive wish to use that money to bring forward the second Forth bridge, they can do so. Some of the other parts of that package would have given certainty about the consequences of extra efficiency savings or the income from extra asset disposal. If we gave certainty, that money would, under the waiving of normal Treasury rules, be allowed to be put into the pot for funding the bridge. Saying that there is no new money is a possible analysis, but I dispute it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o411"><a name="09051844000611"><a name="90518-0022.htm_spnew2"><a name="09051844001163"><b>Stewart Hosie:</b>
 Measures were certainly suggested, but they included end-of-year funding, as the Minister rightly said. To raise the funds required for the bridge on that basis would require the Scottish Government to underspend by about &#163;275 million a year between now and 2016-17. That would be rather foolish. It would be much better if we could simply repay the cost of the bridge over a longer period.</p>

<p><a name="st_o412"><a name="09051844000612"><a name="90518-0022.htm_spnew3"><a name="09051844001164"><b>Angela Eagle:</b>
 That is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s interpretation. In England, the Government require efficiency savings of 3 per cent. a year; in Scotland, I note, efficiency savings of only 2 per cent. are required. With a more radical look at efficiency savings, money for the bridge might be freed up. There are ways to help to put the funding together. My right hon. Friends&#146; meeting with the Scottish Minister was about trying to give certainty in these circumstances. Efficiency savings often go straight back to the Treasury. Part of the reason for the meeting was to say that if such efficiency savings or asset disposals were successful, the Scottish Executive could keep the money. There are many areas where such pledges are not forthcoming from the Treasury; it was an attempt to be helpful. The Scottish Executive have called for borrowing against 20 years of future public funding by the Barnett formula. That is not a way that we can fund public expenditure across the UK, in Scotland or anywhere else: the systems do not work in that manner and it is not a viable option. We had the meeting to try at least to see whether we could explore a way forward, and all those issues remain on the table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="90518-0022.htm_para7"><a name="09051844000613">It is also open to the Scottish Executive to propose an asset disposal plan for assets such as land and buildings that are no longer required. I can reconfirm that in this context the Treasury would be happy to consider the Scottish Executive&#146;s retention of the increased receipts that would follow in order to fund the bridge. For example, disposing of 1 per cent. of the Scottish Executive&#146;s  <br>

assets in the national assets register could yield &#163;230 million to assist in providing the funding necessary to turn the bridge into reality. The Treasury also offered the Scottish Executive the flexibility to switch from resource budget provision to capital, which provides further options for choosing how a funding package for the bridge might be put together. The package that has been offered is potentially worth &#163;1 billion, and it illustrates how it might be possible to take the Forth bridge forward, even within the genuine constraints under which we are all operating, which must not be underestimated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="90518-0022.htm_para8"><a name="09051844000614">It is therefore disappointing that the Scottish Executive have not come forward with practical proposals for adopting that or similar packages to fund the bridge. The UK Government remain ready to work in partnership with the Scottish Executive, and the proposals put forward by my right hon. Friends the Chief Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland remain on the table. We look forward to working with the Scottish Executive to find a way forward. There are clearly choices and priorities to decide on as regards the funding  <br>
