<a name="40513-01_dpthd0"><h3 align=center>TREASURY</h3>
<h4 align=center>The Chancellor of the Exchequer was asked&#151;</h4>


<a name="40513-01_sbhd0"><h4 align=center>Ethiopia (Debt Relief)</h4>





<p>1. <a name="40513-01_wqn0"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson  (Tewkesbury)</b> 
 (Con): What recent discussions he has had with other Governments on debt relief to Ethiopia.  [172709]
</p>



<p><a name="40513-01_spmin0"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 Last month, the Governments agreed debt relief of $1.9 billion to Ethiopia, and then an additional topping up of $1.4 billion. Ethiopia is now the 13th country to reach decision point for debt relief and the 27th to be receiving debt relief.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Robertson: </b> 
 I thank the Chancellor for that answer, and I thank him for the work that he has done in securing debt relief for Ethiopia, on which I congratulate him. I am sure that he is aware that that country still has some $3.7 billion in outstanding debt, particularly to Russia, from the days of the bad old regime. I know that that is causing a considerable problem to Ethiopia as it tries to move towards the eradication of poverty and an increase in education and health services. Will he redouble his efforts in that direction, to secure the relief of that debt as well?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who I know is secretary of the British Ethiopia parliamentary group and has visited Ethiopia on two occasions recently. He is absolutely right: Ethiopia is a very poor country, where the average income is less than $100. Some 82 per cent. of the population live on less than $1 a day. Half of its $5.5 billion debt is owed to multilateral institutions, so the situation is difficult. There is also a specific problem because of the size of the debt owed bilaterally to Russia.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-01_para0">
However, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that, despite the slowness of progress, Ethiopia has now received not only some debt relief, but topping up. I hope that he will also agree that the arrangements that are being made through NEPAD&#151;the New Partnership for Africa&#039;s Development&#151;and the Africa plan offer greater hope to Ethiopia that, if it continues to reform, tackles problems of corruption and secures 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 452</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>stability, it can get both more debt relief and more financial help. It will be symbolic that, 20 years after Live Aid started in Ethiopia, when 7 million people still need food aid, we hope to go further and faster next year in providing resources to Africa. I may just add that that process would be helped if he could persuade his Front-Bench colleagues to support greater overseas development aid.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-01_spnew2"><b> Ms Julia Drown  (South Swindon)</b> 
 (Lab): I, too, congratulate the Chancellor on ensuring that Ethiopia and indeed Niger got their top-up debt relief. He has pointed out to the House the desperate poverty of Ethiopia and the fact that it still owes debts to many multilateral institutions. It has been calculated that it would cost UK taxpayers &#163;3 each for the next 10 years to pay back our portion of the multilateral debt so that those in Ethiopia would not have to keep paying debts to the richer countries of the world. As Bob Geldof said in a recent meeting in this House, they cannot afford to pay it, but we can. Does the Chancellor think that that could be achieved by this country and by other countries?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who I know has been very prominent both at constituency and national level in fighting the case for debt relief not only for Ethiopia, but for countries around the world that are in need of it. A week on Friday at the G7 meeting in New York we will be discussing the possibility of deeper debt relief, which would certainly benefit countries such as Ethiopia. An extension of what is called the sunset clause would benefit countries that are still in conflict and are also desperate to be in a position to receive debt relief later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-01_para1">
My hon. Friend is absolutely right that Bob Geldof highlighted the position of the country to which he first drew attention 20 years ago. Some 7 million children there do not go to school, infant mortality is high&#151;one in six young children die&#151;and there is only 30 per cent. literacy. Those are huge problems that must be tackled. It is not simply debt relief that is needed, but a new arrangement by which, if such countries are prepared to make the reforms, we are prepared to help them with health, education and other resources. This is a major initiative of the United Kingdom over the next few months.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Quentin Davies  (Grantham and Stamford)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Chancellor agree that however desirable and attractive debt relief is from the point of view of alleviating poverty, it is justified only if it is accompanied by strict conditionality and if it is made clear that it cannot be repeated,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise, a tremendous moral hazard is created and we find ourselves simply subsidising failure and perverse policies? Does he agree that, in the case of Ethiopia, part of that conditionality must be the observance of the arbitration award with Eritrea and the avoidance of further conflict, otherwise, we shall be encouraging the reconflagration of violence in that very damaged part of the world?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 The debt relief and additional aid that I am talking about are certainly conditional, and I made it clear in my earlier answers that that was the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 453</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>case. I think that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the signing of the memorandum of understanding with the Ethiopian Government, with clear target points for them to meet on transparency and other changes in the way in which they operate, as well as on the protection of human rights, is extremely important. That is why the additional aid that we are prepared to provide to Ethiopia is conditional on its meeting those benchmarks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-01_para2">
At the same time, in relation to Eritrea, I think that the hon. Gentleman knows that there was a boundary commission report and that there are still outstanding issues, but he can be assured that the Secretary of State for International Development is making it clear that that report should be observed. We must not forget, however, that the people who suffer as a result of what is happening have no control over these events and are starving or being denied education or health care. If we can make the conditions stick, it must be in all our interests to ensure that money is provided to those people, as I think was made clear to Prime Minister Meles Zenawi at the meeting of the Africa Commission in London only last week.

</p>





<a name="40513-01_sbhd1"><h4 align=center>Tax Credits</h4>





<p>2. <a name="40513-01_wqn1"><b> Claire Ward  (Watford)</b> 
 (Lab): How many families in Watford he estimates are receiving tax credits.  [172710]
</p>



<p><a name="40513-01_spmin1"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 In January 2004, around 7,000 Watford families were receiving child or working tax credits, and I can confirm that in the UK as a whole, the figure for families benefiting from the new tax credits has now risen above 6 million, affecting 10 million children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-01_para3">
Given its responsibility for tax credits, I can also tell the House that the first executive chairman of the newly merged Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise will be David Varney, who is currently chairman of mmO <sub>2</sub> , previously of Shell and British Gas and also chairman of Business in the Community. His remit will include implementing staff reductions of 8,000 at the Inland Revenue, of 3,000 at Customs and Excise and of 3,000 as a result of the merger. Her Majesty the Queen has approved the new department&#039;s name, which is the Inland Revenue and Customs service.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-01_spnew6"><b> Claire Ward </b> 
: Given the numbers that my right hon. Friend quoted, I am sure from my experiences in my constituency that many more families could benefit from tax credits. What can he do in his Department to encourage more families in Watford and in the rest of the country to take up their right to tax credits? Will he give an assurance that we have no plans to cut investment in tax credits, unlike Tory Front Benchers?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 My hon. Friend reminds me that the shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts), said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Government needs to face-up to the fact that tax credits are not reaching the people in need.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-01_para4">
A record 6 million people now receive tax credits as a result of the Government&#039;s decisions. Take-up of tax credits is higher than take-up of any other benefit that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 454</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Government provide, both in Watford and across the United Kingdom. The Conservatives should think more about reversing their opposition to tax credits, which are popular across the country, including in Watford, and think less about trying to cut vital public services such as child care, Sure Start and other children&#039;s services, which are built around the successful introduction of tax credits.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. George Osborne  (Tatton)</b> 
 (Con): The Chancellor should stop misrepresenting the Conservative position: we are not opposed to tax credits and never have been. Has he read the damning Public Accounts Committee report, published three weeks ago, which found that the introduction of the new tax credits in Watford and elsewhere was nothing short of disastrous, that it caused hardship for thousands of people and that overpayments could still cost the taxpayer more than &#163;700 million a year? What is his latest estimate of the number of low-income people in Watford and elsewhere who face clawback through no fault of their own, and how much is the taxpayer currently forking out in overpayments?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 Conservative party policy has been to oppose tax credits. The shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has said that they &quot;will not work&quot;, and went on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;It is a benefit paid through the tax system&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There is no need for a new system.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-01_para5">
The leader of the Conservative party said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;They&#039;re putting money into schemes that don&#039;t work.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-01_para6">
That is hardly a unanimous endorsement of the new scheme from the Conservative party.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-01_para7">
As far as take-up is concerned, the Labour party does not need to take lectures about the administration of taxation from the Conservative party. The child tax credit is cheaper to administer than any other benefit, and it costs half as much to administer as the family credit did under the Conservatives. The poll tax&#151;the great tax introduced with the inspiration of the shadow Chancellor&#151;cost &#163;1.5 billion to administer. We will think twice about any lectures on taxation and its administration from the Conservatives.

<p>3. <a name="40513-02_wqn0"><b> Judy Mallaber  (Amber Valley)</b> 
 (Lab): If he will make a statement on levels of unemployment in (a) Amber Valley and (b) the east midlands.  [172711]
</p>



<p><a name="40513-02_spmin0"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 The claimant count in the United Kingdom has decreased by 50 per cent. since 1997. During that period, the claimant count in Amber Valley decreased by 1,087, which is a 53 per cent. fall; and in the east midlands as a whole, it decreased by 48,000, which is a 47 per cent. fall. The claimant count for Amber Valley now stands at 2.l per cent., and for the east midlands it is 2.7 per cent.&#151;the lowest figures for unemployment for 30 years.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-02_spnew0"><b> Judy Mallaber: </b> 
 With 1.9 million more people in work since 1997, the latest east midlands business survey indicates that there are some problems in recruitment, especially for skilled workers, and that the available 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 455</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>labour pool includes many people who are severely disadvantaged. Will my right hon. Friend therefore confirm that instead of abolishing the new deal, as the Conservatives would, we will extend it to ensure that it overcomes those barriers, to enhance skills and qualifications, and in particular will he consider how we can extend the modern apprenticeships programme to ensure that it attracts women, who are often severely under-represented in some areas of skills shortage?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend. She has taken a major interest in the creation of jobs and the safeguarding of industry in her constituency, and I congratulate her on that. She will agree that even though in her constituency long-term unemployment is down by 85 per cent. and youth unemployment is down by 75 per cent., there are many people who the new deal wishes to get to and to help. The new initiatives from the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions are designed to help those people by giving them the chance to get jobs and to acquire the necessary skills. The future of my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency will be enhanced by the new deal for skills, more details of which will be announced next week by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-02_para0">
I think that my hon. Friend will agree that abolishing the most successful employment programme in our history, which has already created 1 million jobs, and saying that it is a waste of money is a disastrous policy, but that is the policy of the Opposition. The shadow Chancellor should remember that unemployment in his constituency is now 0.9 per cent.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mark Todd  (South Derbyshire)</b> 
 (Lab): Does the Chancellor welcome the creation of additional jobs in South Derbyshire and the east midlands through the creation of a manufacturing plant for JCB engines in the Dove Valley business park just off the A50 as a further demonstration that manufacturing is far from dead in my constituency&#151;it is alive and thriving? Has he witnessed also the growth in employment at Toyota, which is just down the road at Burnaston?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has taken a big interest in the success and development of manufacturing in his constituency. Our aim is modern manufacturing strength. We have introduced research and development tax credits, which are available to the companies that he mentions; we have strengthened the Government&#039;s regional policy to make it possible for people to invest; and we are providing a manufacturing advisory service at a regional level. Unfortunately, every one of those services would be put at risk by the policies of the Opposition, who would not only cut the new deal but abolish all the help that we are rightly giving to manufacturing industry.

</p>



<p><a name="40513-02_spmin1"><b>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury  (Ruth Kelly): </b> 
 At 31 March, 5,048 pensioners in Hastings and Rye were receiving the pension credit.

<b>13 May 2004 : Column 456</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>success of the pension credit in my constituency. It has made a great difference to many of my older constituents, many of whom are now more than &#163;30 a week better off than they were under the Tory income support plan. However, does my hon. Friend share my concern that, should the Conservatives ever achieve office, their plans to abandon means-assessment would mean&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="40513-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. The hon. Gentleman is out of order and should please sit down. It is not for the Chancellor to answer those questions, but for the Opposition. The hon. Gentleman can write to the Opposition&#039;s party headquarters to find out about these matters.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-02_spnew6"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to the success of the pension credit in alleviating pensioner poverty. Indeed, if he compares the current average pensioner household with that in 1997, he will find that in real terms it is more than &#163;1,350 better off as a result of the pension credit.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-02_spnew7"><b> Gregory Barker  (Bexhill and Battle)</b> 
 (Con): Help the Aged has described the pension credit as a &quot;profoundly inefficient means-testing mechanism&quot; that &quot;is deeply flawed.&quot; How many pensioners in Hastings and Rye are entitled to that benefit but do not claim it for one reason or another? How many pensioners in Hastings and Rye have become subject to means-testing since the Government came to power in 1997? Is that why so many pensioners in Hastings and Rye feel profoundly let down by Labour?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-02_spnew8"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s attitude is only too typical of the attitude of his party. I do not know how its Front-Bench spokesmen can claim that they are committed to tax credits while at the same time witnessing the hostility of individual Members. The proportion of pensioners now living in relative poverty is at its lowest since the mid-1980s, and is down by 0.5 million since 1996. Pensioners in Hastings and Rye, as across the country, are welcoming the introduction of the pension credit, and the poorest pensioners have benefited most.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Oliver Letwin  (West Dorset)</b> 
 (Con): I hope that you will allow me to begin, Mr. Speaker, by telling you that it is now possible to reach Conservative central office on the web. There is no need to write.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-02_para1">
The Financial Secretary is very proud that so many pensioners in Hastings and Rye are on pension credit. Does she realise that by making those pensioners depend on means-tested benefits, instead of giving them a proper basic pension linked to earnings, she is ensuring that people in Hastings and Rye have little incentive to save?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-02_spnew10"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is talking absolute nonsense. For the first time in history, under the pension credit, every single pensioner in this country has an incentive to save. Those with modest savings, and small occupational pensions, will be rewarded under the pension credit.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 I do not see how a pensioner in Hastings and Rye, who is losing between 40p and 85p in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 457</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>pound on savings income, has been given an incentive to save. Will the Financial Secretary tell us how many pensioners in Hastings and Rye have been affected by the Chancellor&#039;s &#163;5 billion raid on pension funds, and how many pensioners in Hastings and Rye will suffer from his attack on the tax advantages of ISAs?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-02_spnew12"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 Pensioners in Hastings and Rye are better off now than they have ever been. On average, pensioners in Hastings and Rye are &#163;18.50 better off through the pension credit and other measures that this Government have introduced than if, for example, the basic pension had been connected to earnings. The right hon. Gentleman draws attention to the advance corporation tax reforms. He more than anyone should know that that was an example of this Government reducing corporation taxes and making sure that pensioners have resources targeted on them when they most need it.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-02_spnew13"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 It is a sure sign of what is going on in the Treasury at the moment if the Financial Secretary does not have a briefing telling her the answers to simple questions about Hastings and Rye. Let us turn to another pensions disaster that will deter pensioners in Hastings and Rye from saving, putting them on pension credit: the wind-up of their occupational pension schemes. Pensioners in Hastings and Rye who are in that position will have noted the Chancellor&#039;s statement in the Red Book that unclaimed financial assets should be &quot;reinvested in society&quot;. Would not using those unclaimed assets to compensate pensioners in Hastings and Rye whose pensions have been devastated by wind-ups be a true investment in society?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-02_spnew14"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I am not going to take lessons at the Dispatch Box from a party whose leader, when Minister with responsibility for financial services, presided over the biggest pensions mis-selling scandal in history. The Opposition talk about giving pensioners compensation when pension schemes have gone bust, yet they refused to support the Second Reading of the Pensions Bill, which for the first time in history will protect the pensioner promise awarded to pensioners. Yet again, they raise false hopes while being committed to savage cuts in public expenditure. I wonder how they would explain that to pensioners who are suffering.
</p>

 (Lab): Is it not pretty evident that, when the shadow Chancellor ran away during the election campaign, he must have gone to Hastings and Rye in a blanket? That was when he was missing longer than Maxine Carr.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-02_spnew16"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. Unfortunately, the right hon. Gentleman did not reappear in the Labour seat, Hasting and Rye, but somewhere else in the country, wearing a toga. My hon. Friend knows how much pensioners have benefited from the measures introduced by this Government, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 458</b>

<p><a name="40513-02_spnew18"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. The hon. Gentleman must speak about Hastings and Rye in his supplementary question, not North Norfolk, which is too far away. Can he manage that?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-02_spnew19"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 Thank you for that guidance, Mr. Speaker. I intend to concentrate fully on pensioners in Hastings and Rye. Will the Financial Secretary respond to the clear evidence given to the Treasury Committee by experts who said that pensioners in Hastings and Rye and elsewhere will be faced with a positive disincentive to save because of the extent of the means-testing introduced by the pension credit? Worse than that, anyone providing financial advice will clearly face the problem of mis-selling if they advise someone who is on a low or middle income on a pension product, because of the risk of losing out by not gaining the pension credit once they reach retirement age.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-02_spnew20"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I do not accept that. I think that all Governments have a duty to protect the welfare of the poorest pensioners, and it is a duty that this Government have taken seriously. Moreover, for the first time in history we can say unambiguously to every pensioner that his or her money will not be withdrawn pound for pound, and that there is a clear benefit from saving.

<p>5. <a name="40513-03_wqn0"><b> Tony Lloyd  (Manchester Central)</b> 
 (Lab): What assessment he has made of the impact of Government policy on child poverty.  [172714]
</p>



<p><a name="40513-03_spmin0"><b>The Paymaster General  (Dawn Primarolo): </b> 
 By 2002&#150;03 there were around half a million fewer children in relatively low-income households than in 1998&#150;99&#151;4.2 million down to 3.6 million after housing costs, and 3.1 million down to 2.6 million before housing costs. Those data do not fully reflect the effect of increased support from the introduction of the new tax credits in April 2003, or the increase in the tax credits that took effect last month.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-03_spnew0"><b> Tony Lloyd: </b> 
 There is no doubt that the various schemes introduced by the Government both to assist children in the poorest families and to help adults into work have had a real impact on child poverty, but I am sure my right hon. Friend accepts that we still have a long way to go if we are to help those 3.6 million children. Are the Government still committed to the eradication of child poverty in this generation? Is that still a priority, and does my right hon. Friend agree that the biggest single threat to its achievement is the lack of national consensus and, in particular, the failure of Opposition parties to support the Government&#039;s programmes?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-03_spnew1"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 Between 1979 and 1996&#150;97, the proportion of children living in low-income households 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 459</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>more than doubled under the last Government. Following the introduction of this Government&#039;s policies, by 2002&#150;03 the number of children in low-income households, in absolute terms, fell by 50 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-03_para0">
The Government&#039;s historic commitment to eradicating child poverty means that we must tackle poverty on all fronts. We need to ensure that we get money to families, to ensure that people can be in work, and to ensure by means of active labour market policies that that work pays adequately. We need to support parents in their parenting role, and we need to deliver high-quality public services to improve children&#039;s lives in the short term and break the cycles of deprivation. All those policies are opposed by the Conservatives in their desire to cut the new deal and cut investment in public services. It is a tragedy for the nation that we cannot secure a consensus once and for all on tackling child poverty.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-03_spnew2"><b> Dr. Vincent Cable  (Twickenham)</b> 
 (LD): I acknowledge the priority that the Government have given to child poverty and the progress made towards reducing it, but in the light of the utterly chaotic introduction of the child tax credit last year, may we have an absolute guarantee that under the even more complex regime envisaged for this year&#151;incorporating the child supplement to income support, for instance&#151;hundreds of thousands of poor families will not once again find themselves plunged into poverty, either through non-payment or through demands for repayment of amounts that should not have been paid in the first place?

 It is a shame that the hon. Gentleman did not take the opportunity to commit himself fully to the policies that the Government are pursuing to eradicate child poverty. He ought to look at the details of the introduction of the tax credit. It has proved a popular policy. The contribution made by the tax credit, and by the April increase, has been fundamental to lifting children out of poverty. As has been said outside the House,

As he will know, the Government are well on course to achieving their target of reducing child poverty by a quarter by 2004, but he is quite right to identify the challenges for the medium and long term. To that end, the Government are introducing a series of three indicators, all of which will measure our progress on eradicating child poverty: an absolute low-income test, a relative low-income test and a test of material deprivation and relative low income. They will ensure that we have clarity and comprehensiveness in tackling the questions of child poverty. That means investment in tax credits, investment in public services, support for child care, support for training and a commitment to full employment&#151;all policies that the Conservative Opposition do not support.

<p><a name="40513-03_spmin1"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 Following last year&#039;s setback at Cancun, Britain and the European Union are now considering new proposals to break the deadlock on trade negotiations, not least to tackle agricultural protectionism. I hope that our proposals will have the support of Members on both sides of the House.

</p>








<p><a name="40513-03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 The Treasury, with the Department of Trade and Industry, will next week be publishing proposals on trade and a major study of the impact of trade on developing countries. My hon.

He says in his letter that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;we have a historical opportunity for a breakthrough&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is clear that the objective of eliminating all forms of export support is one which is shared by the great majority of participants.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-03_para3">
The European Union is moving to a position at which it will not only reduce agricultural subsidies that are trade distorting but, as part of the negotiations, remove export subsidies entirely. That is part of the pressure that the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and others have been putting on the international community. I hope that everyone will welcome that.

 It is absolutely clear that there are two major areas on which resolution is needed in the trade 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 461</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>talks. The first is that which we have mentioned. The developing countries will not accept the continuation of a system of agricultural protectionism, by either Europe or America, which deprives people in Africa, for example&#151;where three quarters of the population are on the land&#151;of being able to sell their products or, indeed, survive on the land. The second area concerns what are called the Singapore conditions, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the question of how we must break the deadlock on those. It is clear that the four Singapore conditions cannot be accepted by all countries. I believe that the European Union will now withdraw at least three of those conditions, which should help to achieve a breakthrough.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-03_para4">
It is in everyone&#039;s interest, when agricultural subsidies are $300 billion but overseas aid is only $50 billion, that we remove the worst of agricultural protectionism and, by changing the Singapore conditions, try to achieve a breakthrough on trade that is of the greatest benefit not to Europe and America&#151;although they will benefit&#151;but to the poorest countries in the world.

Will the United Kingdom Government follow Canada&#039;s sterling example by introducing legislation, thereby helping to attain our health and development goals while respecting the intellectual property rights of the pharmaceutical industry?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 My hon. Friend takes a huge interest in these matters, and recently visited Africa, where he will have seen at first hand the problems arising from HIV/AIDS and the failure to tackle it. I met the Finance Minister of Canada and talked to him about the announcement that Canada made only a few weeks ago about intellectual property; we shall examine his proposals. At the same time, I was able to remind him that Canada might consider the proposal that we introduced in the Finance Bill&#151;to give research and development tax credits for companies, even those outside the United Kingdom, that are developing and patenting drugs for conditions that are peculiar or specific to, or mainly found in, Africa and other such places. We are prepared to work with Canada on those issues. The most important thing to say is that the cost of the drugs is now coming down&#151;but we must do more, through the global health fund, to get those costs down. Again, I hope that we can have all-party support on that matter, rather than suggestions for cuts in overseas development aid.

Can he give any indication of the timetable? As he rightly said earlier, some 6,000 children a day are dying in Africa, and the potential uplift from just 1 per cent. growth in world trade would far outweigh all the aid programmes, the international finance facility and much else. Can we move extremely quickly, because day by day, this is an urgent problem? Can he reassure us that even if the United States is dragging its feet, Europe can move forward?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has chaired all-party committees on this subject in the House of Commons. At the last meeting of the International Monetary Fund only a few weeks ago, and at the G7 meeting, there was a declaration that there must be urgency in moving the trade talks forward. I can also tell my hon. Friend that Mr. Zoellick, the American negotiator, has been at meetings in Europe in the past few days, so that we can achieve that breakthrough. I believe that the significance of the Lamy letter on agricultural protectionism will be important in moving the talks forward, and we will do everything in our power, including the publication of our documentation next week, to move them forward. As for making more money available for Africa, I have drawn attention to what the Treasury has done to give extra support for drug research and development, and I should add that that will be carried forward by Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs, the new service, under its new chairman. Of course, the main hope is that, subject to all the conditions that have been laid down, we can persuade our partners that an international finance facility would not simply release just a few billions more in resources, but could front-load development aid by doubling the money available to halve poverty over the next few years.

 (Lab): Is my right hon. Friend aware that Sir Peter Gershon&#039;s reports contain some hard targets that are difficult to meet, and will he look closely at the methods for calculating public sector efficiency and productivity? I am thinking in particular of the proposals of the Office for National Statistics, on which the Opposition have commented. Their perverse effect is such that, even if my right hon. Friend were to fan an epidemic throughout the country&#151;I would not put such a task past his considerable powers&#151;create a conflagration the size of the great fire of London, double class sizes and imprison half the population, he could show some remarkable increases in productivity on the basis of ONS procedures. Can we therefore hope that the reviews of Sir Peter Gershon and Sir Tony Atkinson will provide a much better basis for measuring efficiency and productivity, and put an end to the irresponsible exploitation of what are experimental figures&#151;as the ONS itself describes them&#151;by the Opposition?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-04_spnew3"><b> Mr. Boateng: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a very good point&#151;in his inimitable way. He is absolutely right: the current productivity measures give a distorted picture, which is why we welcome the decision of the national statistician and Registrar General to ask Tony Atkinson to develop better measures of public sector productivity. We look forward to the involvement of Front-Bench spokespersons from all parts of the House in ensuring that we get a productivity measure on which we can agree.

<p><a name="40513-04_spnew4"><b> Mr. Howard Flight  (Arundel and South Downs)</b> 
 (Con): No tangible efficiency savings have been announced in health or education; Home Office staff numbers have grown so much that they cannot fit into the new office; the Minister for Local and Regional Government is backtracking on Gershon procurement and back-office savings; Treasury administrative costs are up by 16 per cent.; and the Prime Minister was wrong about UK administrative costs, which are up by 8.5 per cent. as a percentage of total spending. Are the Government serious about Gershon, or is the &#163;20 billion-worth of savings just smoke and mirrors?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-04_spnew5"><b> Mr. Boateng: </b> 
 I recommend that the hon. Gentleman try the alternative remedy of some camomile tea.

 UK development aid has doubled since 1997.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, whose interest in this issue has been shown not just in Parliament, but in the campaigns that he has run in his own constituency. I can assure him that our commitment is that every child be given the chance of primary education, and that that goal be achieved over the next 10 years, with 120 million children who do not receive education being given that education as a result of our proposals. Our commitment is to cut by two thirds child and maternal mortality, and to halve poverty over the next few years. We will do that best by the world coming together to make resources available. In our view, that will be best achieved through the international finance facility, and we are ready to talk with all our international partners about how we can tackle poverty in the poorest countries by increasing the resources that the richest countries give.

<p><a name="40513-04_spnew8"><b> Mr. Mark Field  (Cities of London and Westminster)</b>

</p>








<p><a name="40513-04_spnew9"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 As I said just a few minutes ago, the protocol signed with Ethiopia made it a requirement that, before further aid would be given, the country had to sort out human rights issues, problems of corruption

<br>&nbsp;<br>and the misuse of resources. Also, under measures agreed with the IMF, two centres have been set up in Africa to advise on the proper preparations of fiscal and monetary policy, which the hon. Gentleman would accept is important. It is a condition of the international finance facility and, indeed, the Monterrey consensus, that countries receive the proposed development aid only if they show that they are tackling problems of corruption, lack of transparency and those associated with fiscal and monetary stability as well as opening up to trade and investment.
</p>

At the same time, we want to encourage the better use of aid. We should remember that aid to sub-Saharan Africa has been cut from the rate of $33 per person 20 years ago to only $20 per person today&#151;a savage halving of aid at a time when needs have become even greater. We have not only untied aid, but, for the first time, $1 billion of aid is going directly to Africa and to the projects that the hon. Gentleman would support&#151;in health and education.

Given the scale of the problem and the ambition of our proposal, the best way forward is to persuade countries effectively to double their aid while at the same time subscribing to a long-term and predictable flow of aid.

 No, I do not accept that the policies are not in place. They range from public spending to regulation, instruments of taxation and trading allowances, which come on stream next month. The polices are encouraging the very waste hierarchy that the hon. Gentleman talks about, which is essentially reducing the production of waste and increasing rates of recycling and reuse. Surely he must welcome the fact that the rates of recycling and composting from household waste are on target&#151;we met the targets we set in 2002 and are expected to meet the targets we set in 2003. I would have thought that he and the whole House would welcome the efforts that are being made, especially by local authorities, which play such an important part in waste management.

<p><a name="40513-05_spnew12"><b> Mr. Barry Sheerman  (Huddersfield)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): My hon. Friend will know that his comments will be welcomed by hon. Members who care about the environment. He should also be aware, however, that most of us know that the landfill tax money is building up. The Government have a rather bureaucratic response to how they disburse those moneys. Is not it nonsense, when the Environment Agency is starved of funds and cannot fully carry out its functions as a regulator, that that money is locked up somewhere in the Treasury?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-05_spnew13"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 I hesitate to reply because my hon. Friend is a recognised expert on the subject in the House and well connected outside with the industry, so he speaks with a great deal of authority. However, I do not accept his argument that the increasing resources that we are putting into waste management are locked up in bureaucracy. As he well knows, because we have discussed it, we altered the landfill tax credit scheme precisely so that the money from the increase in receipts from the landfill tax would be put to more strategic use in waste management. The evidence is that that is having an effect. I also remind him that the coffers from the landfill tax are not yet swelling in the way that he suggests, but it is true that we will raise the rate of landfill tax from April next year not by &#163;1 a tonne, which we have done in the past, but by &#163;3 a tonne. That will play an important part in helping us to meet our targets.

I thank the Paymaster General for her reply and for the commitment that she and the Chancellor have shown to helping supporters&#039; trusts. Does she agree that in troubled times for football, one thing that has given cause for hope in recent years is the emergence of 112 supporters&#039; trusts in England and Wales, which are not-for-profit and democratic? They have shown that there is a better way to run football clubs than the failed public limited companies and private models. In advance of the new season, will she give supporters renewed hope by creating the real incentive of an even playing field in football that is in favour of mutual ownership?

 Football supporters&#039; trusts play a very valuable role in giving football fans a voice in the running of their clubs within the community, especially when clubs find themselves in financial difficulties. My hon. Friend will know that the matter is complex; the issues need to be dealt with by the Inland Revenue review and all the possibilities considered. I understand that the all-party football group has also submitted evidence. Once we have considered all those issues, we need to take them forward. I certainly concur with my hon.

 I thank the Leader of the House for the business and I should like to raise two issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-06_para11">
Next week, the main business is the Pensions Bill. The all-party new clause 3 would compensate the 60,000 workers who lost their pensions after their companies went bust, and the Leader of the House knows the distress that those people have suffered. He will also know that I, my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) and Members on both sides of the House have campaigned on the issue. In fact, I led a debate on it in January 2003. According to <i>The Times</i> today, the Prime Minister intends to offer compensation. Can we expect a full oral statement? Will the Leader of the House comment on the very careful words that the Prime Minister used yesterday about people who had no choice about joining occupational schemes? It would be disappointing if that compensation applied only to those who had joined schemes before 1988.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-06_para12">
I have some further questions on the Pensions Bill. We have three days next week to consider more than 100 Government amendments to the Bill and many new clauses. Why have they not yet been tabled? How are Members to consider them properly with so little time to prepare? When will they be tabled? Tomorrow? What about all the organisations outside this place which take a particular interest in pensions issues?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-06_para13">
On Iraq, although it is welcome that the Liberal Democrats have half a day on the security situation, surely we need a full-day debate urgently in Government

<b>13 May 2004 : Column 472</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>time. There are many questions unanswered. Did the Government make representations to the Americans about the rules of detention and interrogation, and if not, why not? Why was the Red Cross report with the Government for two months, but no Minister admits to being shown it? Surely, systems should be in place to ensure that an important document reaches the top, and if not, why not? Why was there no full communication between the Prime Minister, his envoy&#039;s office, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-06_para14">
There are now only 48 days left before the handover of power. We want to know whether there will be further British troop deployments. To whom will the handover be made? What powers will the Iraqis have over coalition forces? Does the Leader of the House accept that there is a lack of confidence in the Government&#039;s approach, partly because of a seeming lack of planning for the peace, partly because of the appalling revelations about the mistreatment of detainees, and also because people question the basic competence of the Government? It is important that the Government explain their position. In fact, the Foreign Secretary said as much on Tuesday:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I am happy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for there to be a debate on Iraq&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is important that I should come to the House and that the Government&#039;s position should be properly explained.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 11 May 2004; Vol. 421, c. 150.]</p>

When can we have a full-day debate, in Government time, on Iraq?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-06_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 First, on pensions, the hon. Gentleman knows that three days have been allocated to the Pensions Bill, which is a lot of time. I agree with him in respect of the ASW workers and many others like them&#151;they have been robbed of their pensions. That is absolutely disgraceful and unacceptable. Indeed, when I was talking to many of them on Monday in Cardiff, on a visit as Secretary of State for Wales, I made it clear that I thought it was a scandal and that it ought to be dealt with.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-06_para16">
The Government are well aware that there is all-party concern. The relevant Cardiff MPs in respect of ASW have been campaigning consistently, and my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan) deserves a great deal of credit for that. The Government are determined to resolve the issue in a way that does not provide a read-across to possibly billions of pounds falling on the taxpayer from other claims that do not fall into that category, where workers have been robbed of their pensions, to which they had contributed over many years&#151;perhaps 28 years, as one worker told me on Monday. That is just unacceptable&#151;after all, pensions are deferred wages&#151;so we are determined to resolve the issue, and when we are ready to do so an announcement will be made. As for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s request for a full oral statement, there will be three days of debate on the Pensions Bill. There will be plenty of time in which the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and Ministers can explain how the Government are proceeding on this matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-06_para17">
I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about 100 Government amendments. The Government are always anxious to provide proper time for Government amendments to be considered. This is a hugely complex issue and I am sure that he will agree that the priority is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 473</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to get it absolutely right. We are responding to a number of issues that were quite properly raised in Committee, to ensure that the Bill is sound and improved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-06_para18">
On Iraq, the hon. Gentleman asks for a full-day debate in Government time. There will be a half-day debate, provided by the Liberal Democrats, as I have announced, on Monday. I should have thought that that would take us further. The Secretary of State for Defence made a statement on Monday, the Minister with responsibility for the armed forces is appearing immediately after these business questions. There has also been plenty of opportunity to question Ministers on Iraq for many months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-06_para19">
The hon. Gentleman refers to the handover. I am sure that he will want to support the Government and the coalition in ensuring that the handover goes as smoothly as possible, because it is absolutely critical that the Iraqi governing council is able to take whatever steps it can to establish Iraqi control and Iraqi rule over the whole of Iraq, which will lead to elections and a proper Government being established. It would be far more important and far more legitimate if the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues, instead of trying to score all sorts of points, backed British forces in Iraq and backed the very difficult job that the Government are doing with our coalition partners to establish stability and security in Iraq, and to enable the Iraqis, for the very first time for a generation at least, to govern themselves free from fear and insecurity, with their democratic rights underpinned.

<p><a name="40513-07_spnew0"><b> Mr. Brian Jenkins  (Tamworth) (Lab):</b> 
 Does my right hon. Friend share with many other people and me a slight suspicion that the oil companies may be operating like a cartel? The price of crude oil has risen and the price at petrol stations is a multiple of that. How can the oil companies justify their actions, as last year they enjoyed excessive profits? The only reason I can think of for increasing the price is the increased cost of transporting fuel to petrol stations. Could we have a short debate to allow the relevant Department to assess the oil companies&#039; position and allay the suspicions that they are ripping off the British motorist?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-07_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has expressed concerns that are probably shared across the House. For all our constituents it is imperative that the global pressures to raise oil prices, which originate from various sources, including the enormous quantities of oil sucked in by China, do not impinge on motorists in a discriminatory way. That is the key thing. If excess profits are made as a result of that sudden hike, it is important that motorists do not bear the cost.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-07_spnew2"><b> Mr. Paul Tyler  (North Cornwall) (LD):</b> 
 Reverting to Iraq, can the Leader of the House confirm that it will be a Cabinet Minister who responds to our debate on Monday so that, at long last, we can clear up the many confusions that have arisen in the House over the past few days, not least responses in Prime Minister&#039;s questions yesterday to questions from my right hon. and hon. Friends? Can we be sure that the Foreign Secretary or the Defence Secretary will respond to that debate on Monday?

<a name="40513-07_para0">
Will the Leader of the House make a statement and publish guidance on the most appropriate way of making Government announcements, a subject which you, Mr. Speaker, hold dear? It is outrageous that ministerial attitudes towards statements are becoming increasingly sloppy. For example, last night there was a tiny written statement by a junior Home Office Minister on the control of firearms and gun crime&#151;an extremely important issue, as I am sure all Members agree. At the same time however, there was an extensive media briefing, which was not made available to Members of Parliament and could not be questioned or challenged. Indeed, that media briefing, by ruling out the possibility of a ban on imitation and replica firearms, contradicted the consultation paper, which left that as an open question to which we require answers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-07_para1">
The Leader of the House may have seen comments in the press about those issues, but we have not been asked to comment and have not been given a chance to challenge Ministers. Can he give us an absolute undertaking that he will look at the issue and see whether there should be better guidance to his Government colleagues about the appropriate way of making statements to the House? Surely, we need a proper opportunity to challenge Ministers. Would he look at that again and make a statement? He is, after all, our only representative in Government, standing up for Members of Parliament, particularly Back Benchers, on such issues.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-07_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I appreciate the point made by the hon. Gentleman. My ministerial role as Leader of the House is to represent the whole Commons, not just the Cabinet. I discharge that duty, as he knows, very diligently. On the question of Government announcements and guidelines that may or may not be published, we all share concern that information, particularly new information indicating a change of policy, is heard by the House before anybody else. In today&#039;s 24-hour news agenda, that is often difficult, but we try our best.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-07_para2">
As for the worrying issue of gun crime&#151;on which we are seeking to bear down&#151;the hon. Gentleman may inadvertently have misrepresented the position of Home Office Ministers. We have issued a consultation document, which has been made available to Members and others so that they can express their point of view. This is a highly complex matter&#151;firearms legislation needs to be modernised, and the consultation document provides an opportunity to ensure that the regulatory framework is robust and prevents guns from getting into the wrong hands, while at the same time allowing legitimate shooters to pursue their sport without danger to public safety. That is what we are grappling with. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s views would be welcome, as would be those of other hon. Members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-07_para3">
On Iraq, I learned only today the topic of the motion that the Liberal Democrats are tabling on Iraq, so the hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to know that we have not managed to allocate ministerial responsibilities, but I shall bear his point in mind.

<p><a name="40513-07_spnew4"><b> David Winnick  (Walsall, North) (Lab):</b> 
 It looks as though it will be a good week for our constituents with regard to pensions. Will my right hon. Friend bear in mind the deep unease that continues to exist over the

<b>13 May 2004 : Column 475</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>sickening abuses of detainees in Iraq? For someone who has not the slightest intention of apologising for supporting action to destroy Saddam&#039;s tyranny, it is alarming not only that the abuses continued to occur, but that we had little or no knowledge of them. Therefore, despite the statement earlier this week from the Defence Secretary and the debate on Monday, will my right hon. Friend please make sure that as much information as possible is given about how it was possible for such abuses to occur? I refer particularly to those committed by the Americans, who are the most guilty of all&#151;but apparently, whether the photographs in the <i>Daily Mirror</i> were fake or not, abuses by British soldiers did occur. We want to know the truth, and we want to know what is being done to bring the culprits to justice.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-07_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 That question, coming from my hon. Friend especially, who has maintained a steadfast position in support of the Government on Iraq, deserves to be listened to closely. He makes his point well and I agree with him. Some of the reports of abuses, especially by American forces, have been not just sickening, but disgraceful and unacceptable, and in defiance of the Geneva convention and other international rules of behaviour. It is right that those abuses have been condemned by Government Ministers on both sides of the Atlantic. We are working to make sure that they do not happen on the British side, and I am sure the American Government are doing likewise in respect of their troops. On BBC television last night, I saw some reports from senators, coming out of the hearings, about the new photographs that they had seen. They are horrifying and it is a total stain on the coalition. The sooner the abuses are brought under control and eradicated, the better. Then we can move forward, as my hon. Friend said.

<p><a name="40513-07_spnew6"><b> Mr. Roger Gale  (North Thanet) (Con):</b> 
 The shambles that passes for the Government&#039;s asylum and immigration policy was exacerbated on 1 May when a significant number of people&#151;asylum claimants from countries that are now members of the European Union&#151;found themselves citizens of the EU. The Home Office wrote to those people in April and told them that, with effect from 1 May, their benefits would stop, their housing benefit would stop, they would have to give up their flats or houses, and they would either have to return home or seek work. What is not clear is how they are to do that if the Home Office immigration and nationality department still has their passports. How are they to prove who they are? Could the Leader of the House prevail upon the Home Secretary to come to the House and clarify the position?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-07_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 There is a serious point here&#151;the problem of the worldwide movement of people on a massive and unprecedented scale, from which other countries across the rest of Europe are suffering, just as we are. We have put legislation in place&#151;often, I might say, opposed by Conservative Members&#151;in order to make sure that we tackle the problem. As a result, asylum applications have been halved and the number of returnees has doubled. We have got a grip on the situation. The hon. Gentleman says there is a shambles of a policy. As he uses that language, I can refer to the shambles of a policy that we inherited from the Conservative Government, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 476</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>which was virtually an open door to illegal asylum seeking. We have got a grip on that, we are driving it down and, in the face of the most massive movement of people across the globe, we are putting in place the measures to stop that happening. We are ensuring that only legal migration can occur.

 May we have a short debate to give publicity to the fact that Bradford district, including my constituency, is piloting the extended school scheme, which will give parents, particularly single parents, the ability to work, safe in the knowledge that their children are receiving high quality child care before school, after school and during the school holidays? Those are issues that deter parents from working. The scheme will reduce child poverty in the Bradford district and it will also almost certainly be opposed by the Conservative party.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-07_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I am sure that the Conservatives will oppose the scheme, not least because they could not afford it if their spending cuts plan was implemented. <i>[Interruption.]</i> They would have to oppose it as a result of the cuts that they plan to make immediately on coming into office&#151;if, indeed, they ever do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-07_para4">
On the substance of the question, it is important that such extended school schemes are implemented because they give parents the opportunity to work&#151;especially those on low incomes or those going into jobs on low incomes&#151;knowing that their children are safe and secure and continuing their studies. I was heckled on the subject of cuts; it is the shadow Chancellor&#039;s expressed programme to cut non-school budgets in education and skills.

 I invite the Leader of the House to reflect on his rather dismissive response to my hon.

Of course we welcome a half-day Opposition debate on Monday, when two or three Opposition Back Benchers might get called, and of course we welcome the statements that have been made. But does he agree that these are no substitute for a balanced, measured full-day debate in Government time on an issue that is dominating political discussion at the moment?

May we have an opportunity, in Government time, to debate the aviation White Paper?

My community has the highest levels of unemployment and the most deprivation, and has lost a significant proportion of its manufacturing base in the last couple of years.

<p><a name="40513-11_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 My hon. Friend&#039;s points will certainly be considered, because they are important, and he is right that the buying and selling of homes affects millions of families across the country. Those families want to know that their rights are being protected, which is precisely what the Government seek to do, and we will draw on the OFT report in order to do that.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-11_spnew4"><b> Mr. David Cameron  (Witney) (Con):</b> 
 May I join the calls from both sides of the House for a full day&#039;s debate in Government time on Iraq and the Red Cross report? We now know for certain that no Minister saw the report for almost three months, which makes the matter even more important. Given the passionate and, I believe, entirely correct answer that the Leader of the House gave to the hon. Member for Walsall, North (David Winnick), does he think that Ministers should have seen the report earlier?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-11_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 This matter has been dealt with by the Defence Secretary, by the Prime Minister and by others. I can only repeat what I have already said to the shadow Leader of the House and others: if there is a case and an opportunity for a full day&#039;s debate, there will be one. We have not been shy in coming to the Dispatch Box to answer questions on Iraq; indeed, the Defence Secretary did so on Monday and the Prime Minister did so yesterday. We are fully accountable on these matters, as we will continue to be.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-11_spnew6"><b> Mr. Tom Harris  (Glasgow, Cathcart) (Lab):</b> 
 Can my right hon. Friend tell the House how easy he finds it to locate a reliable, well trained plumber; and can we have a debate on the Floor of the House that will contrast this Government&#039;s support for the modern apprenticeship scheme with the failure of the previous Government adequately to train up a new generation of plumbers, joiners and electricians?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-11_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I find it relatively straightforward to find a good, well qualified plumber in Neath, but much more difficult in London. I imagine that that has been my hon. Friend&#039;s experience. That is one of the many reasons why we have massively increased the number of apprenticeships from the 75,800 that there were under the Conservative Government when we came into power in 1997 to 255,500&#151;the most ever. We are creating on-the-job learning at school through the young apprentice scheme, which combines traditional school studies with up to two days per week learning on the job alongside skilled workers, including plumbers. I am sure that many more plumbers will come through that scheme. Our abolition of the 25-years-old age cap for apprenticeships should provide further encouragement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-11_para0">
I remember being told last year by a woman involved in training schemes that she found it impossible to encourage young girls to become plumbers, because they all wanted to be hairdressers, even though they 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 487</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>could earn perhaps four times as much while training for plumbing and have a much more flexible and well remunerated career afterwards. We want to see not only more men plumbers, but more women plumbers.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-11_spnew8"><b> Mr. Mark Field  (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con):</b> 
 Sport is very close to the hearts of many millions of our fellow countrymen. Will the Leader of the House give serious consideration to ensuring that the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport comes to the House to lead a debate in Government time on sporting strategy? I am particularly concerned about two issues. First, we should consider the strategy for the London Olympics, assuming that we make the shortlist following next week&#039;s decision by the International Olympic Committee. Secondly, there are grave concerns about the English cricket team&#039;s proposed tour in Zimbabwe in the autumn. I know that that matter is close to the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s heart, given his record as an erstwhile agitator some 34 years ago, and I should be interested to hear his views.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-11_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I have made my views very clear. In the unlikely event that I were an English cricketer, I would not go. Since the Zimbabwe cricket authorities now stand charged with discriminating in the selection of the team, this becomes a sporting matter as well as a question of the oppression under Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-11_para1">
I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the importance of sport. I am a sports fan myself&#151;a Chelsea supporter and a Neath rugby supporter, among other things&#151;and if there is an opportunity for a debate, I am sure that we will get one.
</p>

<a name="40513-11_head0"><h3 align=center>Points of Order</h3>


<a name="40513-11_time0"><h5>1.23 pm</h5>




<p><a name="40513-11_spnew10"><b> Mr. Oliver Heald  (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I understand that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is currently making an announcement about the fallen stock scheme, which is a major scheme for farmers. There is no written or oral statement on the Order Paper, yet this is a matter of great importance. I understand that it might be a bit embarrassing for the Government, because 180 out of 250 collection centres for fallen stock will be at hunt kennels. Would you be prepared to investigate how it is that this discourtesy to the House has occurred?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-11_spnew11"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 That is not a matter for the Chair. The hon. Gentleman should get involved in some correspondence with the appropriate Minister.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-11_spnew12"><b> Mr. David Wilshire  (Spelthorne) (Con):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I apologise for not discussing this with you earlier, but it took until a few minutes ago to double-check the facts that I want to raise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-11_para2">
During yesterday&#039;s Second Reading debate on the Age-Related Payments Bill, I pointed out that Spelthorne borough council&#039;s council tax payers had to meet part of the cost of operating the Government&#039;s council tax benefit scheme. The details of what I said are at column 388 of <i>Hansard</i>. During his winding-up speech, the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Pond) said this about my claim of underfunding:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I must ask my officials to contact his council because he appears to believe that the local authority meets part of the cost of council tax benefit when the central Government subsidy finances all properly made payments of such benefit.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 12 May 2004; Vol. 421, c. 408.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-11_para3">
Clearly, that is contrary to the information that was given to me by Spelthorne borough council. It follows, Mr. Speaker, that either I or the Minister misled the House. I therefore double-checked the council&#039;s claim this morning. It insists that it is telling the truth and has confirmed in writing the figures that I gave the House yesterday&#151;namely, that the administration grant from the Government for 2003&#150;04 was &#163;144,762, while the actual cost of administration, using the Government&#039;s system for calculating it, was &#163;313,276.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-11_para4">
It would therefore appear, Mr. Speaker, that what the Minister said in yesterday&#039;s debate was incorrect. Can you confirm that he should now come to this House to apologise for making that incorrect statement?
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040513/debtext/40513-12.htm"/>







<p><a name="40513-12_spnew0"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me notice of his point of order. I am sure that he is not seeking to accuse a Minister of deliberately misleading the House. If he were, that would be a matter of privilege that should be raised with me in writing. As it is, it seems to be a disagreement about a matter of fact, which is not for me to resolve. The hon. Gentleman should pursue the point directly with the Minister, either by correspondence or by tabling a question.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-12_spnew1"><b> Mr. Eric Forth  (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con):</b> 
 Further to the point of order made by my hon. Friend 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 489</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald), Mr. Speaker. As you know, you have frequently deprecated the habit of Ministers making statements and giving press conferences outside this House on matters that we, and I think you, judge would be much more appropriately dealt with here, where the Minister could be properly questioned by Members of Parliament. You have rightly said that that is not directly a matter for you, but could you confirm that were we to become aware in the early part of the day that a Minister was planning to issue a statement or to hold a press conference outside the House, procedures are available&#151;SO24s and Urgent Questions occur to me immediately&#151;whereby we, through you principally, could insist that the Minister came to the House and stated or repeated here what he had said outside the House so that he could be properly questioned?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-12_para0">
In other words, Mr. Speaker, Ministers should not assume that they can get away with this, and that, although you deprecate it, they can flout what you say. Procedures are available whereby they could be brought to the House in order to emphasise the fact that this is where their first responsibility lies.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-12_spnew2"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is quite right. From time to time, I have had to bring Ministers here to the Dispatch Box, and I have enjoyed doing it. Of course, I keep this matter under review. The House is sitting tomorrow and, as the right hon. Gentleman points out, there are procedures to deal with these matters.

<a name="40513-13_head1"><h3 align=center>Child Trust Funds Bill</h3>





<p><i>Lords amendments considered.</i>


</p>








<p><a name="40513-13_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </b> 
 I inform the House that privilege is involved in Lords amendment No. 7. If the House agrees to the amendment, I will arrange for the necessary entry to be made in the Journal.
</p>








<p>Clause 1


</p>




<br>
<center>Child Trust Funds</center><br>





<p><i>Lords amendment:</i> No. 1.




<a name="40513-13_time0"><h5>1.39 pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="40513-13_spmin1"><b>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury  (Ruth Kelly): </b> 
 I beg to move, That this House agrees with the Lords in the said amendment.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-13_spmin2"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 With this, we may take Lords amendment No. 2.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-13_spnew0"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 Looked-after children include some of the most disadvantaged children in our society, and we are committed to ensuring that they are fully included in the child trust fund arrangements. Although the majority of looked-after children have someone with parental responsibility, some have no one with such responsibility who can give instructions on their behalf for their child trust fund accounts&#151;for example, orphans with no legal guardians. There are also some circumstances in which it would be inappropriate for someone with parental responsibility to give instructions for the management of a child trust fund account of a looked-after child&#151;for instance, when contact between a child and a parent had been terminated because of serious abuse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-13_para0">
I said in Committee in January that we were exploring the possibility of involving the Official Solicitor. The amendments are the result of that work. Without them, there would be no one to give new instructions to the account provider for child trust fund accounts until the children reached the age of 16, when they would be able to give instructions themselves. There are a number of good reasons why it is desirable to have someone who could do that, and could make relevant decisions. For example, a child&#039;s religious or ethical beliefs may not accord with the type of child trust fund account that he or she has, or with the type of investments used in the account. Alternatively, an account provider may be underperforming in investment terms compared with other providers, so a move to a different provider may be called for.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-13_para1">
The amendments would allow the Official Solicitor to be appointed to manage the child trust fund accounts of such children. I urge the House to support them.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-13_spnew1"><b> Mr. George Osborne  (Tatton) (Con):</b> 
 It is good to be back at the Dispatch Box talking about this Bill&#151;it brings back memories of cold, dark January days in Committee.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 494</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-13_para2">
Before I deal with the detail of the amendments, I want to say something about timing, in which I think the Official Solicitor would also be interested. I hope that today will mark the Bill&#039;s last legislative hurdle&#151;we must wait and see&#151;but one major piece of the jigsaw is missing: a piece that is relevant to the Official Solicitor, and the new responsibilities that the Government want to give him or perhaps, in the future, her. It is, however, of greater interest to the providers. I have spoken to some of them in the past week, including the chief executive of one of the largest likely providers. What concerns them, and may concern the Official Solicitor, is the sales regime for child trust funds. That is the last major piece of the jigsaw.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-13_para3">
We, and the providers, were told that the Financial Services Authority&#039;s consultation paper on the sales regime was due to be published by the end of April. This is the second delayed deadline since the end of last year. We are almost halfway through May, and there is still no sign of the paper. When does the Financial Secretary expect it to emerge? Will it have to go to her before being published? I am not sure what procedure will apply in her office.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-13_para4">
Will the Financial Secretary confirm that when the paper is published, there will be a mandatory three-month consultation period in which people, perhaps including the Official Solicitor, will be able to make representations? If so, even if the paper were published this week, the consultation period would run until mid-August. That makes it extremely unlikely&#151;and I am being generous here&#151;that a decision on the sales regime would be made until the end of September. We are therefore very close to the deadline for getting the scheme up and running. The providers must start registering with the Inland Revenue by October or November, and from January they need to be in a position to accept applications from children born between September 2002 and April 2005.


<a name="40513-13_time1"><h5>1.45 pm</h5>

</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-13_para5">
That is a tight deadline. It was tight when we were discussing this in Committee and on Report, but it is even tighter now, and we still do not have the sales regime. That is causing considerable concern in the industry, and is relevant to the Official Solicitor&#039;s responsibilities. When I spoke to the Association of British Insurers this week, I was told:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The lack of information on the sales regime hinders providers&#039; ability to take an informed decision on market entry&#151;for example, we don&#039;t know if the CTF will be covered by the Sandler sales process or not. Early announcement of the charge cap which will apply to the CTF was welcome, but without the details of the sales regime providers will have an incomplete picture with which to consider offering the CTF&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the timing of the publication of information on the sales regime is, at the very least, unfortunate.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-13_para6">
The ABI is one of the most important groups representing the financial services industry, and is obviously important to the success of child trust funds. Unlike the Liberal Democrats, the official Opposition have supported the Bill throughout its passage so far, and we want child trust funds to work; but we are becoming increasingly concerned about the tightness of the timetable. When we read in the press that large providers such as the Pru and Legal and General have decided not to offer child trust funds, it is clear that we must do all we can to make them as attractive as possible 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 495</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to other providers, given the Government&#039;s restrictive decisions on such matters as the charge cap. The sales regime will be crucial to that. Will it be complicated or straightforward? I hope the Financial Secretary will say something about it, because I think it will be of broader interest.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-13_spmin3"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but we must try to keep the debate within the confines of the amendments. I hope he will not seek to persuade the Financial Secretary to respond to a broad Second Reading-type debate.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-13_spnew2"><b> Mr. Osborne: </b> 
 I would not dream of doing so, Mr. Deputy Speaker.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-13_para7">
I am sure that the Official Solicitor, Mr Laurence Oates, will follow our proceedings, because he will have to make some of these decisions. The Financial Secretary talked about his role in Committee, or at least hinted at it. In fact, it was a bit confusing at the time. As the Financial Secretary knows, I have a great deal of time for her. We have just been sparring against the big beasts of the political jungle together during Treasury questions&#151;her against my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), the shadow Chancellor, and me against the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In Committee, however, she kept referring to the Solicitor-General rather than the Official Solicitor. Mr. Laurence Oates is not, as far as I am aware, the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman), and I doubt that either he or she would have been too impressed. But I shall put that slip to one side.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-13_para8">
In Committee, the Financial Secretary said she was considering giving the Official Solicitor some kind of role to act on behalf of children in care. Will she expand on that a little? In her speech today, she did no more touch on what may be a very significant issue, with which I shall deal in a moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-13_para9">
Will the Official Solicitor be able to act in the circumstances suggested by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) in the debate in Committee? Those of us who served on the Committee will remember his rather lengthy dissertation on the performance of the Japanese equity market.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-13_spnew3"><b> Mr. David Laws  (Yeovil) (LD):</b> 
 It was concise.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-13_spnew4"><b> Mr. Osborne: </b> 
 That depends on the definition of &quot;lengthy&quot; and &quot;concise&quot;. It might have been concise by the hon. Gentleman&#039;s standards, but it was lengthy by everyone else&#039;s.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-13_para10">
The hon. Gentleman made the serious point that in future equities could seriously underperform because of a crisis or prolonged slump in the equity market. Under the Bill as drafted, some children in care for whom the Official Solicitor will be acting will be forced into having an equity-based child trust fund account&#151;a stakeholder account. We also discussed that in Committee. The hon. Member for Yeovil asked who, in circumstances in which there had been a prolonged equity slump, would decide on behalf of those children in care that it would be a mistake to go on using equity accounts. At a time when every other child in the country would be going into other accounts, such as cash accounts, because their 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 496</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>parents would be sensibly making the decision not to put their child&#039;s future nest egg into the equity market, children in care, who, as the Financial Secretary said, are among the most vulnerable in our society and often have the smallest financial assets, would continue to be pumped into those equity accounts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-13_para11">
Will the Official Solicitor be able to make a broad decision that, at some future point, all the children in care whom he is looking after will no longer have to have an equity-based child trust fund? That will be a huge decision for him to take, and that raises the question of whether Mr. Laurence Oates is qualified to make it. He is no doubt an extremely well qualified lawyer, but he is not a financial adviser. On what grounds is he qualified to make an investment decision on whether the account of a child in care is best invested in the equity market or the bond market? The Official Solicitor is not in a position to make a qualified judgment on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-13_para12">
That brings me to a point that the Financial Secretary made in her brief remarks. She put to the House the possibility that there might be an underperforming account provider and that children would not therefore have their child trust fund accounts placed with that provider. Again, I am not sure whether the Official Solicitor is in a position to make a judgment on whether an account provider is underperforming. Who will decide that? Will it be the Official Solicitor&#039;s responsibility to gather information from all the various financial providers and then decide that because a certain provider is underperforming, he will not allow any child trust funds of children in care to be placed with it? On what grounds can he take that decision? He is not a financial adviser and does not have financial expertise. Will the Inland Revenue take the decision and make a recommendation to the Official Solicitor? Will the Official Solicitor then be required to accept that recommendation, or will he make a judgment on the Revenue&#039;s advice? The issues are complex, and if we are going to give the Official Solicitor this important role, we need more clarification than we have so far had on exactly what role he will have in those decisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-13_para13">
Will the Official Solicitor have the power to remove accounts, or to decide not to place child trust funds with a particular provider? I remember from our discussions in Committee that the child trust funds for children in care will be allocated to providers on a rota basis. If a provider is underperforming, will it be taken off the rota, or will it still be awarded the account, only for the Official Solicitor almost immediately to remove the account from the provider?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-13_para14">
Those are important decisions, and I do not think that the Government have offered a convincing explanation on them. When I looked at the House of Lords <i>Hansard</i>, I read that Lord MacIntosh of Haringey was even briefer than the Financial Secretary in his explanation. He merely said that the Official Solicitor could


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;give instructions&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. regarding a child&#039;s trust fund account&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, 18 March 2004; Vol. 659, c. GC176.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-13_para15">
in situations where it was deemed &quot;necessary or desirable&quot;. There was no explanation of what exactly necessary or desirable meant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-13_para16">
Amendment No. 2 says that the Official Solicitor can act only for children under 16. Of course, the fact that children aged 16 and 17 are going to be able to manage 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 497</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>their accounts is my single biggest achievement since becoming a Member of Parliament. I persuaded the Government to change their mind on that, so I am not going to suggest that they undo their fine work. I will go to my grave knowing that I have changed the course of our nation. However, many children in care are there because they have, unfortunately, disabilities&#151;some physical, but others mental. It is not clear to me that every child of 16 with mental disabilities will be able to manage their child trust fund account, and that is more likely to be the case for some of the young people whom the Official Solicitor represents. What will be the position of such 16 and 17-year-olds, where the person acting for them is not a parent or relative, but the Official Solicitor? Will there be circumstances in which he will continue to manage the account when a child is 16 and 17, to make sure that they get the benefit of a child trust fund account at 18?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-13_para17">
It seems strange that that age has been written into the legislation, with no explanation of what will happen. I suppose that that also applies to some children who are not being looked after by the Official Solicitor. Since the Government changed their mind on reducing the age from 18 to 16 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, I have not seen what they propose to do with 16 and 17-year-olds who are not capable of managing their own accounts, or who they intend will act on behalf of those young people. However, that is of particular relevance to this debate because of the role of the Official Solicitor in the matter.

</p>

<p><a name="40513-14_spnew0"><b> Mr. Laws: </b> 
 I share the pleasure of the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) at getting back to the details of the Child Trust Funds Bill, which are almost fun in comparison with the Finance Bill that we are dealing with in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para0">
Of all the groups of amendments that we are debating today, this is the most important. I hope that you will therefore bear with me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, while I set out some of our concerns about the Government&#039;s amendments and their legislation in this area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para1">
As the hon. Member for Tatton made clear, this was a major issue for debate in Committee. It was clear that the Government wanted, correctly and understandably, to ensure that children in care had access to child trust fund accounts and the Minister wanted to ensure that the accounts of children in care had as much upside potential in terms of asset growth as those of individuals not in care. However, we raised in Committee the question of what would happen if the moneys invested by the Government in the accounts of children in care were put into equity-based products, as appears to be their intention. What would happen if the equity market was performing extremely poorly, in a way to which parents might respond by withdrawing money from equity-based accounts and putting it into cash or bond accounts? Children who have their accounts managed by the Government acting in loco parentis might lose out and, in future, hold the Government to account for the poor performance of their investment.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 498</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40513-14_time0"><h5>2 pm</h5>

</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para2">
The hon. Member for Tatton mentioned what I thought was rather a concise summary that I gave in Committee of the experience in other countries, including Japan, that have had long-term bear markets. It may be difficult to anticipate that happening in the current circumstances in the United Kingdom, where we are used to the stock market and equity prices rising over a long time, but even several months after we debated this issue, the stock indices in Japan are still around the 10,000 mark&#151;almost as little as 25 per cent. of what they were. In other words, there has been a 70 to 75 per cent. decline in the Japanese stock market since 1987&#150;88, when I left university, and that could happen in the United Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para3">
No doubt the Minister could not envisage that happening on her watch, or that of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but I imagine that even she could envisage it happening if a Conservative Government came back to power. Perhaps she can imagine a long-term bear market at that stage that would raise exactly the concerns that the hon. Member for Tatton described, with the Government merrily putting money into equity-based child trust fund accounts on behalf of children in care, but then discovering that those accounts were going down dramatically in value.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para4">
The question, therefore&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="40513-14_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Order. The hon. Gentleman sought my indulgence while he sketched the background to his remarks, but I have to tell him that, based on what I am now hearing, my indulgence is beginning to drain away.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-14_spnew1"><b> Mr. Laws: </b> 
 Then I have come to exactly the right point in my comments, Mr. Deputy Speaker, because I am now going to talk about the way in which the Government have sought to deal with the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para5">
Initially, the Financial Secretary was unwilling to acknowledge that there was a problem. We had some fun in Committee, perhaps at my expense, with some of the points that I have just made. However, on 13 January she showed that she might be beginning to understand our concerns. She said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;There are some quite difficult issues to resolve. We have been in consultation across Government about the best way to provide for children in care. I am determined to ensure that children in care have the maximum opportunity that we can offer them through this policy.&quot; &#151;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A</i>, 13 January 2004; c. 100.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para6">
She also undertook later in the debate to engage with the Official Solicitor and others to seek to clarify the Government&#039;s policy and deal with the risk of children in care being disadvantaged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para7">
There was a further modest development of the policy on the Floor of the House on 3 February when the Financial Secretary said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We have not yet finalised the possible role of the Official Solicitor, with whom we are still negotiating, but I can confirm that we have discussed the need for the Official Solicitor to consider whether the account was performing poorly&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para8">
That was a major breakthrough in the Government&#039;s policy. She went on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The hon. Gentleman&#039;s concerns about an equity market slump or liquidity crisis that have driven him to make his many and varied comments would be the sorts of concerns that the Official Solicitor, if they were to accept that role, should consider&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 3 February 2004; Vol. 417, c. 713.]</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 499</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para9">
The hon. Member for Tatton went on to refer to comments made in another place on 18 March, when Lord McIntosh spent what looks like less than a minute explaining the policy that led to the Lords amendments being tabled. He summed up by saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I hope the Committee will feel that this is an uncontroversial addition to the existing provisions&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, 18 March 2004; Vol. 659, c. GC176.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para10">
There seemed to be no debate on the issue, which is a pity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para11">
This may be an uncontroversial move by the Government in the sense that they are trying to deal with the problems that we discussed in Committee, but as the hon. Member for Tatton said, there are some major questions about whether their well-meaning intentions in tabling the amendments have been properly thought through. We need answers to a number of questions from the Financial Secretary and I hope that she will be able to give them today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para12">
I shall run through some of the major questions that arise from the suggestion that the Official Solicitor&#151;who, so far as I am aware, has no particular market expertise&#151;will act as some kind of investment adviser, presumably unpaid, to children in care for whom the Government act in loco parentis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para13">
First, will the Official Solicitor have the option of opening accounts that are not equity-based, such as cash-based accounts? The Minister has said in Committee and elsewhere that she wants all the accounts for children in care to be equity-based stakeholder accounts. I understand her desire to ensure that children in care can benefit from any buoyancy in the stock market compared with cash-based accounts or bond-based markets, but does she acknowledge that, in some circumstances, the Official Solicitor might not want to open equity-based stakeholder accounts, but cash or bond-based accounts instead? Will that be possible?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para14">
Secondly, will the Official Solicitor be able to move money out of equity-based accounts that have been opened for children and put it in cash accounts if he thinks that that would be sensible in the prevailing market conditions? Will he be able to do that the other way round and turn a cash-based account into an equity-based one?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para15">
How will the Official Solicitor make those judgments? In my earlier career, I worked in the financial markets for quite a long time. I can tell the Minister that, when markets go down a long way, it is easy for people to panic and, having believed that markets were about to reverse themselves, eventually change their minds&#151;often at the lowest point of the market&#151;and switch into other assets, only to discover that the market then goes back up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para16">
How will the Official Solicitor make judgments about market conditions and investment rates and how will he assess the performance of the accounts that he is considering switching in and out of? Will he be advised by some other body within Government, the Financial Services Authority, the Treasury, or some other organisation, before making those important decisions?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para17">
What legal recourse will there be for children whose accounts are managed in that way if the Official Solicitor gets it wrong? What will happen at the age of 18, or even 16, when a child looks back on the experience of having 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 500</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>his or her account managed by the Official Solicitor, only to discover that, every time the equity markets plunged, he had worried terribly that he would be criticised for inactivity and had switched all the money out of equity into bonds at the low point in the market, that the market had then rallied, the Official Solicitor had switched into gilts and that gilts then declined? The Official Solicitor is not necessarily financially trained and one can imagine that he could make an utter hash of the job. What would stop the children involved seeking legal recourse for the losses that they had sustained?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para18">
Will there be any restriction on the Official Solicitor&#039;s freedom to move money in and out of accounts, or will his powers be as strong or as weak as those of a parent managing their own children&#039;s trust fund accounts? In other words, will the Official Solicitor act fully in loco parentis or will he be restricted in comparison with parents? Is there a memorandum of understanding between the Official Solicitor and the Treasury, setting out the terms on which the Official Solicitor will take such difficult decisions? If so, will it be published so that we can see the terms and put pressure on the Government to change them if they are wrong?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-14_para19">
Finally, as the hon. Member for Tatton asked, what are the implications of the fact that the Official Solicitor can, essentially, pull the plug on a financial provider that appears to be doing a bad job with its investment accounts? What are the implications of the Official Solicitor moving&#151;presumably all&#151;the accounts in the name of that financial provider out of the provider&#039;s name and into that of another? Presumably, if there were concerns about how a particular provider was managing such accounts, the Official Solicitor might move a whole swathe of accounts at the same time. What signal would that send to the financial markets about that provider&#039;s competence? In those circumstances, would it not be very difficult for the Official Solicitor to take such action? He or she would be regarded as almost censuring a financial market body as a consequence of its incompetence. Essentially, that would amount to a vote of no confidence in that provider.

<p><a name="40513-15_spnew0"><b> Mr. George Osborne: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is developing a crucial point. Has he considered the possibility whereby the Inland Revenue thinks that the provider is up to the job and continues to award child trust funds to it, but the Official Solicitor takes the view that it is not up to the job? That would lead to real confusion.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-15_spnew1"><b> Mr. Laws: </b>

I hope that the Financial Secretary does not feel that I am being ungrateful. I appreciate that the amendments are a step towards addressing the concerns that we raised in Committee, but we are sceptical as to whether the Official Solicitor can do the job alone. The Government are placing too much responsibility on the Official Solicitor in respect of areas in which he or she might not be competent. We want to be reassured that the Official Solicitor will not be expected to do this job alone. At the very least, the FSA, Her Majesty&#039;s

<br>&nbsp;<br>Treasury or some other part of government must surely have a role to play in advising the Official Solicitor. I hope that we hear from the Government on that point and that we can engage constructively with them in the months to come to ensure that we get this right. Although they now understand the problems and have introduced amendments in an effort to address them, they have yet to find the right solutions.

<p><a name="40513-15_spnew2"><b> Mr. Michael Weir  (Angus) (SNP):</b> 
 I have a strange feeling of d&#233;j&#224; vu, in that this debate sounds very much like the one that took place in Committee on this very issue. As I recall, the exposition of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) at one point touched on William of Orange and the Glorious Revolution, although that may have been part of some horrible nightmare.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-15_spnew3"><b> Mr. George Osborne: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the big difference between today&#039;s debate and that in Committee is that the Government now agree with what the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) is saying? When we discussed this issue in Committee, the Financial Secretary did not agree.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-15_spnew4"><b> Mr. Weir: </b> 
 That is a fair point; indeed, there has been considerable movement on the part of the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-15_para1">
Despite what I said about the similarity of the two debates, I do agree with many of the observations made by the hon. Member for Yeovil. I should point out that I have no experience whatever of the work of the Official Solicitor, but before being elected to this place I was a practising solicitor, so I have had some experience of the accountant of court in Scotland. I have grave reservations about whether the accountant of court will be able to deal with child trust funds in Scotland. In my experience, the accountant of court has an overseeing role rather than a proactive one, looking at estates that are being dealt with by curators and the like. Frankly, and at the risk of getting into trouble with the legal establishment in Scotland, dealing with the accountant of court was a somewhat bureaucratic experience.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-15_para2">
We need to deal with child trust funds in an intrinsically different way. So far as children in care are concerned, for the most part, the sums involved will be relatively small. Regular payments might have been made in some cases, but my guess is that the majority of funds will consist of the basic trust fund. There could be quite a lot of relatively small funds and I question whether the accountant of court or the Official Solicitor&#151;as I said, I do not know whether the Official Solicitor performs a similar function&#151;would have the staff or expertise to deal with such matters proactively. In my experience, the accountant of court&#039;s organisation is very conservative. There is a danger that such trust funds will simply be left sitting and that no one will look at how individual funds are performing and whether they are in the best interests of the children in question.

I was intrigued to hear the Financial Secretary say that the Official Solicitor will react to the religious or ethical views of the child. How will that be done? Will the child phone the Official Solicitor and say, &quot;I don&#039;t

Given the number of children who might be in care at a given time, I suspect that a considerable burden will be placed on the Official Solicitor, who will not have the resources to deal properly with the problem.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-15_spnew5"><b> Mr. Osborne: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has hit on an excellent point, on which I did not touch. Does he agree that there is a question about whether the Official Solicitor is required to find out the child&#039;s religious and ethical concerns? Will he be required to write to the child or will the child have to find out the Official Solicitor&#039;s address and write to him?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-15_spnew6"><b> Mr. Weir: </b> 
 That is an excellent point, because the situation has not been made clear. This issue needs to be addressed if such a requirement is to be part of the Official Solicitor&#039;s remit. Interestingly, a parent who is operating the account on the child&#039;s behalf might not necessarily have to take into account the child&#039;s religious or ethical views, which might differ from those of the parent. Such accounts would be intrinsically different.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-15_para4">
There are various objections to the proposal and they have been noted. I have tried hard to think of an alternative, but I admit to failure. I cannot think of an easy solution, unless we are to set up a completely new department. The hon. Member for Yeovil suggested that the FSA and the Treasury provide advice, but there is an intrinsic problem with that idea. To a large extent, they are regulatory organisations, and if such organisations were to advise another part of government about investment opportunities for young citizens, that could lead to extreme difficulties and create a legal minefield. By comparison, the prospect of a child suing the Official Solicitor or accountant of court pales into insignificance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-15_para5">
I am not entirely clear about what will happen when a child is taken into care. If there is an order putting a child into care&#151;I do not know what happens in England, but in Scotland the matter is dealt with through a children&#039;s panel or a court&#151;will the child trust fund automatically be transferred to the Official Solicitor or accountant of court, or will a separate function be required for the transfer? Presumably, if the trust fund is already up and running when the child is taken into care, it is controlled at that point by a parent, or by someone with parental responsibility. I assume that that matter will be dealt with in the regulations, but I should be obliged if the Financial Secretary would address that point.

<br>&nbsp;<br>concerns raised by Opposition Members. The hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) described the sales regime as the missing piece of the jigsaw. He is correct to say that that was initially expected in November, but the Financial Services Authority decided to do a second round of market testing to ensure that the sales regime was appropriate and adequate to sell stakeholder products across the full range&#151;not just the child trust fund. It is important that that is done correctly and appropriately, and that those decisions are not rushed. We are in close contact with providers who either intend to or are thinking about entering the market for the CTF. Most providers say that they intend to offer child trust funds directly to people, so they would be unaffected by the precise nature of the sales regime on that account.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-15_para6">
Turning to the role of the Official Solicitor, I would first like to point out that the number of children involved is not very great. It is certainly not the total number of children in care. I know that the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir) is interested in the circumstances in which children have their trust fund managed by the Official Solicitor. I can tell him and other hon. Members in their places today that the Official Solicitor takes charge of an account where there is absolutely no one with parental responsibility for that child.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-15_para7">
It applies where a child does not have face-to-face contact with their parents and when it is part of the care plan that the child will live permanently away from home. It applies where a child has had contact with their parents terminated, where a child&#039;s parents are mentally incapacitated, where a child&#039;s only parent is in prison for a significant period of time or where a child is looked after because they have been abandoned by both parents and there is no prospect of reunification with the parents for the foreseeable future. The vast majority of children in care will have someone with parental responsibility to manage their accounts.

<p><a name="40513-16_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 It is extremely difficult to produce an accurate assessment of the numbers involved, but I think that we are talking of about 2,000 cases rather than the total number of children in care. The Official Solicitor is very clear about the appropriateness of undertaking this role. He already has responsibility for looking after the funds of children in different categories and the provisions fit neatly into that current role.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-16_para0">
To answer some of the questions raised by the hon. Members for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) and for Tatton, the responsibilities of the Official Solicitor will include: monitoring the performance and suitability of the CTF account; moving the account to a different provider or a different type of account, if appropriate; keeping the child informed of any movements made; engaging with the child, as necessary; and relinquishing the management role either when someone appropriate with parental responsibility for the child becomes available or when the child reaches the age of 16. The hon. Member for Tatton asked about the position applicable to a child who may be mentally incapacitated 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 504</b>

 I must say that, the longer the Financial Secretary explains the job, the more difficult and undesirable it sounds. What guidance has she given to the Official Solicitor about how active he should be in managing these accounts in circumstances where markets are very volatile? Is it envisaged that the Official Solicitor is likely to be involved in managing these accounts, or would he or she do so only under crisis conditions?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-16_spnew3"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I am afraid that I cannot answer the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question in full at this stage. We are currently involved in detailed negotiations with the Official Solicitor regarding the precise criteria that he will have to consider in monitoring the performance and deciding whether to switch providers for CTF accounts. I should point out that the Inland Revenue would open a child in care&#039;s account and at that point the Official Solicitor would take over the management of it. That is when the Official Solicitor would have to decide whether to continue with the existing provider or switch to a different one. As I am sure the hon. Gentleman would agree, monitoring the performance of the fund is a vital role.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-16_spnew4"><b> Mr. Weir: </b> 
 The Financial Secretary has talked a great deal about the Official Solicitor, but can she tell us what discussions she has had with the accountant of court? Although that seems to be Scotland&#039;s nearest equivalent to the Official Solicitor, I know from experience that the accountant of court does not normally undertake this sort of work. Has the Financial Secretary discussed these issues with the accountant of court&#039;s department?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-16_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I can certainly assure the hon. Gentleman that we have had discussions on similar lines with the accountant of court in Scotland. Indeed, the Scottish Executive recommended the accountant of court as the office with the closest relationship to the Official Solicitor in England. However, those discussions are still ongoing. Given that the regulations are currently being drawn up, I can undertake that, when they are published shortly after the full recommendations are set out to the House&#151;probably towards the end of this month or perhaps the beginning of June&#151;I will provide a full commentary on the Official Solicitor&#039;s role in these matters. That will describe the circumstances under which the Official Solicitor would take advice and deal with the sort of concerns mentioned by the hon. Member for Yeovil.

 I beg to move amendment (a) thereto.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-16_para2">
Lords amendment No. 7 is rather curious and a little troubling. It gives the Government the power to make payments to children in custody. Those children would, as I understand it, otherwise be excluded because no one is in receipt of child benefit on their behalf.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-16_para3">
The amendment is curious for two reasons. First, it amends clause 10, which deals with further payments rather than initial payments. As I understand it, in some rare cases, children of 14, 15 or 16 may have a child trust fund opened for them for the first time. Such children may be in custody and, under the current legislation, I am unsure whether they would receive an initial contribution or whether they could have a CTF. The Government may want to correct that omission later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-16_para4">
Secondly, the amendment is curious because, in all the consultation documents and in Committee debates, the Government said that they were planning to make further payments into CTF accounts only when the child reaches the age of seven.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-16_para5">
Even in the Home Secretary&#039;s Britain there are not many newborn babies in custody. I do not imagine that there are any seven-year olds there either. On the face of it, therefore, the amendment is pointless, as it is about paying money to children aged seven who are in custody, even though there are no such children. However, I suppose that the Government want to have the option of making further payments to children aged over 12, which is when children can be in custody.


<a name="40513-16_time0"><h5>2.30 pm</h5>

</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-16_para6">
I hope that the Financial Secretary will say whether there are plans to make a further payment into CTFs at the age of 14 or 16. In the initial consultation document, it was envisaged that payments would be made at three different ages. I cannot remember whether those ages were five, 11 and 16 or five, 11 and 14, but the proposal 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 506</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>was something along those lines. Perhaps the Government are reverting to their original plan. I suspect that all will depend on the electoral timetable prevailing at the time the children reach the relevant ages.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-16_para7">
However, amendment (a) addresses a more serious point. The Home Secretary has stoked up an endless debate about whether more children should be in custody. Children who commit what most of us would regard as fairly serious crimes are not put in prison, but are given community service orders and so on. By definition, children who are in prison have committed very serious crimes, and the House needs to pause and consider whether it is really a good idea to give them an unconditional cash windfall at some future date. What sort of message will that send to such children about punishment and reward in our society, and about what society thinks of their behaviour?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-16_para8">
I do not say that such children should be excluded totally from receiving payments. I also recognise that the Financial Secretary might contend that my amendment could lead to some rough justice. For example, a child who is not in prison on his or her 16th birthday might have been in prison for three years before that, whereas a child might happen to be in prison for three or four days just when his or her 16th birthday comes around. That child would therefore lose out. I agree that that would not be fair, and so amendment (a) is conditional in two respects.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-16_para9">
First, the amendment would merely give the Government a conditional power to introduce regulations. That means that they could choose to take up the power, or not. Secondly, it simply suggests that, before money is paid to a child in custody, there needs to be a report from the person who is legally responsible for the child&#151;the prison governor, or someone of that ilk&#151;that attests to the child&#039;s good conduct over the previous year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-16_para10">
The amendment would mean that bad behaviour was not rewarded, and that the Government would not be sending out mixed messages. The prison authorities could use the provision as an incentive to encourage good conduct, and as a way of steering troubled children on to a more responsible path.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-16_para11">
That seems a matter of common sense. The House should consider the alternative. A child who commits a crime that is serious enough to cause him or her to be sent to prison might be so poorly behaved in custody that the person legally responsible is unable to attest to his or her good conduct. That child might also have had various privileges withdrawn in custody, or been subject to disciplinary action. However, he or she will suddenly get a letter from the Inland Revenue saying, &quot;Congratulations on reaching the age of 16, here&#039;s a cheque for &#163;100.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-16_para12">
That would undermine the work of the prison authorities, and make life much more difficult for them. In some ways, such a letter could cut across what they are trying to achieve, and I can imagine prison governors getting extremely frustrated. Just when a governor wants to insist on a certain form of behaviour from a child in custody, that would be undermined by the Inland Revenue unknowingly sending a cheque. The child would pick up the cheque, wave it in the governor&#039;s 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 507</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>face and say, &quot;I&#039;ve just got a cheque for &#163;100. Obviously, some people in the Government do not think that I am behaving badly.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-16_para13">
Amendment (a) is a perfectly reasonable and conditional provision. It would give the Government the option to take regulatory powers, but would not insist on that. It merely says that children in custody should receive a Government handout from the taxpayer only if they behave well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-16_para14">
I think that that is a pretty new Labour idea. It fits in with what the Home Secretary is doing&#151;with parenting orders, child curfews and so on&#151;to encourage good behaviour in children. Moreover, I emphasise that the amendment refers to children who have ended up in custody.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-16_para15">
I hope that the Financial Secretary will accept the amendment. If not, I shall press it to a Division.

<p><a name="40513-17_spnew0"><b> Mr. Laws: </b> 
 We support amendment No. 7, which deals with an anomaly in the original Bill, but we are not tempted by amendment (a), proposed by the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne). He invited us to believe that it would unite new Labour and the Conservative party, and that is good enough reason for Liberal Democrat Members to be suspicious of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-17_para0">
There are various practical problems with amendment (a). First, how likely is it that a young child who had committed enough crimes to be in prison would be deterred from similar behaviour by the fact that a payment would not be made to his or her CTF account&#151;especially given that children cannot access those accounts until they are 18? I think that it is very unlikely that that would influence behaviour in any way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-17_para1">
Secondly, the amendment would be an enormously administratively complex and bureaucratic measure to enforce. For that reason, I am surprised that the Conservative party have proposed it. It could also create further anomalies between those young people who had committed crimes and been given custodial sentences, and those who had been given non-custodial sentences. Moreover, as Lord McIntosh explained in another place, it could create anomalies in respect of young people who had committed a crime but who were not in prison at the time of the reporting period, which is when the sanction proposed in the amendment would be implemented.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-17_para2">
On top of that, the amendment could add a further penalty to the sentence being served by a young person. That does not seem sensible. Also, the Government&#039;s policy on CTF accounts is designed to give assets to children to help them, when they reach adulthood, to settle down, find employment and so on. To take that money away from children who&#151;whether or not they have committed offences&#151;are almost by definition the most vulnerable does not seem especially sensible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-17_para3">
For all those reasons, I am afraid that Liberal Democrat Members support the Government&#039;s position on this matter, and not the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Tatton.

<b>13 May 2004 : Column 508</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-17_para4">
As originally drafted, the Bill would have prevented payments being made to the CTF accounts of children held in legal custody. Child benefit is not paid for those children and the award of child benefit is the key eligibility requirement for CTF payments. As the hon. Member for Tatton pointed out, we have left ourselves the flexibility to decide whether there should be age-related payments above the age of seven in future. Should a Government decide to make payments to children at any age over 12, those children who are held in custody on the relevant birthday would not receive the payments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-17_para5">
We amended the Bill in the Lords to treat children in custody as entitled to child benefit purely for the purposes of the child trust fund. The amendment supports the view that children in custody should not receive those payments unless a responsible person informs the Inland Revenue that the child has been well behaved for the year prior to the relevant birthday.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-17_spnew2"><b> Mr. George Osborne: </b>

</p>








<p><a name="40513-17_spnew3"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I do not envisage any circumstances in which that scenario will apply. Children who move to the United Kingdom after the age of 12 will either get child benefit if eligible, and therefore access to the child trust fund, or, if they go straight into custody, the child benefit will not be awarded and a child trust fund account will not be available to them until they have left custody. That is an extremely unusual case and I cannot envisage a situation in which we would want to open a child trust fund for the first time for a child who is in custody.

<a name="40513-18_head0"><h3 align=center>Armed Forces Personnel</h3>





<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That this House do now adjourn.&#151;<i>[Derek Twigg.]</i>




<a name="40513-18_time0"><h5>2.55 pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="40513-18_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence  (Mr. Adam Ingram): </b> 
 This debate is about armed forces personnel issues. When we talk about personnel, we should always remember that it is not an abstract: we are considering the remarkable men and women who make up our armed forces. They are sons and daughters, husbands and wives, mothers and fathers; they are the people who are prepared to put their lives on the line in defence of this country and to give other nations the freedom to enjoy the human rights that have been denied them by repressive regimes&#151;regimes which have been tolerated for too long because there are those who argue that it is always better to talk and never to act; to prevaricate while millions perish. It is into such cauldrons that we place our armed forces.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-18_para0">
As we have seen in Kosovo, Bosnia, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and now Iraq, our armed forces consistently deliver as a force for good. It is against that backcloth and in that context that I want to open today&#039;s debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-18_para1">
I suggest that there is a vast difference between what we do in this place and what our armed forces are doing in troubled parts of the world in the most difficult circumstances. Our armed forces are not automatons&#151;unthinking and uncaring. They have the same standards and values upon which this nation built its reputation. Some of them make mistakes, just like the rest of us. A very few of them do things that might not make us proud: after all, the men and women of Her Majesty&#039;s armed forces are human. At all times we must ask them to achieve the very highest of standards, knowing that they can never be perfect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-18_para2">
It is deeply disturbing that there are those who are prepared casually to vilify our armed forces without first establishing the facts. It is one thing to have a go at Ministers; we know the business we are about. We have been asked by the Prime Minister to perform our public duties, and we try to do that to the best of our abilities. We are judged in the public spotlight. Ministers at least have the chance to answer back. Our servicemen and women do not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-18_para3">
The childhood adage has it that words will never hurt. But I think we must reconsider that, because the words that some have been using about our armed forces hurt them. The public debate has been unbalanced by some individuals who lay claim to sole ownership of human rights; who convert any allegation, true or otherwise, into fact; and who judge and condemn our armed forces without giving them the benefit of explaining events.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-18_para4">
We have laws. Our armed forces are subject to the rule of law, and it is within that system that their behaviour should, and will, be dealt with. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence has said, two cases are at an advanced stage. In those cases and in any others that may follow, justice will be done and will be seen to be done, because one fundamental principle of human rights is that people are innocent until proven guilty. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 513</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Whatever demands we place upon our personnel, above and beyond those of civilian life, we do not deprive them of that right.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-18_spnew0"><b> Joan Ruddock  (Lewisham, Deptford) (Lab):</b> 
 My right hon. Friend will know that the report of the International Committee of the Red Cross referred not just to the treatment of detainees; it also talked about the brutality of some arrests and about a defective administration system that did not allow for proper notification of the families of those who had &quot;disappeared&quot;. Can my right hon. Friend give us some comfort as to whether those matters have been rectified, in the interests both of the human rights of Iraqi citizens and of the safety and security of our armed forces?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-18_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 As my hon. Friend will be aware, I cannot talk about the detail of the ICRC report and I shall come to the reasons for that later on. However, she raises a matter of general concern, which I shall also touch on later in my speech. It goes without saying that wherever alleged wrongdoing is identified, appropriate action will be taken, whether that involves the need for renewed instructions or specific instructions, or for criminal prosecution. I can give my hon. Friend those assurances. The ICRC is currently carrying out a subsequent investigation, and we are awaiting a report on that subsequent examination of all that we do. I will mention more about that report in passing further on in my speech, but we await the outcome of the ICRC inquiry.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-18_spnew2"><b> Several hon. Members </b> 
 <i>rose&#151;</i>
</p>








<p><a name="40513-18_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Hold on a moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-18_para5">
But I will not discuss that report in detail. I want to talk about the background to it, and I will come to that. I suggest to hon. Members who may want to intervene on the subject of the ICRC report that they let me explain the position on that, and perhaps they can then intervene. I want to make a bit of progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-18_para6">
Before I turn to the main elements of the way in which we seek within the Ministry of Defence to honour our responsibilities to our armed forces personnel, I should like to deal with the issues that have been raised concerning what I said, and what I meant by what I said, when I gave my statement to the House on 4 May.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-18_spnew4"><b> Mr. John Redwood  (Wokingham) (Con):</b> 
 Will the Minister give way?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-18_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 No, not at present.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-18_para7">
Much has been made of my statement that I had not, at the time of speaking to the House, received a report by the International Committee of the Red Cross in which it expressed concerns about coalition treatment of detainees. Some have construed that to be a denial that I had seen any communication whatsoever about alleged wrongdoings by British troops.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-18_para8">
The word &quot;report&quot; has a specific meaning to me. A report is something that is properly researched, properly constructed and properly presented. The interim ICRC report of 10 February satisfied those criteria, and when 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 514</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I said I had not received it, that was a correct and honest answer. That does not mean to say that I was unaware of the issues and the actions being taken.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-18_para9">
Let me make it clear that we co-operate fully with the ICRC. It is offered full access to the detention facilities that we operate and each concern that it brings to the attention of the Government is treated very seriously and investigated fully.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-18_para10">
A second report from the ICRC, a working paper&#151;this is what I was referring to earlier&#151;specific to UK detention facilities has also now been received. It, too, will be examined very closely, and where it makes recommendations, we will deal with them. However, I should tell the House that the report describes UK detention facilities as &quot;fairly good&quot; and notes that we have responded to the earlier concerns. I hope that that deals with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock). That, I suggest, contrasts with some of the lurid statements of recent days.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-18_para11">
I should also comment on the suggestions that we should publish ICRC reports. We will not do so without the express permission of the ICRC. I would have hoped that right hon. and hon. Members appreciated that the valuable work of the ICRC depends upon the confidentiality of its work. It is more than a matter of bad reports or good reports. Without the principle of confidentiality, the ICRC might lose access to detainees in countries where they are most at risk&#151;and not only that: it could put ICRC personnel in danger.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-18_spnew6"><b> Several hon. Members </b> 
 <i>rose&#151;</i>
</p>








<p><a name="40513-18_spnew7"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I may be dealing with the point about which hon. Members are concerned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-18_para12">
The deaths mentioned by Amnesty International in letters to me fall into a different category. Amnesty does not have access to UK detention facilities, but it has commented on a number of issues. I understand from press and media reports that Amnesty has said that it submitted a dossier to me in October last year. Some may call them reports. I received only one document from Amnesty last October. It is hardly a dossier. <i>[Interruption.]</i> It is a letter just over a page in length, dealing with one incident. In my reply of 11 November, I set out the details of the investigation that was already under way into the death in custody of Baha Mousa, also known as Baha al-Maliki. I do not know whether the House would like to me read out that letter, but let me say that it is not a dossier, as some have alleged, nor is it a report.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-18_spnew8"><b> Mr. Redwood: </b> 
 When, last September, the Government rightly decided to ban the hooding of prisoners, what else did they consider by way of maltreatment of prisoners, and what evidence did they have before them at that point on the basis of which to make that very sensible decision?
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040513/debtext/40513-19.htm"/>







<p><a name="40513-19_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman should be aware&#151;if he has followed this with due interest, rather than for the sake of party political point scoring&#151;that these are very serious matters. As we know, the operational chain of command identified that the ICRC report was received by permanent joint headquarters 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 515</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and appropriate action was then taken once those matters were brought to the attention of the operational command in theatre. So a decision was taken to cease immediately. Three issues were raised in the ICRC report&#151;that is in the public domain&#151;and we were already acting on them before we received that report so many months later.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-19_spnew1"><b> Adam Price  (East Carmarthen and Dinefwr) (PC):</b> 
 Will the Minister give way?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-19_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Hold on a moment. It is interesting that no one is particularly interested in me reading out this particular report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-19_para0">
So the central charge is that I received reports about abuse in detention and did nothing about it. That simply does not stack up.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-19_spnew3"><b> Richard Younger-Ross  (Teignbridge) (LD):</b> 
 I wonder whether the Minister can clarify a point. Yesterday, in response to the question from my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), the Prime Minister was asked whether he had seen a copy of the report. He answered that he had not needed to see a copy of it because it related to British troops and that that was being dealt with. The Minister has said that he is aware of the details of these reports, although he had not seen the report itself. Was he therefore aware of the abuses that have been alleged in American detention centres? If so, has he raised those issues with the US authorities? Will he confirm that the impact of what is happening in America has a direct bearing on the security of our forces on the ground in Iraq?

<p><a name="40513-19_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I would have hoped for a better intervention than that, but the hon. Gentleman should read exactly what the Prime Minister said. He said that the allegations that had been made and the issues that had been raised had been dealt with. That is exactly the position. The three issues raised by the ICRC&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Does the hon. Gentleman want an answer? The ICRC had reported in February about matters that already had been taken on board within theatre, and the Royal Military Police had immediately commenced an investigation into one of the issues raised.

<p>
<a name="40513-19_para1">
The hon. Gentleman asks whether I should be concerned about what other coalition forces do. We are each concerned about what the other does in those circumstances, but it is not my job to answer for any other of the 30 nations that are there. I am here to answer, on behalf of Her Majesty&#039;s armed forces, about what they have done, what they have allegedly done and how we then conduct our business in those theatres of operation in which we are operating.

<p><a name="40513-19_spnew10"><b> Dr. Andrew Murrison  (Westbury) (Con):</b> 
 The Minister will be aware that British forces have been used to transport Iraqi detainees to American interrogators. Does he not believe, given the contents of this and other reports, that we have a duty to make sure that the facilities and treatment in those centres are reasonable? If he does, at what point did he stop the use of British personnel for transporting Iraqi detainees into the clutches of the Americans?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-19_spnew11"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The reality is that we established our own facility, which was subject to further examination by the ICRC. As we have our own facility for that purpose, the use of British personnel stopped at the time it was established. That is an important aspect of the way in which we take responsibility for detainees and the way in which we interact with the community in Iraq.

<p><a name="40513-19_spnew13"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I think that I should first deal with some of the central charges.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-19_para3">
Matters have been raised outside the House by Amnesty International, which has claimed that it passed a dossier to me. All the allegations that I have seen are about that, and I repeat that I have dealt with that case. It was not a dossier&#151;it was one case and it is still under investigation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-19_para4">
I suggested that the central charge that we had received reports about abuse in detention and done nothing about them does not stack up. There can be no more graphic illustration of those dangers than the photographs published in the <i>Daily Mirror</i> on 1 May 2004 purporting, and claimed by the <i>Daily Mirror</i>, to show the physical abuse of an Iraqi at the hands of two British soldiers. Right hon. and hon. Members will understand that the investigation is a matter entirely for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 517</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Royal Military Police special investigations branch. Ministers cannot, do not, and should not interfere. As the investigation continues into the very serious allegations made, it would be inappropriate for the details of the evidence that emerges to be disclosed.

<p><a name="40513-19_spnew14"><b> Mr. Gordon Prentice  (Pendle) (Lab):</b> 
 Will the Minister give way?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-19_spnew15"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Once I have finished my explanation I shall certainly give way to my hon. Friend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-19_para5">
If the investigation results in criminal proceedings, the evidence will become public at that stage, just as would be the case in criminal proceedings in the ordinary UK courts. Whether any prior disclosure of evidence is made is quite properly a matter for the RMP, which acts with the benefit of legal advice. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence said in his statement to the House of Commons on Monday that the special investigation branch believe that there are strong indications to suggest that these photographs are not genuine. I said on 4 May that we had to treat the photographs at face value. That value has changed. Investigations are now proceeding on this basis: these pictures were categorically not taken in Iraq. Moreover, I can tell the House not only that that is the opinion of the SIB investigators but that it has been independently corroborated. The truck in which the photographs were taken was never in Iraq. I know that right hon. and hon. Members would like to hear more detail about the evidence, but I hope that they appreciate that those involved may have committed criminal offences under military law, which are the proper subject of ongoing investigations by the RMP. Accordingly, right hon. and hon. Members will understand why it would be inappropriate to say anything more about the emerging evidence.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-19_spnew16"><b> Mr. Andrew Miller  (Ellesmere Port and Neston) (Lab):</b> 
 I have an interest in this matter, as the Cheshire Regiment is currently in Iraq and, as a result of the publication of those photographs, is at risk. Does the investigation go so far as to allow for a possible prosecution of those involved in the chain between the Army personnel alleged to be involved and the newspaper? Indeed, could it bring about the possible prosecution of the editor of the newspaper?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-19_spnew17"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 That is not part of my ministerial responsibility for the armed forces. I am certain that the editor is not subject to military law&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Some may think that he should be. Given my hon.

<p><a name="40513-20_spnew0"><b> Mr. Keith Simpson  (Mid-Norfolk) (Con):</b> 
 Can the Minister confirm one thing? He stated categorically that the photographs were effectively fakes. Nevertheless, it was intimated by the <i>Daily Mirror</i> that they could be a re-enactment. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am trying to be helpful 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 518</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>so that the Minister can clarify whether there is investigation into whether or not there was a re-enactment.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-20_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I shall come on in more detail to the way in which we can progress the investigation.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-20_spnew2"><b> Chris Bryant  (Rhondda) (Lab):</b> 
 If, as the Minister says, the photographs were re-enactions or faked, is not the shocking thing that they seem to suggest that there has been systematic abuse? Nobody has yet advanced any evidence of systematic abuse by British soldiers of any kind.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-20_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a good point. They may not have advanced any evidence, but I am sure that he appreciates that some people have inferred that systematic abuse has taken place. Unquestionably, that is not the case. There is no question but that we are dealing with individual incidents, all of which are under investigation. If any new incidents come to light they will be subject to the same intense investigation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-20_para0">
The special investigation branch&#039;s priority continues to be identifying the individuals referred to by the <i>Daily Mirror</i> as soldiers A and B. When breaking the story on 1 May, the <i>Daily Mirror</i> claimed that those soldiers had witnessed mistreatment of prisoners in Iraq. Indeed, it even said that one of them took part in such mistreatment. We have consistently said that allegations will be investigated and that, if justified, appropriate action will be taken. There has been an extensive and intensive operation by the RMP in respect of the <i>Daily Mirror</i>&#039;s claims involving many investigators. SIB resources inevitably have had to be diverted from other tasks.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-20_spnew4"><b> Mr. David Borrow  (South Ribble) (Lab):</b> 
 It is reported that the <i>Daily Mirror</i> is co-operating fully with the Ministry of Defence. As part of that full co-operation has it given details of names, places and times in the incidents that form the basis of the allegations? Can my right hon. Friend tell us how much officer time been wasted on that wild goose chase?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-20_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 That is a very good question, and I hope that the <i>Daily Mirror</i> can see its sense. No, it has not co-operated to the extent that my hon. Friend suggested. The investigation has not yet been completed and a substantial amount of officer time has been allocated to it. Because of the nature of the public controversy and the scrutiny involved we have had to put considerable resources into it, diverting essential resources from elsewhere.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-20_spnew6"><b> Dr. Howard Stoate  (Dartford) (Lab):</b> 
 Given that the photographs appear to be fakes, can my right hon. Friend quantify the extra risk at which they put our service personnel? Fraudulent photographs in the newspapers must cause significant extra risk to the brave men and women who are serving our country in Iraq.

</p>








<p><a name="40513-20_spnew7"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 That is another very good point. It was a matter to which I referred in my statement to the House on 4 May. Investigating officers in Iraq are conducting their investigations in a sometimes

<br>&nbsp;<br>extremely dangerous environment, and we are putting those officers at risk, as well as others. I want to deal with the impact of the photographs.

<p><a name="40513-20_spnew8"><b> Mr. Prentice: </b> 
 Will my right hon. Friend finally allow me?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-20_spnew9"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 If my hon. Friend would let me finish a sentence and deal with the issues&#151;I understand that he may want to defend the good name of the Queen&#039;s Lancashire Regiment, and I am happy to allow him to do so.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-20_spnew10"><b> Mr. Prentice: </b> 
 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. My question is a simple one. I have always believed that the photographs were fakes. What redress does the Queen&#039;s Lancashire Regiment have, because Piers Morgan has traduced its good name? Can the QLR sue the <i>Daily Mirror</i> for the fake photographs?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-20_spnew11"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I recognise my hon. Friend&#039;s concern for the good name of the QLR and I hope his concern extends across Her Majesty&#039;s armed forces. We need to see the end of the process before people judge what legal action they can take. It is not for me to direct them, but I fully appreciate how angry the officers and men and women of the Queen&#039;s Lancashire Regiment, and their extended families across the country, are about the allegations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-20_para1">
The priority is to get to the bottom of the allegations and, if wrongdoing has occurred, to take appropriate action. That is why I call again on the editor of the <i>Daily Mirror</i> to assist fully in the inquiry. From the start of this episode the <i>Daily Mirror</i> has demanded that the MOD and the Army operate under the highest standards of honesty, openness and professionalism. I challenge the <i>Daily Mirror</i> to do the same.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-20_para2">
It is appropriate that we should debate these matters today, because they bear directly on the morale and, indeed, on the safety of the men and women&#151;regulars, reserves and civilians&#151;whom we ask to perform difficult and dangerous work: men such as the crew of a Warrior armoured vehicle from the Princess of Wales&#039;s Royal Regiment who, only few days ago, were injured by a petrol bomb thrown through the commander&#039;s hatch. Their assailants were children, so the crew did not respond to the attack.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-20_para3">
Two days before that, in al-Amarah, the same regiment did not return fire against militiamen who were cynically making use of women and children as cover. Two days before that, a grenade was thrown at a UK patrol boat in Basra. The assailant was seen, but the Royal Engineers used no force owing to the presence of civilians. Those are only three examples of the sensitivity, forbearance, skill, self-restraint and courage shown by our armed forces in the conduct of their duties, and we would be right to think that such examples occur every day.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-20_para4">
Let us consider the scale of the shadow cast over the QLR by the present furore. The hon. Members who have raised the good name of the regiment have every right to do so. I take the opportunity to compliment the regiment&#039;s considerable contribution during its tour of duty last year in Iraq. Members of the regiment helped to pacify Basra during an undoubtedly turbulent

<br>&nbsp;<br>summer. It is in no small measure due to their efforts and the efforts of others that progress continues to be made in Iraq.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-20_para5">
Iraq now has almost 80,000 Iraqi police. More than 20,000 reconstruction projects have been completed&#151;mostly by Iraqi companies employing Iraqi workers&#151;and that is helping to get the economy going. The capacity of Iraqi ministries is building fast and many have been passed formally to Iraqi control. After years of neglect, Iraq&#039;s infrastructure is slowly modernising, with bridges, pylons, railways and water pipelines appearing across the country. British forces are playing a full part in the reconstruction effort. They have been involved in 2,700 projects. Their efforts will help ensure that by the end of the summer the quality and volume of water in Basra will surpass pre-war levels, and the production of electricity in the south-east will have greatly increased.

<p><a name="40513-20_spnew12"><b> Mr. Gordon Marsden  (Blackpool, South) (Lab):</b> 
 Does my right hon. Friend agree that the catalogue of activities and achievements that he is giving is not a flash in the pan, but builds on what British troops have done over the past 10 years in other peacekeeping operations? Does that not strengthen the argument that the current allegations are far more likely to come as a result of isolated incidents than as a result of a failure to understand the necessary process of peacekeeping in countries such as Iraq?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-20_spnew13"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I agree entirely. That is why the British armed forces are renowned for all they do. I was in Afghanistan a few weeks ago. Everywhere I went, I heard only good words about the work being done in that country by a very small number of British armed forces personnel, and I heard it from senior officers from other countries and from Afghans themselves. That is mirrored in the Balkans, in Kosovo and wherever else our people serve.

 Instinctively, I would say no to that, although I notice other hon. Members are nodding in agreement.

Our people operate under military and UK domestic law. We have an open and democratic structure; Ministers are answerable for the armed forces and have to answer accordingly to this House. The example that my hon. Friend used has been considered in relation to another matter with which I will deal.

Our lessons learned process and the reports by the National Audit Office and the Select Committee on Defence have been very useful in helping us to recognise 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 524</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>where we must improve. We consulted widely during a review of the way in which we dealt with the bereaved. In particular, we listened carefully to what the widows associations told us. We have concluded that we need simpler practices in many areas, including repatriation and casualty reporting. Changes are in hand, and we are keeping this whole area under constant review. We have also reviewed the operational welfare package for our personnel. As a result, we have introduced a family element to the package and are now providing welfare communications for early entry and manoeuvre forces.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-21_para9">
There have been wider lessons as well. The Department fully acknowledges that there were shortages of certain items of personal equipment during Operation Telic and that that was bad for morale. The key difficulty was our inability to track assets once they were delivered to theatre. For example, although some 38,000 sets of enhanced combat body armour were sent to Iraq, which was sufficient to equip those who needed it, not all troops received the ECBA before the commencement of hostilities. A package of improvements for logistics material management has been introduced to provide incremental improvements to logistic tracking and visibility.

 Will the Minister give way?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-22_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I am going to try to make progress. I have taken a lot of interventions, and there are many issues. We are dealing with morale, and I want to touch on some important issues. I hope that my remarks will be heard elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-22_para0">
We recognise the pressure that we place on our personnel and the potential impact on their families. That is why we seek to ensure that commitments do not become unsustainable. From a deployed operational peak at this time last year, we have managed to reduce the number of our service personnel on operations outside the UK and the Falkland Islands from 48,500 to 11,700.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-22_para1">
I shall move on to the policies that we have in place to sustain our people, and the current manning position. Recruiting and retaining the right numbers of the right quality personnel remains critical to achieving operational success. In part, that means getting pay and conditions right, and the Armed Forces Pay Review Body is key. I shall take the opportunity to pay tribute to the work of Baroness Dean, who retired after five years sterling effort as chair of the body. I would also like to welcome her successor, Professor David Greenaway. Under his guidance, I am confident that the Armed Forces Pay Review Body will continue rigorously to scrutinise service pay and to draw careful conclusions. This year, the Government have again accepted in full the Armed Forces Pay Review Body&#039;s recommendations, and we look forward to receiving its report early next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-22_para2">
Beyond pay, we must reassure our people that they can expect a good pension when they retire, and we must also provide adequate compensation for those who are injured in the course of their service. The House will be aware of our plans to introduce a new armed forces pensions and compensation scheme, and the Armed Forces (Pensions and Compensation) Bill completed its Commons stages on 6 May. Subject to successful 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 525</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>completion of the necessary legislation, the schemes should be implemented in April 2005. Independent review has confirmed that both schemes will offer high quality benefits.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-22_spnew2"><b> Mr. Julian Brazier  (Canterbury) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister of State for giving way. Will he comment on the remarks of the Royal British Legion, which assists in large numbers of compensation cases? Up to three fifths of people who would get compensation for suspected war injuries under current arrangements will no longer get them because of the Government&#039;s plan to make such injuries more difficult to prove.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-22_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I am aware of the views expressed by the Royal British Legion. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, who has been dealing with the Bill, advises me that we do not necessarily accept the methodology used to reach those conclusions, and that we continue to discuss the matter with the Royal British Legion and other bodies that have raised it. Many of the issues have already been discussed, although the matter will be considered in another place, and we will return to the Bill at a future stage, when the hon. Gentleman might have more information or have been satisfied by our explanations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-22_para3">
Pay and pensions is only one part of the package. We must provide our people with the training and education that they require to get the job done and to facilitate their personal development. Their performance in Iraq is a remarkable tribute to their dedication, determination, training and preparation. The 2001 defence training review made more than 200 recommendations for improving individual training and education for both service personnel and civilians within the defence field, three quarters of which have already been implemented.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-22_para4">
Alongside training is the need for education. The Ministry of Defence is the largest provider of post-16 education in the UK. Individuals can gain transferable skills and qualifications that enhance both their careers and their future employment prospects. Across the armed forces, more than 40,000 personnel are registered for nationally recognised qualifications. Defence makes a vital contribution to wider national training and educational priorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-22_para5">
Before I close, I should like to highlight some of the wider work that we have in hand for our people. We have long recognised that the armed forces must truly reflect the society that they protect and are drawn from, and again the figures show sustained progress. At 1 February 2004, women represented more than 8.8 per cent. of the overall strength of the armed forces. At 1 January 2004, the figure for representation of ethnic minorities in the armed forces was 4.8 per cent., compared with 1.1 per cent. in 1999, and we are working hard to improve the position. All three services have specialist teams aimed at promoting careers in the armed forces to ethnic minority communities. Over the past year, the armed forces have increased their dialogue with the Muslim Council of Britain, and other spiritual leaders, to address how to encourage more people from those communities to take up a career in the armed forces.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-22_para6">
Finally, I would like to turn to families. We ask so much of our people&#039;s families that we owe them the right support. We have undertaken work to improve our handling of inquiries and investigations into death and serious injury of our servicemen and women. We want to reduce the time taken to conduct such inquiries, whenever possible, and keep families better informed of progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-22_para7">
A wide range of important work is in hand to address the concerns of service families. I should like to highlight in particular the service families taskforce. We have established a joint working group with the Department for Education and Skills to resolve the issues facing schools providing education for service children. The taskforce&#039;s contribution is also vital to ensure that Departments are informed of the impact of proposed legislation on service families. Finally, the taskforce has rightly identified housing provision as key in supporting our families. There is much that we can do to improve matters in this area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-22_para8">
We are wholly committed to the provision of good quality accommodation for service personnel. The defence housing strategy outlined in the defence White Paper aims to meet those aspirations through a mixture of high-quality service family accommodation in the right locations to support mobility and choice for those individuals who choose greater stability. We aim to give personnel and their families more opportunities if they choose to settle or to buy their own house. That should help to improve continuity in health care, education and spouses&#039; careers. Ultimately, all living accommodation, both for service families and for our single personnel, will be managed and delivered with a single vision in mind&#151;quality and choice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-22_para9">
I am sure that many of those issues will be raised in the debate, and I know that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will return to some of them when he winds up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-22_para10">
As at 1 March 2004, the full-time trained strength of the armed forces stood at 190,240&#151;an increase of some 2,000 on last year&#039;s figures. That is the result of sustained hard work across the three services. There remain pinch points where shortages of skilled personnel remain a concern, but even here there is good news to report. I should like to highlight in particular the Defence Medical Services. In January this year, we had nearly 350 more fully trained medical personnel than in 1999, and over 500 more are in the training pipeline. That represents real progress.

<p><a name="40513-22_spnew4"><b> Mr. Peter Viggers  (Gosport) (Con):</b> 
 What effect will the cancellation of the Royal College of Defence Medicine at Selly Oak have on recruitment and retention in the Defence Medical Services?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-22_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I do not have an answer to that, because such matters have to be judged over time. The same question could be asked about any developments that may affect retention. They must be watched and studied, and we do so very carefully. That is why the Armed Forces Pay Review Body will return to areas where there are significant problems, then perhaps recommend certain payments&#151;golden hellos and other incentives&#151;that will attract people or retain them. We must take account of any detrimental impact that works against the trends that I have described.

 I begin by turning the attention of the House back to the points raised by the Minister at the beginning of his speech, particularly his mini statement on what now appear to be the faked photographs produced by the <i>Daily Mail</i>. [Hon. Members: &quot;<i>Daily Mirror</i>.&quot;] I mean the <i>Daily Mirror</i>. I think that the whole House recognises that those who connived with their production and those who published them did a great wrong. As the Minister said, they tainted the reputation, abiding humanity and decency of the British armed forces and their families that has been so successfully sustained over many years. Their good name and, as the Minister said, possibly their lives have been traded for what now appear to be cheap news headlines. As my hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State for Defence said in the House on 4 May, the allegations made by the <i>Daily Mirror</i> must of course be thoroughly investigated. We look to the <i>Daily Mirror</i> board to take appropriate action.

<p><a name="40513-23_spnew0"><b> Chris Bryant: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman also believe that the Press Complaints Commission should act in this case?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-23_spnew1"><b> Mr. Simpson: </b> 
 I hope that it will do so and that it will examine all the details and evidence brought forward. That is not to say that all of us in the House do not recognise the right of a free press to put pressure on Ministers and the Opposition and if necessary, to reveal anything that they think is seriously wrong with the armed forces. This incident proves, however, that in this case one newspaper has probably gone beyond what most people would recognise as the right line.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-23_spnew2"><b> Bob Spink  (Castle Point) (Con):</b> 
 Following the revelations on prisoner treatment, my hon. Friend will be aware of the barbaric murder of the American civilian reconstruction worker in Iraq. Does he believe that the British Government should now consider the protection of any civilian reconstruction workers and aid deliverers in Iraq and of our service personnel?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-23_spnew3"><b> Mr. Simpson: </b> 
 Clearly, that is a question of which the Minister will be only too well aware. I imagine that extra measures have been taken in respect of our service personnel. Clearly, volunteer contractors&#151;I believe that some 5,000 UK citizens are working in Iraq&#151;will accept advice from the British Government and the military forces out there, while recognising that they are taking an increasing risk. Of course, that is a matter that they must decide.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-23_spnew4"><b> Mr. Garnier: </b> 
 I listened with care to what my hon. Friend said about the <i>Daily Mirror.</i> No matter how 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 528</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>blameworthy it may be, and it appears to be that, it does not absolve the Government for strategic and policy failures. Was he satisfied that he received an answer to the apparent confusion that was left following the Minister of State&#039;s answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) on 4 May and the statement made by the Secretary of State on Monday? It seems that there remains a hiatus and the Minister failed to fill it. Was my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) similarly confused by the Minister&#039;s recent remarks?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-23_spnew5"><b> Mr. Simpson: </b> 
 My hon. and learned Friend leads me nicely on to the second part of my comments about the Minister&#039;s mini statement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-23_para0">
The whole House agrees that the contemptible behaviour of a few British soldiers, who, it is alleged, might have carried out such treatment of civilians or prisoners of war, does not represent the professionalism and dedication of the majority of our servicemen and women in Iraq. That is not under question. We all agree that there are no circumstances under which the brutal and disgusting humiliation of disarmed and helpless prisoners can be excused, even when one is at war on operations. However, the crisis, which is a crisis for the coalition, strikes at the very heart of the coalition&#039;s moral case, which we need to consider.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-23_para1">
The damage has already been done. It is not only the damage caused by the continuing revelations about atrocities carried out by certain elements of the United States armed forces. As the commander of 42 Commando Royal Marines, who was interviewed this morning, said, the damage has been done and has affected all of us. It will be incredibly difficult now to turn round opinion in Iraq and in the Arab world, as well as opinion in the United Kingdom.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-23_spnew6"><b> Mr. Borrow: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that had the <i>Daily Mirror</i> not published those photographs, it would be more likely that the Iraqi population would distinguish between the good conduct of our troops in southern Iraq as against the slightly different approach of the US troops in the Baghdad area?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-23_spnew7"><b> Mr. Simpson: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman may well be right, but the problem now is that the coalition brand has been tainted across the board. Certainly, the actions of the <i>Daily Mirror</i> will not have helped. I do not think that many people in Iraq now make much distinction between ourselves and the Americans in relation to the question of who abused prisoners and, of course, the visual image has the biggest impact.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-23_spnew8"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones  (North Durham) (Lab):</b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the allegations and photographs have not just made things difficult for our armed forces and the coalition in Iraq, but made it difficult for the voice of moderate Muslims in the region to be heard? Does he agree that that damage will take a long time to repair?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-23_spnew9"><b> Mr. Simpson: </b> 
 I think that it will. It is now almost impossible to put the genie back in the bottle. As I have said, it is not just a question of the <i>Daily Mirror</i> but of what we see on our screens and of what is coming from Washington. Defence Secretary Rumsfeld has said that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 529</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>we must prepare ourselves for even more and even worse. I think that that undermines the whole coalition effort.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-23_spnew10"><b> Mr. Redwood: </b> 
 Ministers now tell us that policy on the treatment of prisoners was reviewed last September and a sensible decision was made about hooding. Would my hon. Friend expect Ministers to have been aware of that? Would he expect them to have called for papers and discussed issues? Would he expect them at that point to have reviewed the whole question of conduct towards prisoners to ensure that they were being dealt with in the right way everywhere?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-23_spnew11"><b> Mr. Simpson: </b> 
 I hope that my right hon. Friend will forgive me if I do not respond to his point immediately. I am about to list a series of questions for Ministers to answer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-23_para2">
Along with my colleagues and, I suspect, some Labour Members, I have been dismayed by the way in which the Government, and the Ministry of Defence in particular, have responded to what has, in effect, been a crisis. At times, as we have seen this week, they have given an impression of muddle and incompetence. Cursory reading of a newspaper or attendance in the Chamber would have revealed the contradictory statements of the Foreign Secretary, the Secretary of State for Defence and the Prime Minister. That can only encourage those who wish to see the coalition defeated and undermine the morale of our troops.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-23_para3">
What I and others are criticising is not our armed forces, but the muddle and incompetence of Ministers. That is the point at issue. Notwithstanding the numerous questions asked and the two statements made in the House, a number of questions remain unanswered. They should be cleared up now, because we will face further crises like this over the next few weeks that will put our troops in even greater danger. I shall be happy to give way to the Minister of State if he wishes to answer any of the questions that I put to him.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-23_para4">
There is a crucial question about the ICRC report. Until I read it, I did not realise that it put together allegations about both American forces and our own forces. The report was passed on and we understand from the Foreign Secretary&#039;s statement that it eventually reached the permanent joint headquarters. I gather that it was decided there not to pass it on to the Ministry of Defence. Is that correct? It is not a rhetorical question. Does the Minister wish to answer it? Perhaps he does not know the answer. I believe, on the basis of my experience of working at the Ministry of Defence&#151;some years ago, admittedly&#151;that the political secretary at the permanent joint headquarters would certainly pass such a report to the policy-making centre at the Ministry. Either it stopped there, or Ministers were never informed. This is not some pedantic point. It is crucial in terms of policy and the Government&#039;s ability to respond to the kind of accusations that have been made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-23_para5">
Given the report&#039;s reference to the coalition forces, both the American forces and ours, did the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence or the Cabinet Office make representations to their United States 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 530</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>counterparts at any point since its publication? Was the Secretary of State for Defence, for instance, totally unaware of the allegations against the Americans? Might it not have been in the interests of the coalition for him to speak to Defence Secretary Rumsfeld to point out that these were serious allegations and to recognise the damage that they would do to the coalition?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-23_para6">
According to <i>The Observer</i> on 9 May, the MOD confirmed that three British military personnel were stationed at Abu Ghraib prison. Who were they? To whom did they report? Were they aware of the mistreatment and abuses going on? Did those British servicemen at any point make complaints about maltreatment and irregularities at the prison to their superiors? Were Ministers made aware of that? I should be happy to take an intervention from the Minister on that&#151;but no, he does not want to come back to me on it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-23_para7">
It is my understanding that Umm Qasr prison camp, as mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison), was initially operated by the British armed forces. On 7 April 2003, its administration was handed over to the United States, only for it to be handed back to the British forces on 25 September. On 1 April, the ICRC orally informed the political adviser of the commander of the British armed forces at coalition forces Central Command in Doha about methods of ill treatment used by United States military personnel at the camp. Did the British Army continue to hand over Iraqi prisoners to the United States forces despite the warnings about that ill treatment or was that handing-over procedure stopped? If the answer is yes, who made the decision and were Ministers informed of it? I do not know whether the Minister wants to come back on that&#151;no, he does not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-23_para8">
My final point concerns the letter, report or document&#151;call it what we will&#151;of Amnesty International that has got the Minister into so much trouble and produced what could best be described as the Clinton defence on a point of detail over the word &quot;contract&quot;. Because the Minister is an honourable man, I sincerely hope that he will put into the public domain the Amnesty International document that he showed us at the Dispatch Box.

<p><a name="40513-24_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 May I ask the hon. Gentleman whether he got in touch with Amnesty International and asked it to produce the dossier that it sent to me, and if not, why not? It is Amnesty that has said that it is a dossier.

<p><a name="40513-24_spnew1"><b> Mr. Simpson: </b> 
 No. I have to say to the Minister that I would love to be the Minister for the Armed Forces, but it is he, not me, who has to answer for the Government. It seems that what we have seen today is a lot of legalistic semantics from a Minister who has been unable or unwilling to answer the even more substantial questions that I have just put to him. I am sure that members of the armed forces and the press will notice that.

<a name="40513-24_para0">
Both the US and the UK have been steadily losing the confidence of the public over Iraq. To my mind, that is a tragedy. As one who firmly supported the Government in their operations in Iraq, I sincerely hope that, through the good efforts of the United States and our Government, we will be able to hand over to an Iraqi Government on 30 June. However, our Government have created a series of blunders. The 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 531</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Ministry of Defence appears not to know what is going on with major allegations, which seems to replicate what has happened in other Departments. For example, we saw what happened in the Home Office over its asylum policy, when Ministers appeared to blame civil servants and said that things were not going correctly but that they did not know what was going on. So far, as we have seen, the Minister here has been unable to answer any of my questions.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-24_spnew2"><b> Mr. Leigh: </b> 
 There is one point that has not yet been made in this interesting debate. If we are talking about the morale of our troops and the need to win over public support, does my hon. Friend think that it would be useful for the Government to share with the House their future strategy for Iraq? No one expects the Government to give us exact details on when we might withdraw, but we want some kind of intimation of what their exit strategy is, what sort of guidelines are being laid down and when our troops might be coming home&#151;or at least when we might start to reduce their numbers.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-24_spnew3"><b> Mr. Simpson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has raised a series of points that others have raised with the Prime Minister. The date of 30 June is less than two months away, and we assume that the Prime Minister will consult our senior coalition partner to establish a strategy that is credible and that will somehow manage to reverse the dangerous situation that our troops now see themselves in. There must be security and a diplomatic and military strategy for Iraq, and I look forward to Ministers producing that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-24_para1">
The Minister has not answered a number of crucial questions. Either he just did not know or was not told or there is a degree of incompetence that I cannot believe exists in the Ministry of Defence, which I always thought was well run. It is not that I or other Opposition Members&#151;or, indeed, Labour Back Benchers&#151;are critical of the actions of British troops. We are not; but we are critical of what appears to be the stumblebum activity of Ministers.

<p><a name="40513-24_spnew4"><b> Mr. James Gray  (North Wiltshire) (Con):</b> 
 Before my hon.

Lord Vincent asked about the handling of Iraqi prisoners. Lord Bach said that that was a matter of grave concern, that he would look into it and that he would pay it every possible attention.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 532</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>issues directly relating to our armed forces were raised in the ICRC report. All of those were known about and were being addressed. Reports were being made. We knew about the Baha Mousa investigation; we knew about the hooding, which had been stopped in September; and of course, the other issue relating to a vehicle and the compensation relating to it was also known about. All the matters that the ICRC report eventually dealt with had already been acted on. As my noble Friend Lord Bach said, we all take these matters seriously, and we acted on them. I am interested to know whether the hon. Gentleman thinks that there are any other issues that we have not acted on in this context?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-24_spnew7"><b> Mr. Simpson: </b> 
 I refer the Minister back to the series of questions that I asked him and invite him to answer them. Can he confirm that there were three British military personnel at Abu Ghraib prison? Did they report back what was going on there, to him or to any senior military commander, or not?

</p>








<p><a name="40513-24_spnew13"><b> Mr. Simpson: </b> 
 The Minister is saying that those people did report back, but he has not said whether he knows whether they reported on the adverse conditions. Does he, to the best of his ability, know whether he or the Secretary of State raised the matter with Defence Secretary Rumsfeld or other Ministers in Washington? This is crucial, in terms of the reputation of the British armed forces, and of what Ministers knew about. The obvious conclusion is that either Ministers did not know about it, or they knew about it but decided not to report. Ah, a note has arrived from the Box: &quot;You&#039;re on your own.&quot;

 Aha!
</p>








<p><a name="40513-24_spnew16"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Actually, the note does not say that. I was reflecting on it because it gives the same answer as that which I have already given. These people were always told to report back, and they saw nothing of the kind that the hon. Gentleman suggests. They did not observe what he is alluding to.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-24_spnew17"><b> Mr. Simpson: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for that response. It has taken five minutes of questions to

<br>&nbsp;<br>establish that there were British military personnel in Abu Ghraib when some of these activities took place but that, as far as he knows, they did not see, observe, witness or hear about such atrocities. I am grateful to the Minister for putting that on the record&#151;I only wish that he had done so five minutes ago. It has been rather like getting an undergraduate to answer questions in a university viva.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-24_spnew18"><b> Mr. Leigh: </b> 
 A very important point has emerged in the last 10 minutes. We now know that we had our own people in that prison, in which there was widespread abuse, but apparently they told their superiors nothing of what was going on. That beggars belief. What were they doing there? Was there some form of&#151;dare I use a phrase that is often used by Labour Members?&#151;cover-up in their minds? We need to know more and to see the reports.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-24_spnew19"><b> Mr. Simpson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important point. If there are such reports, perhaps the Minister might be willing to publish them, to prove not only that British military personnel were there, but that they did not see any atrocities taking place and, of course, that they were not directly involved in such things themselves. I genuinely believe that what we have experienced this afternoon does no credit to the Ministry of Defence, and it must be deeply worrying to members of our armed forces. If only Ministers would come clean and put on the record what actually happened, instead of putting up more smoke, tabloid newspapers would not have to pick up and make up stories. I hope that the Minister will be better prepared to deal with these issues in time for Monday&#039;s Defence questions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-24_para4">
I turn finally and briefly to the other issues that the Minister touched on, the first of which is the pattern of operations and their impact on our armed forces. Deployments in the past seven years have included continuous operations in the Balkans, and additional operations in Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. Army commitments have fluctuated from a peak of 44 per cent. in 1999 to 22 per cent. in April 2001. In November 2001, there was a 31 per cent. commitment to operations, and a 40 per cent. commitment at the height of the Iraq conflict.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-24_para5">
Of course, we all recognise the professionalism and dedication of our armed forces, but reductions in the Army, Navy and Air Force are taking place between tour intervals, placing an increasing demand on all ranks. As many serving officers tell us, eventually, that begins to wear down the professionalism of the armed forces, and it begins to persuade many&#151;particularly those who are married and under pressure from their husbands or wives&#151;that they should think again about military service. I accept that Ministers have tried to address this issue, but they have yet to get it right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-24_para6">
There is also the dreadful business of overstretch, as a result of which the armed forces frequently have to carry out concurrent military operations. Despite the best efforts of the strategic defence review, the armed forces are getting very close to being unable to do more than one big operation, perhaps alongside one small one. Indeed, it was the firemen&#039;s strike that put the biggest

<br>&nbsp;<br>strain on our armed forces. We need to know what solution Ministers propose, given that, according to the defence White Paper, our armed forces will be involved in even more such operations, which will impose even greater stresses and strains.

 I spent some time with the forces through the parliamentary scheme over the last year, and I discovered that they are incredibly professional in their outlook. I am interested in the hon.

</p>








<p><a name="40513-25_spnew1"><b> Mr. Simpson: </b> 
 Sometimes, just occasionally, a Back Bencher can provide the opening that one has been looking for. If the hon. Gentleman wants to discuss the defence budget, I would refer him to the permanent secretary&#039;s evidence before the Select Committee yesterday. The Treasury said that the Ministry of Defence had, in fact, been incompetent in its handling of the defence budget. We are starting from such an appalling baseline that Sir Kevin Tebbit admitted that it would be wrong for him to say that the Ministry had enough money. The Labour Chairman of the Select Committee, the right hon. Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George), urged the MOD to stand up to the Treasury, saying:

<a name="40513-25_para1">
Across the board, whether in the regular or reserve forces, there are significant manning problems, particularly with specialist groups of one sort or another. I have already touched briefly on the problem of retention. Many of us are concerned about the morale of the armed forces because the White Paper and the work strands seem to be placing emphasis on even smaller&#151;in terms of numerical strength&#151;armed forces. I suspect that the hon. Member for Telford would agree that if the Army is reduced to much below 100,000 it will be incredibly difficult to recruit and maintain certain specialist areas. With greater emphasis on special forces, that will put an even greater strain on a fine group of men and women who now have to be supported very heavily by the reserve forces.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para2">
I wish to end by saying a few brief words&#151;as did the Minister of State&#151;about families. I have special words of praise for the various service family support organisations, which do so much to keep families in touch with their military loved ones who may be on active service. Those groups tirelessly lobby Ministers and Chiefs of Staff on everything from pay and allowances, through accommodation to children&#039;s education.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para3">
On Monday I met Lizzie Iron, the outgoing chairman of the Army families federation, who briefed me on the issues that concern her members. Ministers will be aware that concerns have been exacerbated by the increased years of often unaccompanied duty and by fears about what the White Paper may produce. Uncertainty increases anxiety, so I hope that Ministers will be able to reassure families that, following the implementation of the White Paper, their spouses&#039; jobs are more secure and that&#151;to use a hackneyed old phrase&#151;things can only get better. I do not recall whether it was the Prime Minister or the Prime Minister-in-waiting who said that&#151;or was it the Chancellor of the Exchequer? These days, it is so difficult to know who the real leader of the Labour party is.

The SDR and the defence White Paper recognise, as I know that Ministers do, the real added value as a force multiplier&#151;to use that awful terminology&#151;of our high-quality armed forces. Their professionalism, skills and adaptability have been built up and maintained over decades by successive Governments and are the envy of many other countries and armed forces. However, the pace and frequency of operations place an increasing strain on them and their families. Cuts in time spent at home or on regrouping and training can eventually affect operational effectiveness. We should not assume that our armed forces, at this pace, can continue always to deliver what we expect from them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para5">
Leaks from inside the Ministry of Defence, and evidence presented to the Defence Select Committee about the likely conclusions of the 16 work strands, indicate cuts in the size of the armed forces and a smaller critical mass.

 I am not sure, but the hon. Gentleman seems to be proposing two alternatives. He rightly identifies that the stresses and strains on families are leading to problems of retention. That problem can be overcome either by increasing the size of the armed forces or by not undertaking as many operations. I remember that Conservative Members supported the war in Iraq, whereas Liberal Democrat Members did not. Which alternative does the hon. Gentleman prefer? Should we cut the number of operations or increase the resources?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-25_spnew11"><b> Mr. Simpson: </b> 
 In the end, we might have to reconfigure our armed forces. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister of State laughs, but I am always prepared to tell him which work strand is considering that option at this precise moment. However, as happened with the ICRC report, he may not have seen what that strand is doing, or been made aware of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para6">
If we degrade that added value, we face the prospect that our armed forces may not be able to deliver the very high standard of operational effectiveness that they, and we, would wish for. It is on them, as much as on technology, that we rely for our defence and security.

<p><a name="40513-25_spnew12"><b> Rachel Squire  (Dunfermline, West) (Lab):</b> 
 I begin by presenting the apologies of the Chairman of the Defence Select Committee, who is unable to be here today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para12">
People are the armed forces&#039; most important asset. However much the technology of military operations may have advanced in recent years, it is on the professionalism, training and individual courage of service men and women that their effective conduct depends. I want to begin by paying tribute to the members of the armed services, and to their families.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para13">
For the Defence Committee, personnel issues have always been important. Whenever the Committee visits British forces in the UK or overseas, members make a point of trying to talk to forces personnel of all ranks. The Committee reports regularly and considers the impact of policies and operations on personnel, as is shown by our reports on the lessons of Iraq and on the strategic defence review new chapter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para14">
We have also undertaken inquiries into specific personnel issues, such as pensions and compensation arrangements for the armed forces, and we are now beginning a major inquiry into the duty-of-care issues in the three services. If I have time, I shall make further reference to that inquiry later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para15">
On numbers, we heard encouraging news about progress towards manning targets from General Sir Michael Jackson, who told the Defence Committee a few weeks ago:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The army is not yet at its target figure but it has, for example, increased by nearly 2,000 over the last 12 months. So I am satisfied that army planning is in a healthy position and my forecast is that it will continue to increase&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para16">
Recent operations have demonstrated the potency of modern weapons systems. Some 85 per cent. of munitions dropped in Iraq were precision guided compared with 25 per cent. in Kosovo and 11 per cent. in the Gulf war of 1991. The speed of the American advance on Baghdad was an example of how the concept of overmatching power has replaced that of overwhelming force, but technological advances, however effective, cannot make up for insufficient numbers on the ground, and no one can be in two places at once.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para17">
Stabilisation operations and peace support operations require a large number of personnel, not high-tech weaponry. The Defence White Paper focuses on how the armed forces can best deliver an expeditionary capability. The Defence Committee is conducting an inquiry into that and will publish its report in due course. I am a little concerned, however, that we risk overlooking the importance of ensuring that we meet the simple requirement of having the large numbers of troops needed to supply the considerable number who endure low-intensity operations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para18">
The former Chief of the Defence Staff, Lord Boyce, said in his maiden speech in the other place:


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 538</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;So we need to remember&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the low intensity end, where we are for the vast majority of the time with our forces spread thinly around the world as they are today; that however clever the technology, it does not deliver the capability to be in two places at the same time, such as patrolling simultaneously in the Gulf and the south Atlantic. We have not yet cracked the fourth dimension. So, if there is to be a cut in frontline numbers, then no doubt we can also expect to see a cut in commitments. Anything else would be inexplicable to our already fully stretched servicemen and servicewomen.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, 3 December 2003; Vol. 655, c. 343.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para19">
We would all agree that we ask a lot of our armed forces and that they never fail to deliver, but we must recognise that what they can do is limited by how many of them there are. So how do we resolve the dilemma of too many commitments and too few people?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para20">
We should, of course, always look to reduce commitments where we can. I support the Government&#039;s continuing efforts to encourage our allies, particularly in Europe, to do more, but we must recognise that it is much easier to argue against taking on more commitments in the abstract than to argue against specific proposals when we see the need for them and know that we, and possibly we alone, have the armed forces that could meet that need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para21">
So should we increase the size of our armed forces? To do so would, of course, require extra resources. Although the Chancellor&#039;s statement in the Budget was welcome, it is not realistic to expect the extra funding for defence that would be required to sustain a significant increase in armed forces personnel. Funding is not the only constraint, however. I was struck by what General Sir Michael Walker told us in the Defence Committee. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I do not think it is realistic to imagine that the demographic base in this country would necessarily support a significant increase in the number of people coming into our armed forces. It would be wrong of any of us, I think, to start lowering standards to increase numbers.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para22">
Even if we could afford it, it is the view of the Chief of the Defence Staff that it is unlikely that we could recruit significantly greater numbers to the armed forces without an unacceptable lowering of standards. My first conclusion is that we have to work with what we have got. We should of course continue to look for ways to improve our capabilities within those overall limitations, and we should be prepared to restructure our forces so that they are best able to respond to the sort of demands that we expect to make of them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para23">
My next point is on key enablers, because if our forces are stretched overall, the specific demands that we make of them in some areas become unreasonable and unsustainable. As the Defence Medical Services has already been mentioned, I shall move on from that example in the hope that other Members have a chance to say a little more.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para24">
During Operation Telic there was much public criticism because crucial supplies were not getting through to our front-line forces. As the Committee&#039;s report, &quot;Lessons of Iraq&quot;, spelt out, some of that criticism was justified, but not because the people with day-to-day responsibility for those matters were negligent or careless; rather it was the consequence of there being too few people in key specialties and too little investment in key systems.

</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para25">
Logistics may not be glamorous, but it is essential. The Defence White Paper recognises that logistics must be seen as a capability in its own right and that it needs reorganisation, not least so as to alleviate the demands on specialist personnel.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para26">
Another example is engineering. The initial deployment to Operation Telic put huge demands on engineering capability. When I and other members of the Committee were in Shaibah last July, in temperatures that were routinely above 50&#176; C, we saw uninstalled air-conditioning units lying around because no engineers were available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para27">
I want briefly to mention our reserve forces. They were involved in both the combat and peacekeeping phases of Operation Telic and the Defence Committee was impressed with their dedication and their invaluable contribution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para28">
Operation Telic involved the largest compulsory call-out of reserve forces since the 1956 Suez crisis. Reservists play a critical role in UK military operations, as they provide, in many cases, skills that are not readily available in the regular forces. The medical side provides a specific example; 760 medical reservists were deployed in Operation Telic.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para29">
Being mobilised can put substantial pressure on individual reservists, their families and employers. The Defence Committee is especially concerned that reservists do not lose their jobs as a result of mobilisation. The Chief of the General Staff, Sir Michael Jackson, told the Committee recently that it would be


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;a mistake to assume that we could use the reserves at the tempo at which we have been using them over the last year&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para30">
On mobilisation, he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Reserve Forces Act itself of course says once in every three years, and certainly that is the law, but I personally think that may be a bit too often anyway.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para31">
The Ministry of Defence must consider that point seriously.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para32">
We ask a lot of our armed forces. We put them into situations where they face great personal danger and come under extreme pressure. We also expect them to conduct themselves to high standards and on the overwhelming majority of occasions that is what they do. I have met and spoken to members of the British armed forces all over the world; they are often doing difficult jobs in unpleasant places. I have found them highly professional, committed to the task at hand and fully aware of their responsibilities towards the civilian population.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para33">
I do not intend to discuss the specific allegations against some personnel who have served in Iraq, especially as little time is available, but I welcome the comments of my right hon. Friend the Minister, and the Defence Committee will consider some of those matters in its inquiry into continuing operations. The Committee is also in the early stages of an inquiry into the duty of care towards recruits in all three services. Unfortunately, I do not have time to elaborate on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-25_para34">
I end my speech by once again paying tribute to our armed forces, and to the personal sacrifice&#151;indeed the ultimate sacrifice&#151;they are called on to make in the service of their country. It is Parliament&#039;s and the country&#039;s responsibility to return their commitment with fair treatment, value and respect and just reward.

<p><a name="40513-26_spnew0"><b> Mr. Colin Breed  (South-East Cornwall) (LD):</b> 
 This is indeed a very timely debate in the light of the past few days&#039; events and, in particular, of course, the reports from the ICRC and Amnesty International.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-26_para0">
In the statement on Monday, the Secretary of State for Defence reiterated the need for open and transparent dialogue between the Government and the House. The vast majority of British troops in Iraq are conducting their difficult and dangerous operations to the very highest standards of professionalism in the toughest of conditions. It is right that we have all paid proper tribute to them, both today and on many previous occasions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-26_para1">
Sadly, it is not unusual for improper behaviour to occur in time of war and conflict, and swift and appropriate action needs to be taken by the proper authorities and overseen by the Government and relevant Ministers. It is vital that Ministers are made aware of all important reports, both internal ones and those provided by external organisations, not only so that action is taken at the earliest opportunity but so that the Government can ensure that they keep the House fully informed of important developments. So I welcome the Secretary of State&#039;s statement to the House on Monday, but I remain disappointed by the inadequacy of his response to some of the crucial questions put to him by hon. Members on both sides of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-26_para2">
The Prime Minister yesterday answered questions in a rather similar fashion and insisted that there was no evidence of systematic abuse of Iraqi prisoners by British troops. I think that that is confirmed in the report. He also confirmed that he had not seen the ICRC report until Monday this week, but we know that the report was received by British officials in Baghdad on 26 February. Despite the dialogue between those on the two Front Benches this afternoon, I am still not entirely clear why there was a three-month delay in bringing those very serious allegations to the notice of senior Ministers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-26_para3">
The Prime Minister&#039;s response that the report was not passed to Ministers in February and that he did not know of the allegations of abuse before receiving it was very carefully worded. What was not made clear was whether the Prime Minister was aware of the serious allegations concerning US troops, particularly in respect of Iraqi detainees, and whether he made any representation to President Bush during his recent visit to Washington. As a coalition partner, we surely have every right to know what our partners are doing in the name of the coalition of which we are part and for which we are therefore jointly responsible. But the crucial question remains: why were those reports, which are of obvious political significance, not shown to Ministers and thus not reported to the House?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-26_spnew1"><b> Richard Younger-Ross: </b> 
 In an earlier intervention, the Minister of State, who has left the Chamber for the moment, indicated that what the US does is nothing to do with him. I should have thought that anything to do with US or the coalition forces was to do with him and ought to be of concern to him. I understand that the Leader of the House stated that what the American forces had done was a stain on the coalition. Does my hon. Friend agree with the Minister of State, who says 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 541</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that that is nothing to do with him, or with the implication of what the Leader of the House said, which is that it is a stain on the coalition and is obviously a matter of concern to the Government?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-26_spnew2"><b> Mr. Breed: </b> 
 All this is a good example of the way in which hairs are being split. Both views are correct in a way, but we have to recognise that, of course, any action by any coalition partner will have implications for all the others. That has been made perfectly clear in recent days.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-26_para4">
If we find that any British troops have broken the Geneva convention or, indeed, any other human rights law, I accept the Minister&#039;s assurance that those incidents will be fully investigated and, if proven, those responsible will be appropriately punished.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-26_para5">
The appearance of the black-and-white photographs in the <i>Daily Mirror&#151;</i>they now appear to be reconstructions or representations&#151;have clearly focused attention on what may be disturbing behaviour by our troops that has been the substance of allegations by the Red Cross and Amnesty International for perhaps more than a year. We can only speculate about the motivation behind those images. There is the motivation of the <i>Daily Mirror</i> in using them&#151;it says that it investigated them fully&#151;and the motivation of the people who set the thing up. We were led to believe&#151;and I accept&#151;that they are soldiers, and were named as soldiers A, B and C.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-26_spnew3"><b> Mr. Borrow: </b> 
 On that specific point, does the hon. Gentleman agree that the <i>Daily Mirror</i> should have told the soldiers who came to it with the story to do their duty, see their superior officer and give him full details of the events that they reported?
</p>








<p><a name="40513-26_spnew4"><b> Mr. Breed: </b> 
 I agree entirely that it is right that such actions should be taken before anything of doubtful provenance is published. I want to believe that, although the outcome has been appalling, the motivation of some of the soldiers was honourable. Their action may have been born of frustration following inaction about widely known reports. The way in which the images appeared has been extremely damaging, but we should await the full results of the investigation not only into how those things came to be published but about why they were brought into the public domain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-26_para6">
The US photographs that have been released demonstrate utterly unacceptable behaviour, and have led to an escalation in violence and tension not only in Iraq but among the wider Muslim population of the region. Already, in the past few days, we have seen the appalling and barbaric decapitation of a US civilian, which has shocked people the world over and has shown that even allegations of abuse of Iraqi prisoners can lead to direct retaliatory violence. It is therefore vital that the allegations about British troops are precisely defined and kept separate from the US investigations. What is the status of the British investigations and when will the results be made public? No criminal proceedings have been initiated as yet, but what disciplinary action has been taken against troops in Iraq found to have acted improperly. The Red Cross report states that a commanding officer handed back the body of Baha 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 542</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Mousa to his family in a dreadful state and apologised, assuring them that those responsible would be brought to justice. Compensation was paid, perhaps as admittance that the Army might be liable in the judgment of Army lawyers. Why has it taken so long to reach a judgment? Speed is of the utmost importance to calm fears and restore reputations as quickly as possible. We should not let these things fester in communities. Why did the family of Baha Mousa feel the need to bring another case against the MOD in the UK courts?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-26_para7">
The allegations have dealt a serious blow to the coalition&#039;s efforts to win over the Iraqi people. As part of the coalition, our troops are inevitably identified with those of the US. The ICRC report makes no distinction between coalition forces, and was given at the outset to the US command. Regrettably, we are tarred with the same brush when allegations of abuse are made. Shame falls equally on UK and US forces, regardless of the extent of abuses by either side. The MOD has said that the European convention on human rights does not apply in Iraq, so can the Minister tell us what human rights law does apply there? In particular, does the international covenant on civil and political rights, to which Iraq is a party, apply? Can the Minister assure the House that his Government are doing everything possible to ensure the observance of human rights in all coalition operations in Iraq and that there are clear channels of communication between coalition partners for any alleged breaches of human rights law to be raised, including direct reference to Ministers?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-26_para8">
Can the Minister confirm the rumours of the possible deployment of more British troops to Iraq? In particular, can he confirm that the US has requested British troops to fill the gap left by the withdrawal of Spanish troops? Can he confirm that additional UK troops will be deployed only on the specific request of UK commanders, and that they will be used exclusively to reinforce our own troops on the ground in the southern sector, and will not be used to bolster US forces in areas such as Falluja or Najaf?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-26_para9">
Whatever happens regarding the future deployment of more British troops, we must ensure the continued protection and support of our troops currently stationed out in Iraq. With 30 June only a few weeks away, the Government must surely have determined their political and military strategy for the post-30 June handover. If additional troops are to be deployed, will the Minister tell us on what basis and on what conditions such troops will be made available? It is also not too early for coalition partners to consider their exit strategy, as was mentioned earlier, and in particular what role the United Nations may play in assisting that process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-26_para10">
Events in the past few weeks have seriously undermined coalition efforts to achieve the original objectives. Of course, we all want Iraq to become a peaceful, stable and secure state within which reconstruction can take place safely and speedily, but that all seems a very long way off now. It is far from clear how the original objectives will be achieved in the short to medium term, and it is becoming increasingly obvious that our troops may have to remain for far longer than was anticipated, which will have a significant effect not only on the MOD&#039;s budget but on the overstretch of our forces, which has been highlighted again this afternoon. At the earliest opportunity the Government must present clear proposals to enable the House to debate fully an increasingly worrying situation.

<p><a name="40513-27_spnew0"><b> Dr. Gavin Strang  (Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh) (Lab):</b> 
 Like some hon. Members in the Chamber this afternoon, including the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed), I was opposed to the war in Iraq. I was one of the 219 Members of the House of Commons who last March concluded that the case for war against Iraq had not been established, especially given the absence of specific UN authorisation. However, that is not to say that I do not recognise the arguments of those who, like the Government and the official Opposition, supported the military action.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-27_para0">
I understand and respect the position of people who take a pacifist approach to international politics. I also understand and respect those who adopt an isolationist position, but I have never been a pacifist and I am not an isolationist. I agree with the Ministry of Defence White Paper published in July 1998 that Britain and our armed forces should aim to be a force for good in the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-27_para1">
When the conclusions of the strategic defence review were published in that White Paper, it cannot have been possible to predict that the active deployments of our forces in subsequent years would have been so many and so diverse, including the operations in East Timor, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Kosovo and Iraq, and the work that we asked them to do in Northern Ireland. The Government published a new chapter to the defence review following the atrocities of 11 September 2001.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-27_para2">
If there was ever any question in my mind that our armed forces personnel were overstretched, that question was answered just two weeks ago. I had the opportunity to meet members of the Royal Scots Regiment who were on parade in my constituency, and I spoke with the soldiers who have been at the sharp end of operations, and with the NCOs and officers. They marched through Musselburgh with many people lining the pavements to watch them&#151;a very impressive sight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-27_para3">
One of the advantages of such an event is that it gives not just members of the public, but councillors and Members of Parliament&#151;I am the local Member of Parliament&#151;the chance to talk directly to the men and get an insight into some of the difficulties and challenges they face. They were very positive about the supply of equipment and materials. They did not complain about the lack of supplies, as has been instanced in the past. They mentioned only that they would like more sets of night goggles. The thing that struck me was that some of the soldiers had missed four Christmases in a row. These young people, many with young families, were facing the possibility of a fifth Christmas away from home. The Royal Scots had been in Northern Ireland in 2000 and 2001, in Bosnia in 2002 and in Iraq in 2003. They were marching through Musselburgh, having just returned from Iraq. It is unacceptable and unreasonable to ask our people to join the services on the basis that they will have so little time, particularly at Christmas, with their families and loved ones.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-27_para4">
The working arrangement in the MOD is, I understand, that after six months of operations there should be 24 months back home to recover, train and get back up to speed before another operation, usually overseas. The Royal Scots will be on call from November to go back to Iraq, but that announcement was before the recent speculation that we might be deploying additional troops to Iraq. What I am saying 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 544</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>is not unique to the Royal Scots; it applies to other regiments as well. That is the demand that we are placing on our personnel.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-27_para5">
The Minister of State and my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West (Rachel Squire), who is a member of the Defence Committee, rightly drew attention to the fact that numbers in the armed services are rising, which has to be good news&#151;but I would suggest that it is probably not good enough. If we are to continue to ask our service personnel to intervene on the scale envisaged by the Government, we must substantially increase the military budget and expand the size of the armed forces, particularly the British Army, if we are to become involved in the sort of international action in which we have been involved recently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-27_para6">
Other Members want to speak and time is running out so, in conclusion, I wish to return to the issue of Iraq. The House is aware that the occupation authorities are due to hand sovereignty to a caretaker Government in Iraq by the end of next month. No one would suggest that that interim Government would have day-to-day command over coalition forces. However, I note that my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary said yesterday that it would be for that Government to decide whether foreign forces should remain on their soil. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said yesterday that the people of Iraq say, first, that they are delighted that Saddam Hussein has been overthrown and, secondly, that they want the coalition forces to leave Iraq as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-27_para7">
As I have said in the past, it is my view that the British Government should adopt a policy of replacing the coalition forces occupying Iraq with a force authorised by the United Nations.

 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for giving me a chance to follow the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang), who always speaks with careful thought and sincerity.

<p>
<a name="40513-27_para8">
I count myself as fortunate, having served in the Air Force and in the Territorial Army, and then having served on the Select Committee on the Armed Forces Act 2001, the House of Commons Defence Committee and the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, all of which gave me the opportunity to study the armed forces at first hand.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-27_para9">
I believe that we have the best armed forces in the world&#151;and I say that not simply because I represent a services constituency and know so many people in the armed forces. I know from people from other NATO countries that our British forces are held in high regard. Those forces will be the very first to demand the most rigorous inquiry into the allegations made of mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners. They will have been as shocked as we are that these events appear to have happened and that they happened on the Government&#039;s watch, with no one seemingly knowing they were going on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-27_para10">
I will start at the top, which is always a good place to start. I think our leading commanders benefit enormously from the Royal College of Defence Studies, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 545</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>which takes people in at the level of captain, colonel or group captain, and takes a number of civilians and a large number of foreign students. At the highest level, it gives our senior commanders&#151;before their appointment to the top levels&#151;the opportunity to broaden themselves and means that our top officers are civilised and thoughtful. We are very well led at the top and our senior commanders are indeed of the very highest quality. Similarly, at the staff college at Shrivenham, more junior ranks at the level of major and equivalent learn about joint operations and about the realities of war. They learn, as all junior ranks do, how crucial it is that they should understand and endure fear before they reach the front line.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-27_para11">
In saying that our forces are the best in the world, if I had to base my claim on one simple fact, it would be that our non-commissioned officers have a level of leadership and an ability to take the initiative that often do not exist in the armed forces of other services. If one goes on a small patrol in Northern Ireland or Bosnia and Herzegovina that is led by a lance corporal or a corporal, one realises the extent of the demands that are made of junior ranks at that level. Our junior ranks are fully capable of taking that responsibility, and I single out that aspect as the most important of all those that make our armed forces the best in the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-27_para12">
On the recruitment and training of junior ranks, the Select Committee on Defence is currently studying recruitment and training under the title &quot;Duty of care&quot;. I was impressed recently when I read a reappraisal of initial training produced by the director of operational capability. The document talked about creating a climate in which there was a more congenial and balanced training environment. Over 20 years ago, such words would not have been used. It was certainly the view then that the object of recruitment and training the junior ranks was to break a man&#039;s spirit and rebuild it in the spirit of the unit. Now, that does not work at all. People are trained on the basis of having been encouraged in their earlier education to think for themselves. Officers in the Army, Navy and Royal Air Force&#151;we have recently had the opportunity to meet personnel from all three services to discuss this matter&#151;all say that the quality and standard of recruits nowadays make things much more challenging, as they have been taught to think for themselves. It is no longer possible simply to order a man to do things; one needs to explain what is to be done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-27_para13">
The service ethos is also different. Discipline and order remain important, and people are now trained to achieve similar military standards to those that have always existed, but that is happening in a changing world in which standards in civilian life are not the same as those of the military. The process is therefore much more demanding for service personnel, who need to be trained to use force and violence and to understand that they will need to kill if that is required, yet, at the same time, the world in which they are operating is a changing and rather softer and quieter one. The demands on trainers are therefore greater than ever before.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-27_para14">
I turn now to some individual personnel issues. Reference has been made to the Defence Medical Services, which are dangerously under strength. We have only about a third of the required strength in

I believe that we are seriously overstretched, and when I challenged the Minister to explain the effect of cancelling the Royal College of Defence Medicine at Selly Oak hospital in Birmingham, he gave me a most unsatisfactory answer. The fact is that, having planned to focus defence training in Birmingham at a new site at Selly Oak hospital, there appears not to be a plan B to provide proper education and accommodation facilities for the personnel who will serve there.

 The hon. Gentleman has made that accusation twice this afternoon. I assure him and the House that plans do not exist to close the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, as he alleges. We are committed to delivering a military medical centre of excellence at the RCDM in Birmingham, which is our aim and expectation.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-28_spnew1"><b> Mr. Viggers: </b> 
 The accommodation centre, mess facilities, sporting facilities and offices that would have comprised the centre of the RCDM have been cancelled. Staff in Birmingham have been left in inadequate bed-and-breakfast accommodation, and that point is confirmed in a parliamentary answer from the Under-Secretary. Some staff live in accommodation that was originally intended for people without housing, and a large number of them stay in a Young Women&#039;s Christian Association hostel. I challenge the Minister to deny that there are no plans to change the situation.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-28_spnew2"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 I do not know the parliamentary answer to which the hon. Gentleman refers, but I refer him to a parliamentary answer that I gave to the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson):

<p><a name="40513-28_spnew4"><b> Mr. David Borrow  (South Ribble) (Lab):</b> 
 I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this afternoon&#039;s debate. I represent South Ribble in Lancashire and I live only a few hundred yards away from the headquarters of both the Queen&#039;s Lancashire Regiment at Fulwood barracks and Kimberley barracks, where the Territorial Army regiment is based.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-28_para4">
I have a lot of contact and dealings with the Queen&#039;s Lancashire Regiment. From speaking to people in the regiment, and to the extended family of people who have served in the past and those whose family members serve in the regiment, I know how upset and annoyed they have been by the recent comments and photographs in the <i>Daily Mirror.</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-28_para5">
The Queen&#039;s Lancashire Regiment has a long and distinguished reputation, which goes back to 1782. In 1970, three regiments&#151;the East Lancashire Regiment, the South Lancashire Regiment and the Loyal Regiment&#151;merged to form the Queen&#039;s Lancashire Regiment. Throughout its history, soldiers from the Queen&#039;s Lancashire Regiment have been awarded a total of 18 Victoria crosses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-28_para6">
I was in Basra in early June, a few weeks before the change of regiments, when the 1st Battalion the Queen&#039;s Lancashire Regiment went out to Basra&#151;it arrived in the middle of June and stayed until the middle of November. About 600 servicemen and women were with the regiment, including 100 members of the Territorial Army. When I met members of the regiment on their return, they were proud of their hard work, the schools and police stations that had been reopened, the number of police officers who had been trained and the improved public services. There is very little hint of anything going wrong during that period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-28_para7">
I am experienced and grown-up enough to realise that, if 600 servicemen and women are put in a dangerous situation thousands of miles from home, not every one of them will behave perfectly and that there will be incidents that require investigation. However, what has upset the people of Lancashire so much is the use on the front page of the <i>Daily Mirror</i> of the fake photographs that have cast doubt on the integrity and honour of everyone who has served in that regiment. As politicians and people in public life, we realise that our media are players in that arena and will manipulate and cherry-pick the news to make a political point and we take it for granted because it is part of the rough and tumble of politics. But ordinary families who have been upset by newspapers cannot understand how they can fabricate stories that hurt and damage their integrity. It is an absolute disgrace that the <i>Daily Mirror</i> has been prepared to besmirch the name of the Queen&#039;s Lancashire Regiment to further its own political line and damage the Prime Minister.

Did it say to those servicemen, or so-called servicemen, &quot;You ought to report these things to officers in the MOD or your regiment so they can be investigated&quot;? When they first made their allegations, did they appear at the door of the <i>Daily Mirror</i> with photographs in hand, or did they, as is rumoured, appear without photographs, then return some days later having mysteriously discovered photographs to support their story? Did the <i>Daily Mirror</i> pay for those photographs? Has the <i>Daily Mirror</i> profited from the sale of those photographs to media outlets across the world?

Sadly, those words, which I wrote on 4 July, have turned out to be all too true. The key question that the Government must now address is this: do they now accept that the coalition is fighting a major counter-insurgency war in Iraq&#151;it is not peacekeeping&#151;which is part of a global counter-insurgency war?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-28_para18">
The principles of counter-insurgency warfare are not new. They have been established, discovered and practised by the British armed forces throughout the world for many years. They are to secure one&#039;s home base, which is why we have talked so much about homeland security, and to deny the enemy a secure base, which is why we threw out the Taliban in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein in Iraq. They are also to plan and generate military activity based on the best human intelligence about the enemy that one can gather and to remove the underlying political grievances through reconstruction and the settlement of disputes. Another principle is to co-ordinate all one&#039;s actions to a coherent strategic plan with all one&#039;s partners, which underlines the importance of transatlantic co-operation for the future of Iraq, that we cannot let the Americans do it on their own and nor should our European partners seek to leave them to do it on their own. That also underlines the importance of NATO, and raises the question of why NATO is not taking a strategic role in co-ordinating a single, strategic plan. We must also remember that counter-insurgency warfare is a battle for hearts and minds and that the conflict is about the will to win, and the will to succeed, not about the use of physical force. That means that we must remember that actions and words, including the technical, have immeasurable political and strategic consequences. We need to avoid doing things that create propaganda opportunities for the enemy to feed grievances and enmity. That means that a counter-insurgency campaign must stay within the law and only use proportionate force as a last resort.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-28_para19">
In Iraq, I fear that we are acting on very limited and poor intelligence. The actions that we have seen publicised on screens around the world recently are fuelling grievances. The disputes and splits in the coalition are disabling any coherence of a plan. There is a clash of military doctrines, a failure to win hearts and minds and too much resort to force&#151;not on the part of our armed forces but certainly on that of others. There is a failure to understand the strategic impact of words and actions. That point relates directly to prisoners and their treatment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-28_para20">
Any mistreatment of prisoners in the hands of the coalition is a matter for the whole coalition. That is why it is inexplicable that the International Committee of the Red Cross report was not a matter of instant concern to Ministers as soon as it became available to the coalition. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 550</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>The pictures endanger the entire strategy. They are petrol on the flames of Islamic opinion. They are a propaganda gift to the terrorists. Al-Qaeda could not have planned it more effectively.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-28_para21">
In Iraq and in the middle east, we now face the prospect of real strategic failure. For all the success, skill and commitment of our armed forces and other members of the coalition&#151;and the Americans&#151;for all their forbearance in the face of real danger and for all the progress made in political and physical reconstruction in Iraq, we are in danger of throwing it all away through the coalition&#039;s failure to understand the fundamental principles required of a counter-insurgency campaign.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-28_para22">
This is the question that the Government must face: what is the coalition plan to defeat terrorism and insurgency in Iraq? Are the Government effectively engaged with US policy making? I fear that not only have they made a mess of UK post-war planning for Iraq, but there is a persistent and ongoing failure to engage with the US Administration on the strategic direction of the coalition, in areas in which we have so much more experience and so much more to offer than the Americans currently seem to appreciate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-28_para23">
In a <i>Daily Telegraph</i> interview earlier this week Sir Jeremy Greenstock, formerly the Prime Minister&#039;s ambassador to Iraq, mentioned that we have 5 per cent. of the say in what happens in the coalition&#151;although we provided 20 per cent. of combat power on the ground during the conflict. For all the Prime Minister&#039;s personal popularity in Washington, it is horribly clear that either his influence there is negligible or that he has failed and continues to fail to understand the true nature of the challenge of what is required to win the peace and good government for the people of Iraq, what is required for our own peace and security in the years ahead and what is required for the safety of those who serve so gallantly in the towns and villages and the streets and fields, of Iraq.

<p><a name="40513-29_spnew0"><b> Mr. Nigel Beard  (Bexleyheath and Crayford) (Lab):</b> 
 I worked closely with the British Army for 12 years, and know it to be the best-trained, most skilled and most disciplined military force in the world. That character and capability have been displayed in Northern Ireland, Sierra Leone and Kosovo, and twice in Iraq. It is a humane, confident and professionally effective force of which, with good reason, Britain can be proud.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-29_para0">
That reputation should be in no way diminished by the media&#039;s treatment of reports from Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross, as though they were an indictment of military personnel serving in Iraq. Those reports have been cynically used to imply some association of the British armed services with the very serious evidence of abuse and humiliation of detainees in Abu Ghraib prison. Let us say on every possible occasion, loud and clear, that there is absolutely no evidence of any systematic or widespread mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners by British forces.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-29_para1">
The 33 known cases of Iraqi civilian deaths, injuries or ill-treatment have been investigated by the Royal Military Police&#151;because the Army itself identified them as needing investigation, not because they were

<b>13 May 2004 : Column 551</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>responding to either the Amnesty or the Red Cross report. Of those investigations, 12 are continuing and 21 have been completed, with 15 findings of &quot;no case to answer&quot;. In the other six cases, the findings are still being considered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-29_para2">
The Amnesty report published this week involves 37 cases of Iraqis killed in accidents witnessed by or involving UK forces. The Ministry of Defence is now trawling through its records to identify what was involved in those incidents. Such investigations, using established military procedure, do not reflect an organisation indifferent to the welfare of the civilian population or tolerant of soldiers who are careless in the use of their weapons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-29_para3">
I have yet to see a newspaper article attempt to set any such case against the backcloth of events that soldiers are experiencing. Colleagues have been killed; they may themselves being fired on at the next street corner. A mob may be jeering, and it may be difficult to see what is going on. There are undoubtedly hostile forces at large attempting to create disorder, destruction and despair. In that climate of uncertainty and fear, people will make mistakes. They may do things in the heat of the moment that in calmer times they regret. That is the nature of military operations. Incidents like these must be judged against that background, not against abstract standards of model behaviour. Those are the considerations that the Royal Military Police are best able to bring to the investigation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-29_para4">
Both the Red Cross and Amnesty, in the role reflected in their reports, contribute to sustaining the high reputation of our armed forces. They are independent and strive to be objective in what they report. That is more than can be said for much of the media reporting and comment on them. Too much of that has been an attempt to establish the guilt of British forces by association with what went on in Abu Ghraib prison. The most culpable example of that, which we have already spoken of this afternoon, was in the <i>Daily Mirror</i>, which promoted its indictment with those fake photographs and interviews with anonymous soldiers, which were no more than the regurgitation of stories that had already been investigated, or were recycled from newspaper stories earlier in the year. What valiant and fearless journalism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-29_para5">
Do those responsible for that ever stop to wonder how the parents at home feel when their sons and daughters are risking their lives but are, by implication, defamed as brutalised and undisciplined? Those are the same men and women who have brought drinking water and electricity supplies to new standards in Iraq, who have helped to establish schools and hospitals and to train civilian police, and who have brought in elected local councillors. Not only has press reporting been an unfair indictment of men and women who do great credit to Britain; the climate of crisis that it has created encourages and emboldens the extremists to greater violence and hostility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-29_para6">
Generating a climate of crisis also serves many of those who opposed intervention in Iraq from the beginning, or who otherwise see some political advantage to be gained from the present situation. It is that which leads to the phoney &quot;shock horror&quot; at the fact that the Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Defence became aware of the Red Cross report only recently. The flood of issues of all kinds relating to Iraq 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 552</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and many other topics does not require the Prime Minister or the Secretary of State to deal with everything personally. They must ensure that there are clear lines of accountability and responsibility for action to be taken, and those arrangements exist. The Red Cross report cases had been investigated, and the Amnesty cases either had been investigated or were about to be. Those who allege that the reports should have been immediately sent to the top should tell us what they would have expected the Prime Minister or the Secretary of State to do that was not already being done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-29_para7">
There is no more motive behind that line of argument than an attempt to create a public impression that the Government are not in control.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-29_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jenkin: </b> 
 The question that I would have expected the Secretary of State for Defence or the Foreign Secretary immediately to ask the American Administration is, &quot;How on earth are we going to handle this when it comes out?&quot; That is the damage that has been done, and it is the fact that the American Administration seem to be coming from so far behind on this issue, as do we, that has sullied the reputation of the entire coalition administration and poisoned the Arab world against us even more.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-29_spnew2"><b> Mr. Beard: </b> 
 So the actionable matter was an indictment of the United States&#151;a power for which we have no responsibility whatever.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-29_para8">
The whole episode, as that intervention suggests to a degree, is being exploited to gain political advantage. Let us just look at the troubled waters in which the cynical opportunists are fishing. We are within two months of sovereignty being passed to an Iraqi Government who, six months later, will hold elections for the whole of Iraq. The extremists do not want either of those things to happen. Iraqi sovereignty removes a grievance that they can exploit on the streets, and democracy forecloses any attempt to install an Islamic state. There are numerous sects and cults, including al-Qaeda, with an incentive to try to prevent that progress by creating disorder and fear. These are bound to be difficult days for our troops in Iraq and anxious times for all who want to see a decent, democratic state emerge after Saddam Hussein&#039;s 30 years of tyranny.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-29_para9">
Those who are dealing with that situation deserve our support, not the distraction of the fabricated indignation and opportunist hoo-hah that we have witnessed from the press and from Opposition parties in this House, including frequently this afternoon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-29_para10">
It is not just that our troops deserve better than that; so do the people of Iraq. They want a settled future in a democratic state, with an economy generating jobs and opportunities. To those such as the Liberal party, who have gone on pretending that there is no exit strategy for our troops, I would reply that that aspiration alone defines the exit strategy. It is to create the conditions whereby that kind of society can grow in Iraq.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-29_para11">
Both the British and the American forces have made huge strides to establish those foundations, through the civil works programmes, the establishment of local democracy, and the training of police and local officials. The vast majority of people in Britain have barely heard

</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-29_para12">
Now, that negative picture is being elaborated to create an impression that all is chaos, that things are moving backwards, that all efforts were foolish and in vain and that the best thing we could do would be to withdraw British and American forces. Even sensible reports from the Red Cross and Amnesty are being prayed in aid of that false &quot;I told you so&quot; assessment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-29_para13">
This is not a time when our troops in Iraq should be distracted by a partisan propaganda war at home. They need all their skills and personal qualities to deal with the difficult period ahead, up to and after the end of June. The Iraqi people want them to succeed for the sake of their future too. We want them to succeed. No one can gain if Britain or America appears to lose its nerve at home at this crucial time.

<p><a name="40513-29_spnew3"><b> Adam Price  (East Carmarthen and Dinefwr) (PC):</b> 
 I shall concentrate on what the Secretary of State, in his characteristically opaque manner, has referred to as some of the &quot;process issues&quot; associated with the subject that we are discussing. The process has been deficient; certainly it has been an arduous task trying to extract information on this subject from the Government through parliamentary questions. If the Government had acted with greater candour and a greater sense of urgency, the collateral damage that we are suffering now because of the allegations against America would have been minimised with regard to the British forces. It is a great shame that they did not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-29_para14">
I have at present 10 parliamentary questions to which I have not had a reply, some of which date back to February. Indeed, to one question I had a holding reply on 28 November, and received the letter that was promised at the end of March, after constantly bombarding the Minister of State&#039;s office with telephone inquiries asking where it was. That is no way for us as parliamentarians to have to try to hold the Government to account on any issue, let alone one as important as this.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-29_para15">
Even more worrying is the fact that some of the replies that we have received have not been complete, and some of them have not proved to be correct. I asked whether the Government were aware of any complaints made by the Iraqi interim governing council about alleged human rights violations by coalition forces, and the answer was that they were not. Yet the Iraqi Human Rights Minister, Abdel Basset Turki, made a public statement in November saying that he was very concerned about that very subject, and he had several meetings with Paul Bremer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-29_para16">
The reply to another of my questions was more worrying still. I asked about the number of fatalities that were under investigation, and on 19 January I was given a list of names. Yet we read in the Amnesty International report about the death of Ghanem Kadhem Kati, who was shot in the back outside his home on 1 January. Why was that name not included in the parliamentary reply? The Government say now that the investigation was ongoing at that time, and there was an interview with the Royal Military Police.

We read in the Amnesty International report of the death of Hilal Finjan Salman on 4 October. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister of State is smiling while I am recounting the death of an innocent man who was actually protecting a girls&#039; school. He had been employed for 35 years as a guard for al-Maqal girls junior high school, and was licensed to carry a weapon to protect the school. He was required to wear a luminous orange jacket, but neither the British Army nor the Iraqi authorities had issued him with such a jacket. He was the &quot;gunman&quot; whom the Minister of State told me was shot, thereby dismissing the death of that innocent man. Hilal Finjan Salman&#039;s son has applied for compensation, but according to the Amnesty International report he has heard nothing from the British authorities.

There has been a lot of talk about apologies. Will the Minister of State apologise to the family of that man, who was wrongfully killed while doing his job protecting a girls&#039; school in Basra? The Minister of State has dismissed what happened in an incorrect parliamentary answer to me.

<p><a name="40513-30_spnew0"><b> Mr. Barnes: </b> 
 Is it not important to establish the standing of Amnesty International? The Labour party made considerable use of such reports in connection with developments in South Africa, for instance, and sought to proceed along the lines of those reports. I was very disappointed, in that the Minister of State seemed to place little significance on the Amnesty International reports; indeed, he almost seemed to put them on a par with those in the <i>Daily Mirror</i>. All of us would criticise that newspaper&#039;s approach.
</p>








<p><a name="40513-30_spnew1"><b> Adam Price: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point, and I shall give him an example of what happened under a previous Labour Government. Following an Amnesty International report by Dr. Rastgeldi on alleged torture at the Fort Morbat interrogation centre in Aden in the summer of 1966, the then Labour Government set up their own independent inquiry into those allegations, which led to the Bowen report. When allegations were made about alleged mistreatment in internment when the subsequent Conservative Government were in office, they commissioned two independent reports: the Compton report of November 1971, and the 1972 Parker report. So the Government are departing from established precedent. When widespread allegations are made of mistreatment and human rights violations by British forces, the Government should institute a general independent inquiry in order to establish the facts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-30_para0">
Police investigations into individual incidents are taking place, in order to get at the facts and to assess the innocence or guilt of those accused. But we also need a general inquiry, so that policy lessons can be learned in respect of the very process issues to which reference has been made. For example, we were told that the practice 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 555</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of hooding was outlawed by legal directives on military interrogation, given in August 1972 and in the following year. Yet that practice was ongoing between April and September of last year. Why was the illegal practice of hooding, which may have contributed to the death of Baha Mousa, allowed to continue? <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister of State says that it was not allowed to continue, but British Red Cross officials said that they had a meeting a year ago with British Army commanding officers in Basra, at which those officers admitted that hooding had been going on. They promised a review, but why did that review of an illegal practice take until September to be implemented? If the Government are not prepared to answer those questions, we need an independent inquiry to get at the truth. The Minister knows that the UN Committee against Torture and the European Court of Human Rights have declared hooding to be a degrading and inhuman treatment. That is in addition to the practice being illegal in British law. The Minister must explain why that practice was allowed to continue for six months.

I also associate myself with those who have condemned acts of torture and the degrading treatment of prisoners in Iraq. However, I believe that we should distinguish clearly between what the Americans have done and the treatment of prisoners in British-controlled hands. Many people and media make the mistake of not making that distinction. I would be the first to criticise the Government if action had not been taken against the perpetrators or if the accusations had not been properly investigated, but I am reassured by what I have heard.

We could debate the issue of condemning the <i>Daily Mirror</i>. If what the Minister said today is true and the pictures are false, I do not see how anyone could support what the newspaper did. Irrespective of that, however, the damage done to the coalition brand&#151;a term used by the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)&#151;in the Arab world is immeasurable. Those people on the Arab street in the middle east who wish to perpetuate radical forms of Islamic terrorism are using the pictures as a recruiting tool.

I have also seen the huge logistics effort going on in this country.

The units at Donnington and Stafford have been required to work together and are a model of tri-service working.

Let me be clear, so that there is no misunderstanding&#151;we in the official Opposition unreservedly support our troops in Iraq in the difficult and dangerous job that they are doing. Whatever doubts there may have been at the time of the invasion, all responsible commentators accept that we owe it to the Iraqis and to those who have given their lives in the conflict to see the matter through. However, supporting our valiant troops in this time of crisis does not imply any suspension of the task of holding the Government to account.

My father was a professional soldier and always maintained that, before undertaking any military operation, Britain&#039;s armed forces could do little wrong if their first strike was against the British Ministry of Defence. In my naivety, I used to think that he was joking. As Harold Macmillan observed, events are a politician&#039;s greatest enemy.

The official Opposition supported the Iraq invasion in the belief that the Government had a clear plan for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. It is now clear that there was not very much of plan. We were assured that cheering crowds would throw flowers, and&#151;yes!&#151;there were cheering crowds, as we all saw on television. However, there was no follow-up in terms of development. As it has become clear that security had not been planned properly, the cheering crowds have steadily been replaced by baying hordes throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at our soldiers.

<a name="40513-30_para13">
It is evident that the job is going to be much harder and take much longer than was envisaged. Are the forces in Iraq large enough? The 1945&#150;48 campaign in Palestine took place in a country quite a lot smaller than Scotland, with a population of less than 1 million. Our forces there peaked at 120,000, yet today the coalition has about 160,000 troops to deal with 25 million people in a country twice the area of Great Britain.

Obviously there are differences, but one cannot help wondering whether, once again, our armed forces are being asked to do more and more, with less and less. A stable, democratic Iraq in the heart of that troubled region would be a wonderful legacy to the Iraqi people and the whole region, but the increasingly long-term commitment involved is making the problems of overstretch in our armed forces worse and worse.

The Government&#039;s published establishment manpower requirement across the three services has been cut by 3,000 since April 2000, yet on 1 January this year we were still 4,000 short of even that reduced target. At least a quarter of our infantry battalions have not been allowed the required time between tours of duty 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>because of manpower shortages. The armed forces review board report of 2003 found that last year more than half of the personnel had to change leave arrangements for service reasons, often losing the holiday packages we take for granted, without receiving compensation. According to the figures, average working hours across the three services has reached the point at which pay for private soldiers, calculated on the number of hours they are on duty in a typical week, is approaching the minimum wage introduced by the Government.

Let us think of service personnel families, too. Between 1997 and 2001, the divorce rate in the armed forces, which already is much higher than that in the civilian community, increased by nearly half. Imagine how dispiriting it must be to win the war merely to lose it on the home front. The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) made some salient remarks on that subject.

Canterbury is proud of the locally based Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and, from the regular troops, the Princess of Wales&#039;s Royal Regiment, which are in Iraq. We are also proud of the Territorial Army platoon from the 3rd Battalion&#151;the TA battalion&#151;of the Princess of Wales&#039;s Royal Regiment, which is based in my constituency and will be going to Iraq shortly. The truth is, however, that our reserve forces are just as overstretched as our regular forces. The TA has been cut by a third since 1997, with a disproportionate amount of the cuts falling on the infantry and the sappers, the very people we most need in Iraq. The Government have subsequently given the TA infantry the task of heading up the rapid reaction forces for our homeland defence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-30_para18">
A survey of TA personnel sent to the Gulf found that four fifths did not expect their employer to support any further deployments in peacetime. Some 63 per cent. of medical and technical staff in the TA said that they were thinking of resigning when they got back. In Westminster Hall I put a series of detailed questions, put to me by TA officers, to the Under-Secretary, who is normally a courteous man, and he promised that he would let me have a written answer. They were on the weaknesses in the new TA infantry battalion structure, the fact that the intelligence officers have no staff, and problems with the training regime. I would be grateful if he told me when he is likely to answer those questions.

That surely is the point. Our forces are being deployed on more and more operations and, in the case of Iraq, it is increasingly clear that we do not know how long they will be there. My hon.

Furthermore, the allegations against our troops, and, much more potently, the revolting pictures of certain US soldiers committing those vile acts of human rights abuses, have further endangered the lives of our soldiers. The Minister did not answer most of my hon. Friend&#039;s

I end with two more questions. The Minister gave a robust answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport. Is it really true that the plans for the centre for military medical excellence based in Selly Oak will go ahead despite the huge shortfalls in medical services; that there is no change of plan and the resignation made no difference?
</p>

My second question is about the largest procurement project in the history of the British Army&#151;the Apache. The Conservative Government ordered it and every machine was delivered, but when will the first squadron be trained and up and running as an operational squadron?

<a name="40513-31_para3">
The Secretary of State has placed great emphasis on the fact that technology will make up for cuts in manpower. The Minister made the same point today. However, since the dawn of time kings and Governments have tended to put more faith in technology than in those who wield it. The lessons are never learned. The Government offer our troops cuts in defence spending. Under a measure that has just left this place, they are making a mean attack on war disabilities claimants, and they are obfuscating over the issue of the Americans and prisoner abuse.

The best contribution today came from my right hon. Friend the Minister of State. In more than 50 minutes, he took more than 15 interventions and answered questions from Members on both sides of the House on all the issues of the day. It was a thoroughly open and transparent contribution, which was certainly welcomed by my hon. Friends and will be welcomed outside the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-31_para7">
In this brief winding-up speech, I want to bring the House up to date on two important major legislative matters for our armed forces. The first is the tri-service Bill on which we have been working for some time and which we plan to introduce in 2005&#150;06, subject to the availability of parliamentary time. It is especially pertinent to the personnel and discipline issues that we have been discussing today. It is a big undertaking, involving detailed discussions with and between the three services, and we are determined to get it right, as I said in a recent continuation order debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-31_para8">
Nevertheless, I stress that we are taking an evolutionary, not a revolutionary, approach to reform of service law. The five-yearly armed forces Bills&#151;I believe that the hon. Member for Gosport has served on their Standing Committees in the past&#151;are normally remitted to a Select Committee after Second Reading, but I am keen to share our proposals with the House and to have a constructive debate on the key principles underlying them, as well as on the main proposals, in advance of the Bill&#039;s publication.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-31_para9">
I have been considering how that might best be done, and can announce that I plan to submit a written memorandum to the Defence Select Committee outlining the progress we have made to date. Shortly, I will write to my right hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George), the Chairman of the Committee, laying out a timetable for the provision of that evidence. That approach will enable the Committee to consider the Bill&#039;s main proposals, take evidence as required and report to the House early next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-31_para10">
I look forward to the Committee&#039;s scrutiny of the work that has been undertaken so far and I am sure that it will benefit from such an open and transparent process. Clearly, such a report from the Select Committee would be available for all Members to see and comment on in due course.

<a name="40513-31_para11">
The second sphere of legislation is one that concerns many Members&#151;the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) has just referred to it: our announcement in the White Paper about the review of reservists&#039; financial assistance. Work is being undertaken as a priority to produce new regulations governing the award of both the reservist standard and hardship awards. At the same time, we also intend to revise the regulations for employer financial assistance and consider the matter that many hon. Members have raised today and during our debate on pensions and compensation last Thursday: the self-employed.

The Reserve Forces Act 1996 requires consultation with interested parties. To that end, I plan to publish a consultation document before the commencement of the summer recess to seek the views of interested parties. I hope that the House will accept that it is not appropriate for me to state what our proposals might be in advance of that consultation. I can assure Members, however, that the concerns that have been raised&#151;for instance, by the Defence Committee, reservists and employers&#151;are being given great weight in devising the new scheme. Our aim is to introduce the replacement regulations in the autumn of this year.

<p>
<a name="40513-31_para13">
During the opening speech, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State raised the issue of training and education, and I want to emphasise that issue in the few moments that are left to me today. Training and education are very important to the performance of our people, as was highlighted in the defence White Paper and further expanded upon in the recently published policy paper, &quot;Training and Education in the Armed Forces.&quot; May I say how grateful I am to the many Members of both Houses who attended the seminar at the document&#039;s launch on 4 May?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-31_para14">
The fact that the Ministry of Defence is one of the largest single providers of training and education in the UK is significant. The policy paper highlights the variety and complexity of the task, the skills agenda against which the Department operates, the realities of the operational environment and the demands that they place on the training system. Most importantly, the paper shows that the MOD is at the forefront of developing skills for the 21st century, while never forgetting the fundamental requirements for servicemen and women to deliver operational capability.

<a name="40513-31_para15">
There has been some debate about Defence Medical Services this afternoon. I intervened on the hon. Member for Gosport to put an end, I hope, to the allegations he has been making. We are actively recruiting in the Defence Medical Services. About 500 more medical and dental officers are currently in the training pipeline. They range from specialist registrars&#151;about 40 consultants will qualify in the next four years&#151;to cadets who have just begun their training, two of whom I met when I visited St. Dunstan&#039;s recently, where they were on secondment. More than 400 nurses will also complete their training in the same period. Of those currently in training, 267 are at the Defence School of Health Care Studies in Birmingham, where we are progressively moving all our nurse training, and a further 129 are completing their training at the university of Portsmouth.

I am sorry that I cannot allow my hon.

I do not have time to go into all the issues that were raised during the debate.

I want to raise an issue with the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) about his meeting with the Army Families Federation. I wonder whether he apologised during that meeting for the Conservative defence policies in the 1990s&#151;for example, cuts in defence housing, cuts in recruitment and cuts in medical services. My hon. Friends will know the type of cuts that the armed forces can expect if a Conservative Government were ever returned to power, which is very unlikely.

 I wish to draw the attention of the House to an issue that will not be new to most right hon. and hon. Members. However, it is of such urgent concern and so deserving of a positive response from the Government that I make no apologies for detaining the House with it this evening.

</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-32_para1">
Sham or bogus marriages are entered into by coercion, threats, bribes or other mechanisms, almost entirely for the purpose of remaining in the United Kingdom when all normal citizenship application mechanisms have failed. The problem is especially prevalent in London and the south-east, but it is certainly not unique to our part of the world. In fact, of the 80,000 ceremonies conducted annually, the Society of Registration Officers, the professional body that represents registrars throughout England and Wales&#151;I am delighted that its patron, my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) is here today and can attest to the scale of the problem&#151;estimates that one in five marriages celebrated, if that is the word, in a register office are bogus. I am indebted to the respected journalist Lewis Smith of <i>The Times</i> of London who, in an article on 3 May 2004, described some of the appalling situations that arise. Once a marriage has been notified to the registrar, and even if the registrar sees acts such as money changing hands, the putative bride kissing the wrong man or even one of the witnesses, wedding rings that do not fit and grooms unable to remember the name of the person they are about to marry, he or she cannot stop the marriage. It will continue, providing participants with access to the benefits of citizenship of this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-32_para2">
I mentioned that bribes are often offered. One registrar said that &#163;3,500 changed hands and one woman admitted that she had asked for a bogus or sham marriage, but was offered a generous discount if she would let the prospective groom sleep with her. She considered that and rejected it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-32_para3">
The Marriages Act 1836 and later legislation provide grounds on which a registrar can refuse to proceed with a marriage, but only if the couple are too closely related, are of the same gender or one or both of them are already married. Any other circumstances, such as bribes, coercion or threats, are not grounds on which the registrar can stop the marriage.
</p>

Were you to come with me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to the gracious Edwardian building that we call Ealing town hall, which is, sadly, just outside my constituency, but despite that serves a great many of my constituents, you would find in the wedding suite there a superb building, wonderfully gracefully appointed and staffed by excellent highly qualified and skilled staff, but those staff are angry. They are desperately depressed by the present circumstance in which they feel that they are, in effect, colluding with a system of sham and bogus marriages and unable to do anything about it. One of the senior officers estimated to me that, in the past 12 months, about 80 of the marriages that they were asked to celebrate were, in their opinion, bogus.

<a name="40513-32_para5">
If the registrar has severe doubts, he or she can supply all the details to the Home Office investigation section, which is conveniently located in Noble drive, Hayes, also just outside my constituency, but in the other direction. Of the large number of files that have been sent to the Home Office investigation section in the past 12 months, not one has been acknowledged or acted upon. In every one of those cases, a professionally qualified registrar had severe doubts about the validity of the marriage, supplied the information to the Home Office investigation section, and nothing happened.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-32_para6">
I have spoken to LACORS&#151;the local authorities co-ordinators of regulatory services&#151;which discussed the matter at its management committee on 26 March. It confirms that there are significant numbers of potentially bogus types of notices being given, not uniquely but in many cases in London local authorities. It is important to put it on record that one of the extremely unfortunate side effects of the preponderance of bogus marriages is the effect that that has on genuine marriages between British citizens and citizens of other countries, because they often feel compromised by the perception of falseness when someone marries a British citizen. In the majority of cases, as we know, that is not so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-32_para7">
LACORS feels seriously restricted in its ability to deal with the issue. If the Home Office does respond, as it has in some boroughs, though not in the borough of Ealing, in many cases it is to set up a trap in the register office, with immigration officers present. The prospect of an arrest or detention taking place during a marriage ceremony and somebody being bundled down the steps of the town hall into a waiting black Maria instead of a white Cadillac is deeply regrettable and paints a most unpleasant picture. Registrars do not want to be part of that process. If they have doubts, they want to be able to stop the wedding there and then.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-32_para8">
I accept that the Government are acting on the matter. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made a welcome statement on 22 April, in which, pointing out the action that the Government were taking, he admitted that every time he took a step to address the abuse,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;organised criminals behind the exploitation of normal, legitimate routes find a way round it.&quot;</p>

He was speaking particularly about bogus marriages. He referred to them as &quot;a real scandal.&quot; I entirely agree.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-32_para10">
Mark Rimmer, who has been appointed by the Government to investigate sham weddings, has interviewed registrars around the country. He found that 9,000 cases a year are reported to the Home Office team, which consists of six people&#151;9,000 cases to six people. I now understand why the traffic between Ealing register office and Noble drive, Hayes is one-way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-32_para11">
Registrars say that, where they have been trying to fend off fake marriages, the threats of official action are, in many cases, empty threats. The cunning, well-organised people operating in such a highly profitable area know that the threats are empty. The Home Secretary said that registrars might be given new powers to refuse to conduct marriages if they believed them to be a sham carried out for immigration purposes. I look to my hon. Friend the Minister for confirmation that that action is being taken. I understand that the Government also intend to designate only certain 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 565</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>register offices as authorised for marriages involving foreign nationals. That is greatly to be welcomed if, as I very much hope, that is the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-32_para12">
My brief research for this modest contribution to the warp and weft of the national legislative tapestry has led me into some strange areas, in particular, to the Marriage With Foreigners Act 1906. There are those in the House who are familiar with the Act; previously, I was not. The Act contained the right to demand a certificate of no impediment from someone getting married in the UK. It was superseded by the Marriages (Scotland) Act 1977. If someone from the north of Ireland or from Scotland wishes to get married in England, they must produce a certificate of no impediment, which provides, if not a cure, a filter for bogus marriages. However, somebody from within England marrying in England&#151;wherever the person they are marrying comes from&#151;does not need to provide such a certificate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-32_para13">
In a remarkable fit of generosity, the 1906 Act specifically excludes what subsequently became the Commonwealth countries from the definition of &quot;foreigners&quot;. It has to be said, regrettably, that Ghana and Nigeria are two countries that provide a large number of people who are considered to be involved in bogus marriages, and are, in some cases, convicted, yet those countries are excluded.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-32_para14">
I realise that there are those in the House who are wiser in the ways of the world than me but, apparently, the Civil Partnership Bill permitted the making of an order in council to allow the issue of certificates of no impediment. Up until then, I thought that the 1906 Act was almost analogous to the Easter Act 1928, which set by statute the day each year on which Easter could fall&#151;a good piece of legislation, which I am sure was passed with the good will of the House, but it was never implemented, simply because it was outside the authority of this House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-32_para15">
The 1906 Act&#151;it was disapplied in Scotland and superseded by the Marriage (Scotland) Act 1977, with which I know my hon. Friend the Minister is familiar&#151;was also provided for by order in council in relation to clauses 175 and 179 of the Civil Partnership Bill. We have legislation that we can use; we could require a certificate of no impediment that would provide the extra filter for false marriages.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-32_para16">
We have a problem at present, in that an extremely skilful, widely respected and professional body of men and women are in despair at what they see as the abuse of the act of marriage as performed by civil register officers in town halls and up and down the country. People are being victimised. My hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#039;s Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) is dealing with some particularly horrific cases where people have been physically threatened, bullied and coerced into undertaking such marriages. We must address the issue and I recognise that the Government take it seriously; I pay credit to them for that. However, we must give the registrars the tools with which to address the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-32_para17">

<br>&nbsp;<br>registrar to stop the process there and then because, in his or her professional opinion, the marriage should not proceed? It could then be referred to the Home Office or to any other agency that we wish. But we must set in train a process whereby we recognise the skill, professionalism and expertise of our registrars and the fact that they are acutely aware that their authority and functions are being abused by people in this way.

Sham marriages may have a slightly comic aspect, but although there may seem to be something funny about this issue, it is deeply serious. It is organised criminality and it could have severe and horrendous consequences, given the present state of the world and the war on terrorism, if people are allowed to access all the freedoms of this country by an entirely bogus and indefensible route. We have to stop it.

I am not some starry-eyed romantic who still believes that marriage is such a wonderful institution that nobody would ever corrupt or dilute it, or allow commerce or anything else to interfere with it. Personally, I have been happily married since 1976; I would have got married the year before, but Fulham got to the cup final, and there are certain priorities. I took marriage very seriously, and my wife, judging by her expression most nights, takes it equally seriously. However, the fact remains that, for some people, the institution of marriage is a key to the lock of the United Kingdom, as it allows them access. That is fine; it is all well and good if the marriage in question is real and subsisting, and legal and honestly contracted, but at the present time, far too many marriages&#151;possibly 20 per cent. in my part of the world&#151;are not valid, which taints the whole process.

<p>
<a name="40513-32_para20">
We have to address that issue. I am confident that the Government are already doing so, but I would simply ask them to do a little bit more to ensure that certificates of no impediment are introduced, that registrars are given authority and that we continue to give Government time, resources and attention to recognising that we have left registrars out on their own for too long. They have been trying to do an impossible job. They cannot do it, and they need our help. We in this House need to address this issue tonight.

<p><a name="40513-33_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration  (Mr.&nbsp;Desmond Browne): </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound) on securing this debate, and I thank him for taking this opportunity to highlight an issue that I consider important, as he knows, and that has recently been the subject of some public concern.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-33_para0">
As my hon. Friend pointed out&#151;I shall go into more detail later&#151;this issue has also recently been the subject of a significant and appropriate response from the Government. This is a particularly timely debate, as we have only recently announced a number of steps that we are taking to protect the integrity of our marriage ceremonies. I am grateful for the chance to expand on the recent announcements of the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary, to which my hon. Friend alluded.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-33_para1">
We already have arrangements in place to help to identify potential abuse of the marriage laws, and to prevent them from being used for the purposes of illegal immigration. Under section 24 of the Immigration and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 567</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Asylum Act 1999, registrars have a statutory duty to report suspicious marriages to the immigration and nationality directorate. Indeed, we in the Home Office are grateful to registrars such as those in Ealing, who have been prepared to report such marriages to us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-33_para2">
In 2003, the Ealing register office sent 48 reports of suspicious marriages to the Home Office under section 24 of the 1999 Act. Some 27 of those reports were sent to enforcement officers for action, and the remaining 21 were unsuitable for being sent on for one reason or another. If a report is lacking some detail or information, for example, officers are asked to contact the registrars before proceeding. I understand that that information may not have been communicated to the Ealing register office, and I shall ensure, among other things, that communication between the immigration offices and register offices is improved. In the short time that I have been in this job, I have met representatives of the registrars to discuss our response to this particular problem. I intend to meet them again, and my officials have been meeting them regularly since that initial meeting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-33_para3">
For the purposes of clarity, I should point out that a registrar already has the power to stop a ceremony where there is evidence of coercion or threats. It is also my understanding of the law that registrars have limited powers in relation to ceremonies where proper notice has been given and parties are authorised to be married. However, registrars should not allow a marriage notice to be given if they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person who wants to give the notice is lying in any of the statements or declarations. It will become apparent that the inadequacy of that power lies behind the changes that we are about to introduce. However, we must be careful, because registrars to whom I have spoken want me to ensure that we do not ask them to become immigration officers. I am sure that the appropriate balance will be struck in the steps that the Government are about to take.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-33_para4">
I have already referred to the duty on registrars under section 24 of the 1999 Act, which has helped the immigration service to build up its intelligence base and to target enforcement efforts on suspected organised attempts to abuse the system. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North gave a colourful example in which the groom was arrested and taken away, and a number of successful operations have been conducted. In 2003, for example, 110 people were arrested at suspected organised sham weddings and 37 people were charged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-33_para5">
We have also changed the immigration rules with effect from April 2003 to increase the probationary period for marriages. That period occurs after a marriage, and the change stops the practice of switching from short-term leave to stay in the United Kingdom to leave to stay on the grounds of marriage to a UK national. That practice was being used to avoid the more rigorous examination of marriage applications from posts abroad.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-33_para6">
I am grateful to my hon. Friend for bringing the Marriage with Foreigners Act 1906 to my attention earlier today, because I had an opportunity to examine it, and it appears that it only applies to marriages between British subjects and foreign nationals that take place outside the United Kingdom. He refers to the proposal in the Civil Partnership Bill to provide a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 568</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>certificate of no impediment from this country for a civil partnership between a British subject and a foreign national, and such certificates would also be required were such ceremonies to take place abroad. I will re-examine the 1906 Act, but I doubt whether it is an appropriate vehicle to address the issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-33_para7">
It has recently become clear, through the information received from registrars and other intelligence channels, that activity by those seeking to abuse UK marriage laws and enter into sham marriages as a means of circumventing immigration control is on the increase, but it is not easy for the Government to intervene. As my hon. Friend rightly points out, we do want to lay down rules that would make it harder for genuine couples to enter into marriage. Marriage law in this country has evolved over a considerable period of time, and, by and large, the formalities of marriage are currently set out in the law in the way in which people of this country want them to be set out. Any Government that sought to intervene in that area would do so with trepidation, and they would certainly not do it without the widest possible consultation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-33_para8">
I share my hon. Friend&#039;s intention to protect genuine couples, and that intention led us to abolish the primary purpose rule on 5 June 1997. That pernicious rule penalised genuine marriages, divided families and unnecessarily increased the administrative burden on the immigration system. It was imposed in 1980 by the previous Administration, and it forced applicants over one hurdle after another, both at the point of entry clearance and at appeal. It was inherently ineffective and unfair, and did not work to filter out those who sought to cheat the system, but simply punished those who did not. It was abolished not because, as the Conservative Home Affairs spokesman, the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis), suggested in a statement, it failed to deal with sham marriages, but because of its inequitable treatment of genuine marriages. We will rue the day that we bring it back. We will reflect on the lessons from the primary purpose rule before taking any steps to deal with sham marriages.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-33_para9">
It is clear, though, that where there is abuse we must move to stamp it out. We must ensure that our immigration system is robust in preventing those engaging in sham marriages from bending the rules. There are a number of ways in which we can tighten up the procedures to achieve that without impacting on genuine cases. As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said in his statement to the House on 22 April, we will shortly bring forward legislation to restrict the capacity to authorise marriage involving non-EEA nationals to designated register offices. I repeat that we are talking about the capacity to authorise marriages&#151;the Government do not intend to stop marriages being performed in register offices that couples choose, but to direct them to designated offices for authority. That will enable us to focus our enforcement efforts on a more concentrated area, and will allow intelligence and expertise on marriage abuse to be built up in those dedicated centres. We also believe&#151;this is its primary purpose&#151;that it will have a deterrent effect, because the chances of couples coming into contact with immigration officials will be much higher. That will not be welcome to those who are not genuine, and it will make them much less likely to try.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-33_para10">
We are also looking urgently at what more can be done specifically to address the apparent loophole of third country nationals who marry EEA nationals from other member states, then claim to be exercising treaty rights. We shall make a further announcement on that shortly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-33_para11">
We are exploring other possibilities, such as the proposal that registrars should have the power to refuse to conduct a marriage that they suspect is being carried out for the purposes of illegal immigration, or where they believe that false documents are being used, until the marriage has been properly investigated by the immigration authorities. However, that would require a fundamental change to marriage law and&#151;for the reasons that I gave, with which I know that my hon. Friend agrees&#151;merits wider consultation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-33_para12">
We have in hand enhanced enforcement action to target sham marriages, with a view to having a direct impact on the organised criminals who arrange them and seeking prosecutions where appropriate. We are strengthening arrangements for joint working between caseworkers and immigration officers to ensure a better focus on the intelligence that is gathered from registrars and elsewhere. Importantly, we have set up a new joint working group with the Home Office and registrars to share intelligence and ideas and to ensure that our efforts are as focused and effective as possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-33_para13">
The Government recognise that, as my hon. Friend was at pains to point out, a marriage is an important event in the lives of the people who are effecting that union in their relationship. It is very important, as he said, that places where that is done should be immune from the sorts of scenes that have unfortunately had to be played out in some register offices in response to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 May 2004 : Column 570</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>information about sham marriages taking place. It is important, too, that we recognise that the informality that has grown up over many decades around the formalities of marriage has generated an opportunity for organised criminals to take advantage of not only that set of circumstances but other people, in order to get round the immigration laws. As my hon. Friend says, significant amounts of money can change hands in relation to the facilitating of such events. That is an indication of the level of organised criminality that is involved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-33_para14">
The Government are absolutely determined to bring that practice to an end. We intend to make it as difficult as possible, to deter it, and, where it happens, to investigate it and prosecute appropriately. However, we are going to do that in a balanced way that does not interfere with the reasonable expectations of law-abiding people that, subject to checking the appropriateness of their marriage status, they will be able to have their celebratory event as easily and informally as they want to, without interference from the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40513-33_para15">
The Government will therefore continue to pursue a policy of managed migration to the UK, with procedures in place that will allow us to facilitate that for genuine applicants from whom our society derives real benefits. That includes those who wish to enter into genuine marriages with a UK or EEA national, settle here and contribute. We are absolutely determined that we will also protect the system from abuses in this and other areas. I am confident that the measures outlined will help to protect the institution of marriage within the UK, and help us to maintain appropriate and secure immigration control.
