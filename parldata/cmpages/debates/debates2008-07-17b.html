 I thank my hon. Friend for her reply. I raise the issue on behalf of the tens of thousands up and down the land who weekly do battle with invasive non-native species. In my case, it is the Japanese knotweed, which until three years ago I would not even have recognised, but which has been identified as the species crowding out the other plants and wildlife at the bottom of our chapel garden. I am aware that getting rid of it is probably a five-year mission&#151;in fact, the Japanese knotweed has been described to me as plant life, but not plant life as we know it. I urge the Minister to recognise that most people are totally unaware, as I was, of what non-native species look like or how to combat them. I urge her to redouble her efforts with the Environment Agency to raise public awareness of non-native species and how to deal with them and eradicate them.</p>

 I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for raising the issue. He is absolutely right to say that the public need to be much more aware. That is of course one of the reasons why we have launched the strategy. As he said, Japanese knotweed is a very troublesome invasive species. Not only is it a problem for gardeners, but, more critically, it damages biodiversity. It has to be cleared from all construction sites, because it can grow through tarmac, and causes major difficulties on river banks, creating flood risk. We are doing a great deal on that, but we need to do much more. We have tasked a working group on media and communications with developing a clear plan, including consideration of how the Government can work with stakeholders to target audiences more effectively. There is information available on the website of the non-native species secretariat, and DEFRA makes available fact sheets</p>

 I am grateful to my parliamentary neighbour, the hon. Member for Leicester, South (Sir Peter Soulsby), for raising this issue. I am sure the whole House will remember the Eradication of Mink Bill in 1995&#151;or possibly not. The point is that mink destroy any good work done for water voles through the biodiversity action plan, because they eat them. Will the Government take action to eradicate mink, which are doing huge damage to wildlife across the country?</p>

 I am advised that we publish figures by value. The investment that farmers must make in agricultural equipment is considerable, and if a farmer cannot take their stock to slaughter or harvest their crops, the impact is not only on the farmer but on all of us.

Obviously, all reports that are submitted in relation to the proposed expansion of Heathrow will be taken into account, as has been set out by the Secretary of State for Transport.</p>

 It seems to me that the Minister does not really know what he is talking about when he mentions reducing the burden of regulation. That is because his Department is perpetrating a complete con trick on the industry and the public, because it measures the burden of regulation only by what it calls &#147;administrative burdens&#148;. Why does he not allow for the full cost to industry of all these burdens? For example, DEFRA says that the admin cost of the catchment sensitive farming regulation is &#163;391,000 a year; it is actually &#163;210 million a year. DEFRA says that the cost of the nitrates directive is &#163;1.5 million a year, but the true cost, including all the investment that industry has to make, is &#163;250 million a year. Despite all the Government&#146;s warm words about farming, the Department is stifling farmers&#146; ability to compete.</p>

One person&#146;s regulation is another&#146;s protection&#151;a point that is often missed. Many of the regulations to which he refers are supported by the industries because they help to ensure that the cowboys and bad guys do not get an unfair advantage. He has made an accusation about costs, but he has completely ignored the costs to the taxpayer of non-regulation of environmental protection. For example, what would he say to the water industry, which spends &#163;288 million a year treating nitrates from run-off? I suppose that he would not include that as a cost.</p>

 In Sir Michael&#146;s report he lays emphasis on the importance of improving the resilience of utilities&#146; facilities where there are cases of severe flooding. What reassurance, pursuant to the last answer given by the Minister of State, can the Secretary of State give me that the cost of utilities improving the resilience of their facilities in view of flooding will not be passed on to consumers, but will come from the balance sheets of the companies?</p>

 As the right hon. Gentleman will know, ultimately that is a matter for the regulator, but I am able to report to the House that National Grid has purchased 1.2 km of relocatable defences like the ones that were used to protect Walham during the flooding last year; CE Electric has purchased seven temporary defence kits; and EDF Energy has also purchased a number. The National Grid and Central Networks have put defences around Walham and Castlemead substations following the floods last year. That demonstrates to the House how, now that all of us have had a wake-up call, the utility companies are responding.</p>

 I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for his work on packaging, which is very important. The reason why we must pay a lot of attention to packaging is that in many cases it is avoidable. The public believe that it is avoidable, and they want something done about it. So we will not resile from that. We recently produced information through WRAP&#151;the Waste and Resources Action Programme&#151;which is the Government-funded organisation that deals with waste, that shows us that in the current market, kerbside sorting is more effective for local authorities than single co-mingling, and that costs are similar if two streams are co-mingled but paper is kept separate. So local authorities can benefit from kerbside separation. Kerbside sort achieves the higher-quality recyclates that my hon. Friend wants to see produced. So we are providing a great deal of assistance to local authorities and giving them advice. Contrary to the popular belief that co-mingling is the easiest thing for consumers, we have found that the size of bins matters in determining how much consumers recycle. We will not hesitate to try to get better recycling quality and levels from our local authorities, because that is what our citizens want.</p>

He is right to draw to the House&#146;s attention the fact that the Fisheries Council met on 15 July, when we discussed bringing in new flexibilities and new regulations for the European fisheries fund. The flexibilities will allow for some decommissioning, not just of whole fleets but, as we discussed with the Commissioner, of fleet segments, either geographically or by sector. We will look closely at, and talk to the industry about, the changes that are being made, so that we can implement them to best effect. As I have said in previous debates, both to him and to the industry, I do not subscribe to subsidies for red diesel. I know that prices have gone up greatly, but for the fishing industry, no duty is applied.

The decision was originally taken in principle by the international community in 2002 to allow a number of African states that had legal stockpiles of ivory to undertake a one-off sale.

The Post Office is a unique institution&#151;it is the only one with outlets throughout the rural areas of this country&#151;but the Government have imposed access criteria on it. If the Department for Work and Pensions, for administrative convenience, awards the card account contract to anyone but the Post Office, people throughout rural Britain will find it difficult to collect their pensions in the way that the Government have promised they will be able to. Will the Leader of the House therefore ensure that a statement is made on the issue before the House rises so that Members can question and respond to it? Will she ensure that the statement is not left until the recess? If the Government do wait until the recess, will that not send a warning to our many constituents that the Government are planning yet again to ditch the Post Office and take more business away from it.</p>

 Will my right hon. and learned Friend consider having a debate on sentencing policy for those found guilty of human trafficking and modern forms of slavery? I ask that not in the light of highly paid footballers, but because of a recent case where an accountant trafficked a 14-year-old Ghanaian girl into the UK and kept her as an unpaid servant&#151;or possibly slave&#151;for a number of years, but was sentenced to only 18 months in prison.

 My hon. Friend raises an important issue. It is important that those who have committed human trafficking offences are brought to justice, not only for the sake of their victims, but as a deterrent to others. It is important, too, that the courts pass sentences that make it clear to people all around the world that this country will not be a safe haven for human traffickers. My hon. Friend made a point about sentencing. I understand that the Sentencing Advisory Panel considered the issue of human trafficking a couple of years ago, along with sexual offences more broadly. However, if I am not right on that, I will ask the Home Secretary whether it would be appropriate to refer the issue to the Sentencing Advisory Panel, bearing in mind the fact that she is looking into the question of human trafficking.</p>

 Hundreds of thousands of Equitable Life policyholders know that the Government did everything that they could to obstruct the report that has been published, and to delay the time when that investigation reached its conclusions.

 With permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I should like to make a statement about the service personnel Command Paper, which I am publishing today and which has been laid before the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para2"><a name="08071780000300">The men and women of our armed forces are a force for good. I know that the whole House is proud of the work that they do in dangerous and challenging circumstances, whether in Iraq or Afghanistan, or closer to home. All around the world, every day, they demonstrate their courage, dedication and professionalism, risking injury and death in the service of their country. They are a credit to the nation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para3"><a name="08071780000301">Increasingly, the level of support provided to our forces by the Government, and also more widely by the nation, has come under scrutiny from the public, the media and, most importantly, those in the services and their families. It is absolutely right that that should be the case. If we ask our forces to risk their lives in order to keep us safe, we should all be prepared to look after them while they are in service and afterwards. I believe that we have made a number of big improvements to the lives of our people in the past two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para4"><a name="08071780000302">We have introduced the first ever tax-free operational bonus, we have invested substantial additional money to improve our armed forces&#146; accommodation and we have awarded them among the highest pay increases in the public sector. However, we can and should do more. Last year, the Prime Minister and I asked ministerial colleagues across government what more we could do and should be doing to demonstrate our gratitude for the service and sacrifice of our service personnel. The result, led by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces, is today&#146;s Command Paper&#151;the first ever truly cross-Government approach to demonstrating our commitment to the armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para5"><a name="08071780000303">The Command Paper was not just a cross-Government effort. We also consulted our external reference group, among others, widely and in detail. That group comprised the Royal British Legion, the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association, the Confederation of British Service and ex-Service Organisations, the armed forces families&#146; federations and the War Widows Association of Great Britain. I am delighted that they have so warmly welcomed the publication of this paper and will continue to work with us on its delivery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para6"><a name="08071780000304">This Command Paper is underpinned by two fundamental principles. The first is to remove any disadvantage. The nature of their work and the requirements of service life means that our people, and their families, can face disadvantage in their daily lives. Many of them move locations frequently, often with no choice of where or when, and schooling can be disrupted as a result. They might lose their place on a national health service waiting list, for example, or lose out on an in vitro fertilisation procedure. Many of the measures in the paper are therefore aimed at ending that disadvantage. They seek to ensure that service personnel and their families receive continuity of public services wherever they are based and wherever they are obliged to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para7"><a name="08071780000305">The second fundamental principle is that where special treatment is required in order to recognise those who have sacrificed the most, we must and should provide it.  <br>

This is a comprehensive package of 40 measures covering almost every aspect of life, from health care, education and transport to housing, resettlement and the care of veterans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para8"><a name="08071780000306">I want to highlight just a few of the commitments that we are announcing today. Right hon. and hon. Members are only too aware of the terrible price that some members of our armed forces have paid, suffering mental and physical injuries that will be with them and their families for the rest of their lives. Every Member of this House would agree with me that as a Government we should be willing to make the following commitment: if those personnel have been injured serving their nation, then the Government and the nation must ensure that we support them as much as they need for as long as they need. We must aim to offer the best possible continuous care from the point of injury, through to recovery and beyond, for the rest of their life. The measures set out in the paper are aimed at doing just that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para9"><a name="08071780000307">One of the key changes that we are announcing today is an increase in the compensation payments for personnel who suffer injuries due to their service. I understand that no amount of money can ever make up for the pain and sacrifice that these brave people have endured. However, we need to recognise the special nature of their sacrifice. The top-level tariffs in the armed forces compensation scheme will be doubled, affecting about 80 of the most seriously injured people who have already made claims since the scheme began in 2005. Obviously, it will apply to the most serious claims in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para10"><a name="08071780000308">These things are quite complex as the compensation scheme has many different levels. In practical terms, though, that means that the lump sum awarded for the most serious injuries, which was previously between about &#163;50,000 and &#163;285,000, will double. The new maximum award for an injury will be &#163;570,000. Everyone with an award for injury under the compensation scheme will benefit and the most seriously injured will benefit the most. On discharge, the most seriously injured will also continue to get tax-free income throughout their lives&#151;the annual guaranteed income payment, which is also index-linked&#151;so overall the lifetime payout could be in excess of &#163;1.5 million. Furthermore, these compensation payments for those who are severely disabled will now be disregarded from the local authority means test when they are applying for the disabled facilities grant. That means that seriously injured personnel who receive a lump sum under the armed forces compensation scheme or war pension scheme will not have to spend that money adapting their homes. That money was intended by this House to be compensation for serious injuries, and this approach will guarantee that that intention is fulfilled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para11"><a name="08071780000309">That change is in addition to a host of other changes: seriously injured personnel will be prioritised in waiting lists for adapted social housing; we will roll out community mental health services for veterans nationwide, following successful pilots launched earlier this year; at the earliest opportunity, we will extend free bus travel across England to those service personnel and veterans under the age of 60 who have been seriously injured through service, and Scotland and Wales will do similar; and finally, severely disabled veterans will have an automatic entitlement to blue badges, which provide parking concessions, for life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para12"><a name="08071780000310">Everyone in this House knows that none of those things can make up for the injuries that some people will bear for the remainder of their lives. Nothing can do that. We owe this immense debt, and although it can never sufficiently be repaid, we should, and we will, do our utmost to acknowledge it. The Government will also strive to mitigate the disruptive consequences of mobility on family and everyday life. For example, we will provide continuity of national health service care for service families by ensuring that they retain their relative place on NHS waiting lists across the UK, however often they move, and we will take steps to improve NHS dentists for service families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para13"><a name="08071780000311">We will also minimise the disruption to education suffered by many service children. To that end, we will do the following: review admissions policy to ensure that service children are treated fairly in the allocation of school places; ensure that special educational needs support is uninterrupted when children move schools; and give service children priority access to places at state boarding schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para14"><a name="08071780000312">Those who choose to leave the armed forces will enjoy a greater level of support, ensuring a smooth transition to civilian life. We will give free further or higher education to service leavers of more than six years&#146; experience, up to first degree level. That means that a soldier, sailor or airman can join the armed forces from school, secure in the knowledge that six or more years&#146; service will be rewarded with the chance of a college or university education free from tuition fees. We will also make it easier for service leavers to find homes, whether through the purchase of their own properties or through social housing. We recognise that the mobility of the average service career&#151;typically, people move every two years&#151;means that individuals often prefer to wait until they leave the armed forces before buying a home. For that reason, we will extend the key worker living scheme so that service personnel are eligible for its assistance to purchase homes for one year after they leave the forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para15"><a name="08071780000313">Social housing will also be more accessible to service leavers. In the past, service leavers had difficulties obtaining social housing, as local authorities prioritise individuals with a &#147;local connection&#148; to the area. This legislation will be changed, enabling personnel to establish a &#147;local connection&#148; and so settle in the location of their choice. That is not all, because we will make empty MOD properties available to service leavers as an interim measure, and we will work with the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Housing Corporation and charities to reduce the incidence of homelessness, which will include building new supported housing on gifted MOD land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para16"><a name="08071780000314">In this Command Paper, the Government have listened to the real needs of the service community and responded to those identified needs, introducing real improvements. We are as committed to our armed forces and veterans as they are committed to us, and we will deliver on these promises; after all, it is the very least we can do. The measures I have outlined are the Government&#146;s&#151;and, indeed, the nation&#146;s&#151;commitment to honour and care for those who have sacrificed most in service to their country, and let me make it absolutely clear that this is for the long term. It is the product of many months of concerted effort by Government Departments and the  <br>

devolved Administrations. We are determined to make this stick, and we will put in place mechanisms to ensure that we deliver. I commend this Command Paper on the nation&#146;s commitment to our armed forces, their families and veterans to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o185"><a name="08071780000315"><a name="80717-0006.htm_spnew15"><a name="08071780000849"><b>Dr. Liam Fox (Woodspring) (Con):</b>
 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for his statement and for prior sight of it. Conservatives welcome any measures to help our armed forces and their families, and indeed many of the proposals announced today echo proposals that we have made over the past year. Although it may have taken a long time for the Government to introduce this package of measures, if this is the beginning of a genuinely constructive and bipartisan approach to the welfare of our armed forces, their families and service veterans, the whole country will welcome it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para17"><a name="08071780000316">No other group in our society is asked to make the sort of sacrifices that our armed forces make on our behalf. Those on both sides of the House who have visited our troops in Iraq or Afghanistan know the hardships that they face. Those who have talked to service families about how they feel when they hear that another soldier has been killed or injured but they have not yet learned the name of the person involved marvel at their courage. Those who have visited young soldiers in Selly Oak or Headley Court have been humbled by the soldiers&#146; lack of self pity in the face of great adversity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para18"><a name="08071780000317">May I ask the Secretary of State to clarify a number of points in his statement, starting with the compensation issue? We welcome the doubling of the maximum award for the most seriously injured, but he will be aware that the points system determines eligibility for the most serious injury payment and that it has attracted much criticism. That issue has been raised by hon. Members on both sides of the House. Does he believe that the system is sufficiently holistic in its approach? What plans are there for a review of it, and when will that take place?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para19"><a name="08071780000318">Secondly, the Secretary of State said, &#147;Everyone with an award for injury under the compensation scheme will benefit&#148;. Will he clarify that? Does he mean that there will be an automatic uprating of all awards made since 2005, and if so, when will such changes be made? What of those injured in Iraq or Afghanistan before 2005? What changes will be made to bring their treatment and compensation into line with the changes announced today for those injured after 2005? The public will find it hard to accept an arbitrary date for discrimination in treatment. May I remind the House that between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2005, 33 UK military personnel were categorised as very seriously injured and 78 were categorised as seriously injured, and that in Afghanistan between 2001 and 2005, six were categorised as very seriously injured and four as seriously injured? What will happen to them?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="80717-0006.htm_para20"><a name="08071780000319">Can the Secretary of State also tell us how many claims have been made by former service personnel against the MOD in the civil courts, how many such claims are outstanding and what the estimated liability is? What assessment has he made of the likely impact of today&#146;s statement on those claims? Finally, will more money be made available from the Treasury for the changes that he has announced today, and if so, how much? We do not want the MOD to be forced to cut other parts of an already overstretched budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="80717-0007.htm_para0"><a name="08071780000320">We welcome other moves that have been announced, but we will want to examine the practicalities. For example, providing good mental health services to veterans requires better integration between defence medicine and the NHS, and although the aim of providing better access to NHS dentistry for service families is desirable, it will not be helped by the fact that the number of NHS dentists declined by a further 500 in 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="80717-0007.htm_para1"><a name="08071780000321">We would also like to re-examine the issue of the educational status of those leaving the forces, which the Secretary of State mentioned. Many of those who have taken an interest in this issue point out that the underskilling of those who leave the services early is often a greater problem than the one in respect of those leaving after six years. I hope that the Government will re-examine how such people might also be helped.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="80717-0007.htm_para2"><a name="08071780000322">Finally, may I thank all in the media, in charities and among the general public who have campaigned so tirelessly for the better treatment of our service personnel and their families, and our veterans? Specifically, may I thank Freddie Forsyth and his team, which includes Simon Weston, for the work that they have done for the commission that was set up by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition on service welfare? I hope that the Secretary of State will acknowledge what has been a great act of public service on their part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="80717-0007.htm_para3"><a name="08071780000323">How we deal with our armed forces is symptomatic of the values of our society. Ultimately, we will have to deal with the overstretch that contributes to many of the problems that those in our armed forces and their families face, but today there has been a welcome acknowledgement of how much needs to be done.</p>

<p><a name="st_o186"><a name="08071780000324"><a name="80717-0007.htm_spnew0"><a name="08071780000850"><b>Des Browne:</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his welcome of this package. I appreciate that he has not had the time to go through it in detail, but as he understands more about it and the impact that it will have, he will recognise that it faithfully represents the issues that members of the armed forces and their advocates, including those organisations he identified, have brought to our attention. We have been engaged in a detailed and ongoing consultation, which we announced last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="80717-0007.htm_para4"><a name="08071780000325">I say to the hon. Gentleman that we should all avoid trying to stand on that small space normally occupied by <i> The Sun</i>, and claiming to be &#147;the persons wot dunnit&#148;. There will be significant competition for the credit for these proposals, but they are the result of a genuinely co-operative effort, which has been going on in some detail for a long time, to identify the needs of our service personnel. The announcement reflects the issues that service people and their families brought to us through various organisations and in several ways. For example, many people contacted us about their individual circumstances, but we have an obligation to keep those communications confidential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="80717-0007.htm_para5"><a name="08071780000326">The hon. Gentleman asked several questions about the uplift in the tariff rates of the armed forces scheme. I am satisfied that the tariff approach to a no-fault compensation scheme is the only fair way to conduct that process. He referred in passing to civil claims. When there is an allegation of negligence, one can treat the calculation of compensation differently, but when there is no fault, there has to be transparency and fairness, and some form of tariff. That is now well established in public policy, and previous Governments have had similar schemes.</p>
<br>

<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>17 July 2008 : Column 424</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="80717-0007.htm_para6"><a name="08071780000327">I am satisfied that the scheme works and is fair. I am always prepared to consider reviewing it to make it more transparent and fair, but the doubling will go down to tariff level 6; the hon. Gentleman may be familiar with the structure of the scheme. Below that, there will be increases, but they will not be proportionately as large as those for the most seriously injured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="80717-0007.htm_para7"><a name="08071780000328">The hon. Gentleman asks when the changes will come into effect. He will know that, because it is a statutory scheme, they cannot come into effect until the relevant legislation has been laid. Secondary legislation has to be laid, and that requires a period of consultation. We will publish the detail so that people can see the effect of the scheme on the tariff levels as soon as we are able to do so. There will be a short period of consultation, and then I expect, because of the general welcome for the changes, that the House will approve the proposals. We will have a relevant benefit uplift for everybody who has made an application to the scheme since it started in 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="80717-0007.htm_para8"><a name="08071780000329">The hon. Gentleman asks me to do something that I am not aware any Government have ever done&#151;to make the scheme retrospective and apply it to people who were compensated or supported under an entirely different scheme of compensation. I hasten to add that the previous scheme was inherited from the previous Government. There was dissatisfaction with that, and we have changed the scheme, but it is not appropriate, in public policy terms, to apply the changes retrospectively to people whose compensation or support was calculated under a different scheme, given that many people&#151;not just those who have been in Iraq&#151;still receive income under that scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="80717-0007.htm_para9"><a name="08071780000330">The hon. Gentleman asks whether additional resources will be provided. Substantial additional resources will be provided, but they will be gleaned from the budgets of other Departments. We joined with those Departments and the devolved Administrations to ensure that resources could be identified to meet the principles set out in this paper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="80717-0007.htm_para10"><a name="08071780000331">Finally, on the hon. Gentleman&#146;s specific questions, he asked about the civil claims. He will appreciate that I do not have that information with me, but I will ensure that he gets it and that it is shared with him and made available to all Members. I thank him for the tribute that he paid to our armed forces. He knows that I share his view that they are excellent people who do excellent work very bravely and professionally. I am pleased that there is such consensus of welcome for the changes in the House and I hope that we will all work to ensure that they are implemented as quickly as possible and that the Government are kept to their promises.</p>

<p><a name="st_o187"><a name="08071780000332"><a name="80717-0007.htm_spnew1"><a name="08071780000851"><b>Willie Rennie (Dunfermline and West Fife) (LD):</b>
 I thank the Secretary of State for giving me advance sight of the statement and for the statement itself. I, too, wish to pay tribute to those who have sacrificed so much for their country, including one of my constituents, Sergeant Scott Paterson, who was recently badly injured in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="80717-0007.htm_para11"><a name="08071780000333">Who could disagree with these welcome proposals, which are a great step in the right direction? The bus travel, the blue badges, the further and higher education and the compensation uplift, as well as the priority in housing, health&#151;especially mental health&#151;and education for veterans, are all positive steps in the right direction.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="17 July 2008">

<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>17 July 2008 : Column 425</b><br>
I will withhold judgment, however, until I see the final details, because many of the proposals include proposals to change priorities and move people up lists. Because such changes are complex and fraught with difficulties, I would like to see the details of the proposals before making a final judgment on them. I can pledge the support of this party in making the proposals work effectively on the ground, where support from local councils, the Scottish Parliament or the Welsh Assembly is required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="80717-0007.htm_para12"><a name="08071780000334">I was surprised that no proposals were made to speed up the upgrade of the notoriously poorly maintained single living accommodation. Nor was there anything on the rights of the Gurkhas. Especially given recent coverage of the issue, I would have expected something about their rights to live in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="80717-0007.htm_para13"><a name="08071780000335">I was disappointed, although not surprised, that no mention was made of the real issue&#151;the elephant in the room. It is bunkum to suggest that these proposals will address overstretch in our armed forces. We are asking them to do too much on two fronts, in Afghanistan and Iraq. Until we address that serious issue, we will continue to see discontent among our armed forces. I urge the Minister to review our operations, especially in Iraq. The tempo of operations there is placing enormous pressure on our armed forces and their families, and unless the issue is addressed, including withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, we will for ever be fiddling at the edges.</p>

<p><a name="st_o188"><a name="08071780000336"><a name="80717-0007.htm_spnew2"><a name="08071780000852"><b>Des Browne:</b>
 I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s warm welcome for the announcements, although he did get to the &#147;but&#148; eventually. I thank him for his tribute to the armed forces and recognise the special contribution that his constituent, Scott Paterson, made. I know of his circumstances, but as Secretary of State, I cannot single him out. He is one of many who have suffered injuries and borne them with great stoicism and courage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="80717-0007.htm_para14"><a name="08071780000337">The hon. Gentleman suggests that the implication of the proposals is that service people will move up lists. That may be the case, but the intention and the principle, which we have stated at the outset, are that members of the armed forces and their families should not be disadvantaged by their circumstances. No member of the armed forces came to me and said that they wanted to be able to jump up lists for treatment or for their children to be treated better than any other children. They said that they did not want their lifestyle, which they accept, to operate to their disadvantage. We are trying to find ways to ensure that that principle is observed. We are not asking for people to jump up lists and, indeed, members of the armed forces and their families would be the last people who would want to queue-jump. They are much more likely to stand back and let others go first, but they do not want to be disadvantaged. That is the point, with respect to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="80717-0007.htm_para15"><a name="08071780000338">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned a failure to deal with the issue of accommodation. When he gets an opportunity to read the paper in detail&#151;the devil is always in the detail&#151;he will see that paragraph 3.5 and the following paragraphs are devoted to accommodation. In part, they point out what has been achieved, and that is something that I think that he does not appreciate.  <br>

<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>17 July 2008 : Column 426</b><br>
We have invested &#163;1.4 billion in delivering single-living accommodation, and to date that has produced 26,000 new bed spaces. A further 30,000 are planned, as part of a planned investment in accommodation in excess of &#163;8 billion over the next decade. So it is not correct to say that we are not giving accommodation the priority that it deserves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="80717-0007.htm_para16"><a name="08071780000339">Finally, the hon. Gentleman identified what he considers the real issue, and I shall say two things in response. First, I regularly meet our forces doing their jobs in the operational environment. They never complain to me about their morale when they are doing their jobs, because that is when they are at their happiest, most content and most professional. There is no morale problem when we ask people to do what we have trained them to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="80717-0007.htm_para17"><a name="08071780000340">Secondly, I recognise that our armed forces are operating at a tempo that is beyond what we planned for. I have said time and time again at this Dispatch Box that it is our intention to deal with that. In my term as Secretary of State for Defence, we have already drawn down significantly in Iraq. We are in transition, and we intend to do more in the way of draw-down to resolve the tempo problem.</p>

 My hon. Friend identifies an important point. I pay tribute to him for the lengths that he goes to, along with some other hon. Members, to make sure that he knows exactly the circumstances of our troops, both in the operational theatre and otherwise. At the heart of the proposal and the infrastructure put in place to support it will be a committee, chaired by the Cabinet Office. Its membership will include representatives of the external reference group who were involved in advising us, as well as representatives of all the Government Departments, including the MOD, that are required to deliver on these promises.</p>

However, will the Secretary of State reflect on the fact that people leaving the armed forces prematurely say that the single most important reason for their decision is the excessive separation from their families? That is a product of the fact that the armed forces have been operating well beyond the defence planning assumptions for most of the years since those assumptions were set in the 1998 strategic defence review. Is it not time now to have a debate about what the defence planning assumptions should be? Even if we were to succeed in withdrawing substantially from Iraq in short order&#151;and I doubt that that is in our national interest&#151;it would not be long before another theatre of operations demanded our attention. That is the role that we pursue in our national interest. Can we have an open and public debate over the next few months about the defence planning assumptions, so that we can begin to recalibrate our defence policy to reflect the world as it is&#151;</p>

 First, on behalf of service personnel, their families and their extended families&#151;that is, their parents and even grandparents&#151;may I thank the Secretary of State for the Command Paper? I consider it to be a major improvement in the military covenant for this country. In no way do I wish to appear churlish, but there is one matter that I hope my right hon. Friend will clarify. The Command Paper says that people who leave the service will get one year&#146;s key worker status, but it does not mention anything about free higher or further education. When military personnel leave the forces it sometimes takes them two or three years to become acclimatised to civilian life. Will people be given the opportunity to go into free higher or further education even three or four years after leaving the services?</p>

 May I say to the Secretary of State that these measures are extremely welcome? I wish that the paper had appeared slightly earlier, but I do not want to seem churlish about the measures that it contains. However, the right hon. Gentleman has not mentioned those people who are sick but continue to serve. There has been a huge erosion in fighting power, particularly in our combat arms. For instance, 20 per cent. of the strength of the 3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery are unfit for operations, while 39 men in the 1st Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment have been diagnosed with seriously injured hearing and cannot return to the front. That is a matter of grave concern, and it compounds the manning and staffing crisis that our combat arms are facing. Will the Secretary of State give a clear and positive answer about what we are doing about the problem?</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman knows, we have invested significantly in the medical care of our armed forces, and at the heart of that is the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine. Our investment has built on reforms initially put in place by the previous Government, although we have radically accelerated those reforms. When the Select Committee examined medical care, it produced a report that I thought was very complimentary. I understand that we face a challenge when it comes to service personnel who are too ill to be deployed, for example, but he will know that Headley Court is the jewel in the UK&#146;s crown when it comes to rehabilitative medicine. We have announced an additional investment of &#163;24 million in that facility. We continue to research and invest to ensure that we maintain the health of our armed forces. It is our ability to identify the problems and to respond to them through the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre that has inspired the compliments that have been paid to our defence medical services. However, there is still more work to be done.</p>

Apart from the mental health pilots, which were extremely successful and which we are now about to roll out across the country, one of the things that we put in place early was the tracking system to enable us to keep in contact with our people, recognising that the symptoms of mental health problems sometimes have a late onset.

 I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman makes in welcoming this announcement. This compensation scheme started in 2005. We have committed ourselves to a system of benefits that will ensure that all those who have been compensated under the scheme will have been treated in exactly the same way as all those who prospectively make an application to the scheme. Those who were dealt with under an entirely different scheme, which operated an entirely different method, are continuing to receive the benefits, although some of them have yet to receive the benefits under the qualifications in that scheme. I think it would be dishonest of me to suggest that any Government would be likely to apply the changes to one scheme retrospectively to an entirely different scheme altogether, but I recognise the point that the hon. Gentleman makes. There may be other ways in which we can support those people, and certainly some of the other improvements that are announced in the document that we have published today will be of benefit to them.</p>

Since 1995, the number of violent incidents recorded in the British crime survey has fallen by half, representing around 750,000 fewer victims. We have met our target, set in 2004, to reduce crime by 15 per cent. Indeed, we have exceeded it; crime over that period fell by 18 per cent., and the chances of being a victim of crime are now at their lowest since 1981.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="80717-0008.htm_para4"><a name="08071780000385">This success is a tribute to the police service of this country&#151;the men and women, warranted officers, police community support officers and staff across the growing police family, to whose bravery and dedication we owe so much. Whether working in one of over 3,600 neighbourhood policing teams, forming the backbone of emergency response policing, tackling the threat of terrorism or working in specialist victim support roles, our police service is the envy of the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="80717-0008.htm_para5"><a name="08071780000386">We stand today at a crossroads for the future of policing: over a decade of record investment; a bigger and more flexible work force; and now neighbourhood policing everywhere in England and Wales, alongside new technologies and improved systems. But the service also faces unprecedented challenges. From new forms of criminal activity and terrorism to new ways of working in partnership locally, the service&#146;s scope has never been so broad and public expectations have never been so high. Both Sir Ronnie Flanagan and Louise Casey, in their separate but linked reviews of policing and crime, have emphasised how important it is that the public can feel that they are able to influence policing priorities and that people know what they can expect from their police locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="80717-0008.htm_para6"><a name="08071780000387">The public want a new deal with their police service, and I know that the service wants to deliver to the highest standards for the public everywhere. The public are the best weapon in the fight against crime, but they need to be clear about what they can expect from the police. They want to see transparent, reliable and responsive policing. That will drive greater public confidence. Today I, along with the leaders of the service, accept the challenge of driving up public confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="80717-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08071780000388">To deliver on that ambition, the Green Paper will set out nationally agreed rights to be in place in every police force by the end of the year. Those rights will form the new policing pledge, with both national and local elements, that clearly expresses what we can  each expect from our police service and that ensures that the public&#146;s voice is heard during the setting of police priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="80717-0008.htm_para8"><a name="08071780000389">The police are committing to minimum service standards everywhere. That means, for example, that as well as performing excellently in getting to emergencies when we need them to, the police will now offer appointments for non-urgent calls at a time convenient to the individual concerned and within 48 hours. In addition, we will legislate to strengthen the democratic link with the public by introducing local, directly elected crime and policing representatives. They will form the majority on police authorities, and will be responsible for ensuring that the police are tackling the priorities that concern us most, including by chairing their local crime and disorder reduction partnerships. Local information, with crime maps everywhere by the end of the year, will further empower the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="80717-0008.htm_para9"><a name="08071780000390">To give the police the tools to do the job and the time to spend on the front line, we will invest a further &#163;25 million over the next two years to put more mobile data devices in the hands of front-line officers. By March 2010, the additional &#163;75 million that the Government will have invested in those forms of police information technology will have meant an extra 30,000 mobile devices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="80717-0008.htm_para10"><a name="08071780000391">Furthermore, we will implement across England and Wales the current pilots on cutting the bureaucracy around crime recording and on scrapping the stop and account form. Jan Berry, the former chairman of the Police Federation, will take on the work that Sir Ronnie Flanagan has begun by becoming a new independent champion for the ongoing reduction of police bureaucracy. She will be a powerful voice for the concerns of front-line officers. However, today I want to go further. I have decided that the time is now right to strip away all but one top-down target for police forces, to deliver improved levels of public confidence that crime is being tackled. That is a direct response to calls from chief officers for the space and freedom to focus on tackling crime. It is a significant mark of my trust in them.</p>

It is our response to the views expressed by front-line officers and staff up and down the country and by the communities that they serve. It represents a new deal, and will mean greater freedom for the police, matched by greater power for the public. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

Recorded violent crime has virtually doubled in 10 years. Police numbers are up by 10 per cent., and detection rates for violent offences are down by a quarter. We know why there is a problem; after all, we have had five Labour reviews of policing. Does the Home Secretary accept Sir Ronnie Flanagan&#146;s surgical dissection of serial ministerial failures which revealed &#147;perverse incentives&#148;, a &#147;raft&#148; of targets and officers &#147;straitjacketed by process&#148;?

is needed to free up the police: less red tape, fewer targets and greater local accountability of police to the communities that they serve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="80717-0008.htm_para13"><a name="08071780000395">The Green Paper offers some constructive ideas, but I have to say that virtually all of them originate from this side of the House. Take the Conservative crime mapping proposals; they were announced in April and are already being implemented by a Conservative Mayor of London&#151;months later, they have been pinched by the Home Secretary for her policing pledge. Take her piloting of the abolition of the stop and account form. That is a greatly watered-down version of the nationwide overhaul that we proposed in February to free up nearly 1 million police hours to get officers back on the street. Why not scrap them altogether, as we propose? There is also the promise to review the onerous bureaucratic burden that the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 places on the most basic investigations. That is a straight lift from Conservative party policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80717-0008.htm_para14"><a name="08071780000396">I also note that the Home Secretary has said that she wants to strip away all but one top-down target for the police. That, however, is not how it is stated in the Green Paper itself. Will she guarantee that these targets will not be reintroduced in some new form? There is also a string of rehashed, reheated and half-baked announcements. Neighbourhood policing teams, for example, were announced three years ago and again six months ago&#151;why have they been announced again today? Perhaps she would like to tell the House. As far as I can recollect, monthly victim progress reports were announced in 2005, but they have been reheated today for media consumption, so presumably they were never implemented. There is also a series of police response targets. I ask the Home Secretary to identify one of them that is new.</p>

When will the Government learn that perpetual repackaging is no substitute for real delivery?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="80717-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08071780000399">Then there are the typically ill-thought-through eye-catching gestures that have little bearing on reality. How will the Home Secretary implement the utterly implausible guarantee that 80 per cent. of police time will be spent on patrol, when the proportion is currently only 14 per cent? Is that not what she really means and is there not an obfuscation in the Green Paper? Who does the Home Secretary think she is kidding in announcing the appointment of a police bureaucracy champion? I am delighted to hear of Jan Berry&#146;s appointment, but I gently point out to the Home Secretary that the previous post of national bureaucracy adviser has been kept vacant by the Government for two whole years. The half-hearted proposal for a crime representative on police authorities is a pale imitation of the Conservative commitment to directly elected local police commissioners.</p>

In the meantime, there is a gun crime every hour, there are five fatal stabbings every week, and we still do not have any proper Government information on violence against under-16-year-olds, although the information has been demanded by Members on both sides of the House for years.</p>

The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) claimed earlier this year that neighbourhood policing teams had somehow not been delivered. In fact, thanks to the hard work of police forces across the country and to the &#163;1 billion of Government investment, there is now a neighbourhood policing team in every neighbourhood in the country. That has resulted in a radical transformation in policing, and today&#146;s Green Paper will enable us to take that reform to the next stage by making clear in the pledge the quality of service that people will be able to expect everywhere in England and Wales for the first time ever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="80717-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08071780000406">The hon. and learned Gentleman asked which elements of the pledge were new. It is new that 80 per cent. of the neighbourhood policing teams&#146; time on duty will be spent on the patch. It is also new that they will reply to calls and e-mail inquiries within 24 hours. It is new that there will be a minimum standard to ensure that the police respond to emergencies in 15 minutes or less, that they respond to other non-emergency but nevertheless priority or vulnerable cases within 60 minutes, that they respond to other non-emergency calls with a bookable appointment within 48 hours, and that they deliver monthly public meetings for neighbourhood policing teams and the provision of crime information and crime maps. That is a serious and clear set of standards that people can expect to be delivered everywhere, and that the police will be committed to providing.</p>

I do not believe&#151;as he has previously claimed&#151;that knife arches, search wands, antisocial behaviour orders and the seizing of drug dealers&#146; assets on arrest are gimmicks. I believe that they are serious attempts by the Government and their partners in the police service to cut crime, to respond to public concerns and to deliver a police service of which this country and the world can be even more proud.

 I congratulate the Home Secretary, not only on the reduction in the crime figures but on this bold and imaginative Green Paper.

The fact is that good practice already exists in many parts of the country. We have seen the Staffordshire example of reducing bureaucracy, and what is being done in Moss Side to tackle gun and gang crime. Will my right hon.

Does she feel that this is an opportunity quickly, rather than slowly, to put the crime figures under an independent agency such as the Office for National Statistics, as the Government have already done in other areas? If so, when might that happen?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80717-0009.htm_para9"><a name="08071780000413">On policing and crime, there is general agreement in principle that there should be an emphasis on what works. However, in the past week, the Government have come up with a half-baked scheme for offender hospital visits, which has already been tried and tested in the United States, and which failed, and the Conservatives have been advocating imprisoning all knife carriers even though the evidence shows that sentence severity has a negligible effect on criminality. Surely the Home Secretary must agree that the time has come for a national crime reduction agency&#151;a beefed-up National Policing Improvement Agency&#151;that would act like the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the health service and attempt to establish real consensus between the parties on what works. Nothing would give the police greater support in their desire to see professionalism triumph than an end to the political bickering that we have seen here today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80717-0009.htm_para10"><a name="08071780000414">We also warmly welcome the emphasis on neighbourhood policing, on local crime maps, and on local accountability. This is surely the way to improve on the figure of 53 per cent. of people who say that the police are doing a good or excellent job. That figure obviously leaves some room for improvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80717-0009.htm_para11"><a name="08071780000415">The concerns about the proposals for crime and policing representatives were not allayed by reading the details in the Green Paper. As I understand it, there would be just one representative for each council in a crime and disorder reduction partnership, directly elected, presumably by the first-past-the-post system. That would be the first such proposal that the Government had made since 1997. All the other new representatives have been elected by proportional systems. Let us take the example of my own police authority in Hampshire in the south of England, which, under the proposed system, would have two Liberal Democrats, 12 Conservatives and no Labour members whatever. Does the Home Secretary really intend to disfranchise 25 per cent. of the voters in the south of England who happen to be Labour, merely because she is going to consider only a first-past-the-post system? We know from the way in which the system works that this would also cut out ethnic minorities and women. Is that what the Home Secretary wants?</p>

In particular, he rightly emphasised the importance of ensuring that we not only cut crime, but raise confidence in our ability to do so.

Gentlemen&#146;s suggestion that the crime stats are not independent, but I hope that he has noted that we now issue crime stats using the new provisions for which we have legislated. The independence of the statisticians in the Home Office is now much clearer, and there is an overview from national statisticians, too. I do not accept his view that the way to tackle knife crime is to set up a new quango. We have been very clear that knife crime is a serious problem, but more so in certain areas than in others, and that we therefore need a national knife crime programme. The programme is to be led by a senior police officer, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alf Hitchcock, and it will focus on those issues. We need to ensure increased use of stop and search, and to ensure that links are made with our schools. This week, we made it clear in the youth crime action plan that tackling knife crime starts with ensuring that parents live up to their responsibilities, too. We have to make sure that punishment is tough, and involves custody whenever a knife has been used. Where a community sentence is given, the sentence should bring home, particularly to young people, the consequences of even just carrying a knife. That is the right way to address the problem.</p>

Let me be quite clear: the intention behind the proposals is not to safeguard one political party or another, but to make sure that local people have a direct voice on police authorities. I take seriously his point about ensuring that we maintain diversity, as regards gender and people from minority ethnic communities, on police authorities. That is one of the reasons why, in our proposals, we maintain the provision for independent members of police authorities, who make a very important contribution.</p>

Friend reflect on the fact that every time we decentralise decision making, in relation to targets and the collection of stats, we end up with a contradiction? Was it not the Association of Chief Police Officers that, just over seven years ago, changed the recording of crime, so that the number of crimes and events that had to be recorded rose dramatically? Since the original measures doing away with centrally demanded forms and statistics were put in place, the number of forms at local level has risen dramatically. With the help of the excellent president of ACPO,  Ken Jones, will my right hon.

 May I congratulate the Home Secretary&#151;I pause for a moment to allow those words to sink in&#151;on her acceptance of recommendation 24 of the Flanagan report on the stop and account form? Is she aware that I have questioned the need for that form ever since&#151;indeed, since even before&#151;it was introduced in November 2004?

 I congratulate the right hon. and learned Gentleman on his prescience in relation to the stop and account form. Unfortunately, I cannot congratulate him on his record in bringing down crime when he was Home Secretary, but I do not want to be churlish. As I think he is aware, the increased monitoring, particularly of stop and account, understandably emanated from concerns&#151;not least those that came out of the Macpherson inquiry into Stephen Lawrence&#146;s death&#151;about whether, and how, it was possible to ensure proportionality in the way in which the police dealt with people, whatever their background. That was an understandable reason for the development of that form, but I think&#151;and others agree&#151;that it now does not serve that purpose, and it is right that it be removed.</p>

My hon. Friend is right, and in London we have had considerable success with Operation Blunt 2, which uses Government investment in search arches and wands to step up stop and search operations, particularly in areas where there is considerable concern about knife crime. People have been stopped, knives have been recovered, and those concerned will face the consequences of carrying knives. I want that sort of activity to continue in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency, but I want it to happen not just in London.

For the rest of the time, he ran a very large estate agency, handling hundreds of thousands of pounds of cash. That is, by any standards, undesirable. He was convicted of fraud.

The national statistics have been exceeded by those in Hove and Port Slade, where in the year until the end of June crime as a whole was down by 21.4 per cent. and violent crime down by 21.9 per cent. That is partly to do with our wonderful neighbourhood police team, with whose youth disorder operation I had the pleasure of touring my constituency a couple of weeks ago. We visited areas where large numbers of youths gather to speak to them and to see what was going on.

For example, we have proposed the greater use of, as she has identified, assertive youth work, which involves teams going out on the streets. Such teams sometimes involve people who were previously involved in gangs or serious violence, and they help young people whom they meet on the streets to move away from crime and violent crime.

The question of the House authorities being obliged by law under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to reveal our addresses and other security information has been raised in a number of debates that we have had in this House over the last couple of months; in comments made during the business statement; most importantly, in early-day motion 1620, tabled by the hon.

Once a Member&#146;s address is in the public domain, it cannot retrospectively be made private again without their moving home. This is also a question of the security of the public.

I exclude, however, the Information Commissioner from that criticism. I say that because I had laboured under the mistaken impression that he wanted our individual addresses to be disclosed, but as he later pointed out to me, he had not ordered that. After an appeal, that requirement was added by the information appeal tribunal and upheld by the High Court in a subsequent hearing. The guilty men, as it were, were those two latter bodies. It was not the Information Commissioner. In fact, he proceeded to enter the lion&#146;s den and, at short notice, 50 to 60 hon. Members of all parties came to meet him and his team. I think that even he was quite shaken by the stories that they told him about their experiences when their constituency addresses had been exposed.

 I think that I am the only Member in the House who sat on the Committee that, in the early 1990s, considered the Bill that set up the Intelligence and Security Committee. It struck me then that the Committee was a poodle of the Prime Minister of the day, and it remains a poodle of the Prime Minister of the day. If it is to be truly accountable to the House, should not its position be regularised in some way? Should not it be a Select Committee of the House, rather than a creature of the Prime Minister?</p>

 My hon.

There have been only a small number of occasions&#151;this relates to the second recommendation that he identified&#151;on which the decision has been taken not to make certain information available to the Committee, and he refers to one of those.</p>

The ISC notes, for example, that the increased funding for the agencies over the next three years is commensurate with the increased threats that the UK faces and the requirements of the agencies to counter them.</p>

I would like to take this opportunity to reassure the House that both the Government and the agencies remain very focused on the range of threats to the UK. Although the increase in agency funding was driven largely by the need to respond to the terrorist threat, we continue to resource capabilities to counter other threats effectively. Moreover, capabilities developed to counter terrorism can often be deployed against other targets, and technological advances have led to newer, smarter and more flexible ways of working, which have enhanced our ability to respond to these or any other sudden, unexpected threats.</p>

proper emphasis on the counter-terrorism work that is taking place might be undermining some of the work that needs to be done on counter-espionage. To what extent can the Home Secretary provide the House with reassurance that that issue is being addressed, if, in fact, more resources are needed by the Security Service or the Secret Intelligence Service, whose budget has gone up very much less than that of the Security Service?</p>

 I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will recognise that it was to provide that reassurance that I identified the concern in the report, and the view of the Government and the agencies, that the considerable increase in resources, while directed at supporting the counter-terror effort, nevertheless enables the agencies to build capability and flexibility. That means that although the amount of resource spent on, for example, counter-espionage is perhaps proportionally less, we can nevertheless be reassured&#151;because counter-espionage work will be able to make use of the capability and resources that have been put in, particularly with respect to the Security Service&#151;that those risks are being covered.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is right to the extent that the Committee highlights the difficult decisions that need to be made about priorities. However, I am reassured that the sorts of decisions being made about the investment of those resources are being made explicitly with the intention of ensuring that that extra resource&#151;not only human resource, but resource in terms of capability and functions&#151;will enable the flexibility to shift between priorities, if and when that becomes necessary.</p>

The Committee&#146;s remit is therefore identical to those of departmental Select Committees, but it was established under different arrangements, as we have heard, because of the unique and sensitive nature of its work.

 With respect to the latter part of my hon. Friend&#146;s intervention, I am sure that the Chairman of the Committee is better placed to respond than I am. Let us remember, however, that there has been a categorical denial of the allegation that my hon. Friend mentioned. This country and its intelligence and security agencies abhor torture and neither condone nor support the ability of others to carry it out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="80717-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08071780000513">The ISC&#146;s remit often requires it to have access to highly classified information, which, if disclosed in public, would be gravely damaging to the national interest and could put individuals at risk. The ISC therefore operates in a ring of secrecy, with a legislative regime governing appointments to the Committee and the disclosure of information. Those arrangements have led to some commentators to argue&#151;we have heard this today, too&#151;that the ISC is insufficiently independent. As I suggested earlier, I am sure that such charges are viewed with justifiable indignation by ISC members past and present, all Members of one House or the other. I pay tribute to all who serve or have served on the Committee for their professionalism and, speaking as someone who has appeared before them, for their spirited independence, too.</p>

 My right hon. Friend cannot get away with this. Whatever we might say in this place, it is no reflection on our colleagues; the important point is the principle of the thing. Just yesterday evening, Lord Campbell-Savours approached me about that specific point. When he was a member of the Committee, he challenged, both inside and outside, the nature of its selection. He says that it is flawed, and I believe that that is the view of some of those in the Chamber this afternoon who serve on the Committee. They think that the method of selection is wrong&#151;in many respects it is an embarrassment&#151;and they agree that the ISC should become a parliamentary Committee. My right hon.

 Heaven forbid that I might suggest that my hon. Friend would ever be divided from any of his colleagues. I am coming on to the reform of the selection of the members of the Committee, which forms part of the function of the motions standing in my name. &#147;The Governance of Britain&#148;, which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister launched last year, provided a new context in which to consider whether parliamentary oversight arrangements could be made more accountable and transparent. The Government concluded that significant improvements could be made and set out specific proposals in the White Paper published in March this year; the second motion standing in my name invites the House to endorse them. The aim is to bring arrangements governing the ISC and its operation as closely as possible into line with those governing departmental Select Committees.</p>

 My right hon. Friend, who speaks from experience, refers to the very important balance that we have to achieve. In my view, it is fundamental to the Committee&#146;s role that it has the fullest possible access to classified material in order properly to carry out its functions. That, in itself, creates a constraint on the extent of the openness that is appropriate. It is a careful balance that we wrestle with whenever we consider the nature and reform of the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80717-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08071780000523">Let me explain in greater detail how we propose to move towards greater transparency and accountability. First, on the appointment of ISC members, the Intelligence Services Act 1994 contains the explicit provision that ISC members are to be appointed by the Prime Minister in consultation with the Leader of the Opposition. It is the Prime Minister who is ultimately responsible for national security matters, so he is accountable for them to the House. It is therefore right that he should retain the ultimate say over who is admitted to that inner ring of secrecy. Within that framework, however, there is scope for giving a much greater role to Parliament. The White Paper proposed adopting a process similar to that for Joint Select Committee appointments. Following that model, the Government propose that future nominations for membership of the ISC should be put before the House by the Committee of Selection. Members will then have the opportunity to vote on the nominations  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="17 July 2008">

<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>17 July 2008 : Column 460</b><br>
that will be put to the Prime Minister for appointment. This model will ensure the full participation of Parliament in a transparent appointment process. It requires a new Standing Order of the House, which is the subject of the third motion in my name. The Government will seek to put comparable arrangements in place for Lords ISC members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="80717-0012.htm_para4"><a name="08071780000525">Further measures will assist members of the ISC in fulfilling their statutory duties and add further emphasis to their independence. With the Committee, we will explore how some hearings might be structured to allow unclassified evidence to be heard in open session, as is generally the case with most Select Committees. Given the nature of most of the evidence that the Committee hears, evidence sessions have hitherto been conducted in private. That was, and on most occasions will remain, a prudent requirement for the protection of national security. The Government believe, however, that the public would welcome the opportunity to understand better how the Committee works. There could be no better way than to see it in action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="80717-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08071780000526">We and the Committee will therefore look for opportunities when the subject matter would allow Ministers or agency heads&#151;the chair of the Secret Intelligence Service, the director-general of the Security Service and the director of GCHQ&#151;personally to give evidence in public briefing sessions.</p>

 Perhaps I have interrupted the Home Secretary in mid-flow and prematurely. I am supportive of the Government&#146;s approach, as I will make clear in my remarks, but is there not a danger that if such public hearings are to take place, they will have to have a bit of meat in them? Otherwise, an impression will be conveyed to the public that the hearings are merely a rehearsal in front of the public&#151;a show without substance. Although I will not object to the proposal, I have an anxiety that that might be the consequence, in which case people might end up more dissatisfied than they are at present.</p>

 The hon. and learned Gentleman rightly identifies the risk and the challenge. Of course we must not put national security or the safety of individuals at risk, but we must also find a way of allowing for genuine and substantive public examination of the issues.

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="80717-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08071780000529">To return to the point made earlier, we will also explore how we might provide the Committee with additional support to enhance its abilities to conduct investigations. The ISC has employed its own investigator in the past, and the Government and Committee will draw on that previous experience to consider resources for future appointments and appropriate terms of reference. We will also explore how we might reinforce the ISC&#146;s independence by finding alternative secure accommodation outside the offices of the Cabinet secretariat. There should be no suggestion that the current co-location in any way compromises the Committee&#146;s independence. In the interests of transparency, however, a move would be preferable, and we are already exploring such options.</p>

 The Committee and its secretariat have rightly been in discussions with the Cabinet Office about ensuring that such resources are in place. Although all areas of government rightly face constraints, I hope to reassure the Committee that we recognise the resource implications of both the move and, for example, the investigators, and that those requirements will be met.</p>

As specified in the Intelligence Services Act 1994, its reports are submitted directly to the Prime Minister, whereas Select Committees report to the House. The Government do not propose a change to that arrangement. The ISC must have the ability, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth) said, to draw on its access to information of the highest classification when compiling its reports. But that means that its reports, too, contain highly classified information. Therefore, it is essential that the Prime Minister, as the ultimate guardian of national security, is the first to see the Committee&#146;s reports in their entirety. Subsequently, of course, a version of each report is prepared for publication and laid before the House. That version contains visible redactions, but only when publication would be damaging to national security. However, we believe that there is scope for further enhancing the independence of the ISC by ensuring that its Chairman opens debates on its reports in the House in future rather than a Government Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="80717-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08071780000533">Although I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience of opening the debate today, I am pleased that in future that role will&#151;rightly, in my view&#151;be played by the Chair of the ISC herself. Again, that will bring ISC practice more into line with debates on Select Committee reports. In addition, the Government propose that there should be a new opportunity for debates on ISC reports in the House of Lords, opened by an appropriate ISC member.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="80717-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08071780000534">The Intelligence and Security Committee fulfils a vital role for Parliament and the wider public.

It seems to me that unless we focus a little on some of the points, we might not be able to get clarity on the direction we ought to be travelling in as we try to improve the Committee&#146;s work and its methods of reporting. Let me turn briefly to what the report contains. The first thing that has become very striking&#151;the Government will have to keep this in mind in the future as regards transparency &#151;is that the agencies are costing more and more money. Within three years, as I understand it, &#163;2.147 billion of public funds will be spent on the agencies&#146; work. I think I am right in saying that that is more than the budget of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. What was originally a small area of Government expenditure is increasingly becoming a major area of expenditure or, at least, sufficiently large to focus Parliament&#146;s mind on the financial issues. That is particularly the case when one makes the link to the fact that what was previously regarded as work on counter-espionage now has work on counter-terrorism as its primary function and is, thus, a very live issue for this House and the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="80717-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08071780000539">I must say to the Home Secretary that there must be a question mark over whether further information could not reasonably be supplied to Members of Parliament. For example, paragraph 15 of the report provides us with the total breakdown of resources and capital for the entire intelligence agencies, but, for reasons that I understand, we are denied a breakdown between the services. There is an unsatisfactory element to this. Elsewhere in the report we can ascertain that, in terms of the rise in the number of personnel, the Security Service has benefited a lot in comparison with the Secret Intelligence Service, yet we know that much of the work on counter-terrorism that must be done to protect our country is being done abroad&#151;indeed, that is hinted at elsewhere in the report. I am sure that the Home Secretary will appreciate that if it were possible for the House to be given further information about how the budget breaks down, we would find that immeasurably useful in playing our role as the scrutineers of public finances. I am, however, mindful of the difficulty that the Government have on the topic.</p>

 My hon. and learned Friend will know that when the Committee started, no figures were published. We are pushing away at this door and making some progress. I want to reassure him that we will continue to push at this door, because I agree that the more we can put into the public domain, the better. However there are restraints: if we were to publish the breakdowns, we would show where the shoe was pinching and we do not, and should not, want those who are not friendly towards us to know that.</p>

 I am grateful for my right hon. Friend&#146;s comments, and I have no difficulty in agreeing with everything that he said. Our enemies would be interested in knowing where the shoe is pinching, but, equally so would Parliament, because it might conclude that more funds should be made available or that the way in which the funds are prioritised does not provide the best value for money. Such a debate would, in an ideal world, be of interest to the Government, because history shows that when Governments are taken to task and held to account&#151;politely, I would hope&#151;in such matters, it often leads to improvements, whereas if such matters remain concealed within the Departments concerned, it makes life rather more difficult.</p>

Equally, it is right to point out that the Committee&#146;s members do not have, as an ordinary Select Committee has, the force of the House behind them in making those representations. We cannot simply ignore those issues.</p>

 It may help the hon. and learned Gentleman if I were to tell him that the Committee does play a role in examining the value-for-money aspect of the agencies. We are advised by the National Audit Office on the issues of concern that we should pursue. For some of our sittings in any given year, we take on a role that is, in many ways, not dissimilar to that of the Public Accounts Committee.</p>

We know that regionalisation policy in respect of the Security Service has been very successful. The Government say so and the Committee says so, and I have no reason to doubt that. However, we still have not been told where the regional centres are. I should say that I am satisfied that I know exactly where the regional centres are&#151;and I have not been given leaked information&#151;because the information is in the public domain, although kept out of the report. A sensible trawl of some of the information that is not being made public might reveal that much of it is easily accessible to anyone who wishes to discover it. That might enable a little more to be said publicly than is said at the moment.</p>

greater reliance on the SOCA in counter-insurgency work, especially because of its involvement in counter-narcotics work. The point is also made that the Secret Intelligence Service has an important role in that and that some aspects of that have to be maintained as a priority, partly because of the work it does with our international partners. That is a fertile area for debate. SOCA is a legitimate subject for debate in the House, and indeed some anxieties have been expressed about whether it is functioning correctly. It will certainly be difficult for us to have any sensible discussion about an area that concerns crime prevention as much as it does national security unless further information can, from time to time, be provided that fleshes out the subject. It is only hinted at in the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="80717-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08071780000547">The report also says quite a lot about financial and resilience issues, and about GCHQ and the flooding that took place in Gloucestershire last year. It remains deliciously opaque whether the problem is with the disruption of personnel going to work or whether we have invested a large amount of money on a building located on a floodplain. That is a relevant consideration in view of the amount of money that we have sunk into it. I hope that we may have some further clarity on that.</p>

SCOPE 1, which is a major piece of Government investment in providing the software to enable the rapid exchange of information between different agencies, has apparently been successfully carried out. The report tells us that SCOPE 2 has been held up. In the last couple of days, <i> The Guardian</i> has told us that, in fact, SCOPE 2 has been shelved, but the Committee&#146;s report tells us that it is an important project to enable information sharing. Given the Government&#146;s record on IT projects&#151;although to be kind to the Home Secretary, I could say the same about every Government&#146;s track record on handling IT projects&#151;that should be an issue of major concern to the House. I wonder whether the Minister who will respond to the debate can give us more information on that point without breaching security, because there is a clear difference between those two reports. Given the importance of SCOPE 2 in the context of the Government&#146;s overall strategy to make information readily exchangeable between agencies, it would be useful if we could have more information.</p>

Scottish Nationalist party are also entitled to one. The Government have to bring primary legislation to the House before they can make any of the proposed changes. That is the truth, and the House needs to know it. I think that it is section 10 of the Intelligence Services Act 1994 that limits the Committee&#146;s membership to nine. Moreover, the fact that the Committee contains only one Member of the House of Lords makes it difficult for the Home Secretary to find appropriate representation for the other place.</p>

 Perhaps I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. I certainly was not suggesting that these are major changes, and he is right that some of them are more statements of intent. However, to the extent that a statement of intent is better than nothing, I suppose that there might be a meeting of minds between us that the Government seem to be taking a step in the right direction. I am a great believer that such matters have their own dynamic. Once one starts freeing the logjam and accepting that the way in which a Committee operates is going to change, at least at some time in the future&#151;and we will definitely keep pressure on the Government to honour their commitments in that respect&#151;it is likely to follow of itself that those changes will generate pressure to bring about more change. The direction must be towards openness, and the Government would have to come up with some very good reasons indeed if they were not to ensure that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="80717-0013.htm_para6"><a name="08071780000554">I shall listen very carefully to what the hon. Member for Thurrock has to say, but we take a rather pragmatic view. One difficulty that we share is that we are not privy to all the information on which a decision about whether his idea is a good one will be based. That may seem obvious, but it is the truth. We are sympathetic to what he is trying to achieve but we are not in a position to say to the Government that the problems that are identified with his proposals are not real.</p>

When that happens, it is because they are lured magnetically into a world where the fact that rooms and secret information are made available to them gently and subtly affects their judgment. They are grateful for being made privy to matters that are not available to other people. That said, I would not in anyway wish it to be suggested that members of the Committee do not do a very valuable job&#151;indeed, the very reverse: I have a very high opinion of their work.</p>

escape that, and it is wiser for the House to accept it openly and to tease out the consequences. The risk that I have described exists but we are fortunate that, over the time that the Committee has been operating, its reports and approach have consistently commanded widespread respect throughout the House. I am very grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend for the work that is being done, and I am sure that everyone else is too.</p>

Member for Thurrock with great care but, for the reasons that I have set out, it seems to me that the points raised by the Home Secretary have some force. The danger that I foresee can happen very easily, even with Select Committees, and the danger is that if we start putting in place structures because the agencies involved no longer have confidence that the Committee is working in a way that will not adversely affect their operational capacity, the result will be that the information will start to dry up. At that point, we have the problem that the Committee can no longer do its work as well as it may be doing it at present.</p>

 I probably failed to make that clear. We would, in government, look to see whether statutory reform could be introduced. Indeed, I go further: we would look to the issues that have been raised by the hon. Member for Thurrock to see whether they can be properly implemented, and whether we can create a Select Committee on much more traditional Select Committee lines. That is our view. But as I said, I do not have the information at present on which I could make such a decision. All I can say to the House is that that is an undertaking that I am quite happy to give.</p>

Some 200 extremist networks&#151;of those that we know about&#151;remain currently under investigation.

The fact that we cannot reveal all information in a public report is, as has been repeatedly said in the debate, perhaps an inevitable consequence of the subject matter with which we deal.

 As I have already indicated, individual cases are matters for the tribunal. The Intelligence and Security Committee investigates the policy and, indeed, the implementation of the policy by the agencies; the tribunal looks at individual cases. However, I assure my hon. Friend that the Committee is aware and very mindful of the serious concerns that he has raised.</p>

 Not being a member of the tribunal, or&#151;I fear&#151;having yet closely studied its work, I am not sure. However, complaints are a matter for its very serious judgment and I am sure that it weighs them carefully, as all such bodies would.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80717-0014.htm_para0"><a name="08071780000584">The commissioners to whom I referred check that the agency&#146;s actions are within the law. The tribunal investigates individuals&#146; complaints, and the Intelligence and Security Committee examines administration, policy and expenditure, as do departmental Select Committees. The Intelligence and Security Committee itself was established by the Intelligence Services Act 1994. It set its own work programme, and that work has grown and developed over the years. The Committee produces not only an annual report but, as has been mentioned, ad hoc reports, most latterly on the subject of rendition. The Committee is composed of experienced parliamentarians who value their independence and work on a non-partisan basis to deliver rigorous scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80717-0014.htm_para1"><a name="08071780000585">As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said, however, after so many years it is definitely time to take stock of how the Committee works. When the Prime Minister first broached the issue of reform in the Green Paper &#147;The Governance of Britain&#148;, he invited my predecessor to advise on how the Committee should be reformed&#151;strengthened to enable even more effective oversight, while seeking to increase parliamentary accountability and public understanding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80717-0014.htm_para2"><a name="08071780000586">In many ways, the Committee&#146;s operations already parallel those of departmental Select Committees. It is the nature of the material that Committee members examine that means that we sit behind closed doors, as much of it, as has been said, cannot be put into the public domain. However, if today&#146;s motion is carried, the Committee will consider in the next Session whether there are areas of its work that can be discussed in public&#151;for example, in relation to the national security strategy or the threat assessment. We hope that that will give greater insight into how the Committee works and reduce the level of secrecy when secrecy is not necessary.</p>

Friend the Home Secretary referred is the proposal to re-explore the use of investigators. The Committee has used an investigator to examine administrative matters such as the vetting system and postal arrangements. However, I must emphasise that the Committee will nevertheless continue to conduct major inquiries itself. We all feel a responsibility to examine the evidence first hand on important issues such as rendition or the 7 July London bombings&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. We feel that responsibility, but we believe that a pool of expert investigators such as those used by departmental Select Committees would be a welcome additional resource to help with our work. The Committee also welcomes the proposal that its reports be debated in the other place, because its membership is drawn from both Houses and it is important that debates are held in both Chambers. It is also important that there should be an opportunity to debate not only the Committee&#146;s annual reports, but all its infrequent ad hoc reports&#151;not least because those ad hoc reports often generate the most interest. Debates on them would also increase awareness of the Committee&#146;s work among Members of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="80717-0014.htm_para4"><a name="08071780000590">However, I want to stress the point made by members of the Committee in the debate and to which the Home Secretary responded. The changes that we are discussing cannot be implemented without additional resources. Indeed, welcome for the proposals has to be conditional on such resources being available, in what I completely recognise is a tight financial climate, to strengthen the secretariat, who are already very hard pressed and work very long hours. If the Committee is to maintain&#151;let alone expand&#151;its work load, that has to be taken into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="80717-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08071780000591">That said, I believe that the proposals will enhance the Committee&#146;s role, provide a greater role for Parliament and offer the public greater visibility of our work. It is vital&#151;and this view is clearly shared across the House&#151;that there should be rigorous and independent scrutiny  of the agencies, and the Committee will continue to provide it.</p>

The report that we are discussing today covers the period up to October 2007, and was published in January 2008. I hope that, in future, we can return to an annual cycle, because describing this as an annual  report puts us at some risk of contravening the Trade Descriptions Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="80717-0014.htm_para9"><a name="08071780000596">We support the measures to bring the appointments procedure in line with standard practice, as set out in paragraph 237 of the White Paper, &#147;The Governance of Britain&#148;, and the members of the Intelligence and Security Committee&#146;s standing order. It is right that Parliament, and not the Prime Minister, should have the primary role in nominating members of the Committee, if only to preserve some form of separation of the legislature from the Executive. The ISC must be independent of the Government, and it must be seen to be independent if its reports are to have the standing that they deserve. I believe that the intelligence services see the merit of that argument from their point of view as well, understandable though their concerns are about putting information that might be of use to our enemies into the public domain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="80717-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08071780000597">We welcome the moves to explore alternative accommodation options for the ISC, with the necessary private, secure environment, away from the Cabinet Office. I hope that these are not just empty words, and that the Foreign Secretary will be able to give us more information on any progress in that regard when he replies to the debate. Perhaps in our debate on these matters next year, we will be able to have a report on the successful conclusion of that move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="80717-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08071780000598">The issue of independence is at the heart of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Thurrock. Obviously, the sensitive nature of the information being handled means that the Committee requires heavily security cleared and trusted staff, but I do not believe that such staff cannot be under the authority of the Clerk of the House. In fact, I can think of few people more highly regarded and trusted by Members on both sides of the House. It is also vital, especially as the ISC expands its investigatory work, that there is no question of the Executive having improper influence over the staff of the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="80717-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08071780000599">I am sure that the Minister will agree that public briefings by agency heads or Ministers are no replacement for a properly constituted public Committee meeting. We recognise that some meetings&#151;indeed, probably the great majority of them&#151;will need to be held in private. However, the ISC should have the option of meeting in public, and I was delighted to hear that possibility being mentioned by the right hon. Member for Derby, South.

 I hope that the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that the Intelligence and Security Committee published its report in December 2007. It is now summer 2008. Since December 2007, much information has appeared in the public domain that was not previously available, so there is a time gap.</p>

Nevertheless, I suspect that if the exercise that I suggested were carried out before the redaction of next year&#146;s report, the hon.

 I do not believe that I am crossing that line in relation to the issue of whether to intervene in a legal investigation, because there are wider considerations than those that are of concern to the intelligence services, not least among which is the reputation of British businesses. How many of them will lose business as a result of clients&#146; fears that if they do business with British businesses, it might be taken as a sign that they are in receipt of corrupt payments or bribes? There are wider considerations, and although the Foreign Secretary, whom we welcome to the Chamber, is chortling at  that, I assure him that in many parts of the world it is significant for clients to know that business contracts are being signed for the right reasons, not the wrong ones.</p>

We hope that a resolution can quickly be found that allows for the successful prosecution of terror suspects by using intercept evidence while protecting the needs of our security services. We know, for example, that that has been done successfully in the United States and Australia, both of which are in close intelligence relationships with our intelligence services. Liberal  Democrat Members therefore see no reason why we should not proceed.</p>

It is surely possible for the Committee to find an investigator whose contractual terms ensure that they do not pop up on prime-time television.

First, intelligence is invariably fragmentary and partial, rather than a complete picture. It is information gained against the wishes, and usually without the knowledge, of targets. Complex analysis is required to evaluate intelligence. Secondly, intelligence is never an end in itself. It serves to inform an understanding of risks and threats, to provide warning and to define the need for investigation or disruptive action. That is the complex area in which our agencies are working. Following the Committee&#146;s purposeful evidence sittings with the agencies, I am confident in saying that the staff of the agencies understand the complexities of the various roles that they must perform and energetically and enthusiastically manage enormous tasks.</p>

amount of money is being spent, which must be monitored at all times. I entirely agree with that, as, I believe, does every Committee member. I would add, however, that when we talked about the resources that the agencies have, the former director general said:</p>

<a name="80717-0015.htm_brev0"><a name="08071795000488"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;my main concern has been, and still is, we do not have enough people to do the job&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="80717-0015.htm_para0"><a name="08071795000018">I have never interpreted that statement as referring to the number of people they employ, which has grown considerably; I interpret it as referring to the scale of requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80717-0015.htm_para1"><a name="08071795000019">Over the years, certainly since 7/7, we have become much more aware of the growth of potential terrorist activity. The agencies know that 200 extremist networks are currently under investigation, some with the intent and capability of carrying out attacks against the UK. Special branch has added to that by stating that there are 2,000 individuals in the UK about which it has concern&#151;a very careful use of language&#151;and that those people often have multiple identities. Worse than that, the situation is so different from that which we had to face in Ireland. The people involved are part of informal networks, not formal ones that we could recognise, and did recognise&#151;and, of course, there are others about which little or nothing is known.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80717-0015.htm_para2"><a name="08071795000020">Serious concern is being expressed that there are not enough people to do the job. That has to be seen in the context of the scale of requirements. We have to acknowledge the complex nature and size of the problem that fundamentalism represents. The agencies have an enormous job to do in achieving a safe Britain.</p>

 There has been an explosion in the number of people working at GCHQ and the other security agencies. Has my friend&#146;s Committee given any time to examining recruitment practices and suchlike, given that very little in the report touches on those matters?</p>

<p><a name="st_o346"><a name="08071795000022"><a name="80717-0015.htm_spnew1"><a name="08071795000544"><b>Ms Taylor:</b>
 That was a very positive question about something that the Committee should consider in greater detail. In fact, we have done some work in this field, and it is a mistake that we have not referenced it. I will comment on that a little further in my speech if I have time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="80717-0015.htm_para3"><a name="08071795000023">There is a positive response to the work load that the agencies face. People who have read the report will know that there is an increasing determination to work collaboratively. I see that not simply as valuable, but as invaluable and essential. I am sorry that it has taken the agencies so long to get to the point where they are working much more collaboratively. There has clearly been less competition between them, less exclusivity of knowledge and less scoring points off each other. Perhaps we would all have anticipated that after 7/7; there is no longer any room for such boys&#146; games, if the House will excuse the expression.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80717-0015.htm_para4"><a name="08071795000024">It is not just that the agencies&#146; way of working is much more collaborative. We have supported collaboration. We heard from the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield about SCOPE. He was cautiously but clearly critical about the fact that the overseas project has still not been fielded. We have also been critical about the slowness with which SCOPE has delivered. The intentions of SCOPE are excellent; the delivery programme has been less so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="80717-0015.htm_para5"><a name="08071795000025">Again, it is important for us to see the matter as it is. SCOPE is a secure electronic communication system transferring known intelligence, and inevitably we would all see that as totally appropriate. We know that Departments and agencies can ask for information and that it is delivered in 15 minutes&#151;previously, it took 12 hours. There is no doubt in my mind that it is an excellent piece of kit, which we have to support. I am confident that, although the way in which it is used internationally has slipped, it will be used and it will be of considerable value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80717-0015.htm_para6"><a name="08071795000026">I would like to refer to another bit of technical kit that is of incredible value. GCHQ has been modernising SIGINT&#151;signals intelligence. This programme, across the piece, for all agencies, enables the efficient and effective management of a vast bulk of information. It supports collaboration. Reference was made from the Front Bench to the worry that counter-terrorism operations have taken over, and that counter-espionage programmes are now less and less well funded. Again, the Committee shares that consideration, and it is resolved to monitor the comprehensive spending review settlement for 2007. We hope to come back to the House to report that counter-espionage is covered as well as it should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="80717-0015.htm_para7"><a name="08071795000027">I would like to return to a particular use of language that worried me throughout the time we did the report&#151;we do not have enough people to do the job. The House should realise that a different factor is involved. The agencies, with a vast increase in moneys and a determination to increase their staff&#151;exponentially, it appears at times&#151;are selecting from the same pool, which is getting smaller and smaller. That presents the risk for all of us that they could be selecting the wrong people. Significantly, in addition, we could be relying more and more on less and less experienced operatives. Worse than that, with reference to what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice), it is clear that this group could be receiving less and less training, which is certainly problematic. The Committee most certainly needs to carry out another investigation into that area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80717-0015.htm_para8"><a name="08071795000028">The agencies work very hard. I sound very confident about that, and I may sound too confident and too defensive about their work. I am as abrasive with them as I probably sound to the House this afternoon. I acknowledge the enormous work load that they have to accommodate because it is added to by a requirement, outlined in the report, to increase coverage and operational capability in key countries. That is an important part of the work that the Secret Intelligence Service and MI5 must do. It is fundamental to ensuring that we understand where terrorism could be tracked and could hit Great Britain. They must not only widen their scope and involve key countries, but ensure that they understand the factors that influence radicalisation. Of course, regional teams have been developed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80717-0015.htm_para9"><a name="08071795000029">I feel privileged to serve on the Committee. It is hard and interesting work. The Committee works effectively, objectively and independently. I would hate it if others thought otherwise.</p>

the wrong people&#151;the standard is extraordinarily high&#151;but the consequence of the speed of expansion is that people with experience of a year or 18 months are doing jobs that would previously have been done by those who had been in the services for three or four years. The heads of the services have acknowledged that risk. It has to be accepted because of the necessity for the vast increase in staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80717-0015.htm_para10"><a name="08071795000031">The hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) may not have got his earlier question across clearly. He asked how the intelligence failure that led to the sexed-up dossier could be prevented from happening again. I had the privilege of serving on the Butler review. It was not the intelligence but the use that was made of it that was the problem. If the hon. Gentleman examines the Butler review, he will find that we commented robustly that the dossier went to the limit, if not beyond, of what the intelligence could bear.</p>

<p><a name="st_o348"><a name="08071795000032"><a name="80717-0015.htm_spnew3"><a name="08071795000546"><b>Mr. Kilfoyle:</b>
 I do not want to detract from the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech, but I have examined the Butler review many times. I am sure that he accepts that where the intelligence ended and the political misjudgments began is a matter for debate.</p>

<p><a name="st_o349"><a name="08071795000033"><a name="80717-0015.htm_spnew4"><a name="08071795000547"><b>Mr. Mates:</b>
 I disagree because I believe that the report analysed that. The intelligence was honest and straight. The use that was made of it is the subject of political debate, but it is not for today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80717-0015.htm_para11"><a name="08071795000034">I shall be brief&#151;I want to make only two main points. First, I do not support the amendment that the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) tabled, not because I am a poodle or part of a gone-native club, but because of the practicalities of his proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80717-0015.htm_para12"><a name="08071795000035">If the Committee came under the authority of the Clerk of the House, it would have to be staffed by Clerks, none of whom, as far as I know, is as deeply vetted as all the staff of our Committee are. If one were absent, he could not be replaced unless someone else were deeply vetted and that takes a long time. We have restrictions on accommodation because we see the most secret intelligence, for which there are strict rules. They could not be followed with any ease in the House of Commons, where there is constant public access, without having a place with separate security and separate guards, 24 hours a day, as happens in our current accommodation. It is therefore not the principle so much as the practicality of the proposal to which I object. I would like the Committee to become as normal as possible, but the key word is &#147;possible&#148;. <i> [Laughter.] </i>I do not know what I have said that is so funny. Everything must be compared with the strict security requirements under which we currently operate. That is why I do not support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80717-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08071795000036">Secondly, redactions are an old chestnut, which come up every time we debate the matter. We have to redact some things from our report, which must go first to the Prime Minister. That cannot be changed. If the Committee were an ordinary Select Committee, any evidence given to it would become the property of the House, as the hon. Member for Thurrock knows. One cannot do that with secret intelligence. If the position were forced on the Committee, we would not get any more secret intelligence and that would render us ineffective. However,  <br>

we report everything that we have discovered to the Prime Minister, who sees the report complete and unredacted. Indeed, I think that I can tell the House that there were reports a long time ago that were never published, because the subject matter was too secret. However, the Prime Minister needed the information; he needed to know that the money had been properly spent and administered and that we had got value for money. It took the Committee a long time to look into such things, and we reported them to him, but we can take none of the credit, because nobody knows what we did. Again, that is unavoidable when one is dealing with the sort of subjects that the Committee has to deal with day in, day out. I agree with my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) that when we redact, we must always push the envelope and have a robust exchange. Clearly, the Government and the agencies say, &#147;You can&#146;t possibly say that,&#148; but we test them, we move them a little and we sometimes move them a lot.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80717-0015.htm_para14"><a name="08071795000037">Ultimately, nothing has ever been left out of one of our reports without our agreement. The statute says that nothing can be put into one of our reports that might damage national security or the operation of the security services, and that has always been the case in the 14 years that I have been on the Committee. Let me tell the Foreign Secretary with all the power that I can muster&#151;I hope that he will tell the Home Secretary, who I had hoped would be here as well&#151;not to break that convention. If the Government were to do so, that would damage severely relationships and put the relationship between the Committee and the Government in quite a different light. That relationship has always worked until now. We have honoured the Government&#146;s need for security, and the Government must consider the issue very deeply before they decide to go against what has been a thoroughly worthwhile convention.</p>

None of us can have the slightest doubt that the situation remains as it was three years ago and that there are violent extremists with a religious agenda, and it is pretty obvious what they would like to do.

had one or two debates in the 1980s in which I suggested that there should be some parliamentary accountability for MI5. The ministerial response at the time, which would no doubt have been the same under a Labour Government&#151;I have no illusions on that score&#151;was that it was simply impossible to have such parliamentary accountability and that the very nature of the work of the security services was such that there could be no question of establishing any kind of committee. I was always told, as other critics were, &#147;Don&#146;t worry overmuch. The security agencies are accountable to the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary, who in turn are responsible to Parliament.&#148; I was told, in effect, &#147;Why worry about the matter at all?&#148;</p>

I pointed out&#151;I was hardly the only one&#151;that the Committee functions and the method of appointment should be somewhat different. I argued that it should be a Select Committee of the House of Commons&#151;not a normal Select Committee, but along those lines&#151;but that was obviously rejected.</p>

The story goes that when John Smith, the then leader of the party, heard about it, he said to my colleague who led for us, &#147;Why on earth did you say all that? We have no intention of doing that in government.&#148; That is how the story goes.

Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) if I say that I am a bit of a fan, but I do not consider myself a poodle and I do not think either that he was accusing me of being a poodle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="80717-0016.htm_para0"><a name="08071795000057">I welcome the annual report. There is nothing unusual in it. Its main feature is the growth of the agencies in response to the post-9/11 era&#151;an inevitable fact of life. Earlier in the year, we produced an important report on rendition: Members have alluded to it and it has been widely discussed. However, it is on the proposed reforms that I would like to concentrate my remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80717-0016.htm_para1"><a name="08071795000058">I do not belittle any of the reforms; I support them. I took part in the debate inside the Committee. Appointments by the Committee of Selection are a good idea, but let us not kid ourselves that they will produce a fresh set of characters. The system will continue, and the usual types will surface. To that extent, the process is largely cosmetic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80717-0016.htm_para2"><a name="08071795000059">It is right and proper that the Committee Chairman should introduce the debate, but it will not change the tone of the debate much, other than that she will get more than 10 minutes in which to make her speech. The Committee already has the power to appoint an investigator. In truth, the problem lies more in the question of resources, which was raised by the Committee Chairman, the right hon. Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett), and in the physical cost of accommodating and managing an investigator.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="80717-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08071795000060">On the issues raised by the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick), it will be a change to have public hearings, but my right hon. Friend the Member for East Hampshire (Mr. Mates) was absolutely on the button when he said that the scope will be limited. It will happen&#151;I am pretty sure that there is a determination to do it&#151;but let us not get carried away about how effective and revealing the hearings will be. To that extent, again, the change will be somewhat cosmetic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="80717-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08071795000061">Let me touch on the statutory reforms that have not been discussed today. In 2007, the Green Paper said that the Act</p>
<a name="80717-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="08071795000490"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;should be amended to bring the way in which&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80717-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08071795000062">the ISC</p>
<a name="80717-0016.htm_brev1"><a name="08071795000491"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;is appointed, operates and reports as far as possible into line with that of other select committees&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="80717-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08071795000063">So far, so good. The Prime Minister went on to say that the ISC should have a &#147;strengthened capacity for investigations&#148;. Listening to the Home Secretary today, I thought that that commitment was fading a little. In his statement on national security strategy, the Prime Minister spoke of current reforms in advance of future legislation, but what that would be was not elucidated. A couple of weeks later, &#147;The Governance of Britain&#148; White Paper made no reference to statutory reforms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="80717-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08071795000064">Statutory reforms should be considered in a number of areas. If we are to have the Prime Minister&#146;s &#147;strengthened capacity for investigations&#148;, the first area to consider is documentation. In response to my intervention, the Home Secretary said that the Committee will be able to have an investigator, as if that were the extra, strengthened capacity. As I said, however, we already have that power, so nothing much is coming on that front. Documentation, and that on which we can draw, needs to be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="80717-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08071795000065">The reports on rendition and 7/7 are extra-curricular&#151;they sit outside the legislation. The invitation to the Committee to conduct the reports carries with it the implied request that the agencies should supply us with whatever documentation is necessary to do the job. In the wide range of our activity, the Committee should have the power to request whatever is necessary to do the job. As we consider reforms, that should be the default setting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="80717-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08071795000066">Secondly, we need to look at the issue of the witnesses who come before us. Again, I do not have a precise, concrete proposal, but I have the feeling that one wants to call people whom we do not have the power to call at the moment. That extra power is needed. Consideration should be given to the way in which witnesses can be brought before Committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="80717-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08071795000067">I will return to that point in a moment, but I want to touch on the difference between the ISC and a Select Committee. As the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) knows, I have served on both&#151;I have been on the ISC for three years, and I was on the Foreign Affairs Committee with him when we investigated the war in Iraq. We had the Gilligan report, David Kelly being put before us by the Government, his subsequent suicide, and the Hutton inquiry. It was not exactly a low-profile Select Committee. In fact, for those of us on it, it was a fairly unforgettable experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="80717-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08071795000068">So, if the ISC were to become a Select Committee, its members would have to be notified under the Official Secrets Act 1989, which would immediately take it out of the Select Committee system. It would have to meet wholly in secret and could not report to Parliament without redactions. All those points have been well made by my right hon. Friend the Member for East Hampshire. The Clerks of the House and of the ISC are of the highest calibre, and they would perform an identical function, so it would not make any difference to that extent, but Clerks would have to be vetted and   <br>

cleared. The evidence would have to be given by the agency heads in secret and we cannot get away from the fact that that information could not be published.</p>

<p><a name="st_o358"><a name="08071795000069"><a name="80717-0016.htm_spnew1"><a name="08071795000556"><b>Mr. Mates:</b>
 It is perhaps worth pointing out to the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) that when we last appointed a Clerk, one of the candidates was from the body of the Clerks of the House. We could perfectly well have chosen him. He did not, in our view, turn out to be the best candidate, but we are not prevented from using the resources of the Clerks of the House. If someone applies for the job, we are perfectly able to appoint him.</p>

<p><a name="st_o359"><a name="08071795000070"><a name="80717-0016.htm_spnew2"><a name="08071795000557"><b>Richard Ottaway:</b>
 My right hon. Friend makes a perfectly good point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="80717-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08071795000071">Let me go back to the point that I was making a second ago about evidence. The key difference is that the Select Committee on Transport, for example, has employees, businesses, users, passengers, station masters and so on coming before it. One simply does not get that in the intelligence world, as there is no equivalent. There are plenty of conspiracy theorists out there, but there is not enough time to address all their arguments. In truth, our input is predominantly from agents. If we were sitting as a Select Committee, that input would be limited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="80717-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08071795000072">When I joined the Committee, I was fairly sympathetic to the idea of its becoming a Select Committee after my experience on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Having been on it for three years, I have simply reached the conclusion that that would not be an improvement, that the situation would probably be worse and that it would be less effective. We should focus on making the ISC as similar as possible to a Select Committee, which is what we are trying to do, subject to the reforms that I am suggesting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="80717-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08071795000073">I feel most uncomfortable with the question about the precise role of the ISC. Is it with the agencies or against them? Does it provide oversight or a check or balance? The Committee&#146;s job is defined, as is the job of a Select Committee, as the provision of oversight of policy, finance and administration. That definition is wide and vague, and can be broadly or narrowly interpreted. During my time on the ISC, I have seen a narrow interpretation. A Select Committee has more freedom to range and is wide-ranging in its scope. My third proposal for statutory reform is a clearer statutory definition of the role of the Committee combined with powers to deliver on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="80717-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08071795000074">Let me conclude with the point made by the Chairman of the Committee about resources. The ISC has fewer resources than a Select Committee has. It has fewer staff. If we are to up our game, we have to bite the bullet and give more resources to the Committee. Without those resources, no serious progress can be made. Let me allude, too, to the issue of accommodation for the Committee. The White Paper said that the Committee should not sit in the Cabinet Office. When the Foreign Secretary is winding up, will he mention whether he feels that we should move out of Cabinet Office facilities, by which, of course, I mean the wider Cabinet Office estate? Does he feel that the wider Cabinet Office estate is an appropriate setting for the Committee&#146;s location?</p>

 I am grateful for having caught your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Let me make it clear that I acknowledge that the intelligence and security community has had enormous successes on behalf of all of us in combating terrorism, and I wish it well in that continuing role. I have more of an open mind on another of its aspects&#151;combating organised crime&#151;because part of my thesis is that inadequate information is available to Parliament to evaluate its stewardship, conduct and competence in this regard. In respect of espionage, I have some doubts, because it seems that the same cold war rhetoric&#151;the reference to diplomats as spies&#151;is used in London and in Moscow. It sometimes does not seem mature, given that we recognise that every person in the Russian embassy has been allowed by the Foreign Secretary to be there and that the same thing happens in Moscow. A lot of energy is used on that, rather than on combating espionage, which I am all for. The cold war rhetoric impedes our foreign policy and our building the necessary relationship with the Russian Federation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="80717-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08071795000080">Against that backdrop, I referred in the House on 22 May&#151;I do not want to labour the point again&#151;to what I consider to be an affront not only to me, but to Parliament. I am talking about MI5&#146;s approach to the Government Chief Whip and my being told, &#147;You are being targeted by a Russian spy.&#148; Those were the precise words. I find that menacing, intimidating and inappropriate in a free Parliament. I want to make it clear that so long as I am a Member of Parliament, I intend to meet whom I like, when I like and where I like&#151;my chosen place is here. I want to say that in not only my interests, but those of Parliament. Everyone here knows that, by definition, a Member of Parliament has no secrets; the only secrets we can share are predictions about possible political developments in the United Kingdom.</p>

amendment were adopted tonight, it would not immediately alter things; it would clearly be the subject of further discussions between the security services and Parliament, and it would have to be enacted by primary legislation. That is why I invite the House, if it is favourably disposed in principle, to increasing the parliamentary status of the work done by the ISC, to support my amendment as an expression of will.

Its accommodation may have to be in a different place, but to have the Clerk of the House of Commons providing the secretaryship would send an enormous signal to increase public confidence&#151;this is most necessary. I tabled a question asking who the ISC&#146;s Clerk is, but the parliamentary reply said, &#147;We won&#146;t tell you; its a secret.&#148; That is indicative of the obsessive secrecy that exists, and I do not think it is healthy in a democracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="80717-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08071795000086">I listened and learned this afternoon. I realise that the Committee has to deal with some big-picture stuff, but there is therefore a void&#151;a flaw&#151;that is not being met by our parliamentary institutions. Let me give an example of that. Although we had a statement on the loss of data on the Waterloo train, Parliament should investigate that event. At the least, we need to know that a Committee is investigating it&#151;we are not told what the ISC is doing&#151;yet this relates to the stewardship and management of our security and intelligence services. I have no confidence, and I do not think that anyone else does, that this is being dealt with properly.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has got it wrong again. If the ISC looked into an incident such as the loss of documents on a train, which is a very serious matter, we would be in exactly the same position as any other Member. The incident is being investigated by the police and by an internal disciplinary process, and no Committee of this House would ever interfere in the matter or would question those proceedings until they were over. When those proceedings are over, a decision may have to be taken.</p>

 That may be, but we are devoting a mere three and a half hours to a most important subject&#151;and that will be our lot in one and a half years. We have been told that the report is now six months old. The House is abdicating its responsibility to keep security and intelligence under scrutiny and it is a sham that we have such a short time.

That is set to continue: according to the 2007 comprehensive spending review, the SIA for this purpose will increase from &#163;1.85 billion in 2008-09 to &#163;2.15 billion in 2010-11. Obviously, those are very large sums of money, but I welcome the increased investment by the Government in this important matter. It is a necessary response to the continuing and pervasive threat posed by international terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08071795000100">The Security Service has estimated that there are at least 2,000 individuals in the UK who pose a direct threat to our safety and public security because of their support for the al-Qaeda form of terrorism. That figure has increased since 2005, and I expect it to continue to do so. Evidence suggests that attack planning in Europe has increased over the past 12 months and there has been recent media coverage of a number of foiled plots. It is said that the threat will last for at least a generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08071795000101">These can be fragmented terror groups that plan random plots, but they are often co-ordinated, sometimes from abroad. They boast sophisticated technical know-how, and they are united in their pursuit of extremist ideological ends that are anathema to basic tenets of our democracy. Their willingness to kill indiscriminately, en masse and without prior warning makes this a more extreme form of terrorism than anything that we have experienced previously. Given that the threat posed by terrorism is an amorphous and changing one that franchises, morphs and spreads, there is a question about the most suitable structures through which our response is to be channelled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para4"><a name="08071795000103">The unprecedented increase in funding means that it is more appropriate than ever that suitable mechanisms of accountability are in place. We are, after all, dealing with public money. The sensitive nature of the agencies&#146; work should not, of course, preclude them from being subject to appropriate management and financial disciplines. In any organisation, major increases in resources can lead to inefficiencies and waste rather than value for money and discipline. Expenditure projects that previously did not quite come up to the mark and were found to be below the line can now be dusted off and, relatively speaking, found to be above the line and brought forward.</p>

However, whether the efficiency targets are appropriate is another question, which again I shall leave to one side for the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para6"><a name="08071795000105">By its nature, the ISC is the only body that can take the oversight role. To ensure that money continues to be appropriately and well spent, I think that we need to take an even more hands-on approach in that regard. We need to review constantly, rather than retrospectively, the financial situation within the agencies and how money is spent. We are in discussions about how we do that, but there is obviously no point in closing the stable door. One option, in line with the Government&#146;s proposals  <br>

 I think there is scope for liaison. We do, of course, draw on the resources of the National Audit Office in our work of oversight. We need vetted people to help us and there are a limited number of those in the NAO but none, to the best of my knowledge, in the PAC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para7"><a name="08071795000108">The point is also relevant to the more general question of resource allocation and whether funding is sufficient. I suspect that the question about whether the funding is enough is probably unanswerable, but given the gravity of the threat faced by the UK, we must be confident that additional funds are appropriately distributed and targeted. We must be careful to ensure that, in rightly focusing resources on the threat of terrorism, we do not neglect to think carefully how best we can use total funds. For instance, the Committee, and hon. Members earlier in the debate, have expressed concern that the recent recruitment drives launched by the agencies&#151;a significant reason for the increased expenditure&#151;may lead to a dilution in the quality of staff and to grade inflation. Over 2007-08, for example, the Security Service aimed to supplement its existing 3,200-strong work force with an additional 690 officers&#151;an increase of 20 per cent. We obviously should not prize quantity above quality, but again we are assured, and we accept, that the issue is being managed effectively. The report notes the Committee&#146;s concern that while the agencies&#146; focus on countering the threat of terrorism is both necessary and understandable, it has resulted in a</p>

In many ways 9/11 reinforced that trend, as the more amorphous threat posed by Islamic terrorism came to be seen as the primary threat to our national security. The national security strategy announced in March reflected that in its focus on the dangers posed by terror networks and other non-state actors. It had very little to say on state-led threats. I worry that pooling all our resources into the war on terror may have taken the focus away from more traditional forces of threat.</p>

 It is not for me to comment on that, but I am sure that the point has been recorded and will be noted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para13"><a name="08071795000116">There has been a growing number of warnings over the past year about the extent of covert activity by foreign intelligence organisations in the UK. There has been a spate of unconfirmed stories about the hacking of sensitive computer networks in Whitehall Departments, in parliamentary offices and UK businesses. It is said that 30 agents are operating out of the Russian embassy and trade mission in London&#151;the same number as during the cold war. That has been referred to in some respects. Much of that is tied to the increased competition between nation states over resources, whether energy, technology or information. That seems set to define the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para14"><a name="08071795000117">Despite the changing nature of the security environment since the end of the cold war, it is dangerous to ignore the more conventional threats. The Security Service currently spends only a small percentage of its resources on counter-espionage. The majority of the agency&#146;s resources go into combating terrorism at home and abroad&#151;that is right&#151;but at a time when other countries are increasing the sophistication and reach of their espionage activities, we may need to rethink that division of resources. Our report suggests that</p>
<a name="80717-0017.htm_brev3"><a name="08071795000495"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;consideration may need to be given to separate, additional funding&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para16"><a name="08071795000119">Again speaking from a personal rather than Committee perspective, I want to mention the looming danger posed by cyber threats. I have to say that I defer to no one in my lack of knowledge in that area, but it seems to me that that term broadly describes the intent to defend and attack information and computer networks in cyberspace. The appeal of that form of post-modern, asymmetric warfare is obvious; it is a low-risk strategy, since it is generally difficult to trace the origins of cyber attacks and to apportion blame, but it is high yield in the sense that it gives states or individuals the opportunity to offset the superiority of an adversary&#146;s forces on the conventional battlefield. Smaller players can level the playing field with larger opponents in the cyber arena, because of the relative ease of access to the technology.</p>

It is vital that this issue is given the requisite attention. At the very least, perhaps we need to think about the allocation of more resources  <br>

 May I say what a pleasure it is to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, South (Ben Chapman), particularly his lucid explanation of post-modern, asymmetric warfare? I am sure that the whole House is now far better informed on that subject than we were a few moments ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para18"><a name="08071795000122">I want to address some of the issues that have been raised variously by my hon. Friends the Members for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay), for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) and for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick). In an ideal world, the secrecy involved in the various agencies and the collection of intelligence would not be so wide ranging as it must be in the world in which we live. Therefore, greater openness would be perfectly possible, because a smaller amount of information would need to be dealt with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para19"><a name="08071795000123">As many hon. Members have said, the threat in the post-9/11 world from those who are influenced by Salafi ideology, which was born in Egypt but has been assimilated by groups such as al-Qaeda, is such that we need to have extensive coverage of what is going on in the UK and in countries such as Pakistan and other countries in the middle east and elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para20"><a name="08071795000124">If we are to deal with a lot of intelligence information that is by its nature secret, it is not possible for it all to be discussed openly or for us to conform with all the democratic requirements that rightly apply to other areas of policy. We are not dealing with the health service or education; the information is of a completely different kind and it has to be dealt with differently.</p>

 Nobody is arguing that all the information should be put in the public domain; the argument is that in a democracy the Intelligence and Security Committee should account to Parliament, not to the Prime Minister.</p>

 My hon. Friend will forgive me if I say that that is exactly what we are discussing here today. I shall move on. I shall probably answer his substantive point slightly differently in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para21"><a name="08071795000127">My view is that as far as possible everything should be as out in the open as is reasonable. It is appropriate that, through the Green Paper, the Government have considered how we scrutinise and how we can do more things in public. I shall not cover that ground too much, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett), who chairs our Committee, dealt with it in great detail and in a way that represents the views of most, if not all, of the Committee&#146;s members. Some things we can do in public and some we cannot. The obvious example&#151;the national security strategy&#151;was raised by my right hon. Friend. As that is a public document, it seems reasonable that much of any interview that we have with the heads of the agencies or those responsible for them should be public; I have no problem with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para22"><a name="08071795000128">My point is that there is a trade-off: the more that we do in public as a Committee, the less we will get to know. I cannot go into detail, for obvious reasons, but  <br>

in one of our recent investigations, for example, we looked at some raw intelligence information. It goes without saying that if, as is sometimes necessary, we have the ability to do that, we cannot suddenly grill someone about that information in public. A big element of what we do has to take place behind closed doors; the right hon. Member for East Hampshire (Mr. Mates) made that point very effectively, so I will not take it any further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para23"><a name="08071795000129">In the three years during which I have been a member of the Committee, we have had the opportunity to talk to the members of other oversight committees from other parts of the world&#151;Spain, South Africa, Australia, Canada and others. I should add that most of the time they come to see us rather than the other way round, in case anyone thinks that we spend all our time travelling around the globe. One of the points that has come out of a lot of the dialogue that we have had with people on other oversight bodies is that they envy the extent to which we can go into greater depth and look at information that they simply would not be allowed to consider. They have often made the point that we are probably more effective because we are more behind closed doors than our equivalents in other parts of the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para24"><a name="08071795000130">I had intended to say a lot more, but time forbids. I also want to address briefly the review of counter-terrorism strategy; our report refers to that from page 27. I am thinking particularly of the Contest strategy, and, within that, the Prevent strand. One of the great lessons that we learned from the London bombings of three years ago is that some young, and in many cases British-born, Muslims are so alienated&#151;that is probably the wrong word; &#147;detached&#148; is better&#151;from their own predominantly Muslim community and broader British society. There are all sorts of reasons for that, but I do not have time to go into them now. The agencies are well aware of those reasons, and I know that the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government is also pursuing that agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para25"><a name="08071795000131">It is hugely important that we better understand the process that often leads young Muslim men&#151;it is almost exclusively young Muslim men&#151;to move from a point at which they might be considered radical to a point at which they are willing to strap on explosives, go on to the public transport system and kill and maim hundreds of people. At some future time, it could even be thousands of people. There is a very good book on that process by an American academic and former employee of the State Department, Marc Sageman, called &#147;Understanding Terror Networks&#148;. It is important that that kind of open-source information should be taken into account by the agencies as they increasingly try to understand what is going on in our own community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para26"><a name="08071795000132">A further point on the radicalisation and conversion to terror of young Muslims is that we need directly to engage with them. There are some who would be described by them as apostates&#151;for example, Hassan Butt and Ed Husain. Those people have held that ideology and then rejected it, and are now doing a very brave thing in raising these issues, having come to an understanding of how wrong they were. They are writing articles, making speeches and giving lectures on this subject. They and others in the Muslim community who are moderate in their interpretation of Islam must be strongly encouraged. If we are to prevent more and more young Muslim men from becoming terrorists, almost nothing is more important  <br>

than that engagement. I know that the agencies recognise that fact, but I hope that we all recognise that we have a responsibility to engage with those people and to understand their genuine issues and grievances while, at the same time, being firm in pointing out that terror and blowing people up are not acceptable in this country and will never be condoned simply because they take on a religious colour.</p>

 I shall take only a couple of minutes. I came here to support my good Friend the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay), but I might make one or two other observations, having listened to the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para27"><a name="08071795000134">My Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor) talked about the agencies selecting from a smaller pool of people. That was very delphic; I really wondered what she meant by that. I find myself thinking that the report is very disappointing when it comes to staffing and recruitment issues. The right hon. Member for East Hampshire (Mr. Mates) told us that it is not about recruiting the wrong people but about getting enough of the right people, yet there is nothing substantial in the report about recruitment methods or turnover. We know how many people there are in the three agencies. We are told that it is 3,200, and that there has been an explosion in numbers, with another 690 being recruited in 2007-08. Presumably that recruitment will continue into the future, so long as there is this terrorist threat. We also know that there are concerns within the  agencies about the civil service retirement age increasing to 65 over the coming years. And that really is about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="80717-0017.htm_para28"><a name="08071795000135">My substantive point is that the staff at GCHQ&#151;in fact, the staff of all the agencies&#151;are civil servants, but they do not have all the rights of civil servants. There is no requirement, for example, to appoint according to merit. That is at the core of the United Kingdom civil service, but GCHQ and the other two agencies could just drag someone off the street and appoint them. GCHQ staff cannot take their concerns to the Office of the Civil Service Commissioners, or any other outside body.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is plain wrong about that. In the Committee&#146;s lifetime, a special person has been appointed to whom any member of any of the security services can, in confidence, take any ethical, professional or other concerns, without going through their line management. That has been working extremely well. He ought to get his facts right.</p>

 I hear what the right hon. Gentleman says, but I wonder whether that system is sufficient. In 2004, when the Government published a draft Civil Service Bill, in response to the draft Civil Service Bill produced by the Public Administration Committee, it included reference to GCHQ, but in the draft Constitutional Renewal Bill currently before the House, which is being considered by a Joint Committee, GCHQ has disappeared in a puff of smoke. When the first civil service commissioner, Janet Paraskeva, came before the PAC in April, she voiced her concerns about that. I am left wondering why the thousands of staff in the intelligence agencies are the only civil servants not to be covered by the draft Constitutional Renewal Bill. My invitation to the right  <br>

Many members of those agencies will, at times in their careers, have to risk their life and safety to protect our national interests.

Assembly in December 2006. In a written answer on 14 November 2007, Lord Malloch-Brown said that the United Kingdom had been active in promoting agreement on the convention, but that there had been a delay in the ratification process in this country. It has been suggested to me that genuine security concerns lie behind that delay. If so, I would be grateful for any light that the Foreign Secretary can throw on that matter. If the issue is simply stuck in a Whitehall pending tray, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will use his influence to get the file out of pending as soon as possible and have work done to take that instrument forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80717-0018.htm_para4"><a name="08071795000143">This afternoon, the debate has centred on the extent to which it will be possible to strengthen parliamentary oversight of the Committee&#146;s work. To some extent, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) said, we must accept that activities involving the intelligence and security agencies now involve other agencies whose activities fall under the remit of parliamentary Select Committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="80717-0018.htm_para5"><a name="08071795000144">My hon. and learned Friend cited the case of action against organised crime. Paragraph 32 of the ISC report states that the Secret Intelligence Service is transferring resources away from organised crime in order to focus on the priority of counter-terrorism and that it is transferring greater responsibility for such work to the Serious Organised Crime Agency. Paragraphs 37 and 38 of the report describe how the SIS and SOCA are co-operating against drugs traffickers and the global narcotics network. Such activity is certainly in this country&#146;s national interest, but there is a discrepancy. SOCA is subject to oversight by the Home Affairs Committee and the Public Accounts Committee, but the SIS is not subject to a departmental Select Committee or to the PAC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80717-0018.htm_para6"><a name="08071795000145">Another anomaly concerns Northern Ireland, where the Police Service of Northern Ireland works closely with the Security Service at a new base in Belfast. Those PSNI officers are, through their chief constable, accountable in law to the Northern Ireland Policing Board. When the appropriate legislation was going through this House, we were told that there were to be protocols to define how the information and work shared between the Security Service and the PSNI should be handled when it came to accountability before the Policing Board. It would be interesting to know whether those protocols are operating successfully. There is an expectation, particularly in the nationalist community in Northern Ireland, that responsibility for policing and criminal justice will be devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly. If that comes to fruition, the PSNI will include in its ranks officers working with the Security Service, which will report to a policing Minister in Northern Ireland, who might, at some stage in future, be a member of Provisional Sinn Fein. That illustrates the fact that, to some extent, the boundaries between the areas that are regarded as secret and subject to the ISC and those that are subject to other parliamentary or regional Assembly bodies are becoming a bit blurred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80717-0018.htm_para7"><a name="08071795000146">I welcome the reforms that the Home Secretary announced, but the question is whether they go far enough. I agree with the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) that three and a half hours&#146; debate in 18 months on the vital work of the agencies is inadequate. I hope that Government business managers  <br>

Friend the Member for Croydon, South that the ISC&#146;s investigative capacity and resources should be enhanced. The more that the resources and investigatory powers of the ISC come to match those of the Public Accounts Committee, the better it will be for effective scrutiny by the ISC of the agencies, above all given the enhanced budget and increasingly important role that those agencies are playing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="80717-0018.htm_para9"><a name="08071795000148">The central question in much of the debate was the extent to which the ISC&#146;s proceedings can be made more open.

The hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) reminded us that in the past 20 years we have come a long way from the time when even an explicit mention of a meeting with the director general of the Security Service had to be written in code on the Home Secretary&#146;s diary sheet. I hope that, in the context of a proper statutory reform of the ISC, we can push the envelope further and move, step by step, towards even greater openness than that which we have today.</p>

 I thank all right hon. and hon. Members who have made this a constructive and useful debate. The ISC is, in a way, a very British institution as regards how it works and tries within the limits of our own practice to get the right degree of rigour in the scrutiny of Government and the agencies without compromising the vital work that they do. Let me put it on record that from the Government&#146;s point of view it is in our interest, never mind the country&#146;s interest, that that scrutiny is as rigorous as possible given the limits that need to exist.</p>

security challenges that we face; the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) spoke about bravery, and he was right to do so. Very briefly, I would like to put it on record that I have known Alex Allan for 11 years now, and a couple of hon. Members referred to his recent illness and passed on their best wishes to him. I am delighted to say that he will be able to recognise the warmth and strength of that feeling when it is passed on to him in hospital. I am sure that we all wish him a speedy and full recovery from his illness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80717-0018.htm_para13"><a name="08071795000155">I would also like to thank sincerely all members of the Committee that is led by my right hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett), and my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), who was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor), for his efforts. The rigour with which they approach their task is important for the Government and the nation, and we are developing a balance of challenge and support that is appropriate for the difficult issues that we face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="80717-0018.htm_para14"><a name="08071795000156">I would like to pick up on as many as possible of the comments made by hon. Members without trying the patience of the House. In case hon. Members are worried, I am not planning to take us up to 6 o&#146;clock&#151;this will not be a Castro-length peroration, tempting though it is to engage in such a peroration about the reforms. The hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway) suggested that the reforms could not be classified as revolutionary, which is right, but that is partly because the system has strengths, and we want to build on those rather than up-end the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="80717-0018.htm_para15"><a name="08071795000157">The Intelligence and Security Committee differs from parliamentary Select Committees for a simple reason: in order to carry out its work it needs access to highly classified materials.

Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) in a moment&#151;need to take place in a secure environment, behind closed doors. Its reports inevitably contain highly classified information, which is why the Prime Minister is the first to see them in their entirety and why versions laid before the House are redacted&#151;a point that I shall also return to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="80717-0018.htm_para16"><a name="08071795000158">I shall start with the Government&#146;s proposal for a new Standing Order that would change the process of appointing hon. Members so that they would go before the House by means of the Committee of Selection, and right hon. and hon. Members would get to vote on them before their names were put to the Prime Minister for agreement. The Prime Minister will retain the final say on membership as he is ultimately responsible for and accountable to the House on matters of national security. It is right to make this reform in the interests of the openness and parliamentary accountability that hon. Members have referred to.</p>

 I do not think that the Foreign Secretary was in the Chamber for this part of the debate, but is there any reason why people cannot be nominated, elected and then vetted? Why does it have to be the other way around? Surely, that effectively means that the Prime Minister would retain the right to veto potentially for political reasons, not because someone is in some way unreliable.</p>

 The House will be able to judge clearly the merits of the case put to it by the Committee of Selection, and if a capricious decision were made after that, the House would be able to see it. The reform makes sense, and answers the case that has been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="80717-0018.htm_para17"><a name="08071795000161">Let me address the point about the openness of hearings by heads of agencies, and the notion of such hearings taking place in open session. That process will not be straightforward, and the right hon. Member for East Hampshire (Mr. Mates), among others, has referred to that. We cannot put issues of national security or the safety of individuals&#151;I underline that second point&#151;at risk, and nor do we want to limit the type of evidence that the Committee can hear in order for it to operate in public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="80717-0018.htm_para18"><a name="08071795000162">The Government believe that there is scope for holding some sessions in public, and we want to make progress on that. However, we must protect national security, and in that context, the Government must consider when it is appropriate for evidence to be taken in public. Given our commitment to explore the matter with the ISC&#146;s Chairman and its members, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North will not press his amendment, but hold us to account for our progress in developing some open sessions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="80717-0018.htm_para19"><a name="08071795000163">Next there is the anomaly of the ISC annual report being debated only here and not in the other place. That must change and I do not believe that anyone objects to that. Providing that the Chairman of the  ISC should open the debate in the House is a worthwhile innovation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="80717-0018.htm_para20"><a name="08071795000164">Some questions have been asked about the ISC&#146;s resources. They have doubled in the past five years, but I heard the comments about the commitment of hon. Members of all parties to giving the ISC the resources that it needs. Obviously, they cannot be infinite, but we are committed to ensuring that the Committee has what it needs to carry out its duties effectively. We are happy to work with the Committee on an independent investigator.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="80717-0018.htm_para21"><a name="08071795000165">Let me consider staffing and amendment (a), which my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) tabled. Appointments are made to the secretariat through free and fair competition. As the right hon. Member for East Hampshire made clear, it is open to a Clerk of the House or anyone else to apply for a job with the ISC. All staff, whether ISC or not, would be on civil service terms and conditions. However, we cannot accept the amendment because it would not be appropriate for staff who work for a Committee, which reports directly to the Prime Minister rather than to Parliament&#151;as is essential, given the nature of the ISC and its work&#151;to be under the authority of the Clerk of the House. I therefore hope that my hon. Friend will not move his amendment. Once we have agreement about the fundamental basis of the ISC, I do not understand how his proposal is practical.</p>

 If my amendment were accepted, it could clearly only flag up what must be included in primary legislation. All the difficulties that my right hon. Friend raises can be overcome by discussion, so that the Clerk remains the Clerk of the House of Commons, but the Committee could still answer directly to the Prime Minister. I shall not trespass into that argument.   <br>

Members referred to reports in <i> The Guardian </i>about UK complicity in the torture of UK nationals detained in Pakistan&#151;an extremely serious charge. The Security Service has checked for any relevant information in the light of the media allegations and informed me that there is nothing to suggest that it has supported torture in Pakistan or anywhere else. The Government&#146;s position is clear: we unreservedly condemn the use of torture. We take allegations of mistreatment extremely seriously and would follow up all such allegations very carefully. Of course, as my right hon.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to mention the importance of Burton&#146;s brewing museum not only to local people but nationally and internationally. Burton on Trent grew out of the brewing industry, which developed because of the quality of the area&#146;s water, and it still produces splendid beer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80717-0019.htm_para8"><a name="08071795000441">In 1977, centuries of brewing in Burton were recognised when the Bass museum was opened to celebrate the bicentenary of Bass. At that time, the museum was housed in the grade II three-storey building known as the joiner&#146;s shop. In the 30 years since then, the museum has grown and it now occupies several buildings on the site. There is not only a large gallery that describes the brewing process, but a library, archive and educational facilities, paddocks and stables for the shire horses, a Robey steam engine and vintage road and rail vehicles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80717-0019.htm_para9"><a name="08071795000442">In 2002, Coors Brewers acquired the museum following the company&#146;s purchase of the Bass brewery from Interbrew. However, the Bass name remained with Interbrew and, in 2003, the museum was renamed the Coors visitor centre and museum of brewing. Sadly, in March, Coors announced that it could no longer continue to fund the museum and that it would close at the end of June. That announcement was met with great sadness, some anger and a demand for a way forward to be found to save the museum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80717-0019.htm_para10"><a name="08071795000443">The messages of support for the museum that I received came from throughout the UK and from other countries, including France, Canada and America. Both local and national organisations contacted me. I was grateful that the local paper, the<i>  Burton Mail</i><i> ,</i> launched a petition, which gathered thousands of signatures and was presented to my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport, who is the Minister responsible for culture, creative industries and tourism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80717-0019.htm_para11"><a name="08071795000444">I have received e-mails from relatives of those who established the museum, and from those who just wished me good luck or asked me to save the museum. I also received messages reflecting the museum&#146;s importance, saying that it enables local people to find a sense of their own history and connect it with their heritage. Another e-mail referred to the museum by describing the history of brewing in Burton as the foundation on which the town was built and the museum&#146;s closure as damaging to the local economy. A former Burtonian living in New Jersey referred to having brought small groups of Americans to Burton to visit both Marston&#146;s Brewery, with its unique Burton Union system, and the museum of brewing, which was described as the highlight of the trip.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80717-0019.htm_para12"><a name="08071795000445">Given so many messages of support for the museum, I felt that it was important to draw together the many organisations that had contacted me, so I organised a meeting at the Coors visitor centre at the end of March. I expected there to be about 20 people at that meeting, but, in fact, 36 attended, including representatives of the following: Coors; Museums, Libraries and Archives West Midlands; Advantage West Midlands; Staffordshire county council, East Staffordshire borough council; the  <br>

Campaign for Real Ale&#151;CAMRA; the British Guild of Beer Writers, the chamber of commerce; Burton rotary club; local businesses; and local newspapers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80717-0019.htm_para13"><a name="08071795000446">From that meeting, a steering group was formed to take forward the development of an options appraisal. One of the key issues raised at the first meeting was the proposed date for closure of the museum and the lack of time to secure a rescue. There was also concern that the artefacts might be dispersed. Therefore, following that meeting, I wrote to Coors asking whether the closure could be delayed and whether Coors would be prepared to make a financial commitment to the museum&#146;s future operation. I was pleased that before the first steering group meeting, I received a response from Coors saying that it would be willing to contribute ongoing costs of up to &#163;100,000 per year, as well as the lease of the museum buildings at a peppercorn rent. On top of that, Coors would also be prepared to donate a one-off, match-funded payment of up to &#163;200,000 to a new organisation running the museum. Although Coors could not delay the closure of the museum beyond the end of June, it agreed to keep the museum&#146;s artefacts and contents intact until the end of the year, so that a plan could be developed to re-open the centre to the public. Coors also agreed to continue to provide curatorial support until the end of the year to ensure the preservation of the collections, and the shire horses would also be retained during that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="80717-0019.htm_para14"><a name="08071795000447">The steering group agreed to appoint consultants to produce an options analysis and their final report was released this week. I want to express my thanks to East Staffordshire borough council and Advantage West Midlands for agreeing jointly to fund the consultants, and to Staffordshire county council for agreeing to provide administrative and communications support for the steering group, as well as providing the Coors visitor centre and museum of brewing with staff time to catalogue the extensive archives held on site. I would particularly like to thank Jon Finch, chief executive of Museums, Libraries and Archives West Midlands, for his tremendous support and guidance over the last few weeks. I feel sure we would not have made the progress that we have without him on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="80717-0019.htm_para15"><a name="08071795000448">The report from Jura Consultants provided a way forward for the museum, and at the last meeting of the steering group, we agreed to ask the key stakeholders&#151;Coors, East Staffordshire borough council and Staffordshire county council&#151;to meet to endeavour to produce a business plan. The consultants&#146; report examined the aims and objectives for the future operation of the centre, which include the future contribution the museum can make to tourism and to the regeneration of Burton, finding a financially viable future for the centre, and the necessity to protect the collections, both the objects and the archives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="80717-0019.htm_para16"><a name="08071795000449">The consultants&#146; report describes the collection by saying:</p>
<a name="80717-0019.htm_brev15"><a name="08071795000511"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The collections held at the Coors Visitor Centre are the most significant collection of brewing related objects in Britain. Furthermore, the archive, which comprises the core administrative, financial, production and employment records of Bass and of the many companies from all over the UK absorbed by Bass over decades, is of national significance. It is therefore important that any future of the Coors Visitor Centre should ensure the collections are protected. The value of the collections could also be diminished if they were to be split up&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80717-0019.htm_para17"><a name="08071795000450">The museum&#146;s collection includes not only brewing and malting equipment, brewery transport and specialist items, such as coopering tools, but packaging and historic advertising items&#151;ceramics, glassware, artwork and mirrors. It is also a repository for the Burton town museum, which closed several years ago. It therefore reflects both our local and national heritage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="80717-0019.htm_para18"><a name="08071795000451">The importance of the brewing museum in Burton to our national heritage is reflected in articles that have appeared in national publications. In <i> The Guardian, </i>Roger Protz, editor of the Campaign for Real Ale's &#147;Good Beer Guide&#148; wrote an article entitled &#147;A Beery Past Imperilled&#148;. He said:</p>
<a name="80717-0019.htm_brev16"><a name="08071795000512"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Great brewing nations celebrate the contribution beer has made to their development as civilised societies with dedicated museums.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="80717-0019.htm_para19"><a name="08071795000452">He went on:</p>

It makes a sizable contribution to the wealth of the nation.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="80717-0019.htm_para20"><a name="08071795000453">The article described the history of Burton, saying:</p>
<a name="80717-0019.htm_brev18"><a name="08071795000514"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Burton-on-Trent became an important brewing centre as early as the 11th century, when the monks of Burton Abbey were encouraged to make ale for the Earl of Mercia&#151;aided by a constant supply of pure hard spring water from the Trent valley. It was this water, allied to new technologies of the industrial revolution, that enabled brewers in the town to fashion a groundbreaking, globally exported style of beer: pale ale.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="80717-0019.htm_para21"><a name="08071795000454">The article continued:</p>
<a name="80717-0019.htm_brev19"><a name="08071795000515"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The small town of Burton heaved with breweries and their armies of workers. The brewers developed their own private railways to feed into the new national network.

</ul><a name="80717-0019.htm_brev20"><a name="08071795000516"><ul><p class="tabletext">All this history is brilliantly depicted in the Museum in Burton and shows how beer and brewing are part of the warp and weft of British society.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="80717-0019.htm_para22"><a name="08071795000455">I should like to thank Roger Protz for his outspoken support for the museum in Burton and for his vision of its development into a truly national museum of brewing. The chair of the British Guild of Beer Writers, Tim Hampson, wrote a letter to <i> The</i><i> </i><i> Guardian </i>in support of the museum. He said:</p>

Nothing on its scale exists anywhere else in Britain. And Burton is the natural place to keep it. Burton and the museum are intertwined and it is essential that we try to preserve the heritage, not only of the brewing industry, but of the town. Coors must give the project to create a National Museum of Brewing something almost as valuable as the collection itself&#151;time.&#148;</p>

I understand that, if significant progress can be made towards finding a new operator for the museum, then an extension to the company's commitment could be forthcoming. However, we need to make speedy progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="80717-0020.htm_para0"><a name="08071795000458">The steering group asked the key stakeholders to consider three options put forward by Jura Consultants. All the options would involve using the whole site, and would therefore be able to secure the &#163;100,000 per year financial commitment from Coors, but all would need an operating subsidy of between &#163;140,000 to &#163;256,000 per annum. Each of the options would provide the potential to develop the museum and to seek national status. The consultants&#146; report says:</p>
<a name="80717-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="08071795000519"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Even without national status, the museum would be the premier brewing museum in the UK and an important facility for those wanting to understand, research and enjoy the UK's brewing heritage.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="80717-0020.htm_para1"><a name="08071795000461">The report continues:</p>
<a name="80717-0020.htm_brev1"><a name="08071795000520"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;One further issue regarding national status is that this could lead to the Coors visitor centre attracting significant collections leading to exciting new displays, which in turn would have the potential to attract additional visitors.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80717-0020.htm_para2"><a name="08071795000462">I very much hope that the many messages of support for the museum, locally and nationally, can now be messages of financial commitment in order to take forward the new operation of the museum, possibly as an independent charitable trust. When my right hon. Friend the Minister of State met a delegation at my request, she offered to contact brewers who might be willing to support the museum. She also mentioned the possibility of support through the Heritage Lottery Fund and Renaissance funding. Local people have suggested voluntary fund raising and at this point I should like to thank all the volunteers who have supported the museum over the years. All those forms of funding can help to sustain and improve it in future years, but a secure stream of revenue of funding is needed to take the project forward. For that, I believe that we must look to both local government and industry. East Staffordshire borough council has, as one of its priorities, the encouragement and development of local prosperity and Staffordshire county council includes in its priorities economic development and enterprise and sustainable development. Advantage West Midland&#146;s strategic objectives include attracting more visitors from outside the region. I feel that all these priorities could be helped by support for the brewing museum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="80717-0020.htm_para3"><a name="08071795000463">I also urge the brewing and pub industry to come forward with offers of financial support. I know that these are not easy times for the industry, but this is a golden opportunity to have a museum that reflects the industry as a whole. When the museum was run by only one brewer, it could not be a national museum, nor could it draw down financial support from the lottery and other bodies. The opportunity is now there to develop a national museum of brewing. This is a one-off opportunity, and one that we cannot afford to miss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80717-0020.htm_para4"><a name="08071795000464">I urge any local and national organisations linked with the brewing industry, or in the case of local bodies, concerned for the future of the town of Burton on Trent, to come forward and make a long-term commitment to the financial support of the museum, subject of course to its becoming an independent museum. If all the disparate organisations&#151;business, local government and other groups&#151;can join together, both the financial burden and, in a sense, ownership of the museum can be shared.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="80717-0020.htm_para5"><a name="08071795000465">I have tried to involve all those organisations that contacted me to support the museum in discussions about its future. I hope that we now can see a united  <br>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean) on her campaign to keep the Bass brewery open. Forty-odd years ago, when Burton was still the brewing capital of the world, and still producing magnificent beers, a few fairly rumbustious friends and I used to travel to Burton by train. I well remember Burton at the time. It used to smell of three things: gasworks, breweries and Marmite. Marmite is still there&#151;the factory is still there, as far as I am aware.</p>

<p><a name="st_o397"><a name="08071795000467"><a name="80717-0020.htm_spnew1"><a name="08071795000836"><b>Mrs. Dean:</b>
 I think that Burton no longer smells of the gas; it still smells of Marmite and brewing.</p>

 It still smells of breweries and Marmite&#151;great place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="80717-0020.htm_para6"><a name="08071795000469">Here is one of my memories of those days. I was a pint drinker; we drank beer in pints in Derby. I had the unique experience of going into a public house in Burton&#151;I think it was called &#147;The Derby Turn&#148; because, coming from Derby, we would go into &#147;The Derby Turn&#148;&#151;and saying, &#147;I&#146;ll have a pint of Bass, please&#148;, and hearing the whole public house go absolutely silent. I could not understand it, but the reason was that in Burton people did not drink pints; they only ever drank half pints. Why? Bass and all the breweries round there brewed a flat beer, and the view was that if you had a pint, by the time you got to the bottom it would have gone flat, so you only drank out of half-pint glasses. It was absolute sacrilege for anyone to come in and order a pint.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="80717-0020.htm_para7"><a name="08071795000470">Sadly, Bass&#146;s brewery, as such, has gone, it having been bought out by Coors. The chimney with &#147;Bass&#148; lit up at night has gone; that has now, I think, been replaced by &#147;Coors&#148;. It is sad, but a fact of life.</p>

 My hon. Friend may not be aware that draught Bass is currently brewed at Marston&#146;s.</p>

 I was well aware that Bass is still brewed. People can still get good copperhead Bass. It is still excellent quality, but it is brewed at Marston&#146;s brewery. For those who want to be technical, the Union brewery process is used to make another excellent beer&#151;Marston&#146;s Pedigree&#151;but, thankfully, Bass is also brewed there. It would be an absolute tragedy if almost the last name of Bass departed as a result of the museum closing. The Minister should take the opportunity to visit it if, as I hope, it reopens.</p>

 The Minister ought to take the opportunity to visit the museum. I have heard little rumours&#151;they might be malicious&#151;that he has been occasionally seen imbibing alcohol, namely beer, in odd places around here. He should go to Martson&#146;s brewery and sample a good half pint of Marton&#146;s Pedigree, followed by an excellent half pint of copperhead Bass&#151;wonderful; the elixir of life.

stay closed. It should reopen. It is part of industrial history, not just for Burton, but for all those people who like good-quality beers, as opposed to some of the noxious rubbish that we are sometimes forced to imbibe in various parts of the world. Magnificent beer; magnificent history; magnificent brewery; and I shall give whatever support I can to my hon. Friend the Member for Burton to ensure that the Bass museum continues to survive for hundreds of years.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean) on securing this debate and on leading the campaign to save the brewing museum in Burton on Trent. I am delighted to have had the educational experience of hearing my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Laxton) in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Burton, both of whom are members of the all-party beer group. Indeed, the chairman of that group, my hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) is with us now, so this is indeed an important debate on a serious issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="80717-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08071795000477">As my hon. Friend the Member for Burton has rightly pointed out, there is centuries of brewing heritage in Burton on Trent, with many important brewery buildings and, until very recently, a brewing museum. As she has said, Burton is synonymous with brewing. Great brewing names, such as Bass, Worthington, Ind Coope and Charrington, all had links to Burton, thus making it the brewing capital of the world in the 19th century. By the close of that century, I understand that some 87 miles of private brewery railway lines criss-crossed the town, with 32 level-crossing gates controlling the movement of freight across public roads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="80717-0020.htm_para11"><a name="08071795000478">Even today, there are still brewery businesses in the town, including Coors and Marston&#146;s, and the town&#146;s brewing heritage continues to be celebrated in the name of the local arts centre and the nickname of the local football team&#151;the Brewers&#151;to name but two. So it is not surprising that the people of Burton signed a petition in their thousands to save the museum from closure and came on to the streets to protest against the closure, with the support of their local newspaper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="80717-0020.htm_para12"><a name="08071795000479">Clearly, it is disappointing that Coors could not keep the visitor centre and museum running as a going concern, but I would rather focus on the future than on the past. Yes, the museum may be closed for now, but that should not be the end of the story. The Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport, my right hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Margaret Hodge), met my hon. Friend and local representatives on 16 June. Both my right hon. Friend and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport are keen to see the museum reopen in some form. The Museums, Libraries and Archives Council&#151;the MLA&#151;which is the DCMS&#146;s strategic body for the sector, is advising a steering group on the options that are available. As was reported in the <i> Burton Mail</i>, we do believe that saving the museum is possible and that the setting up of a charitable trust and then fundraising is a fight worth fighting. My right hon. Friend the Member for Barking has said that she will write to the major brewers in this country to seek their financial support for a national museum of brewing. This is not simply  <br>

about rebadging the Coors visitor centre under a new name; it has to be about celebrating and explaining the role that brewing and pubs play in underpinning our communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="80717-0020.htm_para13"><a name="08071795000480">The new museum must tell the story of brewing in the community of Burton and its importance for the country as a whole. As a nation, we take our beer pretty seriously, and a national brewing museum has the potential to be the public front door for the brewing industry and its impressive history. When the museum reopens, I shall take up the invitation of my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North and visit it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="80717-0020.htm_para14"><a name="08071795000481">However, first the stakeholder steering group needs to assess what needs to happen to make the museum a viable proposition. That includes arriving at a good, solid, sustainable business plan with a broad range of long-term funding partners behind it. Those will need to include not just Coors, the other brewers and the wider brewing fraternity, but the local authorities&#151;Staffordshire county council and East Staffordshire borough council. As local authorities, they should consider the value that they place on the museum and whether they can contribute to its future, as I understand that there has not been a local authority-backed museum in the town since the 1980s. Support could also come from the regional development agency, Advantage West Midlands, which has the strategic leadership role for the tourism economy in the region. For instance, there could be scope for marketing the museum as a visitor attraction, alongside the national forest, to draw in visitors to the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="80717-0020.htm_para15"><a name="08071795000482">The new brewing museum should work towards achieving the museum accreditation standard. Accreditation is about a minimum standard of service delivery and public accountability and more than 1,800 museums across the United Kingdom have so far achieved it. Whether a museum has accreditation is a factor in the Heritage Lottery Fund&#146;s assessment of funding applications from museums. East Staffordshire is a priority area for the fund. Only accredited museums can receive funds from the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council-Victoria and Albert Museum purchase grant fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="80717-0020.htm_para16"><a name="08071795000483">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport can also play its part through the Renaissance programme for regional museums, which is managed by the MLA. The Renaissance programme received an index-linked settlement in the comprehensive spending review and the programme includes the Museum Development Fund, which provides advice and support to the museum community in the west midlands. Once the museum is a going concern, it could use Renaissance in the west midlands to build its audiences and develop its strengths. The new brewing museum will also need to earn its own income from entry fees and other commercial activity. The working group is considering whether corporate and private hospitality and conferencing could help cross-subsidise the museum. Other ideas have included setting up an further education school of brewing as a centre of excellence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80717-0020.htm_para17"><a name="08071795000484">Gaining charitable trust status could also help in winning public grant funding and make the museum more attractive to private and philanthropic giving and local entrepreneurs. However, competition for resources is tough. More than half the museums in this country are independent; they range from small local organisations, mainly operated by volunteers, to larger national organisations such as the Ironbridge Gorge museum or Chatham historic dockyard. The museum will have to operate within the resources that are ultimately available to it, and volunteers will have an important role to play in developing the museum and its visitor programme over time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80717-0020.htm_para18"><a name="08071795000485">The coming months will be a challenge for the steering group. I am optimistic in my support for the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Burton and for the wider industry. The enthusiasm of the people of Burton on Trent gives us the opportunity to ensure that the wider community of people in this country, who are passionate about beer and brewing, can have a museum of which they are proud. I hope that we can assist the stakeholder group and that my hon. Friends will keep up the pressure to try to get the museum open again.</p>
