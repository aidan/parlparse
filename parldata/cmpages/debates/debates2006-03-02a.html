 As we set out in our response to the Treasury Committee&#039;s recent report, the Government believe that access to cash is important. Although 96 per cent. of cash machine withdrawals are made from free machines, we know that many hon. Members have serious concerns. The Government would be especially worried if people on low incomes incurred a disproportionate cost in accessing their money.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60302-01_spnew5"><b> Mary Creagh: </b> 
 The Economic Secretary is doubtless aware that British consumers will pay &#163;250 million in charges to access their money this year.

 I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s concerns. In the past five or six years, as a result of the work of the Treasury Select Committee and the Treasury, there has been an improvement.

 (Lab/Co-op): I thank the Economic Secretary for his generous gesture in holding that meeting. Before that, two issues need to be considered: first, sharing postcodes in areas where there is concentrated financial inclusion or exclusion, and secondly, transparency. Approaching cash machines should be akin to going to a petrol station, where the customer knows what he or she is getting into. Knowing that is imperative.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60302-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Lewis: </b> 
 I entirely agree with my right hon. Friend, and pay tribute to the work that he has done on this issue. He is right to say that we should be concerned if there were evidence that paying for cash was more prevalent in areas with low-income families and financial exclusion. However, we cannot make a judgment about that unless we are able to collect the appropriate evidence, so it is important that we do that as part of the process. On transparency, I agree entirely with him. It is perfectly reasonable that, when consumers go to cash points, the nature of any charges should be made absolutely clear.

<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60302-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Lewis: </b> 
 That is nonsense. The scare stories that the Scottish National party has put about on the proposed changes to Scottish banknotes simply do not stack up in relation to the facts.

<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60302-01_spmin2"><b>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury  (Mr. Des Browne): </b> 
 The Government are on track to meet the Gershon efficiency targets. The pre-Budget report of 2005 announced a total of &#163;4.7 billion in efficiency gains as at the end of September 2005, with 31,000 head-count reductions and more than 6,000 relocations. This is part of our long-term commitment to improving value for money in public services. Indeed, the National Audit Office agreed, in its recent report, that we were making good progress in that regard.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60302-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Burrowes: </b> 
 With reference to the National Audit Office report, is the lack of clearly measurable efficiency gains a problem of deficient management information systems or of a lack of will to bring about deeper and more systemic changes, or both?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60302-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has had the opportunity to read the National Audit Office report, of which I have a copy here. I will give him this copy if he has not had the opportunity to read all of it. I say that because I have recently had to debate this report with people who manifestly have not read it. The National Audit Office report was summarised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Sir John Bourn, in the following terms in his press release:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_o0">&quot;There are many worthwhile activities going on within the efficiency programme and . . . good progress is clearly being made.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="stpa_o1">We are now 10 months into the delivery of this process, and of course there are challenges in regard to the technical measurements involved. However, those challenges are being met in partnership with the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission. As the report makes clear, the measurement issues are being addressed and resolved.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60302-01_spnew13"><b> Paddy Tipping  (Sherwood)</b> 
 (Lab): Does the Chief Secretary accept that one important way to make efficiency gains is for central Government to have a more strategic, slimmed-down role, with resources devolved to local level, so that local solutions can be found for local problems?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60302-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Absolutely&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Let me just make the point that, in the whole of my public and political life, I have been arguing for and supporting devolution. Certainly, no Back Bencher needs to persuade me of its importance, or of what it has delivered for Scotland. The most important thing for my hon. Friend and his constituents is not only that decisions are made at the appropriate level&#151;and some of them ought to be devolved&#151;but that we devolve jobs out of the south-east. Part of the process of the efficiency agenda involves moving jobs from London and the south-east to the regions of England, Scotland and elsewhere, and we have been successful in doing so.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60302-01_spnew15"><b> Greg Clark  (Tunbridge Wells)</b> 
 (Con): In the Chancellor&#039;s last Budget, three weeks before the last general election, he claimed &#163;2 billion worth of Gershon efficiency savings. On Monday, the National Audit Office will tell the Public Accounts Committee that it can find no evidence for half those savings. Will the Minister make a commitment, on behalf of the Chancellor, that, in the forthcoming Budget, he will use no figures claiming Gershon savings unless they have been signed off as above board by the NAO first?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="60302-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman would also benefit from reading the National Audit Office report. It confirms that significant progress is being made, and says&#151;particularly in relation to the Department for Work and Pensions, which accounts for a significant portion of the head count&#151;that the published figures are &quot;robust&quot;. It deals with exactly the issue that the hon. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 383</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Gentleman has raised. We have not yet reached the end of the first year, but we have a transparent system. We have published the technical notes and the basis of measurement, and we have worked with the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission on the measurement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_o2">As I have said, in our view the report published last week confirms that our figures are robust; and where they are not robust, we are dealing with the measurement issues. We will continue to report, in a transparent fashion, to Parliament and the country on the progress that we are making on this important matter.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="60302-01_spnew17"><b> Mrs. Theresa Villiers  (Chipping Barnet)</b> 
 (Con): In 2004, the Chancellor promised a reduction of 70,600 in the number of civil service posts by 2008. Most people would understand that to mean that in 2008, 70,600 fewer people will be working for the civil service than when the Chancellor made that promise. Will that be the case, or will the Treasury permit Departments to include head count reduction in full towards their Gershon targets despite additional recruitment for new projects? That would mean, paradoxically, that we could end up with more people working for the civil service in 2008 rather than 70,000 fewer&#151;and I am not even taking into account the issue of civil servants being laid off and rehired as consultants. Have not the Government set the Gershon goalposts in such a way that they can claim savings without making real improvements to embed a culture of efficiency and value for money in our delivery of public services?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="60302-01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The hon. Lady has made the same error in comparing statistics that she made when we debated the issue on the &quot;Today&quot; programme. I say to her now, as I said to her then, that page 29 of the report deals with it in some detail, and explains why comparing different data is inappropriate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-01_para3">
<a name="stpa_o3">Let me deal directly with the question of the number of civil servants. The hon. Lady relies for her argument on the fact that during the period of measurement the magistrates courts were transferred from local government to central Government. With that decision came 12,000 people, whom the Office for National Statistics redesignated as civil servants. It is not a case of more people working in the magistrates courts; those people were redesignated. However, the National Audit Office report confirms the opposite of what the hon. Lady has argued&#151;that, in bald civil service number terms, there was a significant reduction over the period. We will meet the target as it was set out in the Gershon review, and we will maintain our approach to meeting that target.

 I am glad that my hon. Friend welcomes the fact that, in his constituency and throughout Greater Manchester, half a million people will benefit from the beginning of next month. It is true that some bus journeys from the Greater Manchester area will be free.

 The Government are spending around &#163;7 billion more on pensioners this year than we would be if we had restored the link to the rise in earnings. In a situation where almost one in five people are retiring on more than &#163;400 a week, it is surely right that we put in place help for all pensioners. Clearly, the basic state pension remains the cornerstone for that, but it is right that we put in more help for the pensioners who need it most.

 I thank my hon. Friend for that question and for the statistics that he has supplied the House. He is right about the progress that has been made, and he is right to urge the Government to do more. Since 1997, 2 million pensioners have been lifted out of poverty by the measures that we have put in place. When we combine the personal tax and benefit changes made since 1997, this year, the average pensioner household will be &#163;26 a week better off and the poorest 10 per cent. of pensioners will be &#163;42 a week better off than they would have been under the Conservative system.

 I accept my hon. Friend&#039;s point about the opening up of markets and trade protectionism in general. We will continue to press the EU and America to move further and faster in order to secure a world trade agreement based on the removal of the protectionist policies that have been pursued in the past. Within the EU, we will continue to press for the liberalisation of markets that my hon. Friend proposes, but I must point out that it is free trade countries and countries that are open to competition that are creating jobs. Countries closed to competition are, in the long run, not creating the jobs that they need.

 (Con): The Chancellor agrees with me that the big challenge that European countries face is competing in the new global economy. Presumably, he shares my disappointment that Britain&#039;s trade deficit with China widened by 20 per cent. last year. What is his explanation for that?

 We are trading more with China&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Gentleman will just listen. We are trading more with China. I have visited China twice this year and we have signed trade agreements with the Chinese in a range of areas, including financial services. Chinese companies are now registering on the London stock exchange and trade between China and Britain is improving. The hon.

<p><a name="st_o44"><a name="60302-02_spnew20"><b> Mr. Osborne: </b> 
 I asked the Chancellor about the trade   deficit. The truth is that he can change his ties, change his shirts and even change his teeth, but he actually needs to change his economic policies if Britain is to compete in future. So will he comment today on the decision by the internet book retailer Amazon to relocate its European service headquarters from England to Ireland? What is his explanation for that?

 Order. The Chancellor has had at least three strikes outside the sphere of the question. I must ask him to confine his answer to the question that has been asked.

 As you rightly say, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I was asked why a company should relocate to Ireland. The right hon. Member for Wokingham&#039;s answer was that companies were relocating to Ireland because the EU had heavily subsidised the Irish Republic and thus allowed it to reduce corporation tax. If the shadow Chancellor wishes to be consistent in his approach to economic policy, why does he not remind the House that he has spent months congratulating the Government on establishing economic credibility after improving the macro-economic management of the economy, and admitting that his own policies lack popularity?

 (Con): What recent assessment he has made of the effect on sustainability of the public finances of public sector pension liabilities. [55123]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o48"><a name="60302-03_spmin0"><b>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury  (Mr. Des Browne): </b> 
 Pension payments from unfunded public sector pension schemes were &#163;16 billion in 2002&#150;03, &#163;17 billion in 2003&#150;04, and &#163;18 billion in 2004&#150;05. As set out in the long-term public finance report published in the pre-Budget report, spending on unfunded pensions as a percentage of gross domestic product remains unchanged. Principally because of a change in the discount rate effects, the Government Actuary&#039;s Department estimates the total accrued liability of unfunded public service pension schemes at &#163;530 billion as of 31 March 2005, but the actual payments by Government as a percentage of GDP are the same as set out a year ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-03_para0">
<a name="stpa_o4">I shall place a technical note explaining that estimate in the Library of the House today, as the matters involved are quite complex.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o49"><a name="60302-03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Dunne: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that point, and I shall read the technical note with interest. However, the revision to the calculation of the discount rate has increased the public service pension liability by an astonishing amount, from &#163;24 billion annually to &#163;81 billion. At Warwick, did not the Government fail to address the ballooning crisis in funding public sector pensions, and is that not a further reminder that the Chancellor&#039;s self-styled reputation for prudent stewardship of the nation&#039;s finances is in tatters?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o50"><a name="60302-03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I do not wish to be pedantic, but the hon. Gentleman is relying on a figure of &#163;81 billion that he got off the front page of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, and it is clear that he has not performed a simple arithmetical calculation between the figure that I have given and the figure that was in the public domain previously. When he comes to read the technical note, that calculation will be very clear.

<a name="60302-03_para1">
<a name="stpa_o5">The hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) will know that the calculation is based on a set of assumptions, and that it is an aggregation of liabilities based on international accounting standards. However, the technical note makes it clear that none of the new information and assumptions used to make the new estimates of total liabilities has any material effect on the future cash payments from the schemes in the longer term, which are set out in the public finance report. The sustainability of the public finances is a function of what has to be paid, and does not depend on a calculation of aggregated liabilities in the long term.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o54"><a name="60302-03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises an important and live issue, for local government employees and for local government itself&#151;and consequently for council tax payers. However, the distinction between the substance of the question and the local government pension scheme is that the latter is a funded scheme. I am, of course, involved in discussions with my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and with other Ministers in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister about their negotiations and discussions in respect of the scheme, but it would be inappropriate for me to comment on matters that are the responsibility of other Ministers.

 (Con): According to the pre-Budget report, the annual cost of public sector pensions is set to rise by 0.7 per cent. of GDP over the next 30 years&#151;the equivalent of &#163;8 billion in today&#039;s prices. Is the Chief Secretary satisfied that the deal cut by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry at Warwick will make the cost of public sector pensions more sustainable, or does he agree with the Chancellor&#039;s remarks in November, when he said that there was still a lot more work to be done?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o56"><a name="60302-03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I have given additional figures today that may inform the hon. Gentleman&#039;s analysis, but the long-term financial report shows that the cost of public sector unfunded pensions over the next 50 years is sustainable. As for the settlement that was arrived at by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in negotiations with public sector unions for the long-term sustainability of these schemes, we achieved exactly the objectives that we set for savings, and the unions and the work force have agreed to absorb those savings.

 (Lab): May I urge my right hon. Friend to be resolute in resisting panic over the issue of public sector pension liabilities? A relatively small change in the discount rate can produce apparently very much larger figures. My right hon. Friend is not running a hedge fund; he is operating public sector finances. Will he bear it in mind that if he were panicked into taking drastic action on this topic, one effect would be a reduction in public sector borrowing issues, and the problems of private sector pension schemes would therefore be increased?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o58"><a name="60302-03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is precisely correct. On one famous occasion a non-governmental organisation&#151;clearly outside of government&#151;adopted a negative discount rate and suggested a terrifying figure for the cost of unfunded public sector pension schemes. Of course the selection of the discount rate has a significant effect on the calculation. That is why it is important to come back to what the funds cost year on year. The detailed figures that I gave to the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) in answer to the original question showed that they are sustainable and that it is important to look at the long-term projections 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that are published with the pre-Budget report and the Budget. This is sustainable provision; it is constantly reviewed and revised. We now accept international accounting standards for public accounts, so we adopt and apply the discount rates that those standards compel us to adopt.

In addition, the Office for National Statistics has recently announced new estimates for higher investment.

<p><a name="st_o61"><a name="60302-03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I have just given the hon. Gentleman the figures to show that productivity is higher in this cycle than in the last cycle. I have just given him figures to show that it is 2.6 per cent. on average as opposed to less than 2 per cent. If I may say so, the only years in which productivity has fallen have been Conservative years.

 Under the previous Government, productivity rose slowly and unemployment was high. Under this Government, since 1997, productivity has risen faster and, at the same time, employment has risen.

 Given that the Chancellor had to downgrade his growth forecasts for 2004 and 2005 and has now had to downgrade them for 2006 and 2007, is not the most effective way to have reliable forecasts to adopt the Conservative party&#039;s proposals for independent assessment of the fiscal rules&#151;the golden rule and the sustainable investments rule&#151;and independent statistics, so that balance sheets, borrowing and other contentious issues are measured transparently?

 The child and working tax credits are designed to make work pay and reduce poverty, and nearly 2 million individuals are benefiting. Research published today shows that tax credit take-up rates for families with children reached an unprecedented level in the first year of operation. Figures show take-up of about 80 per cent. overall and 90 per cent. for the poorest families, which compares with 57 per cent. in the first year of family credit. Additional research on how family incomes vary shows that the flexible nature of the working tax credit and child credit helps to smooth income, particularly for disadvantaged groups. As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, the 2005 pre-Budget report announced a series of reforms to be introduced over the next 18 months, which will give families more certainty about their tax credit award while maintaining the flexibility that is crucial.

That is a success. Take-up continues to grow, and it is about time that the Conservative party started to support the tax credit scheme, instead of constantly trying to knock it and undermine it.

Under the UK&#039;s internationally agreed and independently measured national accounts, off-balance-sheet debt is not included in measures of public net debt. The decision about whether any individual private finance initiative is on or off balance sheet is made in accordance with the UK&#039;s accounting standards.

 With respect to the hon. Gentleman, the answer lies in his question.

In both cases, the National Audit Office makes that decision independently. Rather than the Government making a decision in relation to one piece of debt and the National Audit Office making a decision in another case, we should leave things as they are. We should leave the decision with the independent body, which applies the same national standards and rules to one railway operation as it does to the other. That is precisely what we will do.

 As the House will know, in 1997 Britain had the fastest growing youth unemployment and long-term unemployment in Europe. The contribution of the new deal to helping young people return to work, and the return of others to work through the programme, has proved a huge success. The Government are committed to its continuation, unlike the Conservative party, which wants to abolish the new deal, presumably because it thinks that unemployment is a price worth paying.

 I do not in any way minimise the difficulties and challenges faced by those responsible for providing health care in Shropshire, but the hon.

When he refers to a health funding crisis, he must put it in this context: 432 out of 566 NHS organisations provide a service by balancing their books, and if three quarters of the national health service can do that, there is no reason why the rest cannot do the same. Only around 4 per cent. of NHS organisations account for 50 per cent. of the overspend, and it is perfectly reasonable for the Government to say in the light of the huge amount of extra money being put into the NHS that those organisations that are failing to balance their books should look hard at why that is the case.

 I have already emphasised the Government&#039;s commitment to postal services, particularly rural postal services. We all know that local post offices play a vital role in the community in many small towns and villages. The Government remain committed to that. That is why we introduced the Post Office account and why we continue to want the people who use that account to use postal services. Some 25 Post Office accounts are available to people, and they are simple and straightforward to use. The whole purpose of the various pilots that have been conducted recently is to encourage people to move away from the account to use other Post Office accounts that will give them greater benefits than are currently available to them, not least interest on their accounts.

 The Leader of the House will be aware that, in Scottish questions, a great deal of anxiety was expressed about the propriety of Scottish Members voting on English-only business. May we have a debate on that issue? The House needs to assert the principle of      accountability, which means that Members of Parliament are accountable to their constituents. If their constituents are not affected by the decisions that they take, there is no accountability, and that infringes on the basic principle of democracy.

 I am not sure that I agree with the right hon. and learned Gentleman. This is probably not the occasion on which to have a profound debate on the nature of our constitution, but the truth is that right hon. and hon.

I know the right hon. and learned Gentleman to be a strong supporter of the Union, and he has in his time been a member of the Conservative and Unionist party, so I am slightly surprised by the implication of his question, which would be to challenge that Union.

 I have seen the early-day motion. Indeed, I have also seen correspondence dealing with the matter. In the course of planning the parliamentary timetable from week to week and month to month, it is difficult to ensure that appropriate priority is given to all the subjects that are debated here. The difficulty that I face on behalf of the business managers is that if more time is given to one subject, less must necessarily be given to another. When the hon.

That will enable us to raise the concern of our constituents that 20 per cent. of all bank branches have closed in the past 10 years, and that the promise not to close the last branch in town is being systematically undermined by the stretching of that commitment if, for example, there is branch in another village four miles away.

<a name="60302-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_43">As I am sure Members will know, every year between 150,000 and 250,000 parental couples separate. One in four of the 12 million children in this country will experience the separation of their parents at some point during their childhood. For every one of those children that separation is a painful and difficult time, and represents the breakdown of their families. It is a difficult time for the parents as well, and we should offer them support; but I firmly believe that our focus should be on the needs of the children, who are often lost in the conflict between the adults.

 I welcome what my hon. Friend is saying, but does she accept that one of the huge costs of the separation of parents is often incurred by the children? That burden is increased when one of the separated parents is not allowed access. The Bill makes useful suggestions for strengthening the courts&#039; power to insist that access be granted when it can be granted safely. Would it be possible to arrange through the normal channels for us to have plenty of time on Report to discuss suggestions from Members on both sides of the House on how we might add to the powers of courts to ensure that the needs of children to see both their parents are observed?

 I am aware of my right hon. Friend&#039;s considerable expertise and commitment to ensuring that our arrangements to deal with those difficult issues for children are the best that we could possibly have. There is a range of potential provisions, only one of which consists of legislation. What we can do before parents go to court, and what we can do in relation to the nature of the decisions that courts make on access and contact, are equally important. However&#151;I am sure that this will be a subject of debate, as it was in the other place, as we go through the detail of the Bill&#151;we would not want any different legal model

<br>&nbsp;<br>to compromise the interests and welfare of the child, which are paramount. Having said that, it is our view&#151;this is enshrined in case law&#151;that for most children it will be in their best interests, subject to safety issues, to have continuing contact with both their parents. That is something that we want to facilitate. Indeed, when the Bill was debated in the other place, that was one thing on which both sides were agreed. Children need to have the love, close interest and involvement of both their parents wherever it is safe and in their best interests. We should make every effort to support families in achieving that.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_44">I will come to the provisions of the Bill in detail shortly. It is important to remember at the outset that the provisions deal only with the 10 per cent. of separating families who turn to the courts for help in resolving arrangements for contact with children. However, the Bill does not sit in isolation. Just as important is the action that we are taking to help parents to agree a way forward without the need for court intervention if they can.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_45">It will not surprise any hon. Member, all of whom have a great interest in this matter, to hear that parents who agree contact arrangements between themselves, without the courts being involved, tend to be much more satisfied with those arrangements. Therefore, where we can, we want to take steps to help more people to agree their own arrangements without going to court. We have announced a programme of work, including producing new parenting plans to help in working out those arrangements, access to specialist legal advice through a telephone helpline, which is working well, and stronger encouragement towards mediation to help parents to avoid the need for a court-based solution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_46">As we know, however much success we have with those arrangements, there will always be a minority of cases where people need to turn to the courts for help. Those will be the most difficult, most emotionally harrowing and most highly contested cases. They will be the cases that probably will not resolve themselves if left to continue and where the ongoing conflict could risk harm to the welfare of the child or children involved. Where the court is called upon, we must ensure that the intervention does not entrench the conflict any further, but offers a positive way forward for everyone, and most of all that the court proceedings and the solution remain uncompromisingly focused on the needs of the child or children.

 As my right hon. Friend knows, in the most difficult cases, the court will make orders for supervised contact, or contact at contact centres, yet there is a woeful lack of those. As this issue moves forward, particularly when she comes back to the detail, will she look at that matter? In Northamptonshire, for a variety of complicated reasons, there has been low take-up at the centre that serves that area. In my town of Northampton, all the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 419</b>

</p>





<p><a name="st_88"><a name="60302-12_spnew1"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 I agree. We need to think creatively about how we can extend provision both for unsupervised and supervised contact centres. The Government have already put considerable resources into that. Since 2000, some &#163;5.3 million has gone to the sector, and in the last spending review a further &#163;2.4 million was provided to develop 14 new centres for supervised contact in England. There will be a further sum totalling &#163;7.5 million for 2006&#150;08 to support that. The development of extended services in schools and children centres offer us enormously creative possibilities for contact to take place, probably non-supervised contact. I have already been to children centres that are being used for non-supervised contact and access. We need to ensure that we use those facilities to the full for the benefit of parents.
</p>





<p><a name="st_89"><a name="60302-12_spnew2"><b> Mr. Peter Bone  (Wellingborough) (Con):</b> 
 In my constituency, we have some contact centres that are run by the voluntary sector. They have some funding but are worried that the funding is drying up and will be moved away to Government-funded centres.
</p>





<p><a name="st_90"><a name="60302-12_spnew3"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 That is not the case. Much of the money that I mentioned is going to local level. Contact centres for supervised access that are run and managed by voluntary agencies have a great role to play. It is not the case that that money is simply for Government or local authority-run centres. By and large, they are run in partnership with voluntary agencies. We want that to continue because they have great expertise. Many parents find the concept of supervised contact undertaken by a voluntary agency more palatable than the concept of supervised contact at a centre run by a local authority or by the Government.
</p>





<p><a name="st_91"><a name="60302-12_spnew4"><b> Margaret Moran  (Luton, South) (Lab):</b> 
 Does my right hon.

Will she examine that matter to ensure that all contact centres have the same high-quality supervision and training for staff? My contact centre in Luton is run by the WRVS, and very good it is too, but I fear that some contact centres simply do not have the quality of staff and training that are desperately needed in such difficult circumstances.
</p>





<p><a name="st_92"><a name="60302-12_spnew5"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 I take my hon. Friend&#039;s point. The role that staff play in those situations, particularly for supervised contact, can be critical for the parents and children concerned. It is very important that they are as high quality as we can make them. I will certainly look at that matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_47">Where the court is involved, we have to ensure that whatever intervention we make does not entrench conflicts any further. The Bill will be critical in achieving that and in maintaining the focus on the child. It offers the court new powers to facilitate contact, and to enforce contact when that becomes necessary.

<a name="60302-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_48">Clause 1 offers the court the power to direct parties to participate in &quot;contact activities&quot;, ranging from parenting classes to domestic violence perpetrator programmes, and explicitly including the power to require attendance at an information session with a mediator to explore the benefits of mediation. We believe that those activities will help parents to begin to face up to the difficulties, and the conflict, behind their disagreement over contact arrangements.

 Clearly, the ability to refer to such groups is valuable and can help in the most difficult cases, but I am far from sure that the resources are currently available at most courts for such projects. How will the Department go about finding what is out there already and ensuring that the gaps are plugged, so that, for example, domestic violence perpetrator programmes will be available at literally every court if they are needed?

 My hon. and learned Friend raises an important point that we are considering actively. We are piloting various forms of activity to which we think that we can direct parents. We are trying to promote through local authorities the provision of parenting classes. We accept that the support parents need when they are separating is rather different from the support that they may need when they are not separating but trying to cope with the behaviour of their children. We are looking with local authorities at the availability of what is likely to be required and trying to ensure that, when courts wish those activities to take place, they will be available. That involves a variety of local agencies, including local authorities and the probation service.

<p><a name="st_95"><a name="60302-12_spnew8"><b> Mr. Stewart Jackson  (Peterborough) (Con):</b> 
 I listened very carefully to the right hon. Lady&#039;s opening remarks and the lesson to be learned from the lack of success&#151;I will not say failure&#151;of the family resolutions pilots is surely that without an element of compulsion, the desired objectives simply will not achieved. Such an approach will not work on a voluntary basis alone.
</p>





<p><a name="st_96"><a name="60302-12_spnew9"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman raises a fundamental point. The model and culture in this country has been based on the understanding that unless people come willingly to the table to participate in sensitive activities such as mediation, they almost certainly will not work. But he is right to draw attention to the fact that we want to encourage as many people as possible to avail themselves of the undoubted benefits that voluntary dispute resolution practices can bring to separating parents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_49">As the hon. Gentleman may know, we have published today the evaluations of the family resolutions pilot project to which he refers, and of the in-court conciliation project. Although the findings are, as he suggests, mixed, both projects have provided very important information on what parents value and find helpful, and on what works well and what does not. In both projects, certain approaches demonstrated good success rates in helping parents to reach consensus and to avoid further dispute in court. We all know how important that is to outcomes for children. So although 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 421</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the results are mixed, we will take the positive findings and try to build them into further development of voluntary dispute resolution. But forcing people down that road is a very serious step that is likely to be counterproductive. As I said earlier, we are making it possible for courts, through directed activity, to insist on a session with a mediator to explore the benefits of mediation, but it would be a step too far to force people to participate in mediation itself.

<p><a name="st_97"><a name="60302-12_spnew10"><b> Tim Loughton  (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con):</b> 
 Did I hear the Minister say that she is publishing today the findings of the family resolutions pilot and if so, would it not have been slightly more helpful to have had them ahead of this debate, particularly given that the project finished last September? I accept that the best form of mediation is that to which people come willingly; otherwise, it does not really work. But where one party fully embraces the mediation route, the other flatly refuses it and the case therefore goes to court, what is the penalty against the person who has decided not to participate, or the reward for the person who has gone along with the court&#039;s wishes?

<p>
<a name="60302-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_50">As I said, both pilot projects are important in helping us to understand what works best for parents in avoiding the need to go to court. Where a court order does prove necessary, clause 2 offers a new power to ask the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service to monitor that order and to make sure that it is followed. If it is not, the court will hear about it. As many Members know from the experience of their constituents, in some cases, after the long and difficult process of a court dispute, a contact order is made only for it to be ignored. We have all heard sad stories of non-resident parents being unable to spend any time with their children, despite such contact having been directed by a court order, which is often obtained only after considerable struggle. We also know of cases where a non-resident parent is not complying with a contact order by not providing the contact that their children may well greatly need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_51">Courts often find themselves with no realistic way to deal with this problem. The only sanction at their disposal is to hold the person breaching a contact order in contempt, leading to a fine or committal to prison, but they are understandably reluctant to do that because of the impact on the child concerned. The courts have told us that they need broader powers to address this problem realistically, and to respond to the circumstances of particular cases. In 2002, a committee chaired by Lord Justice Wall produced a report entitled &quot;Making Contact Work&quot;, which called for these powers. The Bill responds to the recommendations made in that report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_52">In addition to providing the ability to require participation in contact activities, clauses 4 and 5 provide new powers to respond to breaches of contact orders, in line with the recommendations in &quot;Making Contact Work&quot;.

<p><a name="st_106"><a name="60302-13_spnew5"><b> Annette Brooke: </b> 
 Will the Minister clarify the following point, which I may not have understood fully? On enforcement of a contact order and the imposing of a subsequent penalty, community programme-based punishments have a slight drawback, in that they might not be in the best interests of the child. Can such punishments be imposed under the terms of the Bill, and are they in fact permissible?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 423</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_107"><a name="60302-13_spnew6"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is to some extent confusing contact activities with the responses that a court can make to breaches of contact orders, such as requiring unpaid community work of some kind. Clause 1 deals with activities that can be directed, but which are intended specifically to facilitate compliance with a contact order prior to that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_53">Clauses 4 and 5 will give the courts access to enforcement orders, allowing them to direct those in breach of an order to undertake unpaid work. They will allow the courts to order compensation to be paid from one parent to another in circumstances where the breach of an order causes genuine financial loss. One example is the cost of a holiday that had been planned with the child concerned.
</p>





<p><a name="st_108"><a name="60302-13_spnew7"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 I have two questions for the Minister. First, how many breaches of contact orders have resulted in the penalty of contempt of court, which she says the courts are reluctant to use? Secondly, the Minister said that a financial penalty is proposed to replace contempt of court, but what will happen when a parent with custody who is on benefits and relies on maintenance payments from a former partner is not able to pay that penalty? Will the proposed penalty be in the best interests of children who rely on maintenance payments to meet their basic living costs?
</p>





<p><a name="st_109"><a name="60302-13_spnew8"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 I do not have the figures to answer the hon. Gentleman&#039;s first question, but I shall give them to him after this debate. On his second question, we are proposing not a financial penalty, but a means of redress for parents who can demonstrate that they have paid out money to have contact with a child in respect of a special arrangement that has subsequently been aborted by the non-compliance of the other parent. It is important to describe that as a financial loss rather than a financial penalty. We are not proposing what might be called a fine, but that a financial loss can be repaid. All the circumstances under which compensation orders are made will be taken into account by the court, and that will include the direct or indirect impact on the child. We believe that the provisions will give the court greater flexibility in dealing with those who fail to comply with contact orders&#151;a flexibility that the courts have told us that they genuinely and urgently need.
</p>





<p><a name="st_110"><a name="60302-13_spnew9"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for giving away again, but we need to tease out some detail, although I am sure that we will do so in Committee. It does not really matter whether we call this proposal a fine, a penalty or compensation. Let us say that a parent with custody has frustrated a contact order with the result, for example, that a holiday with the non-resident parent costing &#163;500 is aborted. The Minister has suggested that, in those circumstances, the court would direct the parent with custody to pay compensation of &#163;500. However, what will be the penalty if that parent relies on maintenance or is on benefit and cannot afford to pay? What is the next stage of the process?
</p>





<p><a name="st_111"><a name="60302-13_spnew10"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 The court will consider all the circumstances of each case. If a compensation order for a certain amount of money is made, the court will take account of the ability of the non-resident parent, in the case set out by the hon. Gentleman, to pay the money. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 424</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>The court will put the arrangements in the compensation order. If the money is subsequently paid, the court will reconsider the matter and decide what action to take. It will look at all the circumstances in the round, including whether the contact order has subsequently been complied with in full. The details of each case are for the court to decide.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_54">The provisions in this part of the Bill have been asked for by the courts. They want the flexibility that will allow them to act against those who breach contact orders, without having a disproportionate effect on the child. We all understand how important that is. When they make contact orders, the courts have a single guiding principle in mind&#151;that the welfare of the child is paramount. That principle is set out in section 1 of the Children Act 1989. It underpins all our policy and is the foundation of this Bill.
</p>





<p><a name="st_112"><a name="60302-13_spnew11"><b> Ms Keeble </b> 
: When assessments for contact orders are made or breaches of contact considered, will my right hon. Friend the Minister say&#151;either now or later&#151;what attention will be paid to domestic violence?

 My hon. Friend the Minister is very generous in giving way, although I think that she is getting bored, so I will not bother again after this intervention. In connection with enforcement, is it possible that people found to have denied an ordered contact without a reasonable excuse could be required to allow compensating contact? Such an approach might be suitable when the person involved is short of money, and would give the deprived parent an extra allotment of time with the child. That approach has some good points, although it contains the curious notion that one parent can be punished by giving the child to the other. Is that an idea that merits further reflection?
</p>

<p><a name="st_115"><a name="60302-14_spnew0"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 My hon. and learned Friend will know better than I that the courts already have the power to vary the amount of contact, so the option that she sets out is available to them in principle as things stand. However, the courts must decide what is in the best interests of the child, without using that child as a reward for one parent and a punishment for the other. The risk is that compensatory contact could be seen to be used in that way, and that is something that I am sure that we would all want to avoid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_55">When a court, with the principle of the paramountcy of the child in mind, makes an order for contact, that order should be followed for the sake of the child. The court should be able to act if it is not. Much of the debate on the Bill in the other place centred on whether any 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 425</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>change should be made to the paramountcy principle&#151;whether we should be more specific and say that the child&#039;s welfare is normally best served through contact with both parents, or whether we should specify that contact should never be ordered until the court has first satisfied itself that it is safe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_56">The Government believe that both of those positions are well intentioned. They stem from concern that the right outcome for children is not always achieved, and that the law should be more specific about what the best outcome is. However, were we to accept either position, we would irrevocably compromise the clear statement in the Children Act 1989&#151;that, in any case, the court must do whatever is best for the welfare of that individual child. It should not have to make an assumption, independently of the facts, about what is best for the child, and then be forced to row back if that assumption turns out to be wrong. The court should look at the circumstances of the case, think about the child, and make its decision.
</p>





<p><a name="st_116"><a name="60302-14_spnew1"><b> Mr. Stewart Jackson: </b> 
 I agree with most of what the Minister has said, but I have read the <i>Hansard</i> report of the debate in the other place with great care. Neither my noble Friend Baroness Morris of Bolton nor the Liberal Democrat Baroness Sharp of Guildford made any concession in respect of the paramountcy principle, so perhaps the Minister should revise her views on the matter.
</p>





<p><a name="st_117"><a name="60302-14_spnew2"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 The point of view that I set out certainly was expressed in the other place, and that may happen again when we discuss the Bill in Committee, although it is worth noting that the House of Lords as a whole did not vote to overturn the paramountcy principle and insert a presumption of contact.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_57">In respect of a court making a decision on the basis of the principle that the welfare of the child is paramount, it should have as full a range of options as possible to deal with the case in a way that best serves the child. That is what part 1 of the Bill offers. Of course, in making its response, the court must be fully informed about the circumstances of a case. As has been noted already, the question of domestic violence is often raised in disputes about contact, and it has been argued that courts are not always sufficiently aware of it when making their decisions. We take that very seriously, and a great deal of work has been done across Government to try to address the damage that domestic violence can do to everyone whom it affects&#151;including, in some instances, children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_58">There are some vital safeguards already in legislation, such as the requirement in the welfare checklist in the Children Act 1989 for the courts to have regard to any harm that the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering. However, we were persuaded in debate in the other place that something further was needed. What is now clause 7 of the Bill places a new and specific duty on CAFCASS to carry out a risk assessment and inform the court of the result whenever it is involved in private law Children Act 1989 proceedings and it has cause to suspect that the child concerned is at risk of harm, including harm as a result of witnessing harm to another.

 May I take the Minister back to clause 4? I am not clear in my own mind. Let us say that a parent with custody denies contact that has been ordered by a court, and an enforcement order is then imposed which the parent with custody fulfils. What happens if the parent with custody continues to deny contact? She may fulfil the unpaid community work requirement and continue to deny custody. What will happen then?
</p>





<p><a name="st_119"><a name="60302-14_spnew4"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 Those cases would come back to court and it would be up to the court to decide what further action needed to be taken. Clearly, it would not be right for those circumstances to persist&#151;for non-compliance with a contact order to have taken place, for an order to have been made to do community work, for the community work order to be complied with, but for non-compliance to continue on the contact. The court would have to decide what further action it wanted to take to ensure compliance with the contact order because that would be the primary objective in those circumstances. The community work option gives the courts another element of flexibility in their response, but the objective is to obtain compliance with the contact order.
</p>





<p><a name="st_120"><a name="60302-14_spnew5"><b> Ms Keeble: </b> 
 Having had a look at clause 7, may I ask whether those considerations would also apply to breaches of contact orders? People often say that they have breached a contact order because they are concerned about what they have seen happening to the child and they have difficulty in using the process. Will the clause help them?
</p>





<p><a name="st_121"><a name="60302-14_spnew6"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 I believe that it will, and for this reason specifically. I am aware that some women find it difficult to reveal at the start of proceedings that there has been harm to them through domestic violence. The gateway process now makes it more straightforward and prompts people to reveal that there has been domestic violence by means of a tick box. If they tick it they go straight to a CAFCASS member of staff. My hon. Friend should also bear in mind the option for CAFCASS to undertake a risk assessment not only if harm has been declared by a party to the proceedings, but if it suspects from its dealings with a family that there has been harm through domestic violence. CAFCASS can undertake that risk assessment at any point in the proceedings, including after enforcement order proceedings have started. There is no limit on when CAFCASS, if it has concerns, can undertake a risk assessment and make that and its judgment on the issue available to the court.
</p>





<p><a name="st_122"><a name="60302-14_spnew7"><b> Vera Baird: </b> 
 Of course, that would be the ordinary thing to do, but I do not think that the Bill requires that a risk assessment, initiated perhaps by CAFCASS, be reported to the court. Although it may sound an excessive requirement, is it not better to ensure that risk assessments, whether positive or negative, always find their way to the court by including in the Bill a duty for CAFCASS to report them?

 My hon. and learned Friend distinguishes two points. There is a requirement that the risk assessment, if undertaken by CAFCASS, be brought to the attention of the court. She questions whether the court takes sufficient account of that. The court is bound to take account of all the information that is germane to the proceedings. I point my hon. and learned Friend to the important judgment at the end of November by Lord Justice Wall on a case in the Court of Appeal. He felt that the judge had failed to follow the guidelines in relation to that particular issue. He took the rather strong step of attaching the guidelines to his judgment. In so doing, he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;I append them to this judgement in the hope that this court will not again be presented with a case such as the present, which not only ill-serves the parties and the child, but does the system discredit, and helps to devalue the valuable and conscientious work which courts up and down the country are undertaking in an attempt to tackle the scourge of domestic violence and to minimise the effect it has on parties and children.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_62">That sends a strong signal to judges and courts that they have to take the issue seriously and demonstrate that they do.

<a name="stpa_63">My hon. and learned Friend raises the capacity of CAFCASS. It is a developing issue. We have applied increased resources to CAFCASS and will do so next year.

This will often be in the most extreme of circumstances, as a last resort where the child has no chance of a happy or safe family life in their own country. Part 2 contains a number of important measures to help safeguard those children and to improve the procedures around inter-country adoption.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-14_para10">
<a name="stpa_65">First, and critically, clauses 9 to 12 provide a statutory framework for the suspension of inter-country adoptions from a specified country where there are concerns about the adoption process in that country. Those would be serious concerns, such as child trafficking, and a rigorous assessment of evidence would always be undertaken before taking the step of suspending adoptions. There is a real need for this power. In 2004, my predecessor as Minister for Children suspended adoptions from Cambodia, as hon. Members will know, in response to evidence of problems with the adoption process. She did this using prerogative powers, but I hope that Members on all sides of the House will recognise the importance of a clear statutory process for us to respond to such circumstances in future.

That proposal was the subject of some debate in another place, but it was acknowledged that this was a matter of prioritising. With limited funds available, it is vital that we target them at front-line services for vulnerable children in this country, and asking those who can afford it to meet a proportionately small charge is, in my view, reasonable in the context of wider priorities for public spending.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-14_para12">
<a name="stpa_67">Finally, clause 14 makes further important provisions around the process of inter-country adoption. It amends section 83 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 to make it harder to circumvent restrictions on bringing children into the UK. Section 83 currently states that where an external adoption order was effected less than six months before the child is brought into the UK, the adopter must meet certain conditions, such as being assessed and approved by an adoption agency. These restrictions are being circumvented, in some cases, by UK residents adopting the children and then leaving them in the care of a person in the other country until six months has passed so that they do not have to meet those conditions. The Bill will, rightly, make it harder for people to circumvent those restrictions by extending the time limit in such cases from six months to 12. Clause 14 also clarifies that certain children brought into the UK for adoption are not also privately fostered children. That will prevent an overlap of functions for local authorities.

 I have pressed my right hon. Friend often on the private fostering of children, in particular those brought from Africa. I had not picked up the exact implications of clause 14, so I hope that she can say more about its impact on protecting the welfare of such children.

 I know that the issue is of great concern to my hon. Friend, and I share that concern, but she is straying on to the important issue of the regulation of private foster carers, which was considered during the passage of the Children Act 2004, which strengthened the notification scheme. A sunset provision was included, so that in the event that the notification scheme does not produce the desired results, we can introduce a registration scheme. My hon. Friend knows that we are actively monitoring the impact of the notification scheme and will come to a decision on its effectiveness. It is an important issue.

<a name="stpa_68">Taken as a whole, the Bill offers an improvement in life chances to some of the most vulnerable children in our society and elsewhere. It carries on our commitment to improving outcomes for children based on their individual needs, founded on the principle that whatever the situation, and however severe the conflict between adults, we must put the children first. While there are some contentious issues about precisely how we approach that&#151;in such an emotional area, it would be strange if there were not &#151;I believe that that principle unites the House.

It is more than six months since it started its passage there on 29 June. Why has it taken so long, especially as the Bill has changed little since it was originally presented? It was preceded by the parental separation Green Paper in July 2004, the next steps progress report in January 2005, the draft Bill and the pre-legislative scrutiny committee, and there is some mystery about why it has taken so long to progress.

The cross-departmental responsibilities of the Minister for Children and Families are being tested in this case, because it is no secret that Departments have dissented on the early interventions project.

<a name="60302-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_73">It was worrying that, in response to some of the detailed questions that we tried to put to the Minister about how the breaking of contact orders and compensation may work, she kept saying that it was a matter for the courts to decide. That is true, but the introduction of the Bill is a recognition of the existence of a problem, and the courts need to have a much stronger steer on how to use some of the mechanisms that will be introduced to deal with that problem. I hope that in Committee she will not keep falling back on the mantra that it is up to the courts to decide. Of course the courts must decide in individual cases, but they need a strong steer on what the legislation is intended to achieve. That is why we need the detail on how compensatory contact might work, if that is to be one of the measures available.
</p>





<p><a name="st_129"><a name="60302-15_spnew5"><b> Vera Baird: </b> 
 I am anxious to probe what the hon. Gentleman means and what sort of strong steer he thinks should be given. Surely the judge will have powers under the Bill to apply appropriately in each case, given its individual complexities and his training, background and experience. What more guidance can the hon. Gentleman offer to the judiciary?
</p>





<p><a name="st_130"><a name="60302-15_spnew6"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 The hon. and learned Lady has already mentioned contempt of court, which is one penalty that can be applied at the moment, but the courts are reluctant to use it. The measures in the Bill include penalties for breaches of contact and we need to have clearly set out the expectations as to how those penalties will be escalated if breaches continue to occur. If the Minister says it is up to the courts, the position will remain confused and that is why we need to tease out more detail on that issue in Committee.
</p>





<p><a name="st_131"><a name="60302-15_spnew7"><b> Vera Baird: </b> 
 I hope that the hon. Gentleman finds this attempt to clarify the questions as helpful as I do. If my right hon. Friend the Minister produced the record, I suspect that, although we would find that few courts had actually sent parents with primary care to prison, there are probably more cases where they use that threat. Indeed, the district judges who tell people that if they do not comply they will have to bring their toothbrush with them when they next come to court show that the threat is used. Surely the point of the legislation is to remove that dilemma for the courts, because it is bad for a child if their primary carer is sent to prison. There is a raft of different measures, so in what sense is the Bill failing to deal with the problem?
</p>





<p><a name="st_132"><a name="60302-15_spnew8"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 I agree that the worst outcome for the parent, and especially for children, is for the parent to end up in prison, which is certainly not something we want. That is why it is essential that there is a scale of penalties with a realistic expectation of imposition. The hon. and learned Lady rightly says that few people, if any, go to prison, so if the threat of that penalty is never actually carried out, it is not much of a threat. I was trying to tease out whether the details of the scale of penalties that the Bill sets out, and which we want to be better set out, will be imposed by the courts if necessary. A threat can only be any good if it is realistic and credible, and somebody believes it will be carried out.

<p><a name="st_133"><a name="60302-15_spnew9"><b> Ms Keeble: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that some of us welcome the provision precisely because we have had to take up cases of constituents who have been utterly terrified by being told in court that they will be sent down for not letting a violent ex-partner have contact with their child? The courts are used to dealing with people who get into debt or who have financial liabilities, even though they are on benefits and can make repayments only at a low rate. It is perfectly possible for the courts to deal with such cases without their being set out in the Bill. The provisions are a welcome alternative to sending women down for refusing contact to violent ex-partners.
</p>





<p><a name="st_134"><a name="60302-15_spnew10"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 If there is a threat of violence to an ex-partner and his or her children, I entirely agree that a breach of contact may be justifiable and the Bill makes provision for that&#151;it is a matter on which the court must be satisfied. The Bill also includes clause 7 on risk assessments, which we welcome, and which will provide clearer evidence of the strength of the risk. However, unless the risk is proven&#151;unless the case is put&#151;the assumption should still be that a contact order granted by a court should be adhered to and it is up to the person who has breached the order to prove why he or she was justified in doing so. If not, and if the risk assessment does not show that there has been a threat of violence, the penalties should be invoked. I am not in any way trying to put at any more risk someone who is at threat from violence, or indeed, his or her children, but the person who uses that excuse with no vindication must realise that there are realistic penalties that will be enforced.

 I have no concerns about clause 7. That is the point that I have just made. I said that including provision for risk assessments gives greater security. People who have serious concerns about domestic violence can have them taken into account by the court so that a breach of contact would be justified. I think that the hon. Lady slightly misheard what I said. The risk assessment gives greater security, but if it showed that a person was not at risk, the penalties should be enforced if there was a breach of contact.

When we scrutinise the Bill in Committee, we shall maintain the resolute and principled stance taken on the subject of contact in particular by those doughty fighters in the Lords for the interests of children, my noble Friends Earl Howe and Baroness Morris of Bolton.

<p>
<a name="60302-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_75">The Bill addresses two major but unrelated issues in respect of contact orders in part 1 and adoptions with a foreign element in part 2, as the Minister said. Although we have some concerns about the fashioning of new procedures for overseas adoption, there is a fair degree of agreement in principle, so we shall concentrate our fire, and our time, on the woeful inadequacies of some of the contact provisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_76">Let us consider the problem. Up to 200,000 children a year experience the emotional distress of their parents&#039; separation or divorce. That experience is likely to befall 20 per cent. of children before they reach the age of 16&#151;the same experience affected me when I was 11. Members of Parliament are probably not good role models for parents trying to promote stable families. My noble Friend Baroness Morris said that if she was the subject of a CAFCASS report, she would be described thus:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;Works away from home, involving long and anti-social hours; appears more interested in everyone else&#039;s children than her own; and spends long, hot, summer week-ends indoors writing speeches.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i>29 June 2005; Vol. 673, c. 255.]</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_78">Although 90 per cent. of separations are resolved without resorting to dispute in the courts, the remaining 10 per cent. can end up in protracted, messy and acrimonious legal proceedings, as the Minister said. There is much work for CAFCASS to do in producing 28,000 or so contact orders and writing 33,000 court reports, and we have concerns about its resource capability to cope with that work load, while acknowledging the improvements that we are beginning to see under the new board, which, with Baroness Pitkeathley and the new chief executive Anthony Douglas, is doing a good job after a traumatic first few years due to the Government&#039;s poorly thought-through conception of CAFCASS in April 2001.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_79">From our surgeries, we are all aware of the pain of non-resident parents who are denied meaningful contact with their children and who often live in reduced circumstances that militate against proper relationships with the children. We see cases of multiple breaches of contact orders by the parent with custody, which require multiple and costly returns to court by the non-resident parent. There are horrendous cases of members of the extended family being shut out of the lives of children&#151;especially grandchildren. I stress the important role played by grandparents who feel so much pain when splits go wrong. Grandparents who have given family members great support, acting as chauffeurs, babysitters and bankers, suddenly find after a split that they are left completely out of the equation.

 The hon. Gentleman is right. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) held a debate on that very subject in Westminster Hall recently. Just this morning, I heard that a loving grandmother in my constituency, whom I know well, and who has not seen her grandchildren for the best part of 10 years, is in hospital due to the stress caused by that. It is unacceptable that extended family members are just as much victims&#151;even more so&#151;as the people directly involved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_80">The number of contact orders does not reflect the amount of contact that is given. We hear the complaint that the contact simply consists of passing on postcards or a Christmas or birthday card, and nothing happens face to face. I fear that the contact often takes place at rather soulless and anonymous contact centres, although I acknowledge that some of the voluntary organisations in particular do a very good job in that respect. I am pleased to hear the Minister mention the greater use of family centres and some of the other new measures that will provide a family-oriented environment, because such places can be depressing and certainly not conducive to allowing the absent parent to spend good-quality time with his or her children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_81">Too often, the parent with custody can use the children as pawns in an ongoing fight against an ex-partner by taking children away when a holiday has been booked, by denying ex-partners access to school reports or school photographs or by moving to the other end of the country, well away from where the ex-partner lives or can visit because of work commitments. None of that is helpful to children, and there are some extreme cases of people who serially frustrate contact orders and seem to get away with it, time and again&#151;hence my concern that any threat against the infringement of contact must be realistic and able to be brought into play.

 Will my hon.

</p>





<p><a name="st_142"><a name="60302-16_spnew7"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a very good point. We have heard a number of stories where members of extended families and close family friends could effectively step in, in loco parentis, and offer an opportunity, perhaps temporarily, for a stable family upbringing for those children, who are ignored from the equation. In many cases, that is down to the pressure on local authorities but, in too many cases, local authorities do not think that that should be first port of call, although they are obliged to do so. Time and again, when contact orders are frustrated, it causes stress and anguish for parents and an increase in mental illness problems. We are all aware that 40 per cent. of non-

</p>





<p><a name="st_143"><a name="60302-16_spnew8"><b> Ms Dari Taylor: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that not all contact is effective and nor does it produce a stable outcome? There are relationships in every family unit that cause serious problems&#151;a fact that becomes apparent in my surgery, time and again. Does he also accept that, in vexatious situations and when there has been domestic violence, unsupervised contact can often be very undermining to the development of a stable family unit? We can talk about contact and understand its value but we must also put in place controls if those children are to benefit from the stability of relationships.

<p><a name="st_144"><a name="60302-16_spnew9"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is right, and I will come in a minute, if I can, to the presumption that the child will benefit from maximising contact with both of his or her parents, as the Minister has said already. In some cases, that is not the norm, which is when special provisions need to be made. We want a presumption that that will be appropriate for most children, but there are certainly cases of domestic violence where contact with a non-resident parent can be counter-productive and where proper supervised contact may be needed&#151;it is a case of horses for courses&#151;but that is not necessary in the majority of cases.

In the 1970s, the fathers of young children spent less than a quarter of an hour a day involved in child-related activities. Recent surveys show that, on average, the fathers of under-fives now spend an hour and 20 minutes on child care activities during the week. Our society has changed greatly over the past 20 or 30 years, as has the relationship that female and male parents have with their children.

Pre-school children who spend more time playing with their dads are often more sociable when they enter nursery school. Children benefit equally, if not more, from their mothers, but I am making the point that both parents have an equal role to play and can have an equally beneficial effect on their children by maximising such contact where it is appropriate to do so.

Her colleagues spoke in favour of this principle and strongly indicated that they would back amendments on it. She and I went merrily through the Lobby together during the Report stage of the Bill that became the Children Act 2004 in support of the principle that we are putting forward again today.

 My hon. Friend is right. We should not automatically consider a non-resident parent in some way to be inferior to that same parent when he or she was part of a married couple or a couple together, or inferior to the parent with whom custody resides. It is being strongly suggested by the briefing that the NSPCC has insisted on putting out again, and in stronger terms, that in some way non-resident parents are a threat to the safety of their own children. That is disgraceful and insulting to many thousands of parents who are not able to live with their children.

 I will not tangle with the hon. Gentleman about what the NSPCC says. I can see that he has become riled by it. Underlying the courts&#039; position&#151;I hope that he accepts that historically this has always been the case&#151;there has always been a presumption that there will be joint contact, continuing contact, where that is at all possible. That is not something that CAFCASS or the Courts Service conjured up for the report. That has always been the principle for many years. Child charities worry that if the paramountcy principle is ousted so that the safety of the child stops being the first criterion and we introduce parental rights, too much emphasis is given to the need to guarantee what the hon. Gentleman calls the child&#039;s right to see the parent. There must, of course, be a two-way right. Too much precedence is given to that right and not enough is given to safety. Where domestic violence is raised, that consideration is undervalued.

 The hon. and learned Lady is misinterpreting what I have said. I have not talked about parental rights. I have been clear in saying where I am coming from on this issue. We are constantly told that there is a presumption of equal contact that pervades in the courts, but that does not appear to be working. Why, therefore, is the NSPCC not complaining about the status quo? What harm will we do by putting explicitly in the Bill&#151;something from which everybody starts&#151;that there is that presumption? It will then be possible for everyone to argue why that should not be so in individual cases.

 It is for the NSPCC to explain its interpretation of what it has put out in its briefing.

It is important to understand&#151;I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman does&#151;that a statutory presumption in law is something that the courts must follow in all but exceptional circumstances. Therefore, a statutory presumption starts to fetter the discretion of the courts and makes a fundamentally different model that would compromise in law the principle of paramountcy.

<a name="stpa_101">The system that we are talking about is best served if we can avoid reaching a certain stage by means of prevention. The best solution to acrimonious legal disputes is to prevent them coming to court in the first place. We favour concentrating more on preventive action, which keeps families together. We need to see much more work undertaken by properly resourced professionally trained social workers, who spend more time not fire fighting if something goes wrong, but more time on preventive action to keep families together in the first place rather than pulling them apart. For example, Kent has done some excellent work in that regard. That is one reason why the number of children in care in Kent has fallen dramatically.

<a name="stpa_102">We need also to achieve an agreed settlement earlier. As my noble.

We must also agree to some form of mediation. We will have further debates about the extent to which that mediation should be imposed on, or agreed with, the parties.

<a name="60302-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_103">The Government initiated the promising form of mediation in what was called the early interventions project in the autumn of 2003. It was a successful and imaginative project. The prototype was due to be up and running by 2004, with a national roll-out by 2005. The aim was to defuse parental battles and dramatically to reduce the number of court cases. The project was mysteriously abandoned and replaced with the ill-thought-through family resolutions pilot project, which has been mentioned, having been scuppered by the Department of Education and Skills. Perhaps the Minister can give us more detail on that, though that happened under her predecessor.

<a name="60302-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_104">The family resolutions project, which ran for one year from September 2004 to 2005, with three pilots in London, Birmingham and Brighton, cost more than &#163;300,000. Thousands of couples were expected to come through the process but only 47 couples started the process and only 23 of them finished it. We have already heard about that independent evaluation.

<p>
<a name="60302-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_105">As <i>The Guardian</i> put it, that project was a waste of time. That was a great shame because it replaced something that was rather more worth while. We need to set up an expectation that mediation will be used to try to get things sorted before they come to court. We think that it should be close to mandatory for parents to embark on mediation processes before they come to court, and that if they refuse to take up the offer, that should go on their record. Hence my intervention earlier about differentiating between a partner who is perfectly happy to go along with the mediation process and the other party who decides that they will not have anything to do with it, with the result that both parties are subjected to court proceedings. Surely that must count against somebody who had refused unreasonably the mediation process and count more favourably to the person who was prepared to go along with it.

However, there are question marks over the limited financial incentives for divorcing parents in opting for mediation. We are also concerned about the availability of people who are skilled in mediation within the Courts Service. There are many examples of where a more compelled mediation service has brought about dramatic results, particularly in Virginia where mediation has shown that after 12 years 30 per cent. of parents who had attended mediation were in weekly contact with their children as against only 7 per cent. who had been through litigation and had shunned mediation. This shows that mediation does work.

Defiance of contact orders should be monitored by the court system. We should not just rely on the non-resident parent crying foul before we initiate and pay for legal challenges. Serial frustrators are able to play the system, ultimately leading them to be in contempt of court, although the relevant powers are rarely used. Prison is not a practical option, and electronic tagging, I am glad to say, has been dropped. There are problems with the payment of compensation, and I would like the Government to consider the proposal on compensatory contact time, which we support and which was mentioned by the hon. and learned Member for Redcar. Whatever measures are put in place should be on a sliding scale so that the offender has many opportunities to reform their behaviour and comply with the contact orders, subject to checks and balances if they are scared to do so because of domestic violence and other threats.

I share concerns about cases of child trafficking, particularly, it was claimed, after the tsunami. There were claims of such cases in Cambodia, which is why a decision was made on that country. We should clamp down rigorously on anything that constitutes the trafficking of children. Procedures were tightened in the Adoption and Children Act 2001, and we supported those measures. I am concerned, however, about the imbalance in adoption numbers. In the past 10 years, about 3,000 children have been adopted overseas, of whom 1,441&#151;almost half&#151;came from China. Many of those children, I suspect, were baby girls. Should we concentrate so much on a country with a questionable social stance on baby girls? The next largest contributor was India, where 235 children were adopted; followed by Guatemala, where 205 children were adopted; then Russia, where 177 children were adopted, and Thailand, where 171 children were adopted. I am in favour of inter-country adoption where appropriate, but I question the imbalance in the countries from where children have been adopted in recent years.

<p>
<a name="60302-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_114">Another problem arises from the fact that, unlike many other western countries, we lack an inter-country adoption agency. How much evidence of trafficking will be required to trigger the suspension of a country from inter-country adoption arrangements? Why are the rules not working if we are clamping down properly on child trafficking? We need to act in the best interests of the child, and I certainly welcome the provisions that allow for special exceptions in individual cases. We are concerned, however, about the scale of charges for work on inter-country adoption. Such a proposal was not included in the draft Bill, and inter-country adoption is already an expensive and bureaucratic business. The British Association for Adoption and Fostering has expressed concern about the Government charging for a service:
</p>

<p><a name="st_175"><a name="60302-20_spnew0"><b> Margaret Moran  (Luton, South) (Lab):</b> 
 I welcome the Minister&#039;s strong support for the principle of paramountcy, particularly in the face of comments by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton). Many of us believe that his proposal would undermine that fundamental principle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_117">I am afraid, however, that the Bill could go further to ensure that the principle of the safety of the child is enhanced. This feels a little like groundhog day, because many hon. Members participating in our debate took part in similar discussions in the Joint Committee that considered the draft Adoption and Children Bill as well as the subsequent Bill Committee. We were concerned that existing legislation had not done enough to safeguard children at risk in contact situations, particularly if there was a risk of domestic violence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_118">I was pleased that the Government accepted our arguments about the risks to children in contact cases involving violence, and that my amendment was accepted, which extended the definition of harm to the child to include impairment due to seeing or hearing ill treatment of another. For the first time we enshrined in law and recognised the damage to the child caused by witnessing domestic violence and the fact that that should form part of the court&#039;s consideration. As the Minister noted, further measures have been introduced to improve family court practice with regard to domestic violence, most recently in January this year, when new court application forms were introduced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_119">Even so, at that time many of us said that the measure would not be sufficient to remove the risk to children, and so it has proved. None of the measures so far introduced or in the Bill require courts to ensure that contact is safe. To date there is no evidence to suggest that court practice has been improved. That is asserted not just by me, but by all the leading children&#039;s charities, including the NSPCC, Barnado&#039;s, NCH Action for Children, Women&#039;s Aid, the Greater London domestic violence project, Respect, Men&#039;s Advice Line and Enquiry Service and others&#151;in other words, all the experts on the subject.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_120">Despite the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham decrying the report of Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate of court administration, we cannot ignore the evidence from its study showing that in the work of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 445</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>CAFCASS in this regard, there is such a strong presumption of contact with both parents that concerns about safety and the risk to the child are overridden, thereby putting children in severe danger of violence and abuse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_121">Notwithstanding the legislation and recent Government initiatives, there is still grave concern that children&#039;s needs are minimised or ignored, and that many parents and children remain unsafe during contact arrangements as a result of contact orders being awarded inappropriately. If, as we all profess, the safety and welfare of the child should be the key principle throughout the legislation, we need to amend the Bill further in the interests of the safety of the child. It is important that all the proceedings covered by the Bill have the paramountcy principle at their heart.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_122">I welcome the amendments made in the other place in relation to the introduction of clause 7. That is a significant step forward, but the court is still not required to act on the risk assessment by CAFCASS. I recognise the extensive work done by the Government to tackle domestic violence, but in the interests of children&#039;s safety the Bill should incorporate a requirement that the court act upon the risk assessment required under clause 7. It is clear that in the criminal justice system the dangers of separation where there has been a history of domestic violence are recognised, but the same understanding is not evident in many parts of the family justice system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_123">Much of the debate in the other place and to some extent in the Chamber today has been based on anecdote. We need a great deal more research on the subject of contact and the reasons why contact is not taking place in cases where an enforcement order has been issued. I hope that the Department will take that on board.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_124">Let us deal with some facts. The victims of domestic violence face greatest risk post-separation. Research shows that children ordered by courts to have contact with a violent parent are likely to be abused and in some cases killed. The Green Paper on parental separation recognises that of the 10 per cent. of contact cases that get to court, in at least 35 per cent. of them there are concerns about the safety of the child. CAFCASS officers state that in about 66 per cent. of the caseload domestic violence is a significant factor.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_125">Despite that, judicial statistics indicate that less than 1 per cent. of applications for contact orders are refused. It is clear that parents and children are being exposed to unsafe conditions by court orders. Research by Trinder in 2005 shows that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;In many of these families there had been violence in the home. Quite commonly, there were child protection concerns. The disputes presented to the court did not reflect straightforward arguments about &#039;contact&#039;; they reflected a range of issues, including commitment to the child, reliability, parenting quality, the child&#039;s reaction to contact, and perceived attempts to bully or control. In short these families experienced problems on a different scale from those experienced by the majority of separating parents, including multiple risk factors associated with poor outcomes for children.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_126">In other words, the family courts are dealing with the most difficult cases where children are likely to be at risk.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 446</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_127">That is reinforced by a study of 73 private law family cases, which found that one year after contact proceedings ended, the children were still experiencing similar levels of emotional and behavioural disturbance as children who had been the subject of child protection proceedings. That was linked to distress among the parents and high levels of intimidation and domestic violence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_128">Rather than a blanket assumption that contact will always be beneficial, the findings emphasise the importance of assessing risk and considering what is best for each child. That is supposed to happen because the welfare of the child is paramount in the Children Act 1989, so why are children still at risk after all this time? First, there is insufficient liaison between the criminal justice system and the family justice system. Following an investigation into the murder of Georgina McCarthy, whose violent ex-husband used contact proceedings to obtain information as to her whereabouts, the Advisory Board on Family Law stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;The view of the Home Office, with which we agree, is that there needs to be much greater liaison and co-operation between the criminal justice system and the family justice system over issues of domestic violence at all court levels&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para12">
<a name="stpa_129">When Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss was asked by the Select Committee why schedule 1 offenders were still being granted contact with their children, her response was that judges do not always know when they are dealing with a parent who has been convicted of an offence against a child. That cannot be satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para13">
<a name="stpa_130">Clearly, the family justice system does not have good liaison with the criminal justice system, yet we hear that the judiciary would like greater powers to enforce contact orders, even though they might unknowingly be granting contact in high risk cases. How can we legislate to give judges more powers to enforce contact, when the Bill does not contain a clause requiring pre-court checks in all cases? Such checks are needed because domestic violence tends to remain hidden. I understand that two cases in which children were killed during contact visits involved consent orders. The parents&#039; solicitors agreed contact arrangements which were then rubber-stamped by the court, with no consideration of the possible risk.
</p>





<p><a name="st_176"><a name="60302-20_spnew1"><b> Mr. Stewart Jackson: </b> 
 Does the hon. Lady agree that some children&#039;s charities have already criticised the Bill because the paramountcy principle is not explicitly at its centre, and less so than the 1989 Act?
</p>





<p><a name="st_177"><a name="60302-20_spnew2"><b> Margaret Moran: </b> 
 I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman. The representations that I have received state that the Bill includes the paramountcy principle. There are concerns that the paramountcy principle is being undermined by existing case law and practice within the family courts, and we therefore need to reinforce clause 7 to ensure not only that risk assessments are conducted, but that the courts are required to act upon such risk assessments when they make decisions in difficult cases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para14">
<a name="stpa_131">Most children&#039;s charities argue for a further strengthening of the Bill, because they know that the paramountcy principle has already been undermined by

<br>&nbsp;<br>case law precedents. For example, in re O in 1995, which concerned the imposition of conditions for contact, it was stated that contact is
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">&quot;almost always in the interest of the child&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para15">
<a name="stpa_132">It was hoped that court practice on child contact and domestic violence would improve after the judgment in re L, V, M & H in 2000, which stated that the courts should have a heightened awareness of the effects of domestic violence on children and that they should make findings of fact and minimise risk. That judgment also upheld the ruling that contact is almost always in the best interests of the child.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para16">
<a name="stpa_133">Both case law and the inspectorate of court administration report on the practice of CAFCASS indicate that there is a strong presumption of contact despite the existence of the paramountcy principle, which is supposed to be the court&#039;s priority. The inspectorate of court administration report on CAFCASS&#039;s activities in such cases states that

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para19">
<a name="stpa_136">The inspectorate of court administration report identifies the strong presumption of contact as the fundamental reason for the failure to protect children. CAFCASS officers admit that it is difficult for them to challenge the strong presumption of contact, even when there are concerns about the continuing impact of abuse on a child. Although the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham does not regard the report as significant, many hon. Members do, and it should make us think carefully about what the Bill does to facilitate and enforce contact.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para20">
<a name="stpa_137">Are the safeguards adequate to ensure that contact is safe before contact orders are enforced? I shall pray in aid the Prime Minister&#039;s reply to my recent parliamentary question:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;We of course are concerned by the finding of the Inspectorate of Court Administration report that there is such a strong presumption by the courts that there must be contact with both parents that concerns about violence and children&#039;s safety are overridden. We remain utterly committed to the principle that the welfare of the child should be paramount in the consideration of the courts. We recognise that more needs to be done to address domestic violence concerns&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 2 November 2005; Vol. 438, c. 828.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para21">
<a name="stpa_138">As I have said, the amendment by the other place is extremely welcome, but it does not require the court to take that advice into consideration, and the Bill should state that that is a requirement. Furthermore, we must examine pre-contact risk assessment, which must be considered throughout all proceedings, including enforcement proceedings. When enforcement takes place, we must ensure that there is a requirement for a further risk assessment should it be necessary to safeguard the care and welfare of the child. We know that the most dangerous points for children and their parents in domestic violence cases are the points of separation and of contact. In the interests of children, it is therefore vital that we not only say that a risk assessment may be taken into account, but require it to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 448</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>be done before enforcement, because the danger is that domestic violence has taken place after the parents first had contact with the courts. We owe children nothing less than that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-20_para22">
<a name="stpa_139">The Bill requires a further provision on the voice of children. The Adoption and Children Act 2002 includes a requirement that children&#039;s views should be taken into account, but as I understand it, that provision has not been enforced. We should include a provision in this Bill to enforce section 122 of the 2002 Act, which introduced separate representation for children in family proceedings.

<p><a name="st_178"><a name="60302-21_spnew0"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 I have some sympathy with the idea of taking children&#039;s views into account and have cited the example of Australia, where representations by children are being beefed up. However, putting a young, vulnerable child in a court scenario will create problems in practice, and it may be better to conduct such matters from the home of the parent who has custody. Does the hon. Lady have practical solutions on how best to take into account the views of a child without intimidating them, which may prevent them from providing a balanced view?
</p>





<p><a name="st_179"><a name="60302-21_spnew1"><b> Margaret Moran: </b> 
 Those concerns were extensively debated in the proceedings on the 2002 Act. Children&#039;s charities have introduced many proposals on how we can ensure that children&#039;s voices are safeguarded, that undue pressure is not applied and that the child&#039;s voice, rather than that of their parents, is considered. I think that we need to seek the advice of children&#039;s charities.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that working out how children&#039;s voices can be heard in court is an urgent issue? These days, it is easy for child abuse to take place in a criminal context, but it is impossible to bring action because of the tender years of the child, which means that people of tender years are not protected. It is critical that we turn our minds to the whole issue of bringing children&#039;s evidence into court.

 I am making a habit of agreeing with the sensible comments made by the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird).

<a name="stpa_140">Opposition Members and those in the other place have been extremely exercised by the enforcement of contact orders. I would hate for anyone to misunderstand me on this. I agree that in the best of all possible worlds, it is always best for children to have contact with both parents, but we are dealing not with the best of all possible worlds but with cases where the evidence suggests that there are severe risks to the child. We must therefore build into the legislation every precaution to ensure that contact is safe for those children. We are not dealing with the generality of contact orders. Equally, I agree that vexatious parents who deny contact for their own reasons should have the proverbial book thrown at them. Again, however, we must be absolutely certain that those children are safe before contact is enforced. As things stand, the Bill has no such requirement. That is urgently needed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_141">We need pre-court checks at the beginning of all proceedings to assess whether there may be safety concerns and a more comprehensive definition of risk assessment in legislation or in regulations. Courts must have regard to any risk assessment and order contact only if it is safe to do so. I fully support perpetrator programmes, provided that they are legitimate programmes run by organisations such as Respect and MALE, which have a long history of understanding perpetrator practice, not short courses that purport to resolve domestic violence and treat perpetrators in one day. We have to be careful about what is meant by proper perpetrator programmes, and we must ensure that the voice of the child is heard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_142">We do not want to experience further groundhog days as parliamentarians, but this is not only an issue for us but one that has serious implications for the lives of our children. Twenty-nine children have been killed as a result of contact arrangements in England and Wales. Serious case reviews indicate that with regard to five of 13 families involved, contact was ordered by the court, but no court professionals have been held to account for those homicides. Children have paid with their lives for the presumption that exists, and will continue to exist unless we amend the Bill, that contact is almost always in the best interests of the child&#151;the presumption that the family justice system abides by and holds so dear. It is time that that is balanced by a legal requirement that the court must have due regard to risk assessments and be satisfied that that contact will be safe for our children. Nothing less will do.

Its recommendations covered several issues that we are debating today. However, it was not until July 2004 that the Government published their Green Paper on parental separation, which acknowledged that the way in which the courts intervene in disputed contact cases does not work well. The results of the consultation were published in &quot;Next Steps&quot; in January 2005. We then had pre-legislative scrutiny. That is an excellent process, on which the Government are to be commended. There should be much more of it.

The evidence that I have seen suggests that we tend to get different answers, depending on whether we ask the resident parent or the non-resident parent. Obviously, perceptions will differ, but that makes it all the more important to set up the research projects with great care. It is welcome that the Government are setting up a further research project on what happens between a case arriving in court and a final contact order being made. However, that research could well take 18 months, and we shall have completed our work on the Bill long before that. Research has also

Given that presumption, I should like to address four issues: safety, mediation, contact and enforcement. If I have time, I shall also mention resources and transparency. I concur with what has already been said about the paramountcy principle being included in all proceedings referred to in the Bill. In particular, it should be added to clauses 4 and 5.

<a name="stpa_160">The Government have made an important contribution to tackling domestic violence, but can we ever do enough in that regard? In relation to contact and the safety of children, there is frequently a history of violence behind the cases that come to court. A statistic that is often cited is that in 2003, 16,000 cases involving domestic violence came before the family courts, but contact orders were refused in only 601 of them. It is difficult to say whether domestic violence is under-recorded. Many groups feel strongly that it is, and I certainly have a distinct feeling that that is the case. However, others will argue that it is over-recorded.

<a name="stpa_163">We have long felt strongly that any contact activity should be subject to careful and separate risk assessment to minimise possible risk, especially to children but also to others involved, particularly women. The Joint Committee responsible for the scrutiny recommended that before making contact or enforcement orders, courts should be explicitly required to consider the safety implications for both child and parent. I am glad that the other place agreed to introduce risk assessments. I look forward to scrutinising the new clause in Committee because it concerns a vital issue. I hope that it can be strengthened.

<a name="stpa_164">Why are reports of domestic violence increasing? Are we becoming a more violent society? Have the gateway forms encouraged people to come forward and say something, or are people using domestic violence as part of the unfortunate game, as has been suggested? It is encouraging in many ways that people are speaking out more and acknowledging the issue of domestic violence, but when there is a dispute between two parents on whether domestic violence has occurred, a mandatory risk assessment will be helpful. Both sides will have an opportunity to present their points, and the playing field will become more level.

Mediation should be used as an opportunity to strengthen relationships and to ensure that the outcome is the best for the child and does not merely serve the parents&#039; interests. It might be good for the parent to see the child, but if it involves hundreds of miles of travel for the child, that must be borne in mind. Putting the child first is all-important.

CAFCASS frequently intervenes too late, long after parents&#039; attitudes to each other have hardened, or long after one parent has created a new household excluding his or her former partner. Indeed, many attitudes have hardened long before the first court application&#151;hence the need for even earlier intervention where possible. Arguments about the fine detail of contact arrangements occupy huge amounts of scarce professional time, often unproductively. Once a court application is made, there is a clear risk of an adversarial model of law being started. The consultation document illustrates why we must put such emphasis on early intervention. However, we must also make information easily accessible. The Minister mentioned the telephone helpline. I understand that booklets are available, but I wonder whether they are necessarily the best format for those who need to access information.

Partly because of their lack of education, they often find it difficult to communicate not only with each other, but with those who try to help them.

It is a question of listening. In its written evidence to the Select Committee, Resolution&#151;formerly the Solicitors Family Law Association&#151;suggested that there should be a first presumption and then a second: the first relating to the child, and a second, lower-order presumption relating to the right to see both parents.

 That is my point.

In such cases, the outcome is almost a self-fulfilling prophecy. What can we do? Is it a question only of making the court process more efficient, or can we put in place some mechanism to deal with the problem, where there is no risk of harm?

It would be interesting to have some evidence in that regard, but hearsay suggests that that body&#039;s response is patchy across the country. I support the NSPCC&#039;s contention that the Bill fails to make any provision in respect of the mechanism by which the courts may ascertain the child&#039;s wishes and feelings, or ensure that separate representation for the child is available when that child might be at risk and his or her interests are in conflict with those of the parents.

It is important to consider different penalties, and my earlier intervention was aimed simply at establishing whether a range of penalties existed. The community punishment is obviously preferable to sending a parent to prison, which is a last resort, but the way that it is operated by the probation service means that some parents will find it difficult to make sure that the child&#039;s interests are not affected. For example, a parent who is sent on a gardening scheme might have to wear a very visible jacket, and her child might think, &quot;That&#039;s my mother doing that.&quot;

That would add to the range of available penalties, although all matters to do with contact activities, community service and so on obviously require adequate resourcing. We know that delays have been caused by CAFCASS, but in &quot;Every Day Matters&quot; it seems almost to be putting on a brave face.

We all know that inter-country adoption happens for different reasons. Frequently, people adopt children from within their extended family or friendship ties. More often than not, such adoptions are nothing like that. There are thousands of children waiting for adoption in this country, but they are older children and they have a number of problems. People choose to go abroad to adopt babies. The proposed legislation will cover countries, I presume, such as the USA.

<a name="stpa_193">Each child and their family circumstances are different, and it is not therefore appropriate to approach the welfare of the child from definitions of parental rights or notions or presumptions of equal parenting. However, it is right to start from the basis that children benefit from having a meaningful relationship with both parents. When their relationship fails, it is the responsibility of parents to come to arrangements about contact that are in the interests of the child. Of course, in the overwhelming majority of cases they do. Nine out of 10 separating couples agree informal contact. Of the 10 per cent. who have a formal arrangement, 90 per cent. work successfully. It is that small and difficult minority who cannot agree and who ask the courts to resolve their disputes that the Bill attempts to address. But as the Joint Committee report pointed out, in the small minority of cases in which a parent has applied to court, the problems of those families may be complex and not easily resolved through any enforcement measure.

<a name="stpa_194">In her excellent speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South (Margaret Moran) referred to the research done by the university of East Anglia, which has provided an insight into those problems. The parents involved were often young, on low incomes and with very young children. The parents&#039; ability to communicate with each other was limited and the relationships were characterised by a lack of trust, empathy or flexibility, often with high levels of anger. The disputes presented to the courts did not reflect straightforward arguments about contact, but a range of issues and the courts were typically presented with competing his-and-her accounts. Given that, many of these families need support and a facilitative approach to problem solving sustained over a period of time. I welcome the provisions in the Bill that will enable that to happen, including the ability of the court to make contact activity directions. Although it is not clear what those might be exactly, there are several activities that could relate to the promotion of contact, such as attending advice or guidance sessions, including those that give information about the value of meditation&#151;I am sorry, I mean mediation, although meditation might also be useful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-23_para18">
<a name="stpa_195">It would make sense to look at basing those contact activities in the new children&#039;s centres. The Sure Start project in my constituency already gives advice and information to parents to increase their understanding of children&#039;s behaviour and their skills in managing that behaviour. Attendance at such a session might help parents in conflict separate out their needs from those of their children and help to resolve disputes between parents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-23_para19">
<a name="stpa_196">I also welcome the expansion of the role of CAFCASS in facilitating and monitoring contact in that supportive approach, but bearing in mind the complexity of the difficulties of some parents, I am pleased that the Government have responded positively to the Joint Committee&#039;s recommendations on expanding family assistance orders, which are underused. With the roll-out of children&#039;s centres and

<br>&nbsp;<br>the establishment of new local children&#039;s centres, there will be an opportunity to use all available resources to provide families with help and support not only to resolve contact disputes but to enable better outcomes for children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-23_para20">
<a name="stpa_197">We must be clear about the limitations of contact activity directions in dealing with the more complex underlying problems where violence and the fear of violence has been a factor in the separation and continues to be an issue in contact. I very much agree with women&#039;s organisations that say that abusive behaviour in a violent relationship cannot be dealt with by parenting classes and that the primary responsibility must be to ensure the safety of the child in any contact arrangements. However, even when a court has decided that contact is in the child&#039;s interests, there will be situations where a parent persistently undermines the decision and refuses to co-operate for reasons that have little to do with the child&#039;s welfare, so I welcome the new enforcement powers, including the court&#039;s being able to direct a parent to do unpaid work and make financial recompense. Courts are reluctant to send a parent with care to jail and those new powers, together with a more facilitative and supportive approach, will mean, I hope, that that does not have to happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-23_para21">
<a name="stpa_198">I am sorry that the Government did not agree to the time and placement requirement recommended by the Joint Committee as a form of bridging order between facilitative contact activities and enforcement orders. It would have enabled the court to direct a parent to be at a designated place for a designated time. The Joint Committee saw great advantages in such orders, as the court could direct a parent to stay in their house while the non-resident parent had contact with the child in another place, thus preventing that parent from undermining the contact arrangement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-23_para22">
<a name="stpa_199">Finally, I turn to the provisions on restricting inter-country adoption. I welcome the proposals to set up a list of restricted countries that the Secretary of State deems have bad practices relating to the adoption of children, such as not having proper systems to verify that children are orphans or not attempting to reunite abandoned or lost children with their families. The Government will of course need to ensure that they have good information about what is going on in other countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-23_para23">
<a name="stpa_200">As the Minister will be aware, one of the Joint Committee&#039;s recommendations was that the Government take steps to establish an inter-country adoption agency, which we believed would enhance good practice and inform the Government about unsatisfactory practices in countries where children are available for adoption. It would also inform the Government when a country should be placed on the restricted list. As has already been said, there are about 300 applications each year to adopt children from a number of countries, with a few countries receiving the bulk of the applications. Home study reports are prepared by almost as many individual local authority or voluntary organisations as there are countries, so the channels of communication to the DFES from so many agencies cannot be as good as they would be with a small number of specialist agencies, which could network with similar agencies in other countries. The overseas adoption helpline, in its evidence to the Joint Committee, made a good case for pump-priming money to be made available to facilitate the setting up of specialist agencies that would 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 461</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>perform a linking or mediation function with the state of origin, and which exist in a majority of countries worldwide.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-23_para24">
<a name="stpa_201">The overseas adoption helpline argued that the establishment of such agencies would result in a more child-protective system for arrangements for adoption by UK applicants, as the agencies would be accredited by, and accountable to, the proper authorities in the country of origin as well as the relevant central authority in the UK. A network of such agencies would provide a mechanism to monitor adoption practices in situ in those states.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-23_para25">
<a name="stpa_202">The Government did not accept that recommendation, as they thought it unnecessary. They also pointed to the cost. However, 300 applications a year with a charge to applicants of &#163;5,000 for a home study report indicates that there is already a substantial revenue stream, and the DFES plans to recover some of the administration costs at the rate of a further &#163;800 to &#163;1,000 per head.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-23_para26">
<a name="stpa_203">In other countries, the costs of inter-country adoption applications, like domestic applications, are borne by the state as it is seen as a service to the child, not to the adopter. We do not take that view in this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-23_para27">
<a name="stpa_204">I would argue, however, that some pump-priming money to set up one or two specialist agencies would be a recognition that, with such complex issues, a degree of specialisation would benefit both the child and the Government. It would also be a good investment for the Government, as it would help to achieve the objectives of the highest practices in inter-country adoption in both this country and the country of origin. I realise that that is outside the Bill&#039;s scope, but I hope that Ministers will look at the issue again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-23_para28">
<a name="stpa_205">This is a good Bill that will legislate on a difficult issue, and I believe that the Government have achieved a good balance of facilitative and enforcement measures to achieve the objective of ensuring that, as far as possible, separated parents fulfil their responsibilities to their children.

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to participate in this vital debate, which has been marked by good sense, clarity and shared principles, as exemplified by the speech of the hon. Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey), who clearly knows what she is talking about. For the record, I will confine my remarks to part 1, concentrating on contact orders and the operation of family courts. Other hon. Members may wish to debate the more thorny subject of inter-country adoptions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_206">I believe that there is a consensus across the House for us to achieve an outcome that is not only practical and pragmatic, but fair and compassionate, with the paramount consideration being the welfare of children, both in theory and practice in statute. I am pleased to say that there is a political will on both sides of the House to put aside party differences and focus on getting the legislation right. We are, of course, dealing not with dry, arcane academic case law, but with people&#039;s lives and the future of our children, whose lives may be fractured or broken by the raw emotion and hurt engendered by the disintegration of their families and

<a name="60302-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_208">Two thirds of those children are under 10 years of age. As my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) mentioned, 40 per cent. of children lose contact with the non-resident parents, often as the result of bitter and protracted disputes following separation and divorce.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_209">We agree on much in the Bill. In particular, I welcome the Government&#039;s commitment on risk assessments in clause 7, which is supported by hon. Members on both sides of the House. There is a demonstrable need for a more effective method of enforcing contact orders. In so far as Parliament can legislate to change people&#039;s lives for the better&#151;as Disraeli may have said in another context, &quot;The elevation of the people&quot;&#151;that is what we are trying to do today. It may not be Catholic emancipation or the abolition of slavery, but we are trying to improve people&#039;s lives and to give adults and children a better future, to ameliorate the tragedy of family disintegration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_210">We agree that, as legislators, we have a duty and responsibility to balance the best of what has gone before, best practice and an evidence-based analysis of the current system with a realisation that there are significant flaws in what passes for the practice of family law today, which is sometimes perceived as ineffectual and certainly perceived by many people as unfair.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_211">I welcome much of the Bill. I support the insertion of the domestic violence perpetrator programme into the Bill and the introduction of risk assessments, especially given the points made eloquently by the hon. Member for Luton, South (Margaret Moran) about circumstances where allegations or proof of abuse are involved. It is right to reform the Children Act 1989 and I am glad that there is recognition that the principle of children maintaining contact with both parents after divorce and separation should be enunciated, even though I might think that is not expressed sufficiently robustly in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_212">The recognition that contact orders are meaningless in their practical application without legal sanction is also welcome. Non-compliance cannot and should not be allowed to be tolerated by the courts with impunity. If it is, we risk undermining the whole discharge of family law. The Bill&#039;s proposals establish a marker that creates a disincentive for those who would otherwise flout the will of the court. They restore balance to an area hitherto considered wholly biased against the non-resident parent. As has already been said by my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton), giving the court a range of options, such as the early intervention projects, is realistic and sensible. Most importantly, it recognises that all families&#151; parents and children&#151;are different and that a one-size-fits-all approach is inappropriate in this particularly sensitive area. It goes without saying that I welcome the fact that Ministers have supported the decision not to proceed with tagging, which would have been a grotesque and gratuitous overreaction.

<a name="stpa_213">The failure&#151;or, if I am being charitable, the non-success&#151;of the family resolution pilots, which were launched and discontinued at a hugely disproportionate cost and which involved low take-up and a lack of compulsion, should not prevent Ministers from being imaginative, especially when reviewing the efficacy of mediation in the package of measures. However, voluntary measures will once again fail. As I mentioned when I intervened on the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke), only a legal obligation enacted by the courts will have the desired effect. Academic evidence from Norway, the United States and other countries has shown that that is the case. I hope that that matter will be debated in Committee at length and in detail.

<a name="stpa_214">The wider range of options available to the courts, the improvement in the monitoring of contact and&#151;I agree with the hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_215">I want to focus on a reasonably small number of areas that concern me and which remain unresolved in the Bill. At the outset I have to say&#151;this may be controversial&#151;that I believe that there is no contradiction between the presumption of co-parenting and the safety of the child or children subject to a contact order. I do not believe that the case has been sufficiently made that a legal presumption is, in general, in any way at odds with the interests of the child or children. I regret that the Government have not sought to strengthen the Children Act 1989 to give legal power to reasonable contact. I will come back to the word &quot;reasonable&quot; later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_216">Common sense indicates that children desire successful co-parenting after divorce and separation, and are happier and healthier as a result of it. Those children mostly go on to be settled, responsible and decent adults and to be good parents themselves. That is borne out by research by the National Council for One Parent Families in a study by J. Hunt in 2003.

Noble lords and ladies in the other place debated at length&#151;I believe in relation to amendment No. 2&#151;the word &quot;reasonable&quot;, which is enshrined in section 34 of the 1989 Act. I would also add &quot;meaningful&quot; as a given. I am glad that the Minister acknowledged in her comments to the Joint Committee the use of the word &quot;meaningful&quot;. &quot;Substantial&quot; was mentioned by my colleague, Baroness Morris of Bolton in the other place.

<a name="stpa_218">The positions taken by organisations such as Families Need Fathers and children&#039;s charities such as Barnardo&#039;s and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, notwithstanding its ill-judged and intemperate comments in its briefing notes, need not be irreconcilable. The presumption is an instrument that gives flexibility to the courts to tailor their decisions accordingly. Evidence shows that it would only formalise the current situation, where very few contact orders are not granted. That in no way invalidates the paramountcy principle in respect of the welfare and interests of the child.

<p>
<a name="60302-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_219">A corollary of this practical approach that the Government have not yet fully acknowledged is the strong argument in favour of a greater role for the child&#039;s voice to be heard in court, an argument that some Labour Members have advanced. It is one of the issues in the NSPCC briefing paper with which I agree, so it does not get everything wrong. Perhaps the Minister will touch on why section 122 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, which provides for children to have a legal and discrete right to be participants and to have separate representation in court, remains unimplemented.

<a name="stpa_220">I shall make some tangential comments. There has been consensus but the partisan comments of the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) obscure the issue. We all want children&#039;s voices to be taken into account. If an important piece of legislation has been on the statute book for three years and an important section of it remains unenacted, it is surely reasonable for us to ask why that is so.

: There might be a causal link, given that the Labour party is in Government and the Conservative party is in Opposition. Three years is surely plenty of time to come up with practical and pragmatic approaches to this point, particularly as it has been said that the issue is very important in the context of the proposed legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-24_para15">
<a name="stpa_221">There is much evidence including that, for example, from the <i>Family Law Journal</i>, under the auspices of the    National Youth Advocacy Service. Far from exacerbating the bitterness that is endemic in legal wrangles around contact order disputes, allowing the child&#039;s opinion to be heard acts as a catalyst in helping to resolve even the most long-standing and protracted difficult disputes.

<a name="stpa_222">On a broader issue, the paramountcy principle is only implicit in the Bill&#151;particularly in clauses 1, 4 and 5&#151;and is not as explicit as it was in the Children Act 1989. The Minister may want to comment on that when she replies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-24_para17">
<a name="stpa_223">I return to the sensitive subject of co-parenting and child safety. Thankfully, the awful phenomenon of child murder in contact situations is extremely rare. Although that issue is distressing, it must not obscure the case for co-parenting. More particularly, we should resist recourse to stereotypes. There is no definitive evidence that non-resident fathers per se, as a group, are a greater risk to child safety than substitute non-biological partners or non-biological mothers. In this respect, I deprecate the comments of the NSPCC. It has undermined its kudos as a respected children&#039;s charity in putting forward arguments that have no basis in fact and no evidential back-up. Let us remember that many of the dreadful crimes that take place involve not natural or biological fathers, but men brought into the family unit in the wake of divorce or separation. They may have very poor or non-existing parenting skills. At present, unlike the natural or biological father, they are unlikely to have been risk assessed.

<br>&nbsp;<br>remain unconvinced that the Government have thought through the practical consequences of the relevant provisions and their impact on CAFCASS, especially the availability of appropriate financial resources and, just as important, the uniformity of resources and facilities across the country. Under clause 7, CAFCASS officers will have a considerably enlarged portfolio of duties, and it is imperative that that does not impact on existing work flows, which are very demanding. I wish to take issue with the Minister, because there have been significant staffing shortfalls, long delays in assigning officers to children and a &#163;4 million cut in funding. As I said in an earlier intervention, the chief executive of CAFCASS, Mr. Anthony Douglas, wrote to me in response to a written question that I had tabled, confirming that one in six private law cases that dealt with parental responsibility, contact orders and residence were unallocated to a staff member.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-24_para19">
<a name="stpa_225">I pay tribute to the work done in sometimes very trying circumstances by the professional staff of CAFCASS, but there is dissatisfaction with the organisation, including complaints about inadequate time spent with children and institutional bias against non-resident parents. We should be mindful lest inadvertently we make matters worse. I am glad that the hon. and learned Member for Redcar has flagged up her concerns and cited the thematic review. The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke), too, was concerned about the matter. Like other hon. Members, I await further details from Ministers. No doubt, the issue will be debated at length in Committee. Perhaps the Minister will clarify her rather opaque description of a new and robust statutory framework, and the way in which it will affect funding and resources. Above all, we need proper planning, proper training and a realistic business plan for future CAFCASS workflows.

<a name="60302-24_para20">
<a name="stpa_226">In conclusion, may I make a plea on behalf of non-resident parents&#151;usually fathers&#151;and praise the invaluable role of the extended family in child care, especially grandparents who, as the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) will agree, are the unsung heroes of our sometimes difficult and dysfunctional families? Grandparents contribute 60 per cent., or &#163;1.1 billion-worth, of child care, yet they have few if any legal rights. I truly hope that the presumption of co-parenting in the Bill and other provisions will redress the balance in favour of fathers, reduce the bitterness inherent in many family courts cases, and have a commensurate positive impact on children. At the moment, non-resident fathers believe that they are on the receiving end of a slow legal system that tends to accept the status quo as a fait accompli, appears hostile to them as a result of their absence and, we should remember, imposes significant costs on them for having the temerity to seek equity and fairness. The most recent figures show that 7,000 court orders are breached every year. At the very least, notwithstanding the recognition in the Bill that non-compliance with court orders will not be tolerated, there must be an assumption by the state that it is responsible for upholding court decisions. That burden should not fall on the impecunious shoulders of individual non-resident parents.

Member for Peterborough said&#151;that worries me immensely. There is a very real difference between that and what Labour Members were discussing when he was speaking and graciously taking interventions&#151;that is, an underlying assumption in the courts which, believe me, does exist and has existed as long as I have been involved in the family courts, that the welfare of the child requires as much contact with both parents as possible. That is a common-sense assumption which underpins what the courts seek to do. However, that is a far cry from a legal presumption in the Bill which states that it is presumed that there will be co-parenting.

<a name="stpa_234">A legal presumption can be of two kinds. It can, for instance, be an absolute one, which means that it cannot be knocked over, whatever happens. On the other hand, a legal presumption can be rebuttable&#151;the words are archaic, but we lawyers love them&#151;which means that it can rebutted, but the onus is on somebody to unsettle what is otherwise an edifice of uncrackable law. If one gives such rights to parents, then one is giving rights to bad parents as well as to good parents, and one is also ousting the welfare of the child as the paramount principle.

 I am sure that I am not going to agree with the hon. and learned Lady on this point. Why is this issue so different from the rest of the law, in which there is a presumption of innocence until one is proven guilty? Why can there not be an assumption that a parent is a good parent until they are proven not to be, given all the checks and balances in the courts, which this Bill will reinforce? Why would such a presumption undermine the welfare of the child?
</p>





<p><a name="st_205"><a name="60302-25_spnew4"><b> Vera Baird: </b> 
 The explanation why such an approach would undermine the paramountcy principle is straightforward. In a situation in which it is not the child but the parents who are battling, the parents are obviously expressing what one might conjure up as the right of the child to have contact with dad, but it is dad who is fighting for that right, so it is his right. Once one makes that the presumption, the welfare of the child cannot be paramount, so the presumption must be ousted in some other way. In that case, one must bring to the surface the danger to the child in order to rebut 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 468</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the presumption, which self-evidently means that the presumption of paramountcy is not coming first. I would never agree to that proposal, which is not only technically nonsense, but wrong. It could be extremely dangerous, too, because it would oblige courts to give too many rights to bad parents, which is not what any of us want.

<p><a name="st_207"><a name="60302-25_spnew6"><b> Vera Baird: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is not comparing like with like. I am unaware of any legal system that includes a legal presumption of the type to which he has referred. The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) discussed the ability to put a presumption into the welfare checklist, but that is not a legal presumption. Most family law systems in societies resembling ours will be based on such a presumption, which is not a legally binding presumption of the kind mentioned by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham&#151;I hope that he eventually gets why he is wrong.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_236">Child contact is a child-protection issue, and there are dangers. This Government, more than any previous Government, have recognised domestic violence as a serious issue that has been hidden for many years, that is very hard to get the measure of and that is seriously under-reported. That point applies to male domestic violence, too, which the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham and I have discussed before. I talk about domestic violence against women because the vast majority of domestic violence involves women, but there is domestic violence by brother on brother, father on brother, brother on father, gay partner on gay partner and women on men. In every situation it is a hidden problem that needs teasing out, because, as it is wrapped up in a relationship, it is not easy to speak freely about it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_237">In this connection, though, it mostly concerns women. The statistics suggest that 750,000 children witness domestic violence annually. Seventy-five per cent. of children who are on the at-risk register for their own safety live with domestic violence, and up to 66 per cent. of children suffer physical violence from a perpetrator who is attacking the mother but also at some point attacks the child. In the criminal justice system, the point where the parties separate is now well recognised as being one of enhanced danger when the violence tends to increase because the perpetrator appreciates that he is losing his grip and tries to use even greater force to bring the person back into the fold. However, that is not half as well recognised in the family sector. When domestic violence is recognised in family courts, it is generally regarded as having come to an end when the couple has split, not as a continuing issue. It is often undervalued because it is perceived as a tactic in a fight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_238">The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, whom I know does not think as his words suggest, talked about the need to be rigorous and punitive about false allegations in court. Everybody agrees with that, but he cited only false allegations of domestic violence. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 469</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>That is a slightly partisan view. Of course, in heated situations where there is a child to play for, more unscrupulous parents make all sorts of allegations against one another, but there is not a high incidence of false allegations about domestic violence, although there is a great deal of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_239">Those of us who sat on the Joint Committee that scrutinised the draft Bill had the benefit of the scrutiny unit statistician&#039;s figures about a whole range of related issues. In the year for which he gave us figures&#151;I think that it must have been 2003&#150;04&#151;out of 40,000 contested custody cases, 13,000 concerned issues of safety, of which 5,500, or nearly half, concerned child abuse or neglect and the other 7,000 or so domestic violence. It is therefore utterly vital that the child&#039;s welfare is paramount and that that cannot be changed. I am pleased that the Government cling to that position and will continue to do so. The question is whether the Bill goes far enough to guarantee the safety of the large number of vulnerable children and domestic violence victims who are present in the statistics.

<p>
<a name="60302-25_para12">
<a name="stpa_240">The Government would say that those worries are adequately addressed by the welfare checklist in the Children Act 1989, the extension of the definition of &quot;harm&quot; to include impairment due to seeing or hearing ill-treatment of another, and the new family court application forms that try to ensure that domestic violence is put at the top of the list so that cases can be verified and dealt with at the outset. However, the joint charities grouping, which consists of a large number of pressure groups concerned with children, including the NSPCC, suggests that there is no clear requirement to ensure that contact is safe.

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_242">The thematic review makes the point that if we have existed with a family court system in which the stars representing the social workers, the sense of both sides to a dispute and the expertise acquired has never paid sufficient attention to safety planning, that speaks volumes about keeping children&#039;s safety paramount. Even the officers charged with the task of recommending welfare outcomes have not had that requirement as high on their agenda as they should.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_243">My second concern about the Bill is the absence of the paramountcy principle from the provisions that deal with enforcement against a recalcitrant parent. Clearly, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 470</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the point is to enforce, but orders for contact can only be prospective. The judge works out the likely way in which it will happen but events can call safety into question. For example, something could alarm the mother or make the child afraid so that it does not want to go, and she says, &quot;I won&#039;t go through with it.&quot; At that point, enforcement is directed at dealing with her. If the paramountcy of the interest of the child is lost then, we lose a good deal of the point of the Bill. That is deeply worrying.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_244">An individual needs to be punished but that should not undermine the paramountcy of the child. We are back to the point that the Bill is intended to tackle. The courts do not easily send a primary carer to prison because that is bad for the child and we are trying to get away from that model. The courts might express concern that, if they make someone do unpaid work at a time when they would otherwise take the child to a football match or do something nice, it undermines the welfare of the child. However, I believe that we could give the courts a strong steer and emphasise using reasonably civilised means to enforce an order, which the court remains assured is in the interests of the child. That model is compatible with the paramountcy of the welfare of the child. If that does not remain at the top of the agenda, we are worried that punishing the person will be put first and the child&#039;s welfare will be lost along the way. I hope that those who serve on the Committee can ensure that the paramountcy principle is included in the relevant provisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_245">Section 122 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 about representation for children has been mentioned. It has not been implemented and I understand some of the criticism from Conservative Back Benchers. There is no doubt that all the joint charities believe that it is crucial that the courts hear and understand the child&#039;s wishes and feelings about the circumstances to help them decide what would be safe for the child, yet the Bill neither implements section 122 nor orders separate representation when there is risk.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_246">The lobby groups say that separate representation should be considered in all cases where there is a risk and that courts should ascertain children&#039;s views in all cases. In principle, I agree strongly. However, I ask a question that I hope will be considered in a broader context than simply that of the Bill. How do we do that?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_247">In cases involving an older child, we can get the kid to give evidence if we have to, although that is not necessarily desirable. Such evidence could certainly feed into a social worker&#039;s report in some way. But what about the younger children? And what about the 5,500 out of every 40,000 who are subject to the threat of child abuse or a lack of safety? They need to be able to make an input into the question of contact, and they need to be able to articulate what has happened to put their safety in danger. That can be hugely difficult.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_248">That question is reflected in the criminal justice system, where case after case is brought involving allegations of abuse of young children, usually as a result of physical evidence, which might not be totally compelling, or concerns about the child not thriving. In other cases, a sibling might have said something, or the child might have said something to mum or dad to cause 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 471</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>real concern. But how can a child be facilitated to express what has happened to them, and to give that kind of evidence, which is highly material to a prosecution but equally material to the tortured issue of contact where there might have been child abuse?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_249">There is a provision in the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 for intermediaries to be supplied to help people who cannot communicate in the normal way to put their evidence before a court. That is used for a variety of vulnerable groups. I had the privilege a few weeks ago of visiting the Barnardo&#039;s Bridgeway project in Redcar. The project deals with what it calls troubled children. These are children who are suspected to have been abused. Its primary role is to unearth what has really happened, in order to help the child to deal with it and to give them counselling. It is that unearthing of what has happened, by using very clever methods, and then being satisfied as a professional that is has indeed happened, so as to know how to tackle it through the right kind of counselling, that offers a potential medium for getting complaints of child sex abuse before the courts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_250">I had a pretty limited opportunity to get to the depths of how those professionals work. Through the use of toys, books and pictures of a specific kind, they try to get the child to go back through the experience, to see whether they respond to anything that registers that they have had an abusive experience. For instance, rather than asking a child a complex question such as, &quot;How did you feel when that happened to you?&quot;, they have puppets that represent different emotions. This is just one example of how ingenious these methods are and the potential that they hold. The child would be asked which puppet was there at the time of the experience, and they might hold up the sad puppet or the angry puppet to show that that was how they felt. Or they might hold up the happy puppet, which would show that there was nothing to worry about.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_251">I am not suggesting that we use puppets in court&#151;I think that my colleagues in the legal profession might be a bit worried about that. However, I am suggesting that we all have a big responsibility, in confronting the inability to get children&#039;s testimony in these cases, to consider how those kids are not being protected because their testimony cannot be brought forward, and to examine some of these very clever methods, including those being used in the Barnardo&#039;s Bridgeway project. We need to acknowledge that, if they represent a well researched and methodologically sound way of getting reliable information about child abuse out of a child, so that an expert can then report it in court, that could be a way forward. I do not blame the Government for not introducing that part of the earlier Bill. It is easy to say that there should be separate representation in all circumstances, but a lot of questions remain about how exactly that should be achieved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_252">I welcome the Bill immensely. My only reservation is whether we have put safety sufficiently at a premium. Let us cleave to the paramountcy principle at every stage, and let us not lose sight of the opportunity that the Bill offers us to open the door into the world in which some children&#151;not all, but a substantial proportion, as the figures show&#151;suffer from abuse and from the spin-offs of domestic violence. Let us give serious thought to how we can, from now on, try harder to get children&#039;s voices properly heard.

I hope she will forgive me if I do not pursue some of her excellent points, as I want to concentrate on a narrower aspect of the Bill, namely adoption. I want to say something about the secrecy of the family court. I think that some of the general rules on adoption concerning foreign nations are relevant to our own system. A particularly sad case in which I have been involved over the last few months has a direct bearing on how adoption works in practice, especially forced adoption, the most extreme of the many issues that we must consider.

We have had three formal meetings and many more informal meetings. The Under-Secretary has changed my views on a number of important issues. She has also reinforced some of my prejudices, which is a nice feeling&#151;but I am genuinely grateful to her, and grief-stricken by the fact that she is plainly suffering from a heavy cold. I wish her a quick recovery.

<a name="60302-26_para13">
<a name="stpa_254">As I have said, I am concerned about the secrecy of the family court. I tabled an early-day motion on the subject. Looking around the Chamber earlier, I noted that almost every Member present, apart from Ministers and, obviously, the occupant of the Chair, had signed it. Early-day motion 869, entitled &quot;Workings of the Children Act 2004&quot;, stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&quot;That this House urges the Government to remove the veil of secrecy from the workings of the Children Act 2004; considers that the closed door policy of the family courts breeds suspicion and a culture of secrecy which does nothing to instil confidence in those using them, which affects not just the courts but the social services departments of local authorities; and believes that it is possible to preserve the anonymity of children involved in the proceedings without the cumbersome rules which obstruct parents from receiving advice and support, which in particular works to the disadvantage of parents with special learning difficulty.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_255">The hon. and learned Member for Redcar spoke about the concept of the rights of the child being paramount. Her explanation was a good deal clearer than some that I have received from social services departments. However, I am less concerned with the effect on the courts than with the effect on social services. There is almost a process of Chinese whispers, whereby that noble concept becomes bastardised into an unwillingness to disclose, to justify, to listen to arguments, or even to see a need to explain decisions. The law was changed because of Members&#039; difficulties in obtaining information from social services departments. At one time, they were threatened with contempt proceedings and prosecutions for pursuing constituency cases. Since the beginning of April last year, however, we have been able to look at case files and discuss the issues. I may be wrong but I think that I was the first Member of Parliament to take advantage of that, after a constituent who was going through the process brought it to my attention in the early part of April last year.

<a name="stpa_256">The change in the law seems to have wholly passed by Essex social services department. Despite the will of the House and the change in the law, it led me through quite an elaborate dance when I wanted to get some basic information from it. At one point, it insisted that I went to court to get special permission, when by Act of Parliament I already had that right. Had it not been for my noble Friend Lord Hanningfield, who happens to be the leader of Essex county council, I do not think that I would have been able to pursue the case to the full.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para16">
<a name="stpa_257">I cannot go into the details of the case, but I can talk about it in the abstract and discuss the way it affects the law. It concerned the decision by Essex social services to remove two children from a family because they considered the mother to be stupid and incapable of bringing up the children because of her lack of intellect. The mother had an IQ of around 60. Social services sought to present her as stupid to the point of being unable to understand maternal feelings. In my view, she was a little slow but someone who clearly loved her two children. She was faced with an unending stream of social workers dealing with her case&#151;at one point, I counted 16&#151;who were pushing her in different directions. She was left bewildered and unable adequately to rebut social services&#039; allegations. I want to say a few things about people with learning difficulties and then move to the general question of social services. I want to stay firmly within the terms of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para17">
<a name="stpa_258">A problem has been identified recently with the Meadow case. I do not want to go down that route but it illustrates the fact that, sometimes, proceedings have been initiated because hospital consultants or social workers have been a little over-zealous. It is typical for the person who initiates proceedings to see the complaint through. There is a need for a separation of powers between those who take the decision to initiate an investigation and those who actually conduct it. I am worried&#151;I will come to this a little later&#151;about the targets for adoption and the obvious financial benefits that accrue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para18">
<a name="stpa_259">The principal problem is that social services departments cannot be entirely non-partisan in the way in which they identify the issues. Few people who initiate a serious chain of events are likely to admit it when it goes wrong. The temptation is to tailor evidence to fit the complaint. That should be resisted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para19">
<a name="stpa_260">I can give a few brief examples of how that happens. As I said, I think that I was almost certainly the first MP to go through the process of wading through a social services file concerned with a forced adoption. It was thick, repetitive and at times confusing. I have talked to the Minister about that. I speak as a former chairman of a social services department and was used to seeing that kind of thing. I was shocked at the sloppiness of record keeping, the shoddiness of the process and the basic injustice. In that file&#151;this is directly relevant&#151;there was misinformation, embellishment and inappropriate assigning of motives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para20">
<a name="stpa_261">I shall give just two examples, which illustrate the general problem. In the first example, the husband did not have learning difficulties but was, by mistake, described as having them. The mistake was recognised and corrected in the file but subsequently, such allegations continued to be made, as though it was a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 474</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>proven fact. More seriously, it was suggested that the child had witnessed domestic violence. It became clear that this was a single incident in which the husband, in a moment of pique, had picked up his slippers and thrown them against the wall. He is a gentle and passive man and at no time were the slippers aimed at anybody; nor was any damage caused, except, perhaps, for a slight mark on the wall. However, the file on that family states that the female child
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;has witnessed domestic violence and this will have an impact towards her development&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para21">
<a name="stpa_262">Following close scrutiny on my part, social workers told me that there was no evidence of any violence toward either child in the family. No doctors or casualty departments had expressed concern, and there was no evidence of repeated accidents involving the children. Yet the allegation remained on the file.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para22">
<a name="stpa_263">An allegation was also made of poor parenting and I asked for various examples. I was given two. First, the female child had been given sandwiches and a packet of crisps for her lunch, and because she chose to eat the crisps first, she was too full to eat her sandwiches. That was deemed sufficiently important to be regarded as an example of poor parenting. The second example&#151;we should bear in mind that at this point, I was pressing for another such example&#151;involved allowing one of the children to stay up late at night to watch television. I asked whether &quot;late&quot; meant 10 o&#039;clock at night, or perhaps 9 o&#039;clock. I was told that she was allowed to stay up until 8 o&#039;clock to watch the end of &quot;EastEnders&quot; or &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. I have many middle-class friends with children of a similar age who are allowed to have crisps and to stay up until 8 o&#039;clock. None of them is subject to a care order.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para23">
<a name="stpa_264">I turn to the issue of stories being embellished. By this point, the social worker was finding me a tad provocative. He said that the mother had screwed up a baby-wipe tightly in her fist and had repeatedly rubbed it against the genitals of the young male child, to the extent that they were &quot;red raw.&quot; However, the report actually said that the mother had used heavy pressure, and that the genitals were flattened and &quot;very red&quot;. There is a world of difference between &quot;red raw&quot; and discoloured.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para24">
<a name="stpa_265">I found distressing the way in which motives were ascribed in the report, without any obvious discipline. The father was criticised because he had refused to leave his job of some 23 years to become the full-time carer. It was said that that showed a lack of commitment. I believe that holding down a job&#151;in his case, a humble job&#151;for 23 years and putting bread on the table week in, week out sets a fine example to one&#039;s children. The social workers wanted the father to live off benefits. That might have been a solution, but if someone can set an example to their children by working hard, that is something to be proud of.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-26_para25">
<a name="stpa_266">I want to return to the way in which the primacy rule can be bastardised. I confess that by this time I was beginning to irritate people, although I am sure that hon. Members will find that hard to believe. I found myself being lectured by a very senior person whom I shall not name, as that would be embarrassing.

<a name="stpa_272">I was enormously surprised to find that there is no national system for the regulation or disciplining of social workers.

The solution does not need to be elaborate, but peer evaluation among social workers on relevant matters is important.

<a name="stpa_276">I would like to give an illustration which, of all the features of the case, has really chilled me. It is about the question of duty of care. In the April before the children were finally taken with a view to an enforced adoption, there was a case conference. The second child had not yet been born. The conference was considering whether to put the child on the at-risk register. The daughter was already on it. On the basis of the facts before it, the conference decided that it was not necessary to put the young boy on the register and furthermore that it was appropriate to take the young girl off it. Somebody at that conference, notably the chairman, did not like that decision. There was no change of circumstances and no other substantial incidents had taken place. Yet the same circumstances were seen as making it appropriate to put the children into care with a view to permanent adoption.

<a name="stpa_277">Let me say what I think needs to be done. Those who investigate a complaint must be independent of those who initiate it and those who may in due course be called on to care for the children. A proper code of conduct for social workers is long overdue. I certainly believe that those with special learning difficulties deserve special care. We are told that in 1 per cent. of all families one partner or the other has learning difficulties. We are also told that 20 per cent. of children in care have one parent with learning difficulties. There is some dispute over the figures, but whether they are precisely right or not, they demonstrate a problem.

<a name="stpa_278">The secrecy of the family courts needs to be opened up. We wait for the consultation document. I believe that there is a strong case for judgments to be published and that they can be published while retaining the anonymity of the child. I have one additional suggestion. It goes back to the Meadow case. There is a question whether the professional witnesses should be identified. If the Government take the decision that they should, I will generally support that. Once you become involved in a case you get e-mails from all over the country. Some are heartbreaking, but they all have strong emotion running through them. Very normal people sometimes become irrational. I recognise that there might be a problem obtaining witnesses if they are routinely named.

<br>&nbsp;<br>and talk to us. I can give examples of where there is a problem. In care or adoption proceedings it is understandable that parents want to take a fair amount of time off. Under the existing rules, parents cannot tell their employer why they are absent from work without going back to the court. Psychiatric evaluations are also often necessary in such proceedings, but people cannot make full disclosure without first going back to the court. We have to find ways to solve those problems, and I wholeheartedly endorse the Committee&#039;s recommendations for greater transparency.

<a name="stpa_281">It might be slightly controversial to say so, but some cases resemble attempts to make bricks without straw. Once the facts have been established, the courts are reluctant to revisit those facts or their interpretation. However, if adoption has resulted from fraud or seriously erroneous evidence, we should have a procedure to enable that adoption to be overturned, although the period in which that could be done should be limited. In care proceedings, any carer who is accused of abuse should have an automatic entitlement to legal aid; the opportunity to instruct an expert of their choosing; a right of appeal against any findings; and legal aid for any appeal.

 Child contact disputes can be tremendously painful and affect everyone involved in them. They can leave long-lasting damage in their wake, so it is in everyone&#039;s interest to keep them to a minimum. For families, it is a deeply personal and private decision whether parents should live together or separate, and, if they separate, what arrangements should be made for caring for their children. We&#151;as the decision makers&#151;and the agencies and courts that affect those people&#039;s lives should be very aware of the difficulties that people have in engaging with the state when they have to make those private decisions.

The Bill may not be able to cover some of my interests, such as a universal parenting support service, but we should remember that services for parents in difficulty are woefully inadequate. There is some preparation. The external assessment process for adopting and foster parents may prepare them for what is to come.

Many people have overlooked that change. I asked my local register office why we could not have a ceremony to mark the registration of a birth and was told that there was one but not many people asked for it. Such a ceremony could be an occasion for parents not only to celebrate the joy and pleasure that they will derive from parenthood, but to learn a little about their duties and responsibilities, which is relevant to our debate about parents&#039; responsibilities for the welfare of their child when they are in dispute.

The concept of joint parental responsibility, much overlooked in today&#039;s debate, has been extremely successful. The statistic has become hackneyed in our debate today, but in nine out of 10 cases parents who separate come to their own agreement about the future care of their children, because they exercise their joint parental responsibility. Most of our focus has been on some of the cases in the other 10 per cent. The existing law is sound, but some of the practices about which we have heard today are unacceptable. We need to give thought to them in designing legislation to improve the situation.

 The point that I want to pursue in a little while is that the enemies of dissatisfied parents, grandparents and wider family members are usually obstacles that are nothing to do with what the court would decide if it had a fair opportunity to make the decision.

A person who already thinks that that is unfair and that, if the mediation does not work, lawyers in the court case will have to be paid, will worry that mediation involves a wasted cost and will be reluctant to incur that in the first place. The first thing to address is: if mediation is such a successful route and might save lots of costs later, is it not worth investing something in the mediation process for both parties to make it an attractive solution for the early resolution of disputes?

<a name="stpa_300">What does the Bill do to reduce delay? On its own, it is silent about that, but it introduces a new power to direct parties to undertake a contact activity&#151;information sessions, classes and counselling. It is possible that that could be the first thing that a court orders immediately after somebody applies for a decision. In that instance, if something comes of the information sessions, classes and counselling, it might bring about an early resolution of the dispute and achieve a satisfactory outcome for both parties. That will depend on the order being used and resourced so that things happen quickly, as well as whether the parties feel that they get sufficient help through that route to resolve their dispute. Clearly, the approach will not work if parties retain hardened attitudes.

I hesitate to say that CAFCASS will make that approach work because we have also heard that it has to carry out the new risk assessments, administer the reformed family assistance orders, presumably carry on its current role regarding inquiries and reports to courts and, hopefully, fully resource its public law cases, which are an important priority for it.

It contains many references to the presentation that day from the Florida judge, John Lendermann, under the title &quot;How and Why Most American States Changed to Early Interventions&quot;. His article describes how it was based on a statutory requirement for frequent and continuing contact founded on child development research. He said that children did better when both parents were kept in their lives. He added that the basis of the whole scheme is well publicised in parenting plans setting out cycles of contact in the average case.

<p>
<a name="60302-27_para21">
<a name="stpa_304">I have some difficulty with the concept of the average case. The problem with these few cases is how highly individualised they are in terms of the needs and demands of the parties to them. Nevertheless, the judge said that the combination meant that American parents knew what sort of orders the courts might make in the absence of exceptional circumstances, and that by implication they concentrated more on making a success of the alternative. It is clear from that description, as it should be in this country, that allegations of domestic violence should be taken out of the process immediately and dealt with separately by courts.

<p>
<a name="60302-27_para22">
<a name="stpa_305">In the judge&#039;s scheme in Florida, the remaining cases are streamed through a two-stage process. The first is that separated parents are mandated&#151;I think that that means that they are made&#151;to go to group parent educational classes where their post-separation responsibilities to their children and each other are explained to them. They are given the opportunity to agree a parenting plan and exit system. For the remainder&#151;what the judge describes as resistant parents&#151;he says that they are obliged to attend a single session of contact-focused mediation. He says also that Florida has a standard standing temporary order, which is issued in every case, binding the parties to maintain contact prior to the first hearing. The judge describes in his article that therefore only a minority of cases, mostly involving serious issues, need further intervention. Florida&#039;s overall caseload was up and costs were down. Enforcement was a rarity and delay was negligible. Most disputes were resolved within a few weeks.

There should be specific procedures to deal with those cases once they are identified. We should hear the families&#039; views, including the children&#039;s views. We should certainly consider the separate representation of children in appropriate cases. We need to identify those cases where continuing contact has already been shown to be in the beginning of the case in the child&#039;s best interests, and there is a danger that that continuing contact will cease unless something is done at the early stage of the case and not at the end of it.

All those things can be identified in a robust risk assessment and targeted approaches designed as a result, and I hope that that will happen in future. Children&#039;s welfare certainly includes protection from physical and psychological harm, so our systems of dispute resolution must be vigilant so that they can detect cases of domestic violence. It is important not to put parents in danger, even at the early stage, as I mentioned, of mediation, and certainly not during the proceedings.

While I support the extension of enforcement powers, those uncertainties reinforce my strong view that we must sweep away obstacles that arise early in the process, such as delay and cost, so that we can deal with more disputes more effectively.

<p>
<a name="60302-27_para28">
<a name="stpa_311">Part 2 deals with adoption. The Joint Committee that considered the draft Bill and the Joint Committee on Human Rights both recommended that the Bill should require the Secretary of State to pay particular regard to the United Nations convention on the rights of the child when deciding whether to impose special restrictions suspending inter-country adoptions from a particular country. I very much agree with that suggestion, which would provide an important safeguard to ensure that the power to issue special restrictions is exercised in conformity with, and in support of, the convention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-27_para29">
<a name="stpa_312">The Bill is necessary because of the difficulties relating to some contact disputes, as we well know. It goes in the right direction, as most speakers have said. It has been improved in the other place and, in my view, it could be improved still further in the House. My strong wish is that we continue this debate in Committee and hammer out a position from those that have been articulated today to make the Bill much better and much more effective in reducing those disputes.

<p><a name="st_220"><a name="60302-28_spnew0"><b> Andrew Selous  (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con):</b> 
 May I begin by commending the Minister for Children and Families, my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton), who spoke on behalf of the official Opposition and, indeed, all hon. Members on the tone and manner of their contributions? These are emotional issues and there are many different perspectives on them, but everyone who has spoken today has made a considered contribution. Indeed, I am heartened by the extent of consensus in the Chamber. We are all united in wanting children to be safe, both in their own home with the parent who has custody of them, and with non-resident parents. We are united as well in agreeing that it is in children&#039;s interests to have ongoing contact with both their mother and their father, although there will be some exceptions where that is not in the best interests of the child.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_313">The first aspect that I shall consider is prevention, which is not specifically dealt with in the Bill. Again, I commend my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, who touched on trying to prevent couples from splitting up. I also commend the hon. Members for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke), who referred to that, and the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) who mentioned the important topic of marriage preparation. We miss that all the time. It is not something for which we can or should legislate, but it is a matter of political will and a matter for greater funding priority than it is currently given.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_314">Is it possible to reduce the workload of the family courts and of CAFCASS, which we have been hearing about? I would argue that it is. There is a growing body of evidence around the world that that is the case. Let us start in America. The community marriage policies that have sprung up there have halved&#151;yes, halved&#151;the divorce rate in some cities. Modesto in California and Austin in Texas are two examples. The university of Texas has undertaken independent corroboration of the effect of community marriage policies across America and estimates that they have prevented some 31,000 divorces and that the divorce rate across all those community marriage policy areas is significantly lower than in areas without it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_315">In Australia, there is a concerted effort to tackle the problem. We heard briefly from some hon. Friends about the family relationship centres in Australia, which play a role in making sure that the arrangements are correct for children when parents have separated. They also do important preventive work beforehand to try and help couples stay together and make marriages successful. Those organisations are not run by the state but receive some support from it. Given that the Government are considering reform of the Child Support Agency, it is interesting that the Australian child support agency is involved in helping non-resident parents to be good parents and provides materials to enable them to do that. That is a good example of the way in which, cross-departmentally, across all the agencies of Government, we could do better in this country. In Singapore and Malaysia, both Governments are taking the matter seriously. Similarly, Dubai in the middle east came to my attention recently.

<a name="60302-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_316">I am trying to set up a project in my constituency. Last week, we launched our own community marriage policy and, in time, I hope to develop two community family trusts. I know that the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole has an excellent one in her constituency doing very good work in schools. I am envious of that, and want the same in my constituency. I hope that all hon. Members might take more of an interest in such projects, so that we can reduce the flow of parents and children coming into the family court system and reduce the demands on CAFCASS. We have heard from almost everyone who has spoken today that CAFCASS will have great difficulty in coping with the extra demands placed upon it by the Bill.
</p>





<p><a name="st_221"><a name="60302-28_spnew1"><b> Mr. Kidney: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman remember that a couple of hon. Members spoke about the new children&#039;s centres that are planned for many parts of the country as being places where contact can take place? Does he agree that they could also make admirable focuses for parent support services? In my constituency, Stafford, I have an ambition to get Home Start to be the front-of-house service for supporting parents.
</p>





<p><a name="st_222"><a name="60302-28_spnew2"><b> Andrew Selous: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right that children&#039;s centres are good forums for support centres for parents, but I am discussing support for couples, which is a slightly different point. Support for parents is important, but almost the most important thing that parents can do for their children is to be kind to each other. If parents do that, it sets a wonderful example to their children and helps them to stay together, which benefits their children.
</p>

<a name="60302-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_317">I am particularly interested in the point that my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham made about the contribution of social workers in Kent.

<p><a name="st_223"><a name="60302-28_spnew3"><b> Mr. Stewart Jackson: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend support the work of the charity Parent Talk? Last week, I attended an event specifically designed to help parents cope with the difficult job of parenting that that charity put on in a primary school in one of the most deprived areas in my constituency. Support includes videos and booklets to help keep together families which are sometimes in difficult financial circumstances.
</p>





<p><a name="st_224"><a name="60302-28_spnew4"><b> Andrew Selous: </b>

 I am sure that the hon.

</p>





<p><a name="st_226"><a name="60302-28_spnew6"><b> Andrew Selous: </b> 
 I am sorry to hear that. The onus is on local community family trusts to try to raise as much money as they can. Some of the central support for the work of community family trusts has been cut and I hope that today&#039;s debate will enable Ministers to review some of those decisions. As the hon. Member for Stafford and others said, it is right that the focus should be on mediation, avoiding cases going to court in the first place and early intervention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-28_para6">

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">&quot;Schemes to divert parents away from court have been developing, including the scheme led by Judge John Lendeman in Florida whereby parents are given information about the damaging impact of their conflict on their children and invited to work out a parenting plan with the help of a mediator.

<p>
<a name="60302-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_320">We should be going in that direction in the United Kingdom, and I share the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Stafford that the Bill does not explicitly state how we can do so and whether sufficient funds are available.

<a name="60302-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_321">Clause 4 deals with the enforcement of court orders, which remains an area of great concern to me. Over the past four and a half years, several constituents have come to me to complain about this. Typically, they are good, concerned fathers who regularly pay their child support as they should, month by month. Some of them have been back to the court 30 or 40 times to try to get their disputes resolved and to have enforced the contact that they have been granted by the court after it has weighed up all the considerations. They have come to me and said that neither the court nor the police have been interested in ensuring that the contact that they were granted is enforced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_322">That was graphically illustrated to me in my constituency surgery about two weeks ago, when a serving company sergeant-major came to see me. He sat down in front of me and took off the fleece that he was wearing, and right in the middle of his chest was the symbol of his office as a warrant officer in the Army&#151;a large crown. He said, &quot;I don&#039;t believe in the antics of Fathers 4 Justice&quot;&#151;who, it is worth remembering, have physically changed the shape of this Chamber since we last debated these issues. He went on, &quot;I stand for what this country stands for. I am a serving soldier and I have done everything right. I pay all the money that I am required to. I have a court order that has stamped on it the same crown that I wear as the badge of my office, yet it is not worth the paper it is written on in terms of my ability to see my children.&quot; That is an absolutely 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 487</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>scandalous state of affairs for a good, caring father who has every right to see his children, and whose children will be missing out on the input of a good and dedicated father. The tragedy is that the gentleman who came to see me is one of 7,000 non-resident parents every year who find that the court orders that have been granted to enable them to see their children are being breached.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_323">My worry is that it is not sufficiently clear exactly what will happen if these contact orders continue to be breached. When I intervened on the Minister during her opening speech, she said, properly, that the matter would be left to the courts. However, as Members of Parliament, we collectively represent the High Court of Parliament. It is important that we make it absolutely clear that, where people have acted properly, the court has duly considered all the information, the non-resident father clearly has no history of domestic violence or anything similar, and the court has said that contact must happen, that contact is in the best interests of the child and we must ensure as a Parliament that it happens. That is fundamental.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_324">If the constituent whom I spoke about, or any other such constituent, comes back to see me after the Bill has passed into law, I will feel that I have failed him if the contact that the court has said that he should have with his children, and his children with him, is not being granted. I am sure that the Minister understands the seriousness of this. We have to ensure that the law has teeth and that where contact has been ordered it really does happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_325">The difficulty will centre on what series of escalating steps&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham mentioned this&#151;is put in place by the courts to bring that about. It is clearly sensible to have parenting intervention programmes to try to convince parents to do the right thing. I like the idea of giving compensatory time. We could also consider fines going from one parent to the other so that the child does not lose out, with perhaps some mechanism to ensure that that money is indeed spent on the child. It is a vital issue. Many non-resident parents&#151;often fathers&#151;give up their house and the day-to-day care of their children. In many cases, another man moves into their house and lives with their children for most of the time. If the one thing that they have been given&#151;a right by a court to see their children&#151;is flouted, it is a massive injustice for the children and the non-resident parents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_326">I echo all the points that have been made about grandparents, but why confine the comments to grandparents? Uncles, aunts, cousins and the extended family generally are vital for the development of our nation&#039;s children. Many of us have benefited from close relationships with all members of our extended family. Our view of the family is much too nuclear in this country and in several European countries. We could greatly benefit from a more southern European approach. Contact and enforcement is important not only for the non-resident parent but for all those who have loved and cared for children. For many grandparents, uncles and aunts, the children whom they will not see have been an incredibly important part of their lives. We must ensure that the matter is taken seriously for their sake, too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-28_para14">

<br>&nbsp;<br>resident parents travel some way from their homes to see their children, there may not be a contact centre in which to see them. Supervised visits have to take place in a contact centre, but if the visits are unsupervised and there is no contact centre, where do they go? There is an expression, &quot;McDads&quot;. In the summer, it may not be so bad&#151;perhaps there is a park or another place outside on a warm day&#151;but where, physically, do we expect non-resident parents to spend any quality time with their children? I am not looking for state provision from the Minister but I am trying to think of solutions.

<a name="60302-28_para15">
<a name="stpa_328">Perhaps charities can help. We have heard much about children&#039;s charities today. Perhaps the NSPCC or other charities that have been slightly criticised may like to consider the problem. Perhaps churches, faith groups or anyone in a community who has space in their home and a heart for such matters could help. Perhaps arrangements could be made to put non-resident parents and their children with people who would like to open their homes to them. The non-resident parents could relax and play with their children in a familiar, family environment. That would have to be done by agreement and negotiation, but it is an important matter that some of my constituents who are non-resident parents&#151;and non-resident grandparents&#151;who have to travel some way have raised with me. I do not look to the Government for an answer&#151;it is properly not within their remit&#151;so Ministers can relax. However, I hope that they at least agree that it is an important matter to consider in the context of the care of children with non-resident parents.

<a name="stpa_329">Other hon. Members have mentioned delay. &quot;Justice delayed is justice denied&quot; is a common saying about the law. That is nowhere more true than when children are involved. Childhood is finite and crucial. If a parent misses specific stages of a child&#039;s development, they are gone for ever. That is a tragedy. Speed is therefore important. Of course, we must get things right but speed is also vital and I hope that that will be taken fully into account.

<p><a name="st_227"><a name="60302-29_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Maria Miller  (Basingstoke) (Con):</b> 
 We have had a full and wide-ranging debate. We have heard that children everywhere must cope with increasingly complex and difficult family relationships. Every year, 150,000 children have to deal with the distress and upset of divorce. One in five children are likely to go through their parents&#039; separation or divorce before they reach the age of 16. That is difficult for any child.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_330">Indeed, parental divorce is seen by children as one of their biggest concerns and fears. We need to bear that in mind as we discuss the Bill. We have heard that great importance is put on children maintaining a relationship with both parents after separation or divorce, and that has been accepted by all speakers on both sides of the House. However, the harsh reality is that after only two short years of separation, 40 per cent. of non-resident divorced and separated parents lose contact with their children. That should set alarm bells ringing for all of us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_331">We have also heard arguments on both sides of the House that reinforce the fact that the Bill does not grasp the full magnitude of the social problems faced by children growing up in this country today. We must not miss the opportunity to get to the heart of the problem, because we face many challenges as we consider this very difficult and sometimes apparently intractable problem.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_332">There needs to be a change in the way in which family law deals with establishing and maintaining contact between non-resident parents and their children, and a change in the way in which we ensure that the law is put into practice. We have heard today that many other countries are considering new and different ways of doing that, and it seems entirely appropriate that we should examine those options in more detail in Committee, to see whether we can learn anything from them. Those countries&#039; legal systems are not dissimilar to our own, so I hope that that would not be a difficult challenge for us to undertake.

<a name="stpa_336">It should not be the role of the Government to dictate the relationship between parents and their children, but it is their role to ensure that systems are in place to provide guidance when it is needed. The Bill lacks explicit guidance on the important role that both parents can play in ensuring the well-being of their children. The Green Paper was more explicit about such provisions, but the Bill is not.
</p>

<a name="stpa_337">As I have said, there is common ground between the Government and the Opposition. We all agree that the child&#039;s welfare is of paramount importance, and we must ensure that any legislation designed to support children has that at its heart. We need to debate these matters as they appear to children. I am not a lawyer, and perhaps Members of Parliament should try to speak not as lawyers but as Members of Parliament. I am married to a lawyer, and I know that it is sometimes difficult for lawyers to get out of the habit of speaking as lawyers, but that is an important challenge for us.

<p>
<a name="60302-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_338">First and foremost, we should focus on the everyday, practical problems that children face. We should then let the judiciary decide how they are dealt with, when it comes within its remit to do so.

<a name="60302-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_339">We have all agreed today that parents play a pivotal role in achieving the best outcomes for children. We have also agreed that the vast majority of non-resident parents want to stay in contact with their children, and we need to keep in the forefront of our minds that, in 90 per cent. of cases, it is perfectly safe for them to do so. However, anyone reading the transcript of today&#039;s debate might find that somewhat surprising.

<a name="stpa_340">The Bill attempts to encourage contact and to make the sanctions that are in place workable. We cannot help feeling, however, that it merely tinkers at the edges of a more deeply rooted problem. There is a general feeling that a lack of confidence in the family court system has resulted in many parents settling for less contact, or unreasonable contact time, as legal fees and court time

<p>
<a name="60302-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_341">All too often, as others have said, even when parents have not had to resort to the courts, non-resident parents find it difficult to secure the time with their children that they need in order to maintain and develop the parent-child relationship. Difficult situations are often compounded by non-resident parents&#039; living in accommodation that is not suitable for their children to visit, let alone stay in. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) made that point. A parent who has had to leave the family home    may well be living in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, or other accommodation that is deeply unsuitable for a child to visit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_342">Lengthy and costly judicial process only serves to exacerbate the problem. As we heard earlier, the Government&#039;s own research shows that one in four contact and residence cases lasts more than a year, and a quarter of all cases involve multiple applications resulting from enforcement problems. The system often fuels existing tensions between parents, and a feeling of marginalisation for non-resident parents. Clearly none of that is in a child&#039;s best interests.
</p>

<a name="60302-29_para13">
<a name="stpa_343">The law should make clear that we value the contribution of both parents to the future welfare of a child whenever that is safe&#151;and, as I have said, it is safe in the vast majority of cases. If a child&#039;s relationship with his or her parent is to flourish and not wither on the vine, time is needed. We must examine ways in which the legal system can become more accessible, and can work better to bring about successful outcomes for children rather than fuelling conflict in already difficult and emotionally charged circumstances. That is why we will seek fundamental amendments to the Bill, including a legal presumption of co-parenting and an explicit statement of reasonable contact, backed up by early intervention and mediation.

We must also ensure that the legal approach, which at present can seem rather hostile to that group of people, is amended so that we can support them more.

Importantly, she touched on the issue of safety and the hidden aspects of domestic violence, of which we should all be aware when we discuss the Bill. It is an important issue.

<p>
<a name="60302-29_para19">
<a name="stpa_349">The hon. Member for Luton, South (Margaret Moran), who made a considered contribution, raised the important issue of domestic violence and child care and various other aspects of the Bill, including the importance of clause 7. The hon. Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey) touched on the importance of mothers and fathers and the fact they have responsibilities, which, again, we should keep to the fore.

<p>
<a name="60302-29_para20">
<a name="stpa_350">As my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham pointed out, there is a fair amount of agreement in principle on the issue of inter-country adoption, although we have some concerns about the fashioning of the new procedures and will consider that in a little more detail in Committee. We feel strongly that it is perfectly legitimate to consider overseas adoption but we share the Government&#039;s concerns about the cases of child trafficking in recent months. However, we must be vigilant that restrictions do not lead to a growth in private adoption.

We will encourage the Government to be bolder in the Bill to achieve those ends. We know that the Government often have regretted not having the courage to be bolder when seeking solutions to the important problems that are faced by our country. I can reassure Ministers that we will do all we can to ensure that that is not the case in this instance.

 No doubt it is but that is not a matter for me to decide.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_352">I congratulate hon. Members on both sides of the House who have participated in an extremely stimulating, wide-ranging and well-argued debate. It is apparent from their speeches that they approach the issue with a passionate commitment to try to ensure that children caught up in the divorce or separation of couples, and the bitterness that sometimes results, are not harmed too much by that experience. There is no doubt that that commitment was apparent even if it was also apparent that there may be one or two slightly different approaches to how best to achieve that. That is no different from the tone adopted when the Bill was debated in another place and during later proceedings on it. The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) was right to say that proceedings on the Bill have been going on for some time. That lengthy deliberation is only correct because we need to get things right; the future of the children whom we are trying to assist depends on our doing so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_353">The debate did occasionally descend into slightly bad temper and we had a couple of somewhat vehement spats between the hon. Members for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) and for Mid-Dorset and North Poole. There was also a spat involving the hon. Gentleman and the NSPCC, which was of course unable to defend itself. However, it will doubtless find an opportunity to do so when the debate is over.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_354">I want to sort out what I believe to have been a genuine misunderstanding&#151;it does not happen very often&#151;between the usual channels. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham suggested that the Government are trying to avoid giving the Opposition the time that they want for consideration in Committee, but I assure him that that is not the case. There has been a genuine misunderstanding, in that the usual channels on our side gave what was asked for, but I assure him that the Government intend to be flexible and to provide more time in Committee if required.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_355">I shall deal with some of the points and broad themes that were raised, although I will not have time to deal with them all, given that most Members spoke at great length. It is clear that contact with both parents is in the interests of the child if it can be done in safety; indeed, there is general agreement in all parts of the House on that point. I would argue&#151;as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) argued, perhaps more eloquently than I ever could&#151;that case law already suggests that the courts start from the position that contact between a child and their parents is generally in the child&#039;s best interests.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_356">The different perspectives expressed on the Floor of the House disagreed on the question whether such contact compromises the safety of the child in some instances, or the paramount interest of the child&#039;s welfare, given that such contact often breaks down. The Children Act 1989 does of course contain the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 493</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>paramountcy principle, and the Government and I believe it incredibly important that that principle, which was established with the support of Members in all parts of the House, be retained. We heard from my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar an excellent exposition on what changing the presumptions would mean in legal terms. It is undoubtedly true that many fathers are unable to spend the time with their children that they would like to spend, and it is right that we offer them support and encourage a positive relationship between children and both parents after separation. The Bill attempts to ensure that we do just that by providing the courts with more flexibility in enforcing contacts that they have ordered, on the basis that they are in the interest of the child. That is what the Bill is about.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_357">However, we need to be clear that any presumption&#151;even if couched as a principle in the absence of evidence to the contrary&#151;represents a different legal model from the one enshrined in the 1989 Act. To place something else on a level with that which is supposed to constitute paramountcy is incompatible with the paramountcy principle. I am certain that we will continue to have legalistic and non-legalistic arguments on this issue&#151;from lawyers and non-lawyers&#151;as the Bill proceeds through the House, but the Government do not want to do anything to compromise the paramountcy principle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_358">In the main, Members in all parts of the House had something positive to say about mediation. The issue was raised of whether voluntary mediation is best, or whether mediation could&#151;or even should&#151;be compulsory. It is clear that voluntary mediation is best: one can lead a horse to water, but one cannot make it drink. Can we really expect people to be forced to mediate if they are not in the mood? Requiring mediation before a case can proceed, for example, could simply result in further unnecessary delay if the parties are already well-entrenched in their respective positions and are in no fit state to see that mediation might actually help. However, the Joint Committee considering the draft Bill recommended that the court should be able to direct people to attend an initial meeting with a mediator, and I think that that would be appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_359">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole asked whether information about mediation was available other than in the form of leaflets. She asked whether a video was available, and I can tell her that the Government are even more modern than that, having produced a DVD on the subject. We are moving into the modern world, and the courts will have to do the same.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_360">The hon. Member for Basingstoke said that some 40 per cent. of non-resident parents lose contact with their children within two years of separation. I have heard that figure before, but I am not sure of its provenance. I hope that the hon. Lady will be able to let me know, perhaps during the Committee stage. However, the omnibus survey by the Office for National Statistics suggests that about three quarters of non-resident parents who have been separated for between two and three years have contact with their children at least once a week, and that fewer than 10 per cent. of them have no contact at all. In respect of longer separations, the survey suggests that about 20 per cent. of children have no contact with a non-resident parent 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 494</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>after two years. That is still far too many, but it is fewer than the hon. Lady suggested, and we might have to return to the matter in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_361">I am glad that hon. Members on all sides of the House mentioned the positive role played by grandparents and other members of the extended family. I agree completely with that, and note that the Bill can apply not only to resident or non-resident parents but to grandparents as well. It is not restricted to parents, so I hope that it will assist in all of these matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_362">The question of resources for CAFCASS and the courts was raised. I can understand that, but the Government have always made it clear that they should have adequate funding so that they can fulfil their responsibilities under part 1 of the Bill. My right hon. Friend the former Minister for Children, who is now Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform, said as much in evidence to the Joint Committee. She stressed that the Bill&#039;s provisions will be implemented only when we are satisfied that appropriate resources are available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_363">My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) and the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) both spoke about how the work loads of the family courts and of CAFCASS could be reduced. We have high hopes that the Bill will enable us to shift resources from too much reporting writing to more proactive and helpful interventions. I know that CAFCASS is very committed to ensuring that that happens.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-30_para12">
<a name="stpa_364">The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) was extremely ingenious in managing to talk about public law and domestic adoption in connection with a Bill that deals with private law and inter-country adoption. I congratulate him on that, and I am, of course, aware of the case that he raised. I would take an extremely dim view if any local authority sought to remove children from parents simply because they were learning disabled. Some of the legislation for which I had the honour to be responsible in the previous Parliament will come into force in December, and make it even more difficult for public authorities to behave in that way than is currently the case. There is an increased awareness of these matters, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will continue the campaigns on behalf of his constituents for which he is known.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-30_para13">
<a name="stpa_365">In conclusion, it is clear that we will have a lot more to say in Committee. We might even have a little more time in which to say it, given the accidental error in the programme motion that meant that only four sittings were originally provided for. I look forward to that discussion, as I believe that hon. Members of all parties have a genuine interest in making things better for the children of divorcing and separating couples.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-30_para14">
<a name="stpa_366">That is certainly true of the Government. If every child in this country is to matter, we must make sure that those whose families separate do not suffer the consequences&#151;that is, lack of development and self-esteem, and an inability to do their very best in future life. We are all in favour of that, and I commend the Bill to the House.

<p><a name="st_240"><a name="60302-31_spnew1"><b> Mr. Edward Vaizey  (Wantage) (Con):</b> 
 I am extremely grateful for the opportunity this evening to debate the important subject of child psychiatry; indeed, to continue the theme of this afternoon and talk about services for children. I begin by making a few general remarks about mental health in this country. It is a matter of common agreement that mental health services are often seen as the Cinderella of the health service. It always seems to me that mental health services are last in the queue for funding and first in line for cuts. It is particularly difficult because in recent years we have grown to understand more and more about mental health issues and problems. In this country, for example, it is now known that up to 10 per cent. of young people between the ages of five and 16 experience significant mental health problems such as depression, self-harm, obsessional disorder, anorexia or anxiety. What is less well known perhaps is that 40 per cent. of those children have no contact at all with any kind of mental health service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_371">In fact in <i>The Independent</i> today an article on this very subject highlights the problem. It points out that children with mental health problems are being put at severe risk by long waiting lists to see a psychiatrist. It claims that there is now an average wait of six months and increasing reliance on inappropriate drug treatment. Adrian Worrall, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, is quoted as saying:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59">&quot;All too often, children are not being picked up, are not receiving fast access to treatment or appropriate treatment when they do get it. This will have long-term consequences for everyone.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_372">The article quotes a survey of 1,300 GPs by the medical magazine <i>Pulse</i> which found that the average wait for a child psychiatrist appointment was 188 days. Children have to wait 79 days before an initial assessment is made by the child and adolescent mental health service, and a further 102 days before they receive treatment. Some 93 per cent of family doctors&#151;in effect, almost all GPs&#151;admit that they prescribe antidepressants to children because of a lack of alternative therapies, despite safety concerns surrounding the use of drug treatments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_373">The article concluded with a quote from the editor of <i>Pulse</i>, Phil Johnson. He says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60">&quot;It is a scandal that some of the most vulnerable patients in the country are left languishing on waiting lists because apparently mental health is not seen as a priority.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_374">That sets the general scene of mental health services for children and young people, but I want to concentrate this evening on a specific aspect of that care&#151;that is, care for children, and even more specifically, in-patient care for these children. I should stress that I am talking about children, not adolescents, for whom care can often be very different. Many of the children about whom I will talk have specialist and complex needs. Some have neuro-psychiatric disorders that do not respond to out-patient treatment and most of them come from families that need a huge amount of support. Apart from the simple humanitarian need to give those children the best possible care at the earliest possible 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 498</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>stage, it is clear that children left untreated continue to have a poor quality of life into adolescence and adulthood and sometimes cause wider problems in society.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_375">In-patient treatment for children can have a spectacularly beneficial effect. The children and young persons in-patient evaluation study, commissioned by the Department of Health and published in 2004, showed that substantial improvements could be achieved in the mental health of children admitted to in-patient child psychiatry services. The study made it clear that the subsequent needs of children who had benefited from in-patient treatment were reduced, to the extent that they could usually be treated in a child and adolescent mental health&#151;CAMHS&#151;community tier 3 service. Further, the improvements in those children were sustained one year after in-patient admission, often with very little further community service provision. So there is little doubt that in-patient services are vital for the small numbers of children who require complex treatment. I have been told by practitioners, especially in child law, that they have seen remarkable results from such in-patient units, including swift turnarounds and remarkable outcomes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_376">Despite that evidence, the availability of in-patient child psychiatric services seems suddenly to be in precipitate decline. In 2001, the national in-patient child and adolescent psychiatry study showed that in 1999 there were 103 beds in 12 children&#039;s units and 46 beds in five general CAMHS units. In 2003, there had been a slight increase to 110 beds. But since then, four children&#039;s in-patient services have closed. Shirle Hill in Sheffield no longer provides in-patient care. Stepping Stones in Sutton, Surrey, has closed completely. Larchwood in Haywards Heath now has only two beds as part of an adolescent ward, and an outreach service. Red Oak in Lancaster has closed with a loss of 12 beds, but it may reopen in 2007 although only as an adolescent unit for 12 to 17-year-olds. A bed recount is underway and it is likely to show a reduction in beds to levels substantially below the 1999 figure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_377">Those closures are bad enough, but three more in-patient services are under imminent&#151;I stress the word imminent&#151;threat of closure, including the Park hospital in Oxford; the ward in Birmingham children&#039;s hospital; and the West End children&#039;s unit in Hull, which currently runs only a skeleton service anyway. If those services close, it will mean a dramatic reduction of about a third in the number of units specialising in that work for children and their families.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_378">This evening, I want to concentrate on one unit in particular which serves my constituents in Oxfordshire and acts a case study of what is happening across the country. The Park hospital in Oxford has provided in-patient care for children for some 50 years. It provides a general service with a strong neuro-psychiatric leaning and highly valued national epilepsy services, based on skills that have been built up over many years. Child psychiatry is a highly specialised area of clinical practice. The closure of the Park is not simply the closure of a hospital&#151;although that would be bad enough&#151;but also risks severely damaging, and probably losing altogether, one of Britain&#039;s leading centres for training, research and treatment of child psychiatric disorders.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Mar 2006 : Column 499</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_379">What makes the threat of closure even harder to understand is that the child psychiatry service in Oxford and nationally is set to be enhanced by the provision of a specialist scanner, at a cost of some &#163;2.7 million, at the Warneford Hospital in Headington. Its major clinical use will be the investigation of complex epilepsy and the pre-surgical investigation of patients with intractable seizures. Together with the new in-patient facilities that have been promised for so many years, it would have provided the country with an important world-class resource for the management of children with complex interactions between behaviour and epilepsy.

<a name="stpa_380">As I said, in-patient child psychiatry is not a service that can be seen merely as an add-on; it cannot suddenly be set up at short notice. It takes years and years to build up the highly specialised expertise that exists at the Park, which must be preserved at all costs. For example, higher specialist training in child psychiatry requires at least six months&#039; full-time experience working in a children&#039;s in-patient service, often with a year&#039;s follow-up specialist training. There are already unfilled consultant posts across the UK, so the closure of the Park would further reduce training for doctors and other mental health professionals. The possible closure of the Park, which is being carried with little consultation&#151;as anyone in the House would understand it&#151;highlights general concerns about the resourcing of child psychiatric services nationwide.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_381">First, it is clear to me that the reason behind the potential closure is undoubtedly financial, although it is being dressed up as a clinical decision. The local mental health trust says that it is inappropriate these days to admit children to hospital, although there is no clinical evidence for that claim. Indeed, I have already mentioned a study that shows that that is not the case. Of course, specialist clinicians will do all they can to avoid admitting children to hospital but in some cases it is unavoidable and is clearly beneficial.

 I am sure that my hon. Friend shares the concern of many of us that if the Park closed, there would be no children&#039;s in-patient service in a triangle bounded by London, Manchester and Dublin. The consequence would be that children admitted to hospital would have to travel huge distances, which would have a clinical impact on their treatment.
</p>





<p><a name="st_242"><a name="60302-32_spnew1"><b> Mr. Vaizey: </b> 
 I absolutely share my hon. Friend&#039;s concern. It is incredibly important that families can visit their very young children when they are in unfamiliar surroundings. The more units that close&#151;especially if we lose the Park&#151;the longer the distances that families will have to travel and the more time that they will have to spend apart, which will have a further devastating impact.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_382">It is said that low bed occupancy at the Park illustrates the point that fewer children are being admitted to hospital as part of clinical practice. However, I submit that low occupancy rates are a symptom not of a clinical decision but of contractual complexity. It is well known that many specialist services across the country would like to make use of the Park and Oxford&#039;s facilities, but&#151;as I understand it&#151;the trust has not pursued those case-by-case contracts.

<a name="60302-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_383">The dilemma faced by the Park is a clear example of how local commissioning falls down. The Park is a national as well as a local service, yet it is suffering the severe side-effects of the local financial crisis that affects Oxfordshire&#039;s health services across the board. For example, Oxfordshire&#039;s supporting people budget, which helps adults with learning difficulties lead independent lives, has been severely cut. The mental health trust faces cuts of &#163;1 million this year and a further &#163;5 million over the next five years. Nursing and psychiatric posts are being cut. The Barnes unit at the John Radcliffe hospital, which provides psychiatric services to those admitted to the accident and emergency department after a suicide attempt or self-harm, is also under threat of closure. Day services are being closed, including the Ridgeway day centre at Didcot in my constituency. Local financial pressures are leading to the potential closure of a national specialist service.

<a name="stpa_384">I have been in correspondence with the Department of Health about mental health and local health issues since July last year&#151;they were some of the first issues that crossed my desk after I was elected&#151;and I have been greeted throughout by the Department&#039;s mantra:

 What was just said was not meaningless verbiage&#151;it was a very important procedural point of the House&#151;but to return to the meaningless verbiage to which I was referring from the Department of Health, it is effectively passing the buck. Partly because I am currently a member of the armed forces parliamentary scheme and have recently been attached to the Royal Marines, the analogy occurred to me that allowing a local mental health trust to decide the fate of the Park would be a bit like asking Devon county council to decide the fate the Royal Marines.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_388">Although I believe in local commissioning and local accountability, at some point the Government must recognise where they have a national resource that must have national backing. For example, a local primary care trust will admit a child to an in-patient unit less than once a year on average. So why on earth would a local mental health trust be charged solely with the responsibility for the Park? When the local mental health trust writes that the trust

<a name="stpa_391">Again, I am not at all sure what that means. Certainly, the people whom I have been speaking to do not believe that the Park has been saved from closure. Certainly, the mental health community believes that the Park will close. Has there been a failure of communication or a failure of consultation? How long is the foreseeable future? Where will in-patient services be available? Until the recent crisis, the intention had always been to close the Park, but to reopen a new in-patient facility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_392">The Government seem to be refusing to take responsibility for a national service. That is why I have chosen to raise this subject at a national level, in the House this evening. Managers, removed from the clinical chalk face, push through changes&#151;or perhaps they are forced to push them through&#151;that the professionals counsel against, whether in respect of special needs education or specialist clinical services, such as child psychiatry.

<p>
<a name="60302-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_393">This, though, is not, and should not be, a matter for party politics. It is genuinely an issue of national concern, and if we do not act, it will be a matter of national shame. The Park, and other units, shine as beacons of national excellence throughout the world. Moreover, they shine as beacons of hope for many vulnerable and disadvantaged children and their families. With little notice and even less justification, those beacons are being snuffed out one by one.

<p>
<a name="60302-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_394">As my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) reminded the House, that will mean longer journey times for children and their families; more time spent apart; the inappropriate use of adolescent and even adult services for children; a greater cost to the community, because of the need to provide longer-term treatment; and the loss of a specialist service built up over many years.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey) on securing the debate. We have not had a chance to debate with each other before, but, through various channels, his reputation preceded him and this evening he has shown that that reputation is richly deserved.

<a name="stpa_396">The hon. Gentleman made a number of local points in the context of a broader national debate. This is a rare opportunity to debate child and adolescent mental health services, so I hope that the House will permit me to widen my remarks to the national picture before addressing the important local points. He singled out child psychiatric services, but we cannot consider that issue on its own; we must consider child and adolescent mental health services across the board. I pay tribute to the outstanding hard work of all staff who work in that area in the NHS and in other related services up and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>down the country. They provide important services, often under difficult conditions, to our children and young people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-32_para15">
<a name="stpa_397">The hon. Gentleman helpfully started with some facts and figures to set the context for the debate. He is right that last year the Office for National Statistics reported on the prevalence of mental disorders among five to 16-year-olds and found that one in 10 children had a clinically diagnosed mental disorder, 4 per cent. had an emotional disorder such as anxiety or depression, and 6 per cent. had a conduct disorder such as oppositional defiant disorder or hyperactivity. The prevalence in 2004 remained broadly unchanged from that found by the previous survey that was conducted in 1999.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-32_para16">
<a name="stpa_398">To address those needs, we need to make sure that we improve the life outcomes of children with mental health problems by ensuring that all patients who need it have access to a comprehensive child and adolescent mental health service, and not just to child psychiatric services. We attach enormous importance to this matter and the hon. Gentleman was not correct to say that we do not regard it as a priority. The Government have set themselves a public service agreement target with the Treasury for the Department of Health. The way in which we achieve that vision is extremely important and our way of doing so was set out in the children&#039;s national service framework, which was published in September 2004. Quite rightly, it was recognised around the world as a leading example of how such services can be specified for children. Full implementation of the principles set out in the national service framework will not happen overnight, which is why it was given a 10-year timetable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-32_para17">
<a name="stpa_399">Quite rightly, there has been, and continues to be, significant additional investment to ensure that the important targets attached to our CAMHS work can be delivered. In the three years up to and including the current financial year, &#163;300 million has been made available to the NHS and local authorities. Dedicated teams of CAMHS workers are advising commissioners up and down the country to help them to understand the best local strategies for improving services. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that aspects of those services have national significance and it is important that we recognise that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-32_para18">
<a name="stpa_400">All that activity is beginning to have an effect. We track our progress on CAMHS work through an annual mapping exercise. The latest results that we have relate to late 2004 and show encouraging signs of progress. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that there is an enormous amount still to do, but, between 2002 and 2004, the number of CAMHS staff&#151;both professional and non-professional&#151;increased by 20 per cent. The number of cases dealt with increased by 30 per cent. One of the biggest worries is the length of the wait before seeing a specialist, but, here too, the CAMHS mapping work shows that there is cause for optimism. In 2002, only 24 per cent. of new cases were seen in four weeks; by 2004, that figure had risen to 50 per cent. As the hon. Gentleman says, there is an enormous amount still to do, but the direction of travel is encouraging. Similarly, the number of cases waiting for more than 13 weeks has reduced from a little more than 50 per cent. and is now down to just over 30 per cent. Again, there is an enormous amount to do but there are some encouraging signs of progress.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-32_para19">
<a name="stpa_401">The debate is about the future rather than the past. There are important elements that we need to get right if we are to make serious progress on this agenda, and I want to highlight them. The first is our ability in every part of the country to provide access to 24-hour services to meet urgent needs. I am pleased to say that emergency coverage of this sort is now available in 80 per cent. of primary care trusts. It has increased from about 57 per cent. in 2003.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-32_para20">
<a name="stpa_402">The second area is the provision of CAMH services to people who have a learning disability. It has been of some interest to many right hon. and hon. Members. The availability of this type of service has increased from about a third in 2003 to more than 50 per cent. of PCTs now. The third area is the provision of CAMH services to 16 and 17-year-olds. I know that the hon. Gentleman centred the debate not on adolescents but on children, but that is an important area because as young people reach maturity and independence at different ages, CAMH services should be structured to take account of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-32_para21">
<a name="stpa_403">Young people may wish to decide whether their care is managed within CAMHS or within adult mental health services. We think that it is important that CAMHS should be available for young people up to and including the age of 17. In 2003, half of local services were able so to deliver. The figure has now increased to three quarters. There are signs of progress although there are a number of important hurdles that we still need to leap over, as it were.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-32_para22">
<a name="stpa_404">The first issue is that of staffing. It is an important part of the set of challenges that the hon. Gentleman has outlined. There is some good news to report in that the number of consultant child psychiatrists working in hospitals has increased from about 390 in 1997 by nearly 25 per cent. to nearly 500 in 2004. That is the last year for which figures are available. The rate of progress on staffing appears to be accelerating not only in the case of child psychiatrists but in other staff sectors as well. For example, in England the total number of staff employed in CAMHS teams in 2004 was nearly 9,000. That is up by 15 per cent. compared with the previous year. That is quite a rate of growth in the space of a year, given how long many of these professionals need to spend in training.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-32_para23">
<a name="stpa_405">Over the same year, the number of clinical child psychologists increased from nearly 1,000 by nearly a third to 1,320. Over the same period, the number of CAMHS nurses increased from 2,000 to nearly 2,500. That is quite a rate of growth in such a short period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-32_para24">
<a name="stpa_406">The second big hurdle that we need to confront lies with the criminal justice system. We are tackling the mental health provision that is available to young people in contact with the CJS. That is a considerable issue for children in the CJS. Services that are now available include mental health screening for young people in court. There are joint appointments between CAMHS and youth offending teams&#151;dedicated teams&#151;that are providing in-reach to secure units and young offender institutions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-32_para25">
<a name="stpa_407">Our basic principle on this aspect of CAMHS is that a child or young person who is in contact with the CJS, whether they are in custody or in the community, should have the same sort of access to the comprehensive service as any other child or young person within the general population.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-32_para26">
<a name="stpa_408">The third issue is that of adult psychiatric wards, a subject that has been of some interest to right hon. and hon. Members. The national service framework recognised that, for the majority of 16 and 17-year-olds for whom admission becomes necessary, admission to a young people&#039;s unit is the appropriate and preferred option. For some young people who are living away from the family home, or those with certain types of clinical need, an adult facility may be more appropriate. Our plans to increase CAMHS provision will reduce the incidence of placing children and young people inappropriately. As a contingency measure, NHS trusts should identify wards or settings in adult units that would be appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302-32_para27">
<a name="stpa_409">The issues raised by the hon. Gentleman related to his local facility of the Park hospital. I know that there have been provisional plans to close in-patient facilities there. I am advised by officials that the Park building has been deemed inappropriate for in-patient over-night care of young children. There has always been, and continues to be, an intention to develop new facilities to provide appropriate modern community and extended day services for children with a mental health problem to help the hon. Gentleman&#039;s local health community to achieve the ambitions set out in the national service framework. It is worth underlining the fact that that framework is not optional for the national health service&#151;it is mandatory. It is spread over an extended time horizon, because of the scale of the ambition that it expresses. I understand that, because of concerns that have been voiced locally, not least by the hon. Gentleman, the plans are being further considered. I do not have a precise update on those considerations but, once I do, I would be more than happy to write to him with full information.

 In many services, it is inappropriate for local facilities to be funded exclusively by local sources.
