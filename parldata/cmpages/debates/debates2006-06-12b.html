Pathways to work, as it is at present, will successfully address that issue. Conditioned management support is one way through the issue, but we stand ready to work with the private and voluntary sectors, and other parts of the public sector, to make sure that the reforms are a success for people with mental illness.</p>

 In the two decades prior to 1997 the number of children living in poverty in the United Kingdom more than doubled.

 There were a great many points in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question, but I shall respond to one or two. He said that national insurance numbers were issued willy-nilly: that is simply not the case. If our officials are aware of false documentation, national insurance numbers are not issued. He should bear in mind the fact that 20,000 applications for national insurance numbers were declined last year. The powers to which he referred in his long question are more robust following our implementation of Grabiner&#146;s recommendations, as there is now a four-stage process, which did not exist under the previous Administration. For third-country nationals, the first stage covers telephone discussion; the second stage establishes residency; the third stage involves a face-to-face interview for identity purposes; and the fourth stage involves additional evidence. An applicant may be required to submit up to 20 documents as proof of their identity.</p>

 That is the key group at which the reforms are aimed. They will be helped especially by the reduction in the number of qualifying years to 30.

The level of loss in jobseeker&#146;s allowance to fraud in 1997 was &#163;300 million; last year, it was &#163;50 million.

 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend&#151;the Scottish Parliament&#146;s Public Petitions Committee has been widely praised by people from all parties and those of no party.

However, is there not a disjunction between what people are thinking at a certain time and want to put before Parliament, what Members want to put before Parliament, and what gets on to the Order Paper? Is there not a case not only for a petitions committee, but for finding a proper way to consider early day-motions signed by a great number of Members?

 I certainly have no doubt that there is a disjuncture between what Liberal Democrat MPs may be doing and what the public think, and we are keen to find a mechanism that takes account of the public filling in petitions. I am keen to look at solutions to the issues that have been raised by us and in some of the reports that I have mentioned, such as the increased volume of petitions, as compared with those in the devolved Parliament in Scotland, and so on. I am sure that those obstacles can be overcome and I believe that we are at least united in wanting to ensure that the public have a better mechanism for being able to participate in discussions in the House.

never thought that I would stand here and say it, I think that we can learn something from the Scottish Parliament in relation to a petitions committee. However, there is a real difference between what the many thousands of people, who often sign petitions and who work hard to get signatures on petitions, feel will happen as a result of bringing their views to the House and to the Government, and the way in which those petitions are handled. We need to find a way in which people&#146;s views are taken more seriously by the Government and the House when they have gone to all that effort.</p>

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="60612-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0606123000185">The Bill will reform the criminal law on fraud and dishonestly obtaining services. It applies to England and Wales and to Northern Ireland; Scotland has different provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="60612-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0606123000186">We know that fraud has a massive impact on the United Kingdom economy. It is difficult to give precise figures, because fraud is by nature secretive, but in 2000 National Economic Research Associates estimated that it cost the UK economy &#163;14 billion. In 2004, Norwich Union suggested that the cost had risen to more than &#163;16 billion. Despite the public perception that most fraud is a victimless crime, the reality is that it hits most of us. We all pay higher prices for security systems, banking services, credit and goods, and of course we also pay higher premiums for insurance. If the Norwich Union estimate is right, fraud is costing each household more than &#163;650 a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="60612-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0606123000187">Tackling fraud and the provisions of the Bill are therefore important to everyone. The Government&#146;s strategy for tackling fraud has three aims. The first is to get the law right, and is the reason for the Bill. The second is to improve the investigation of fraud by the police and other agencies. The third is to ensure that the courts deal expeditiously and effectively with fraudsters. The investigation of fraud is being considered by the fraud review that the Attorney-General is currently leading, and which is expected to report soon. I shall return to that later. We have also agreed to deal with the issue of trials, particularly the contentious question of non-jury trials, in another Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="60612-0004.htm_para6"><a name="0606123000188">This Bill was the subject of a great deal of discussion in another place. By the end there was broad all-party support for most of its provisions, although I am sure that Opposition Members will want to test the detail in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="60612-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0606123000189">Strange as it may seem, no general offence of fraud exists today. When lawyers talk of fraud, we refer collectively to a wide and complex array of deception and theft offences. The Theft Acts and the common law, compiled somewhat haphazardly, have the task of encompassing the wide range of fraudulent conduct.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="60612-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0606123000190">In 1998, the Government asked the Law Commission to review this area of law. The commission conducted a lengthy and painstaking review, for which we thank it, producing a report in July 2002. Unsurprisingly, it concluded that the existing law on fraud was deficient and proposed changes, most of which found their way into the Bill. It identified certain key problems. First, the deception offences in the Theft Acts tend to be specific and narrow, which makes them vulnerable to technical assaults. Defence lawyers are often able to argue that a particular  <br>

behaviour fell just outside the definition of the offence with which the defendant was charged, or that the defendant was charged with the wrong kind of deception and so ought to be acquitted. Defendants may indeed face the wrong charge or too many charges, and indictments may be excessively complex because of charges relating to various alternative counts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="60612-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0606123000191">Secondly, deception is an essential ingredient of the offence. That requires a victim to be deceived. However, a shop assistant who accepts a card for payment may be indifferent about whether the cardholder has authority to use the card as long as the payment goes through. Machines and computers have generated new problems. For example, a ticket machine has no mind of its own: can it be deceived? What of problems such as internet phishing? The more we use machines to obtain goods and services, the greater such problems are likely to become. So far the old laws are coping with those developments, but the signs of stress are beginning to show.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="60612-0004.htm_para10"><a name="0606123000192">The Law Commission rightly took the view that it was unrealistic merely to plug the loopholes in the deception laws, or to try to create a new collection of specific new deception offences, as such piecemeal reform would produce even more complexity. Instead, the commission recommended a new general offence of fraud that would make the law more comprehensible to juries, would be fairer to defendants by making the law more straightforward, and would encompass fraud in its many unpredictable forms. In proposing that change, the Law Commission made two specific recommendations in relation to the law. First, the focus should be on dishonesty rather than on deception. Secondly, proof of gain should no longer be essential to proving the crime: it should be enough that the offender intends to make a gain for himself, to cause a loss to another, or to expose another to a risk of loss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="60612-0004.htm_para11"><a name="0606123000193">The Bill creates the general offence of fraud in clause 1. It will replace provisions in our law that are in daily use in the courts. It is important that we get those changes right. That is why, in 2004, after the Law Commission's report, the Government decided to carry out a further consultation on the proposals. The consultations showed wide support for the proposal for a new general offence. Most stakeholders agreed that it would be right to focus the crime on the dishonest behaviour of the defendant, rather than the deception of the victim. Most also agreed that the Law Commission was right to reject the idea of a very broad offence of dishonesty, which risked being too uncertain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="60612-0004.htm_para12"><a name="0606123000194">The general offence in clause 1 requires not only dishonesty and the intention of making a gain or causing a loss, but one of three other elements, which must be met before the crime can be charged. The three elements are: fraud by false representation, fraud by failure to disclose information, or fraud by abuse of position. Let me briefly describe each of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="60612-0004.htm_para13"><a name="0606123000195">Fraud by false representation is set out in clause 2. The extra element is that the offender makes a false representation knowing that it is, or might be, false or misleading. The types of representation covered may be of fact or law, including making a representation as to a person's state of mind. There is no restriction on whether it is written, spoken or in non-verbal communication. The representations can be implied or  <br>

expressed in any form. For example, it can be done by entering a stolen chip or PIN into a machine or by internet phishing, where someone puts a letterhead on an email suggesting it has come from a bank in order to elicit a victim&#146;s financial details.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="60612-0004.htm_para14"><a name="0606123000196">Under the second limb of the offence, fraud by failing to disclose information, the extra element is that the offender fails to disclose information that he has a legal duty to disclose. There were some differences of view on that proposal between the Law Commission and others. The commission&#146;s report proposed covering circumstances where there was no legal duty to disclose but where one person trusted the other to disclose&#151;where there was some kind of moral responsibility, for want of a better phrase&#151;but in the Government's consultation, although there was widespread welcome for that limb of the general offence, the issue of going beyond a legal duty was questioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="60612-0004.htm_para15"><a name="0606123000197">Some&#151;for example, the Association of Chief Police Officers fraud working group&#151;said that it would create uncertainty in the law. I can see their point. For example, how many of the minor defects of a second-hand car would a seller be trusted to disclose? The Government listened with care to those concerns and responded by restricting the offence to legal duties only&#151;a position supported by the Rose committee, comprising members of the senior judiciary set up to ensure that legislative proposals are as well formulated as possible and can work in practice.</p>

 The incidence of credit card fraud, not merely by customers against retailers but often the other way around, is a significant problem, of which I confess I was briefly the victim in South Africa last year. Will the hon. and learned Gentleman tell the House something about the penalties proposed in the clauses and specifically how they compare with existing penalties? Is he prepared, alongside custodial sentences, to consider stiff community penalties and possibly the use of restorative justice?</p>

 We certainly need to look at the full range of penalties. Crime involving fraud, particularly cheque card fraud and other credit card fraud, varies in terms of extent. It can be a massive fraud that merits a high penalty. Indeed, the maximum penalty under the Bill is 10 years&#146; imprisonment. A community penalty and restorative justice may be appropriate if the amount involved were limited, the defendant had a limited record, or none at all. In those circumstances, we could look at various forms of restorative justice, particularly if the defendant were younger. I think that it is about achieving proportionality and ensuring that the appropriate sentence is delivered for the offence that was committed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="60612-0004.htm_para16"><a name="0606123000200">The third limb of the offence&#151;fraud by abuse of position&#151;is set out in clause 4. Here, the additional element is abusing a position of responsibility to commit a fraud. It applies in situations where the defendant has been put in a privileged position and by virtue of that position is expected to safeguard another's financial interests, or at least not to act against those interests.</p>

 We need to ensure that we have a view about how a relationship is created. It can be created in various ways, such as by contract, through various relationships or by a legal obligation. It is clear that, as long as there is a basis for ensuring that a person has a fiduciary duty to another person, there is the potential for such a charge to be made. But in prosecuting any such case, it will of course be necessary for the prosecutor to ensure that he identifies the way in which the circumstances had developed, and whether a fiduciary duty had indeed existed.

 I do not think that that would arise under this limb of the offence, but it would depend on the circumstances and the relationship between the friends. If they are dealing as equals, it would be a straightforward contractual relationship. Under this limb, for there to be an abuse of position, it is required that a particular duty is owed by the individual, over and above that which people have when they enter into a normal contract to purchase property, or anything else.</p>

However, again after considering the arguments put forward during the consultation in 2004, the Government decided not make secrecy an essential part of the offence. We took that view because secrecy is difficult to define and would represent an unnecessary complication, which could lead to technical arguments in court.

 It is certainly right that some of the developments in the global economy that have so benefited our economy have also benefited a lot of fraudsters, who operate in Europe and globally. We now see frauds committed by a group on one continent against victims on another, especially by use of the internet. We are now developing relationships between the various prosecutors and Governments to build up new mechanisms, such as the one that my hon. Friend described, that will enable law enforcement agencies to keep abreast of the changes that the global economy is bringing.

It will replace section 1 of the Theft Act 1978 and will fill a gap in the existing law.

 We are responding to the broader consultation that took place and the work done by the Law Commission.

Consideration is always given to whether penalties are adequate, and we took the view that in all the circumstances they were adequate in this case. It is always possible to increase sentences, but it is necessary to look at the circumstances that the offence would contain and to determine the appropriate maximum penalty, in the knowledge that the maximum penalty is rarely imposed. None the less, the provision gives the court an indication of the relative seriousness with which Parliament regards various offences. We have taken the view that five years on indictment is the appropriate maximum, but in due course we can consider in Committee whether a higher sentence is more appropriate, and I shall be happy to discuss that point with the hon.

Some of those items are downloaded from countries a long way away, so whatever our law, it is sometimes difficult for people, artists or companies to protect their copyright. That has been a long-term issue, and is better dealt with not so much through the criminal law, which is obviously related to a particular jurisdiction, but through international agreements. When I had ministerial responsibility for dealing with issues relating to internet fraud, I helped to negotiate agreements with Japan and a number of other countries so that we could begin to make the international agreements that would provide a basis for trying to protect some of the copyrights and international artistic licences that need protection.

The clause therefore introduces a new offence of possessing articles for use in, or in connection with, the commission or the facilitation of a fraud. It draws on the current offence in section 25 of the Theft Act 1968. Under that section an offence is committed when a person has with him, when not in his place of abode, any article for use in the course of, or in connection with, any burglary, theft or cheat.</p>

 Some commentators have referred to the fact that there is an absence of any mens rea element in this part of the Bill. The Solicitor-General has already referred to the &#147;going equipped&#148; part of the provision. I am concerned that a person could be in possession of an article that was for use in the course or in connection with a fraud, without knowing that that article would be for use in connection with the fraud. That is dangerous. Although I understand the reasoning for updating the law, which is very important, I think that it would have been preferable to put in the Bill a clear mens rea element.</p>

 I suggest that the problem may go further, particularly with regard to clause 7. If one were a member of the Magic Circle, with all the impedimenta for deceiving people, and one were going through the streets or even in one&#146;s own home, one might frequently be making an article that could be used or adapted in a connection with fraud. I suspect that that is one of the reasons why the original cheating provisions were so tightly drawn. That is something else that we may be able to examine during the passage of the Bill. I am sure that it is not the Government&#146;s intention to make it impossible for conjurors to perform their trade.</p>

 May I make it clear that clause 6 does not go too wide, in my view? It does not introduce a strict liability offence in any way. Its wording draws on the wording of section 25 of the 1968 Act in order to attract the case law that goes with that section&#151;notably the case of Ellames, which is referred to in the explanatory notes and which established that the prosecution have to prove a general intention that the article will be used by the possessor, or by someone else, for a fraudulent purpose.

 There is a distinction. Under the present law of going equipped, if a person were out at night with a jemmy and various other tools, as an initial starting point it would be fairly obvious from the nature of those tools that he was up to no good. The distinction is that an article that could be used in connection with fraud might look perfectly innocent to a person such as me, who is not high-tech, or whatever the word is. Without knowing it, I could have something on my computer that might be used in connection with fraud. If I walked down the street with a jemmy, clearly that would be a different thing altogether.</p>

 Again, the hon. Gentleman seems to suggest that this is a strict liability offence, but it is not. If he were in possession of something that he ought not to be, but did not know and did not have any intention, he would be able to put forward a defence. That is right and proper. Nobody intends to catch people who are not acting inappropriately or in a way that goes outside the provisions set out in the case of Ellames. No doubt this is the sort of issue that we can discuss at some length in Committee.

custodial sentence of 10 years serves as a strong deterrent to criminals who prosper from an industry based on fraud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="60612-0005.htm_para9"><a name="0606123000242">Clause 9 implements a recommendation made by the Law Commission in 2002 in a separate report on multiple offending. The commission recommended that, as the existing offence of fraudulent trading under companies legislation applies only to companies, it should be &#147;extended to non-corporate traders&#148;&#151;for example partnerships, sole traders, trusts or companies incorporated abroad. Fraudulent trading is an activity offence, and carries procedural and evidential advantages because it is not limited to specific fraudulent transactions. The proposal was widely welcomed in the Government&#146;s consultation of 2004. The new clause 9 offence, together with section 458 of the Companies Act 1985, will carry a maximum sentence of 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="60612-0005.htm_para10"><a name="0606123000243">Let me now turn to the one area of the Law Commission&#146;s proposals that elicited opposition when the Government consulted stakeholders. The Law Commission proposed the repeal of the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud. Opposition to that proposal has come not only from law enforcers and the judiciary, through the senior judges on the Rose committee, but from many others, including the Fraud Advisory Panel, the Confederation of British Industry and the Law Society. The Government took account of those considerable objections, so the Bill does not include that repeal, although we will review the position three years after its implementation. We accepted the arguments for the retention for the time being of the common law offence, based on the need to provide a seamless transition between the current situation, in which there is heavy reliance on the offence, to compensate for defects in the statutory law, and the stage when its abolition can be safely contemplated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="60612-0005.htm_para11"><a name="0606123000244">The common law offence of &#147;conspiracy to defraud&#148; is flexible. It is of use in frauds that involve a number of conspirators and hundreds of offences. If each item were charged, the indictment would be lengthy and extremely complex. Conspiracy to defraud allows a charge that covers the agreement to carry out the crime. There are limitations, too, on the application of statutory conspiracy, and the common law offence can be used in situations where statutory conspiracy cannot be used&#151;for example, when the final offence is carried out by someone outside the conspiracy. Overall, the new offences go a long way towards filling many gaps in the law. However, we are concerned about a number of issues, and we should ensure that the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud remains in place, at least for the meantime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="60612-0005.htm_para12"><a name="0606123000245">The Law Commission will shortly publish a report on assisting and encouraging crime. Any reform of the law on conspiracy to defraud or of other laws that flows from that work should be taken into account. We intend to consider the report, all the circumstances and the way in which conspiracy to defraud has been used, then make a decision, which will be informed by our operational experience, not only from the Bill once it is in force, but from the multiple offending provisions in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004.

courts to deal appropriately with fraudsters who are responsible for scams involving hundreds of victims. The Home Office will review the operation of the Bill three years after its implementation, and it will focus on conspiracy to defraud. We have put in hand measures to collect the information for the review from all Crown prosecutors so that we have a clearer picture of the way in which the common law is used after the new law is implemented.</p>

I want them to look at the ways in which they use conspiracy to defraud to ensure that it is used appropriately, and to set out their reasons for using it in particular cases so that we can make a more effective assessment in three years&#146; time. That will provide information on which to base a decision about whether the common law offence can be repealed. In the meantime, the Attorney-General&#146;s guidance to prosecutors on the use of the common law offence will prove instrumental. It will state what information must be collected from the outset to inform the review, as well as setting out the circumstances in which the use of the common law might, or might not, be justified.</p>

 The conspiracy to defraud has proved useful to prosecutors in several ways. For example, it can be used to reduce the number of charges that would otherwise be brought. It can be used, too, if the substantive offences are steps to achieve a wider dishonest objective, such as swindling a large number of people. It should not be used where, for example, statutory conspiracy is more appropriate. There are circumstances in which the conspiracy has involved certain individuals who carried out the steps preparatory to the offence, but the substantive offence was committed by somebody outside the circle involved in the conspiracy. There are a number of examples where prosecutors have been able to prosecute people who clearly had a dishonest intent and who were clearly carrying out acts preparatory to a fraud, but who were not involved in the final substantive act. Such cases are extremely useful to the prosecutors.</p>

However, since even Ministers do not claim infallibility, we cannot be sure that we can create a set of legal provisions encompassing all the areas currently covered by conspiracy to defraud. We therefore need to await the outcome of events and see how the Bill operates in practice. If we do not need conspiracy to defraud to capture those who are committing serious frauds, our preference would be to repeal that provision in due course. But if we still find a series of examples in which we need to use conspiracy to defraud, we will have to consider whether we can repeal the provision, or whether we should consider alternative tightening provisions.</p>

 Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that when people are charged with criminal offences, it is important to make it as clear as possible in the charge what the offence is? One of the difficulties with the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud is that it is too general a provision. We should always try to ensure that offences are as particularised as possible. That is why the common law offence ought to be repealed as soon as possible.</p>

 If we can repeal the offence, our preference would be to do so, but we want to ensure that we deal with the issues of fraud, so that is not appropriate at present. The prosecuting authorities and the judges took the view that we need to approach the matter with caution. The Rose committee, whose opinion is highly valued, did not consider it appropriate to repeal the offence at this stage. In principle, though, I have sympathy with the point raised by my hon.

We should not overrate the capacity of the criminal law alone to solve this or any other problem. The Bill is only one of a number of measures in hand to combat fraud. Among those measures, we have provided considerable resources for the Serious Fraud Office and the City of London police to tackle fraud, including &#163;1.08 million this year, which has been matched by the City of London. That has gone to the City of London police. We have also set up the Serious Organised Crime Agency, which is a new force in tackling and defeating serious organised crime.</p>

 I congratulate the Solicitor-General on having secured that rarest of things for a Law Officer&#151;an outing at the Dispatch Box on Second Reading. I note that the interest of the House has not been wholly seized by this matter, but the Bill is extremely important and I am grateful for the manner in which he introduced it. Furthermore, it is clear that the Bill was well thought through before its initial presentation and I make my remarks against that background.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="60612-0006.htm_para5"><a name="0606123000258">The Bill is an opportunity to simplify and strengthen the law in an important area. If we get it right, we will undoubtedly improve our ability to fight fraud in all its forms, and we wholly support the principle behind what the Government are trying to achieve. As with all technical Bills, this Bill has quite a long history. There is no doubt that the Law Commission&#146;s 2002 report was a document of great value. I would not want Second Reading to pass without expressing the Opposition&#146;s gratitude for the Law Commission&#146;s work, because the report was a model of its kind. I note that the Serious Fraud Office was extremely positive about the commission&#146;s proposals, stating that the suggested improvements would not only clarify offences of fraud, but simplify the law to allow more effective prosecutions, and I am sure that all hon. Members want to see exactly that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="60612-0006.htm_para6"><a name="0606123000259">I agree with the Solicitor-General that, although fraud sometimes sounds like an esoteric issue that affects others, that is not the case. The scale of the problem is considerable&#151;his estimate of &#163;14 billion appears well researched&#151;and everyone pays for it through extra credit card payments, if nothing else, so the burden falls upon the law-abiding, who provide the fruit of such dishonest activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="60612-0006.htm_para7"><a name="0606123000260">Fraud is extensively used to fuel wider criminal activity. The evidence from the National Criminal Intelligence Service shows that, unless we succeed in tackling fraud properly, there will be knock-on consequences in terms of wider criminality and, indeed, terrorism. In my career as a barrister, one fraud case that I did involved allegations of widespread benefit fraud that was being used to fuel the activities of the IRA. The fraud was taking place on a massive scale in south-east London with stolen benefit books and the case brought home to me how the eventual destination of such funds can be inimical to the public good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="60612-0006.htm_para8"><a name="0606123000261">There are clearly problems with the current law, which originates from a variety of sources, and I accept the Solicitor-General&#146;s comments on that matter. The Theft Act 1968 attempted to simplify matters on obtaining property by deception, but the patchwork of law is unsatisfactory and the multitude of overlapping but distinct statutory offences does not make it easy for the prosecutor to decide the counts on which to draft an indictment, whether there should be alternative counts and how best to present a case to a jury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="60612-0006.htm_para9"><a name="0606123000262">In my experience of being involved in fraud trials, an astonishing number have come unstuck in one form or another, long before they could be presented to a jury, simply because the prosecutor&#151;I hasten to add that I was defending in these particular cases&#151;had failed to understand the true nature of the fraud or, indeed, who the ultimate victims were. Although the evidence of  <br>

dishonesty was manifest, it was impossible to show that the people who were alleged to have been deceived had been deceived. In some cases, the wrong target altogether had been selected. In a case where it looked as though a building society had been the true victim, it became clear as the case proceeded that the true victim was almost certainly the taxman. Those examples classically illustrate some of the problems that arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="60612-0006.htm_para10"><a name="0606123000263">In those circumstances, there is a powerful argument for reform. The Bill sets out to achieve that in a form that seems to have considerable internal logic and coherence. The creation of a new single offence of fraud that can be committed in three ways appears to be eminently sensible. We will judge it and scrutinise it in Committee on the basis that it fulfils three requirements. First, it must overcome the complexity of the current law and make it more comprehensible to juries. One way of achieving that would be to make fraud indictments simpler and more self-explanatory. At first glance, the Bill seems to go a long way towards achieving that goal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="60612-0006.htm_para11"><a name="0606123000264">Secondly, the new offence must provide a genuinely useful tool for prosecutors. My Front-Bench colleagues in the other place have said that the current range of specific offences can lead to complicated decisions, so we will need assurances as the Bill goes through that a single offence will really help to focus investigations at an early stage and help prosecutors to get the charge right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="60612-0006.htm_para12"><a name="0606123000265">Thirdly, we will need to be satisfied&#151;we believe at first sight that we shall be&#151;that the new offence will be adaptable to the changing face of criminality in the 21st century. The Solicitor-General pointed out areas where new offences have been created to deal with new technology. We entirely welcome that. We will seek in Committee to ensure that it delivers what he believes that it will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="60612-0006.htm_para13"><a name="0606123000266">Let me, at the risk of repetition, raise one or two slight areas of concern. The Solicitor-General mentioned the continuation of the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud. He provided some reassurance in the form of a promise that the Government will not just let that issue drift off into sleep. I would be happier if we had greater reassurance, perhaps by means of a sunset clause to ensure that, unless the Government revisited the matter within three or five years, the power to bring a prosecution under common law for conspiracy to defraud would lapse. The arguments against keeping the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud are enormous. Throughout my career at the Bar, there have been numerous occasions on which that offence has come into disrepute when used. It is possible for a person to be convicted of such an offence if he conspired with another person, yet if he carried out the act on his own, it would not amount to an offence. That immediately introduces an element of concern for anybody who believes in civil liberties. Although I am mindful of the Solicitor-General&#146;s comments on the subject and appreciate that Governments have a tendency to caution, I am sorry that they have not been bolder, especially since the Law Commission stated emphatically that it perceived no good ground for the continuation of the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud. Indeed, the Government&#146;s report of November 2004 acknowledged that when it stated:</p>

multiple offences are affected by the fact that provisions in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, which the hon. Gentleman and I spent time debating, have not been implemented two years on.

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. Indeed, one problem, given the plethora of legislation that the Government introduce, is the astonishing length of time that it takes to bring into operation much of the legislation that we pass. I do not wish to get diverted down a side road, but I would say to the Solicitor-General that we will try at least to probe the Government in Committee as to how we might best proceed in this regard. I would feel uncomfortable if we were really saying that it was inevitable that such a blunt instrument as common law conspiracy to defraud should continue to be an offence for the foreseeable future. If that turned out to be necessary, we would have failed to legislate properly here. Minds need to be concentrated on that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="60612-0006.htm_para19"><a name="0606123000276">I would like to express my gratitude to the Government, because I had feared that there might be a major difference between us over the role of juries in fraud trials, but that issue has been parked to await other legislation. May I say to the Solicitor-General that the sensible thing to do would be to wait and see how well this legislation works? If it turns out greatly to have simplified the law on fraud, no more powerful an argument could be devised for persuading the Government to drop their idea of getting rid of juries in certain fraud trials in its entirety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="60612-0006.htm_para20"><a name="0606123000277">I have always taken the view that juries are perfectly capable of understanding fraud trials. Indeed, as I have pointed out to the Solicitor-General, in my experience, the cases that collapsed did so long before the jury had the opportunity to consider the issues. I remain concerned about the proposals on juries in fraud trials that the Government had floated, and that will doubtless be a subject for debate at another time. The Government appear to wish to move speedily towards implementing their proposals to restrict the use of juries in certain fraud trials, but it would be odd if they did so immediately after implementing new legislation that could go far towards reassuring them that fraud trials can be considerably simplified.</p>

We shall doubtless return to them in Committee, but I want to put them on the record today. Fraud by abuse of position is a concept that most right-thinking people have no difficulty in considering improper. However, the definition in the Bill of the position in which such fraud is committed is woolly. I am worried that we have developed a consistent pattern in recent years of passing legislation whose scope is uncertain in criminal justice terms. People behave reprehensibly at times in ways that other people would consider to be of poor moral standing. The hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) gave the good example of a friend not revealing to another the true worth of some chattel that he was selling off to a third party&#151;or to the friend  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="60612-0006.htm_para22"><a name="0606123000279">Clause 4 deals with fraud by abuse of position. However, unless we define exactly who is intended to be caught by the provision, quite a wide range of people&#151;including relatives, for example&#151;could fall into that category. I want effective legislation on the statute book and I believe that it is possible to sharpen this measure to make it clear who is intended to be caught by it. If we do not improve clause 4, the danger is that we will end up bringing prosecutions in circumstances in which people are surprised to learn that some special duty lies on them to protect another person from making a loss.</p>

The use of gadgetry that can potentially be used to defraud in order to entertain is a well-established practice, so I wonder what other safeguards could be provided to ensure sufficient mens rea in clauses 6 and 7 to avoid idiotic prosecutions of individuals who never had any intention of defrauding anyone. We shall look further into the detail of those clauses in Committee, as we will examine further the general issue in clause 2 of what constitutes gain or loss.</p>

They are simple straightforward frauds, but they nevertheless have sufficient complexity to merit having officers&#151;certainly police officers and, in my view, members of the Crown Prosecution Service&#151;working on them who have an understanding of the concepts and pitfalls. My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) made a fair point, but there are resource implications, so to that extent, I am sympathetic to the Solicitor-General and the problems that he faces.</p>

 Certainly, the fraud review led by the Attorney-General will examine some of those issues, particularly how the police have dealt with fraud&#151;mainly lower-level frauds that do not fall within the ambit of the Serious Fraud Office. I hope that, as a result of that review, we will see some improvements in the policing of fraud. Without wishing to widen our debate too much, I believe that the larger police forces will allow greater specialisation so that chief constables can identify the experts to focus on fraud cases.

 I speak in support of the Bill today. It looks to be a good Bill&#151;one that has had a very long gestation period, which reflects its complexity, rather than its size. It is one of the better Bills for me, as it is rather slim. It is a credit to all concerned in the consultation on and the production of the Bill that it has been drafted so concisely. The accompanying explanatory notes are well laid out and a great help to people like myself, a non-lawyer, in understanding the logic behind the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="60612-0007.htm_para3"><a name="0606123000297">Fraud is not a victimless crime; it is an insidious, indiscriminate crime that wreaks long-term damage on UK business, not only in cash terms but in undermining confidence in the institutions that are needed to trade and create wealth. It hits the pockets of individuals and creates misery for many families. It costs the people of our country dear, and I should like to extend the figure that my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General put on that: it is now approaching &#163;20 billion a year. It is a large business, and its proceeds keep organised crime funded. It also funds terrorist organisations&#151;the very groups that are pledged to bring down our way of life. So I welcome this approach to tackling those problems, but I remind my hon. and learned Friend that the Bill is only part of the solution: we cannot will the end without providing the means.</p>

Who do we envisage investigating alleged fraud? Will we ensure that all investigating police officers tasked with applying the law will be trained to understand it, able to contend with modern technology or have access to specialist support? Will they be properly supported by Crown Prosecution Service lawyers?</p>

legitimacy, and merely to recoup their losses by passing on the costs to all policyholders through increased premiums. The scale of the problem was highlighted by Norwich Union, which, in 2004, identified and prevented 15,000 insurance frauds. It estimated that 4,000 would have met the criminal level of burden of proof. Because it did not want to over-burden the police, it submitted just 41 of the most serious cases, in which there were possible links to organised crime and the evidence was overwhelmingly persuasive. Of those, 27 were taken up by the police, and 18 came to court and resulted in conviction. I applaud Norwich Union&#146;s attempt to tackle fraud, but until every organisation, bank and insurance company takes the same stand against organised crime and fraud, the costs of which are met through extra bank charges and premiums, it will not be tackled seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="60612-0007.htm_para7"><a name="0606123000301">Do the police have the resources to process all such cases? Do we seriously intend to use&#151;I look to the Solicitor-General to give an answer&#151;the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and to channel funds to the police for this activity, so that it becomes self-funded? Does he have any other ideas about finding resources?</p>

The Law Commission recommended that the conspiracy to defraud charge should be abolished, but then had concerns that limitations on scope meant that certain types of secondary participation and fraud might still only be caught by the common law charge. Will my hon. and learned Friend give some examples? I listened closely to what he said, but he knows that there is still concern. Alternatively, will he say that the Government do not know exactly what the situation might be but that it would be prudent to leave the provision in place, as a belt and braces approach, while they reassess the legislation as they intend to do?</p>

This is the man on the Clapham omnibus speaking, not the lawyer, as the general public will not take it kindly if we throw out old legislation and replace it with new legislation that contains a loophole.</p>

The first question is whether the defendant&#146;s behaviour would be regarded as dishonest by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people. If that is answered in the affirmative, the second question must be whether the defendant was aware that his conduct was dishonest and would be regarded as dishonest by reasonable and honest people.

An internet bank could be established in America and the proceeds could go to Belize, and when the bank folded it could be found that no crime had been committed because no section of jurisprudence covered the total area.

Capitalists make profit, if not through sheer exploitation of individuals through labour, then through exploitation of knowledge, skills and money. That is a legal activity; it only becomes illegal when dishonesty makes it a criminal fraud. But as I have said, dishonesty is a rather nebulous concept in law because there is no firm definition, only cases in relation to which definitions can be established. Until we can establish firmly what constitutes dishonesty, the pursuit of wealth and gain through exploitation of knowledge and skills in a capitalist society must remain legal.

fraud cases have often appeared to founder, but that low-level fraud is frequently not prosecuted at all&#151;at the fact that it is somehow regarded as a lesser offence than others that are, perhaps, committed by people not wearing white collars and ties at the time. I do not accept that view; fraud is a serious crime that should be prosecuted with as much assiduity as any other offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para0"><a name="0606123000328">Three factors are involved in the general approach to achieving successful prosecutions. The first is the law, which we are addressing today by simplifying the law relating to the relevant offences; the second is the prosecuting and investigating authorities; and the third is the management of court cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para1"><a name="0606123000329">I have long had a serious concern about the disjunction between the various prosecuting authorities. I know that it is fashionable to criticise the Serious Fraud Office and, to a certain extent, the prosecuting department of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, but the real problem lies in the lack of resources available across the field, and in the fact that, too often, we have different compartments. Some deal with fraud against Government, and others deal with serious fraud. There is the Serious Organised Crime Agency, which is in its infancy and deals with organised crime; and the City of London police, which does a wonderful job&#151;within the City of London. Beyond that, there is very inadequate provision across the territorial forces of this country. I know from my own experience in policing that there simply is not the expertise in most provincial forces effectively to investigate and to provide the wherewithal for successful prosecution of fraud.</p>

 The City of London police are responsible not only for fraud in the City, but more widely for London and the south-east, hence the extra resources that they receive. They have built up enormous expertise and I endorse the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments about the way in which they carry out their duties. We are all very grateful to them.</p>

 I concur, and, as one of the rare breed of council tax payers in the City of London, I am glad that it is not solely my contribution that enables them to do their job on behalf of the wider community. I have thought for a long time that we need a single, all-embracing anti-fraud organisation, with much better internal connections, to provide better investigations in parts of the country that are not currently well served. I hope that that will form part of the conclusions of the review that the Solicitor-General mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para2"><a name="0606123000332">Even when we have successful investigations, we still have problems with the management of fraud cases. The over-simplistic view sometimes expressed on behalf of the Government that that is somehow the result of juries who cannot cope with the amount of information and the time scale of cases is unsupported by evidence. We must be clear about that. If we want an instructive case study, we need look only at the Enron trial in Houston. It was the fraud case of the century&#151;a huge case, with huge ramifications. It did not lack for evidence, because it took evidence from 56 witnesses, but those responsible managed to conclude the trial in 15 weeks. The jury had nearly six days of deliberation and found the defendants guilty as charged. If that is possible  <br>

before a Texas jury and a Texas judge, it is not beyond the wit of UK juries and UK judges to effect similar management. In contrast, the BCCI litigation&#151;although it was a misfeasance trial, not a fraud trial&#151;took more than two years, and cost more than &#163;100 million in legal bills. The two opening speeches alone took 200 days of court time, only for the action to be abandoned, with all that work proving abortive. That is an effective comparison of the effectiveness of trial procedures and the Lord Chancellor&#151;as he is at the moment&#151;the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General need to consider the issue carefully to see how we can make improvements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para3"><a name="0606123000333">Like the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, I hope that we will hear no more of the implementation of section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. I think that we have had an assurance from the Attorney-General that if the Government take the view that they need to restrict jury trial further&#151;which I would oppose with every fibre of my being&#151;he will do so by means of new primary legislation. If that is the case, he will no doubt support the amendment that I intend to table in the course of proceedings on the Bill to repeal that section as entirely otiose. We shall then have proof of the Government&#146;s intentions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para4"><a name="0606123000334">I shall mention several issues that I hope to address further in Committee. We had a short debate on clause 4, which states:</p>
<a name="60612-0008.htm_brev0"><a name="0606123000379"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A person is in breach of this section if he...occupies a position in which he is expected to safeguard, or not to act against, the financial interests of another person&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para5"><a name="0606123000335">I was not entirely persuaded by what the Solicitor-General said about that provision. He seemed to be saying that he actually means &#147;the person occupies a position in which he has a duty&#148;&#151;wording that seems entirely appropriate. However, the wording &#147;he is expected to&#148; opens the provision to all sorts of challenge, which is entirely unnecessary because there is no suggestion that there is an additional general duty on an individual citizen. I think that is what the hon. and learned Gentleman said, so it is something that we could usefully consider in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="st_o169"><a name="0606123000336"><a name="60612-0008.htm_spmin1"><a name="0606123000580"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b>
 I have looked through my notes for the exact quote from the Law Commission about clause 4, which I shall read out as the hon. Gentleman has expressed concern about the issue. It states that the &#147;necessary relationship&#148; of a position of trust</p>
<a name="60612-0008.htm_brev1"><a name="0606123000380"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;will be present between trustee and beneficiary, director and company, professional person and client, agent and principal, employee and employer, or between partners. It may arise otherwise, for example within a family, or in the context of voluntary work, or in any context where the parties are not at arm&#146;s length. In nearly all cases where it arises, it will be recognised by the civil law as importing fiduciary duties, and any relationship that is so recognised will suffice&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para6"><a name="0606123000337">But&#151;and this is important&#151;it states:</p>
<a name="60612-0008.htm_brev2"><a name="0606123000381"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We see no reason, however, why the existence of such duties should be essential.&#148;</p>

comprehension, so perhaps we can explore it in Committee. All those cases suggested a duty that could be expressed in those terms, so the idea that there may be some other context in which a court could be persuaded that a person had a reasonable expectation of that duty without it comprising a duty seems a very nice point, of which I would need some persuasion before embracing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para8"><a name="0606123000340">Clause 5 gives definitions of gain and loss and, again, we can usefully explore those points in Committee. Subsection (3) notes:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para10"><a name="0606123000342">On clause 6, the point has already been raised about mens rea in the case of possession of an article and we heard warm words in support of conjurors, who will be able to go about their legal business, using their paraphernalia without fear of arrest. I am not absolutely sure that that is what the Bill says, although I accept the assurances of the Solicitor-General. At what point does a conjuring trick become a dishonest act? The three-card trick seems to be the turning point at which a conjuring trick starts to become a confidence trick. I shall be interested to know how the definition will work in such cases. The Solicitor-General was at pains to say that it would not be an absolute offence, but there is at least an intimation that it is, because the Bill does not specify a statutory defence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para11"><a name="0606123000343">I am less worried about conjurors, however, and more worried about unwitting agents of fraudsters. There are many examples of a person carrying forged credentials&#151;forged documents or letterheads&#151;believing that they are acting lawfully and appropriately for an enterprise when in fact they are not. It worries me that they might unwittingly find themselves in possession of an article that was being used and had been produced for the purpose of fraud, but which they were not aware was being used or had been produced for the purpose of fraud. We need to be clear about the defence that could be used in those circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para12"><a name="0606123000344">We do not want to create a defence that is too easily used by someone who is probably guilty of an offence but who wishes to use their ignorance as a means of avoiding prosecution.

 As I indicated earlier, it is not a strict liability offence. It is the responsibility of the prosecution to show that the individual had an article in his possession with an intention that it should be used in some fraud. That is not on the face of the Bill, but the provisions import the case law of Elan from the previous legislation. That is clear. I say it with all the authority that a Minister has on presenting a Bill. It is intended that the provision should import previous case law.</p>

helping us to assume in a way that the courts will recognise. I am grateful to him for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para13"><a name="0606123000347">I welcome the new provisions for fraudulent business carried on by sole traders. An area that I would like to explore in Committee and perhaps at later stages is where actions are taken in anticipation of receivership or bankruptcy. I perceive that there are many instances where people carry out actions that have the long-term effect of defrauding creditors or employees of a company in the expectation of a company ceasing to trade or in anticipation of that happening. My belief is that that is fraudulent. My belief also is that there can be a deliberate intention to remove assets from a company prior to it ceasing to trade, in a way that is intended to prevent genuine creditors, including the employees of the company, from getting their proper recompense. That is not adequately covered, and is certainly not adequately prosecuted at present. I would wish to explore that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para14"><a name="0606123000348">We have already dealt with clause 11, which is the replacement of part of the Theft Act 1968. I made an intervention about downloading. I do not defend those who illegally download music. Equally, there have been occasions when large corporations have been extremely heavy-handed in either threatening to or carrying out legal action, particularly against minors who have perhaps unwittingly committed an offence. If the clause can be used to launch a private prosecution of a 12-year-old with a computer who is downloading songs off the internet, with mum and dad having no idea that that is happening, that worries me. Perhaps we shall receive some reassurance about that at a later stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para15"><a name="0606123000349">We need a slightly more specific definition of the related offences on non-incrimination. Under clause 13 there is a requirement that a person is not to be excused from answering questions on matters relating to an offence under the Bill or a related offence. We need to know what the related offences are, rather than have an open-ended commitment at that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para16"><a name="0606123000350">Lastly, in terms of what is in the Bill, there is the extent. I know that there has been an issue about whether we should assume extraterritorial jurisdiction in the Bill. The Government have broadly decided that they should not do so. However, the extent to which extraterritorial jurisdiction is appropriate in relation to some of the offences is still an open question. Certainly, internet crime is a real issue, as the Solicitor-General well knows. There is also an issue with unsolicited mail&#151;something that bedevils an awful lot of our constituents. Often it originates from abroad and constitutes what I would consider a fraud on the recipient. When someone receives what purports to be a demand for money, which may have a fraudulent intent, we shall need to be careful about the point at which that becomes prosecutable and in what jurisdiction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para17"><a name="0606123000351">May I conclude with what is not in the Bill? The major issue, of course, is the fact that the Bill does not repeal the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield said that the Law Commission was fairly explicit. It could not have been more explicit. Its report refers to</p>
<a name="60612-0008.htm_brev4"><a name="0606123000383"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the indefensible anomaly represented by the continuing survival of conspiracy to defraud&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para18"><a name="0606123000352">It is an indefensible anomaly that the Solicitor-General now finds himself in a position to defend. I am not convinced by the arguments. They are based on the existing law of fraud, rather than the law as it will be  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="12 Jun 2006">

following the Bill&#146;s enactment, and the existing law on multiple offences, rather than the position that will be the case after the rather belated implementation of provisions on multiple offences in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para19"><a name="0606123000353">The offence is a catch-all offence, which, if there are adequate alternatives, I find repellent in itself. The offence provides an easy route for dual criminality, which is becoming more and more of an issue in extradition proceedings, given that almost anything that is a lawful activity on behalf of one or more people might be interpreted as a conspiracy to defraud and might therefore provide that dual criminality to enable extradition. We need to look at this matter again, both in Committee and probably on Report. In the interim, I ask the Solicitor-General seriously to consider why it would not be appropriate to have a repeal provision in the Bill with a later commencement date or a commitment involving, in effect, a sunset clause for that particular provision, which could be reversed by Order in Council. There are ways of providing the primary legislative framework for the repeal of the existing offence, which we can do by virtue of the Bill and still have the precautionary approach that the Solicitor-General advises. The advice to prosecuting authorities needs to be extremely robust when it comes to why they should not use the conspiracy to defraud. I would like a commitment from the Solicitor-General, if he can give it, that he would be prepared to use noli prosequi powers to prevent a prosecution on that basis if he believes that there are other more appropriate offences as a result of the Bill that should be used as an alternative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para20"><a name="0606123000354">There are other matters that could have been placed to advantage in the Bill. We do not have that many Bills working in this broad area. I would have liked the Bill to be not just the Fraud Bill, but the fraud and corruption Bill. It is a perfect Bill for the incorporation of the provisions of the Corruption Bill that is before the House in the name of the hon. Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley). Many people feel that that is an essential part of our armoury against corruption on a wider scale and fulfils the expectations on this country by treaty to provide better anti-corruption legislation. It is consistent to join fraud and corruption, as there is a considerable overlap between the two, and the Bill is an appropriate vehicle to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para21"><a name="0606123000355">Some things that could be construed as fraud or corruption are not investigated or prosecuted. It is perhaps over-fashionable to talk about association football, but it is inappropriate for bung allegations to be investigated by the Football Association and other sporting bodies. They should, at least on a prima facie basis, be investigated by the police and other investigating authorities, and I am surprised that no such investigation has taken place on the basis of the evidence that has been made public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para22"><a name="0606123000356">Finally, does the Solicitor-General think that anything could be included in the Bill so we can deal more effectively with carousel fraud, which has become an extraordinarily serious issue? A report on figures recently released by the Office for National Statistics in the past few days says:</p>
<a name="60612-0008.htm_brev5"><a name="0606123000384"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Criminal gangs are cheating the taxman out of VAT on &#163;1 in every &#163;7 of Britain&#146;s trade with Europe.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para25"><a name="06061210000011">As has been said, there can be no doubt that fraud is a serious business. The criminal law is required to deal with it effectively, and we do not want to construct laws that allow criminals to find loopholes. The Solicitor-General has made it clear that that is the purpose of the Bill, which I welcome wholeheartedly. I particularly welcome the fact that it deals with the fraudster&#146;s intentions, rather than the consequences of fraud. Instead of dealing with deception and the question of who is deceived, which causes the problems that we have discussed, it addresses the fraudster&#146;s intentions and whether or not they are dishonest. That is an extremely effective riposte to the fact that, as fraud is increasingly perpetrated electronically, there is no one to be deceived.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para26"><a name="06061210000012">I wish to make three points about the Bill against the background of my broad welcome. First, I echo the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) about jury trials. This is a good Bill, because it makes the law of fraud simpler, thus weakening considerably what, in my view, is an already weak argument for a reduction of the right to jury trial for individuals accused of fraud. In my experience juries are well able to deal with the matters put before them in a fraud trial, so long as the lawyers putting those matters before them do so in a straightforward way. The Bill will help them do that, which means that juries will be more, not less, able to deal with fraud trials. I recognise that, as the Solicitor-General said, these arguments are for the time when we deal with another piece of legislation, but I hope that he will not do something counter-intuitive, by passing one piece of legislation that helps juries, and then not taking that into account when he considers whether juries are able to deal with fraud trials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="60612-0008.htm_para27"><a name="06061210000013">The second issue that I want to raise also follows on from comments by the Solicitor-General with which I wholeheartedly agree. It should not be up to the criminal law alone to deal with fraud. It is up to the Government to consider the other ways in which they can reduce the likely incidence of fraud. Fraud prospers in complex systems. It is much easier to perpetrate a fraud in a system that is difficult to follow, because that makes it difficult for those who enforce the rules to work out how the rules have been flouted, and difficult for a court and a jury to work out how the system has been abused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="60612-0009.htm_para0"><a name="06061210000014">I urge the Government to examine the systems for which they have responsibility and ensure that they are as simple as they can be. We have seen recently that in the tax credit system, the internet portal has become subject to precisely the type of fraud that the Bill is designed to address. The Government need to review not only the criminal law but the systems in place in the benefits system and the tax credits system, and ensure that where simplicity is possible, it is introduced, so as to play its part in defeating the potential fraudster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="60612-0009.htm_para1"><a name="06061210000015">Thirdly, I return to my earlier intervention and press the point about the maximum sentence in clause 11. The clause deals with obtaining services dishonestly. I welcome the fact that it redrafts the law so that dishonesty, rather than the deception of an individual, is the key question, but it is a restatement of the law with regard to maximum sentences. The Bill offers an opportunity, which is well taken by the Government, to simplify the whole area and make it straightforward, consistent and easy for the general public to understand so that everyone knows what they are obliged to do and what they are not permitted to do, but there is a potential anomaly in the law as it stands with regard to maximum sentences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="60612-0009.htm_para2"><a name="06061210000016">Under the Bill, if someone were to perpetrate a dishonest act by representation or by omission or in other ways, leading to a gain or loss of money or property, they would face a potential sentence of 10 years. If, however, they obtained services by dishonesty, they would face a maximum sentence of only five years. There must be circumstances, as we can all envisage, in which the value of services is at least as high as the value of property, which is encompassed by the earlier clauses.</p>

If, on the other hand, one defrauds a merchant bank in such a way that one receives the services of a very highly paid, professional and experienced merchant banker, which might be worth as much as or perhaps more than the property of which the bank could have been defrauded, one faces half the potential maximum sentence.</p>

Whether people are defrauding them of services or of property, the maximum penalty available should be consistent across the board. The Government could take the opportunity to establish that in the Bill, and would be well advised to do so.

Members in the Chamber. This Bill is very important for our constituents, not least because the law on fraud has been a hotch-potch until now, with different bits and pieces of legislation being knitted together to cover what many would consider to be an important offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="60612-0009.htm_para7"><a name="06061210000022">Since the introduction of the Theft Act 1968 and its subsequent amendments, the nature of fraud has changed dramatically. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) has referred to the fact that much fraud is now conducted electronically, which is a specific issue for those trying to secure successful prosecutions. The law must keep up with technology, which it has failed to do in that area in recent years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="60612-0009.htm_para8"><a name="06061210000023">I know from my constituency surgeries and from letters from my constituents that a significant number of people are affected by identity fraud, the theft of credit card details and other scams. Such scams often involve relatively small sums of money, so people do not necessarily go to the police, who may find such matters too complicated to proceed with. I suspect that a large amount of fraud is barely considered by the criminal justice system, because people shrug their shoulders and say, &#147;Ah well&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="60612-0009.htm_para9"><a name="06061210000024">In welcoming the Bill, I want to press the Solicitor-General on implementation and enforcement. He has referred to the Crown Prosecution Service, the Serious Fraud Office and additional funds for the police, particularly in central London. Around the country, however, police forces sometimes feel incapable of dealing with the complexity of the IT, of the fraud itself or of the law, and I hope that training will take place in all the police forces in the United Kingdom to make sure that everybody has equal access to justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="60612-0009.htm_para10"><a name="06061210000025">Fraud is more than a national matter. Frauds that have been brought to my attention through my constituency casework include the Spanish lottery fraud, which is well known and has been well attested on television. In order to pursue justice in such cases, one needs a degree of Europe-wide intervention. Similarly, I am sure that all hon. Members have received e-mails from people across the continent of Africa offering them large amounts of money to set up some kind of business. Again, none of us ever refers those e-mails on to any part of the legal system&#151;yet perhaps we should, because others who are perhaps less cynical and sceptical than us fall into those traps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="60612-0009.htm_para11"><a name="06061210000026">All hon. Members who have spoken have discussed whether we should abolish the common-law offence of conspiracy to defraud. I agree with the Government that fraud cases can be amazingly complex and that statutory conspiracy law may not suffice. In most major credit card fraud cases, one person does the phishing by sending out e-mails&#151;again, I am sure that all hon. Members have received such e-mails&#151;that make it look as if one&#146;s bank has managed to lose one&#146;s details and is asking for them to be restated.</p>

themselves to the recipient&#146;s internet explorer and manage to inveigle them into visiting a website that they would not otherwise have visited, so that in the process, or in trying to extricate themselves from the website, they end up inadvertently giving further details about themselves. Such a fraudster may be separate from the first type.</p>

The entire process of complex credit card fraud can involve a series of different people, each of whom is committing a fraud, but one does not get the full sense of the criminality that has been engaged in without seeing the whole package of the fraud. Indeed, individual members of the gang may not know that the others are engaged in it. In those circumstances, I understand that there may be reasons why we should want to keep the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="60612-0009.htm_para14"><a name="06061210000029">Moreover, the fact that, as the British Retail Consortium points out, many new forms of fraud are coming online as a result of new internet IT may mean that we would want to keep a stop-gap clause of some kind. However, as other hon. Members have said, some more hotly than others, it is pretty difficult to advance the argument that we should keep stop-gap legislation just in case we need it. Despite the comments of the Solicitor-General, the law says that an act committed by an individual is not an offence against the criminal law, whereas it may be an offence when it is committed by two people. That puts us in danger of bringing the law into disrepute. I realise that the Solicitor-General has moved considerably further on this issue than the Attorney-General did in the House of Lords, but I would welcome a clear indication that if we do not feel that the common law provision is still necessary, we will see a specific end date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="60612-0009.htm_para15"><a name="06061210000030">I question whether 10 years is a sufficient sentence. Some of this fraud is very significant. It does not always involve one person being defrauded out of a small amount of money; sometimes millions of pounds is defrauded from lots of people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="60612-0009.htm_para16"><a name="06061210000031">I also question, as did the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, whether aspects of corruption should be included in the Bill. I note in particular that we have not revised for many years the legislation on the suborning of a police officer. There is some debate about precisely what that offence now is. However, many newspapers acknowledge that they pay police officers for information that would otherwise be secret and private, and should probably remain so, so that the police can perform their legitimate duties as regards a secure prosecution. Perhaps by now the Government should be advancing legislation to reform the law on suborning a police officer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="60612-0009.htm_para17"><a name="06061210000032">I think that what the shadow Solicitor-General said about magicians and the Magic Circle was wholly erroneous. It is clear that under clause 6, which deals with carrying articles for use in connection with a fraud, the fraud would have to involve the person making a gain for himself or another, causing loss to another, or exposing another to a risk of loss. I cannot see why magicians would be caught by that in any sense. The clause that they are most likely to be caught by is clause 2, which  <br>

 I am trying to follow the last point, which was interesting, to say the least&#151;a rabbit out of a hat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="60612-0009.htm_para18"><a name="06061210000034">The debate is important and the Bill is interesting. As hon. Members of all parties have said, it is welcome, but, as with every measure, aspects need addressing in Committee. I agree with hon. Members who spoke in favour of preserving the right to jury trial. I speak as a practising barrister and not, I hasten to add, out of self-interest. Jury trial is and always has been the bulwark of justice and it should be retained at all costs. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="60612-0009.htm_para19"><a name="06061210000035">The Solicitor-General, who was generous in allowing interventions and has taken the debate forward through his responses, made the point that the Bill will simplify to some extent the offences involving fraud and lead to shorter indictments. That, in turn, will lead to a simpler process, which will negate the need for denuding people of jury trial. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I note that the Solicitor-General was with me on the first three points but unfortunately shook his head at the last one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="60612-0009.htm_para20"><a name="06061210000036">All of us who are involved in the criminal justice system&#151;as legislators, practitioners and so on&#151;are bound to try to keep matters simple. That is not to be offensive to juries. When I prosecute, if I do not keep a case simple and it is lost, it is my fault because I have not made the case properly and it therefore should be lost. It does not happen because the jury did not understand it but because the case was not made simply and understandably. It behoves us all to make law that is readily understood by all concerned, including juries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="60612-0009.htm_para21"><a name="06061210000037">The Solicitor-General knows that the Lord Chief Justice recently referred to some protocols, including case management, the involvement of prosecutors at an earlier stage in larger fraud cases, more effective pre-trial hearings, encouraging judges to use their powers to persuade prosecution that charges should not be pursued, severing indictments and so on. If those are proactively pursued, together with the simplification for which the Bill provides to a large extent, a good job of work will be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="60612-0009.htm_para22"><a name="06061210000038">I do not intend to say much about conspiracy to defraud because others have discussed it at length. Ultimately, there will be no case for retaining that offence, but I have some sympathy with the Solicitor-General, who is effectively saying, &#147;Let&#146;s see how the offences bed down and, in three years&#146; time, we might be able to knock it on the head.&#148; That is a pragmatic and sensible approach. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) said that he would like the measure to include a sunset clause. That could amount to the same thing as the Solicitor-General&#146;s approach, if we are considering discontinuing the offence in three years. I appreciate that it is not exactly the same, but it could have the same effect. I understand his caution, especially given that several highly regarded senior members of the judiciary on the Rose Committee have said that we should be careful about ditching it now. My opinion therefore varies slightly from that of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield.</p>

 Although I should like to agree that it would be appropriate to incorporate a sunset clause, what guarantee could the hon.

 I think that I agree with the hon. Gentleman. A period of three years has been mentioned and that is ample time in which to ascertain whether to get rid of the offence. I stress that I do not violently disagree with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, who supports a sunset clause. We all want the same thing&#151;it is a question of how we get there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="60612-0009.htm_para23"><a name="06061210000045">I shall be relatively succinct because others wish to speak and we are holding a Second Reading debate, which does not call for going into the minutiae.

That poses the question of why &#147;knowing&#148; or &#147;intending&#148; is not included in the provision. If it were, I would not have raised the matter and I am sure that many other learned commentators would not have raised it. Is the Solicitor-General open to an amendment along those lines in Committee? He was adamant that intention was required. In opening the debate, he said that there was some sort of tie-up between the old offence of &#147;going equipped&#148; and the clause. I tried to make the point that they are different because, if a person, late at night, is carrying bolt cutters, jemmies and all the typical gear of a housebreaker, that is one thing, but there is also the high-tech stuff&#151;PINs, cards and so on&#151;that is not perceived as being there specificallyeb;normal;j for a dishonest or nefarious purpose.

 Perhaps a better analogy than the offence of &#147;going equipped&#148; is instruments that can be used for an innocent purpose and adapted for a nefarious one, for example an iron bar or knife.

Is it the person whose interests are concerned? Is it a third party? Or is it a &#147;reasonable person&#148;? If a person unreasonably expects another to safeguard their financial interests, that should not give rise to liability under the clause. Further, if there was no legal duty to do so, and the defendant was not aware that he was expected to do so, he or she should not be liable for this offence.

Should there be a specific mens rea requirement in regard to a defendant dishonestly obtaining services in breach of subsection 2? That is undoubtedly what the clause intends, but it could be argued that, under the present wording, such an act would be intrinsically dishonest, so there would be no need for a finding that the person was dishonest.

However, it is not utterly clear in some parts of the Bill that that will be the way that it will work. Despite those few misgivings and caveats, I welcome this important Bill. In relation to a remark made earlier by the hon. Member for Rhondda, (Chris Bryant) it has not been standing room only here today, but the Bill is important to all our clients&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Clients?&#148;] I meant to say &#147;constituents&#148;. The Bill is important for all our constituents, especially those who might be affected by fraud, but also those who might be tempted to perpetrate an act of fraud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="60612-0010.htm_para4"><a name="06061210000062">We in this House think that we always legislate sensibly and that we always get things right. I remind hon. Members that there was a mistake in the Theft Act 1968 as a result of some draftsman forgetting to repeal the provision that a person caught stealing a sheep could be hanged. Let me tell you that, in some parts of Wales, that has caused a great deal of difficulty.</p>

 Thank you for calling me to speak last, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am the tail-end Charlie in this important debate. Given the closeness of the debate, I feel that I am among old friends. At its best attended point, there were 15 Members in the Chamber, and that included Madam Deputy Speaker. However, it has been a good debate, and it is getting better. Or it was until I stood up. Certain parts of it were fairly sterile, but the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) started to inject the subject of people into it and talked about how fraud impacts on the ordinary people&#151;real people&#151;who come through our surgeries every week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="60612-0010.htm_para5"><a name="06061210000064">To use a well-worn clich&#233; that I have heard on a few occasions this afternoon, fraud is not victimless. It is not some sterile concept. Fraud is theft. It is clear and simple theft, committed by very undesirable people. If I may use unparliamentary language, Mr. Deputy Speaker, fraud is, in the main, committed by absolute toe-rags&#151;nasty, unpleasant, self-interested, self-motivated people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="60612-0010.htm_para6"><a name="06061210000065">It is easy to talk about fraud as something that is large scale&#151;something to do, perhaps, with Asil Nadir and Polly Peck, <i> The Mirror </i>pension fund or the BCCI scandal of many years ago. By and large, though, fraud is often small scale. As the hon. Member for Rhondda said, it is committed against ordinary people, who might suddenly find &#163;3,000 taken out of their bank account, not only their &#163;1,000 worth of savings but another &#163;2,000 overdraft on top. It is frightening and, once one gets caught up in the fraud web, it is extremely difficult to unravel it. It can take months or years to get one&#146;s life back on track.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="60612-0010.htm_para7"><a name="06061210000066">Fraudsters tend to be indiscriminate and opportunistic. In my constituency, there is a group of fraudsters who use fake ID to gain entrance to old people&#146;s homes. Some come in the guise of police officers, others as council officers or workers for local utility&#151;gas or electricity&#151;companies. That is an obnoxious and obscene form of fraud, an absolute abuse of trust and a misrepresentation of the worst kind. I hope that, when the Bill becomes an Act, it will ensure that people who use fake ID or credentials to gain access to people&#146;s homes feel the full force of the law. Ten years may not be long enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="60612-0010.htm_para8"><a name="06061210000067">I met a local vicar earlier today, a minister of Rosedale church, whose mother had someone on her doorstep claiming to be a police officer and gaining access to her home in that way. She is an extremely clued-up woman. She quickly realised that something was wrong, she led him into a room that happened to be her garage and she locked him in it. It was 8.30 at night, so she thought that the police would not be interested in coming to arrest him and left making the phone call until the following morning. She thought that she would let this young man contemplate the error of his ways in her garage. Unfortunately, when the police turned up the next morning, he had found a way out of the garage. That may sound like an amusing anecdote, but it was only her presence of mind that allowed her to navigate her way out of that unfortunate situation. Many elderly people find their trust being abused and pay a huge cost for it, not only financially, but in their mental well-being.</p>

qualifications to gain people&#146;s trust&#151;&#151;&#147;I am from the federation of master builders; I know what I am talking about.&#148; All of a sudden, the vulnerable find themselves paying out vast sums of money for work that did not need doing to complete crooks who have used fake qualifications to con their way into a position of trust in order to abuse it. Once again, I hope that the Bill will cover those sort of fraudulent acts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="60612-0010.htm_para10"><a name="06061210000069">We must also understand that we have a responsibility and we need to be vigilant against fraud as well. That is the real meaning of responsibility. The hon. Member for Rhondda spoke about phishing schemes in which e-mails are sent claiming to be from the Halifax, advising people that they need to update their bank accounts. People are still falling for that con. I believe that it has been running for three or four years, yet I still find that some of my constituents are falling for it, giving out their financial details and losing vast sums of money in consequence. We, collectively as politicians, the Government, the financial services industry and local authorities need to educate people to be on their guard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="60612-0010.htm_para11"><a name="06061210000070">Why are we still throwing out our bank and credit card statements in the general rubbish, providing a rich source of opportunity? Some of us have bought shredding machines, but then we hear about armies of people sitting in darkened backrooms, putting together what we have shredded so that they can still read our bank account numbers. That is happening&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Rhondda looks bemused, but I can assure him that this is absolutely the case. In fact, Frank Abagnale, one of the world&#146;s top authorities on fraud, visited the country only a couple of weeks ago and said, &#147;For crying out loud, people, don&#146;t just get something that shreds vertically. Get a proper criss-cross shredder, so there is absolutely no chance of the information being reconstituted and used to defraud people.&#148;</p>

 Does my hon. Friend believe that magistrates take a suitably robust approach to the obnoxious practice, prevalent in my constituency and across the country, of distraction burglaries, which are particularly aimed at older people, the most vulnerable in our community?</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Nothing upsets the police more than the fact that, when they actually catch an individual who has been preying on the elderly and vulnerable and he is brought before the magistrates courts or even the Crown court, he is given a one or two-year suspended sentence or a bit of community service. That individual then goes back to doing what he was doing very well before&#151;ripping people off. People like that should be locked up and if the Solicitor-General can lock them up not for three or four years but for 10, good on him.</p>

talk it through. I am sure that he is talking perfect sense and thank him for that intervention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="60612-0010.htm_para12"><a name="06061210000075">I shall now deal with particular provisions, starting with clause 2, which the hon. Member for Rhondda also spoke about. We have seen the promotion of fraud conducted over computers through e-mail and the internet. The hon. Member for Rhondda and others mentioned phishing, but there are also the K-scams, largely from Nigeria, where people are told that they will receive a large sum of money from a relative of the former deposed king or local warlord who has $55 million to launder. People are asked to send &#163;20,000 so that they can have the whole lot. Unbelievably, people are still falling for it. We have to go with the adage: if it sounds too good to be true, it is too good to be true. In plain and simple, non-Shakespearean English, if it looks too good to be true, ignore it and walk to the other side of the street. How will the Bill deal with international scams, as phishing and K-scams are run from Africa, by and large, or from parts of the former Soviet Union that are not yet in the European Union?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="60612-0010.htm_para13"><a name="06061210000076">Clause 3 deals with failure to disclose information. A classic example would be the estate agent who visits an elderly or young person&#146;s home and says, &#147;I have looked at your very nice home and you should put it on the market for &#163;165,000.&#148; Lo and behold, a buyer turns up the next day and offers to buy it for that sum. The seller is extremely happy and the deal goes through, but he then discovers that the home was really worth &#163;220,000 and that the estate agent undervalued it so that one of his mates could buy it, only to put it straight back on the market with the two splitting the profit. That is a classic example of fraud, which I hope the Bill addresses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="60612-0010.htm_para14"><a name="06061210000077">Clause 4 deals with fraud by abuse of position. Before I entered Parliament, I worked in recruitment businesses and what went on in some of our offices was phenomenal. Nice young men or women would be hired and given a computer at their desk. They would work away, but a year later, we might find out that they were running a completely parallel business from that desk. They might have downloaded all the company&#146;s information on its candidates and clients, crossed it over to their computers and run two businesses. If they were caught, they would be fired, but they would often leave with all the data and set up business down the road&#151;another classic example. I congratulate the Government on introducing legislation to deal with that sort of fraud. I am in a very congratulatory mood today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="60612-0010.htm_para15"><a name="06061210000078">One part of the Bill causes me some concern and I am sure that someone will say that I am making a fatuous point about clause 11, which deals with obtaining services dishonestly. It strikes me that the rights to cover test matches at the Oval are owned jointly by Sky and the England and Wales Cricket Board. Fair enough. Will the clause be used against the hundreds of people who like to dangle out of windows or sit on the roofs of the houses around the Oval, watching the cricket? The point is not necessarily fatuous and it is worth raising. People could get a knock on the door from Sky or the England and Wales Cricket Board, who then ask them what they are doing accessing the match. They might say, &#147;You haven&#146;t paid to access the match, so please remove yourselves from the windows or roofs.&#148;</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I hope that my point is not as poor as he thinks and that the Minister will respond to it here or in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="60612-0010.htm_para16"><a name="06061210000081">My final concern relates to the decision to retain the offence of conspiracy to defraud. I understand some of the Government&#146;s reasons for doing so, but clause 7, on the making or supplying of articles for use in frauds, would cover that, by and large. We have talked about people walking around with crowbars. Of course, it is debateable whether someone is taking a crowbar to lever open a door or to lever off a manhole cover and go about his business if he is a plumber. However, if someone is caught walking around with a cash machine keypad recording device, it is very difficult to argue that that person did not know what it was for; they are specific machinery manufactured only to defraud. I hope that clause 7 will cover a large amount of what is still viewed as conspiracy to defraud, but the Government have a slightly different view.</p>

<p><a name="st_o193"><a name="06061210000082"><a name="60612-0010.htm_spnew9"><a name="06061210000210"><b>Mr. Jackson:</b>
 My hon. Friend referred to Frank Abagnale, one of the world&#146;s leading experts on fraud. On counterfeit measures, does my hon. Friend agree that Frank Abagnale has stated that most modern identification cards can be counterfeited at least within 18 months and, possibly, two years?</p>

<p><a name="st_o194"><a name="06061210000083"><a name="60612-0010.htm_spnew10"><a name="06061210000211"><b>Mr. Walker:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes a valid point, and to the Solicitor-General&#146;s credit, he did not talk about ID cards in his opening remarks. Some people say that ID cards will help to reduce fraud, but many people think that they will worsen the problem. Fraudsters will get hold of ID cards and manufacture them, and they will find them an effective way to win people&#146;s trust and take their money. We already see that with passports and there is no reason why it should not apply to ID cards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="60612-0010.htm_para17"><a name="06061210000084">The Solicitor-General said that he was very much in favour of police forces merging, so that they could pool their resources in tackling fraud. May I say for the record that I am totally opposed to the merger of police forces? I believe that most Conservative Members and some Labour Members share that view. Most of my constituents would not buy the argument that one needs to merge police forces to tackle fraud better. Most of them believe that the police are doing a pretty good job and that, when caught, fraudsters need to spend more time in prison and less time on the streets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="60612-0010.htm_para18"><a name="06061210000085">In conclusion, I broadly welcome this Government Bill.

Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) has found this afternoon&#146;s debate such an enjoyable occasion, because, as he knows, the Government are here to provide us with pleasure, and they have, in fact, done it 53 times since 1997. This is, I think, the 53rd Bill that they have introduced to do with the criminal justice aspect of criminal policy. Probably, on this 53rd occasion, this is the one Bill that I can more or less wholeheartedly welcome, so long as they implement it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="60612-0010.htm_para19"><a name="06061212000002">I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions to the Home Secretary&#151;this one, the last one and the one before that&#151;to ask which Bills have been brought into force, which of their provisions have been repealed before they came into force, which have been repealed since coming into force and which are yet to come into force, and it is quite amazing how one gets back a telephone bill of an answer, too big to be e-mailed by the relevant Home Office department, to show how active the Government have been in producing legislation, but how dilatory and, indeed, how repetitive they are in the work that they do in bringing it into force. So they are a Government who chase headlines, but thanks to the Law Commission&#151;on behalf of the official Opposition, I send my thanks to the Law Commission&#151;here at least we have a Bill that looks pretty good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="60612-0010.htm_para20"><a name="06061212000003">I also thank the Joint Committee on Human Rights for producing its 14th report, which deals in part with the Bill, and there is some good reading to be had in there, not least because it points out some of the concerns that the Government ought to have&#151;I am sure that the Solicitor-General has them&#151;about aspects of the European convention on human rights and the way in which it bites on the Bill, particularly in relation to articles 5 and 7.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="60612-0010.htm_para21"><a name="06061212000004">A number of hon. Members have expressed our interest and support for the continuance of jury trial. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) and the hon. Members for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) and others have all expressed views in support of jury trial and quite sensibly stated that the problem with some of the more difficult fraud trials is not the jury&#146;s participation but the case management and the way in which the prosecution case has been presented to the jury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="60612-0010.htm_para22"><a name="06061212000005">As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield pointed out, very often those cases have fallen apart well before they get to a jury. Certainly, if there was much space in the Government&#146;s armoury for arguments against the use of juries in fraud trials, that space has been utterly emptied by the production of the Bill, which is, no doubt, intended to simplify and clarify the criminal law in relation to dishonesty. I trust that the Government will be extremely slow to introduce not only another criminal justice Bill, but a Bill to implement section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, to abolish juries.</p>

the Bill was read for the Third time in the other place. I quote his remarks as recorded in the Lords <i> Hansard</i>:</p>
<a name="60612-0010.htm_brev1"><a name="06061212000030"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Attorney-General has helpfully summarised in paragraph 8 of his draft advice the judgment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, the then Lord Chief Justice, in the joined cases R v Rimmington and R v Goldstein.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para0"><a name="06061212000007">In essence, what other hon. Members and I are asking for is that there should be clarity and certainty in the criminal law. The Solicitor-General and I are familiar with the expression &#147;the certainty of indictment&#148;, and that rubric should flow across into statute law, just as much as it does in the drafting of a criminal indictment. Although we are happy to give the Government that three-year extension while they consider the common law conspiracy offence, it is something that ought not just be let to run. Whether there is sunset clause or some other device, it is not something that the Government should allow just to roll off into the long grass.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para1"><a name="06061212000008">What we are essentially talking about is dishonesty&#151;a concept that is often easy to recognise and sometimes a lot more difficult to define. Definitions are important in all statutes, but particularly in criminal law statutes and certainly in the Bill. By and large, the definitions in the Bill are sufficiently clear and the sort of thing that a judge&#151;I declare an interest as a Crown court recorder and as someone who practices as a barrister not at the criminal Bar but at the civil Bar&#151;can easily explain to a jury at the end of a trial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para2"><a name="06061212000009">We must bear in mind the fact that some areas of definition will need to be teased out. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield ran through those relating to the expressions &#147;loss&#148; or &#147;gain&#148; in clauses 3 and 5. More importantly, that relating to the word &#147;expected&#148; in clause 4(1)(a) has far-reaching implications that require careful thought. Issues relating to duty flow from that. My hon. Friend and the Solicitor-General had a private debate earlier about fiduciary duty. Speaking as a defamation specialist, when one talks about qualified privilege, one often talks about the duty to pass on a defamatory allegation even though one might know that it is defamatory and might be damaging. That duty can be described as either legal, moral or social. Therefore the fiduciary duty about which my hon. Friend and the Solicitor-General were talking might not be the only sort of duty caught by an expression such as &#147;expected&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para3"><a name="06061212000010">I therefore urge the Government to think carefully in Committee about what they mean, what they want the courts to mean, and what they think the police and prosecuting authorities ought to be doing when faced with a case that might fall under clause 4, entitled &#147;Fraud by abuse of position&#148;. As I said, there is a clear need for certainty in the criminal law, and as long as that is provided by the time the Bill leaves this House, either to go back to the other place or to get Royal Assent, none of us should complain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para4"><a name="06061212000011">I want to say one or two more things about clause 4, as that, in conjunction with the problems described in relation to clauses 6 and 7 on criminal intent, is where most of the difficulty with the Bill will lie.

 For the record, it was a Justice briefing.</p>

 Well, that is J rather than L. They are different letters of the alphabet, and we are making progress. In short, there is a foreseeable potential problem with relationships that can be the subject of abuse, which could then lead to fraud. We must bear in mind the distinction between straightforward dishonest criminal behaviour, which this Bill is designed to catch, and sharp practice, immorality or bad manners, which might be utterly reprehensible as matters of social conduct but which might not fall within the definition of fraud intended by the Government in introducing the Bill. I urge Members who serve on the Committee to invite the Government to think carefully about that. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para5"><a name="06061212000014">There have been seven contributors to the debate, the last of whom, my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne, not only clearly enjoyed speaking in the debate but was good enough to tell us that he enjoyed speaking in it, which is a matter of some congratulation. He said that fraud affects not just Members of Parliament or lawyers but our constituents. It is a real issue. As he correctly said, it is not just dealt with on the Enron scale but can affect people with very little by way of assets or money, for whom the consequences can be disproportionately hard. Those with small savings and little wealth can be hard hit by some very nasty people. Now is not the appropriate time to debate the philosophy of sentencing policy. I have some interesting views, at least to me, about the appropriate sentence for all sorts of crimes, but the Bill makes it clear, depending on the clause that one is looking at, that sentences will be 10 or five years. I am sure that Members who serve on the Committee will have ample opportunity to exercise their minds on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para6"><a name="06061212000015">My hon. Friend makes the perfectly good point that there is a great deal of self-help that can prevent fraud. Those who throw their bank account details, cheque books or other sensitive information into a bin without shredding them have, to some extent, only themselves to blame, even though those who misuse the confidential information contained in those documents in a criminal way can have no excuse simply because they found it in the bin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para7"><a name="06061212000016">The hon. Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins) kindly undertook a gentle canter through the explanatory notes to the Bill, which many of us had perhaps not had the chance to read before he read them out to us. That was a valiant service, and I am sure that those on the Treasury Bench have noted that he was able to provide it, for which I thank him very much. He made some other, independent points in relation to the international nature of fraud. Those need to be grasped, especially, as he correctly pointed out, as so much fraud is conducted over the internet. The internet knows no national boundaries, even though the jurisdiction of our criminal courts is to a large extent confined within the boundaries of England and Wales, which I am sure is a point that the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker), will want to take back to the Home Office with him, along with the explanatory notes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para8"><a name="06061212000017">The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome gave a cautious but none the less thoughtful welcome to the Bill. He made some points about the need for a coherent prosecuting and investigatory policy. He invited us to try to manufacture a system with one coherent prosecuting and investigative authority, but he did not go so far as saying that he wanted one amalgamated national police force&#151;</p>

 The hon. Gentleman says, &#147;Certainly not&#148;, from a sedentary position, in case anyone did not hear him. He also made sensible points about case management, and gave his support for the jury system. From my experience of summing up to juries, and of addressing juries as an advocate, they have a collective common sense, by and large, and are exceptionally good at discerning honesty and dishonesty. When considering cases of criminal fraud, one is essentially talking about dishonest behaviour. There is no better way of unravelling all the complicated inter-weavings of a scam and asking whether what was going on was a deliberate piece of dishonesty than to ask a group of  2 people to apply their collective common sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para9"><a name="06061212000020">I will not detain the House now with a dissertation on fraudulent preference, on which the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome touched briefly, but there is a story to be told in that regard, as there is with regard to carousel fraud, which has lately hit the headlines. I am sure that the Government have both those matters fully in mind, and I am sure that he can raise them again in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para10"><a name="06061212000021">One point on which the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome lighted, which others did not, and which is worth highlighting now, is that of evidence on self-incrimination in relation to clause 13. I will have to read clause 13 a few more times before I get my head around it completely, but as I understand it, the self-incrimination concerned relates to questions asked in civil proceedings, which might prevent a prosecutor from using the answers to those questions to mount a criminal prosecution. The Solicitor-General, or my hon. Friend the shadow Attorney-General, will no doubt take me into a cooler room and explain things to me gently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para11"><a name="06061212000022">I would be interested to hear from the Government, now or subsequently, either orally or in writing, how that clause impacts on what is loosely called the right to silence, or the denial of the right to silence. As the Solicitor-General will know, prosecutors are entitled in certain circumstances, under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, to comment on a refusal to answer questions or to explain a particular course of conduct, at the roadside, on arrest or later while being interviewed by the police&#151;or, indeed, on a refusal to give evidence in a trial. I should like to know for my own purposes what impact clause 13 will have on that aspect of criminal procedure. As I have said, the Minister need not trouble himself to give me an answer this evening, but I should be grateful if a simple written answer could be prepared.</p>

had very little experience of the intricacies of criminal law. On the contrary, he is a highly experienced senior junior at the criminal bar. It is a pity that he has had to give that up for his parliamentary duties from the point of view of the courts in England and Wales, but it is a great benefit to the House. He too expressed support for the jury system. He too sensibly advised us that the Government should not just consider legislation on fraud, but consider ways of making things less complicated. He rightly said that the more complicated the system&#151;he cited the tax credits system&#151;the easier it would be for bad people to cheat. He too raised the issue of the maximum sentence in clause 11, which I think it is sensible to deal with in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para13"><a name="06061212000024">The hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) took a zoological canter through the Bill&#151;if it is possible to take a zoological canter; perhaps not. He talked of phishing, Trojan horses and money mules. Essentially, his point was that fraud is an international crime which can be perpetrated by three separate people from three separate jurisdictions, and which can have an impact on a victim in this jurisdiction. It may well be that international co-operation of one kind or another outside the confines of the Bill is necessary to help reduce fraud. The hon. Gentleman was sceptical about the need to retain the common law conspiracy offence, although I think he properly recognised that it might be necessary to retain it in order to establish the most appropriate way of dealing with phishing, Trojan horses and money mules. No doubt the Government will consider that over the next three years.</p>

He seemed less sure than Conservative Members about the need to abolish the common law conspiracy offence&#151;not necessarily for the same reasons as the hon. Member for Rhondda&#151;but I am happy to say that he was wholly with us on jury trial, on the need for tighter definitions, on the need for clarity in relation to mens rea or criminal intent in clauses 6 and 7, and on the wider and more general plea for clarity and certainty in the criminal law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para15"><a name="06061212000026">Let me say something about clauses 6 and 7. I understand the concern expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, and understand and support the simple solution that he proposed in relation to clause 7. I may be able to assist the Government in that regard, although no doubt my hon. Friend will explain his ideas better in Committee. Simply removing the word &#147;or&#148; from clause 7(1)(a) and substituting the word &#147;and&#148; would do away with all the problems that we may face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para16"><a name="06061212000027">The Government may ask what constitutes fraud within the confines of the Bill. Fraud is described in clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4. It requires criminal intent. The fraud referred to in clause 7(1)(a) is the fraud described in those earlier clauses. When we combine that with the word &#147;knowing&#148; in the same paragraph, we end up with criminal intent. My hon. Friend&#146;s solution is so much neater, simpler and clearer. A stroke of a pen could remove one little word and insert another: end of problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para17"><a name="06061212000028">There is a disjunction between the drafting of clause 7 and the drafting of clause 6, but as my hon.

I am sure it will, given a relatively benign and much welcomed Bill&#151;it should concentrate on those two clauses, while obviously dealing with the difficulties presented by the word &#147;expected&#148; and the relationships issue raised in clause 4.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para18"><a name="06061212000029">That is quite enough from me. I told the Government Whip that I would speak until about 9.30 pm, because I knew that the House was keen to hear from me. I also wanted to ensure that my hon.

 This is the first occasion on which I have spoken as a Minister in a Second Reading debate. As I am not a lawyer, I rise with a slight degree of apprehension, which is why I was grateful to the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) for saying that I could write to him about clause 13.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para19"><a name="06061210000116">I welcome the broad support that has been expressed for the Bill. I thank the hon.

Members for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), and others on both sides of the House for responding constructively, while committing themselves to scrutiny in Committee to produce the better Bill that is our common goal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para20"><a name="06061210000117">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield outlined three tests that he considered important. It was crucial, he said, to overcome complexity, to help prosecutors to prosecute those who committed the crime of fraud, and to adapt to the changing face of criminality&#151;for example, in the context of new technology. I assure him that the Government agree with him about all those tests and aims. As for repeal of the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud, I repeat that, having listened to Lord Justice Rose and following various consultations, we decided not to repeal it but to review it after three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para21"><a name="06061210000118">Let me point out to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that the views expressed in the other place changed during debates on the Bill. The hon. Gentleman said that Lord Lloyd saw no case for retention of the common law conspiracy offence. That may have been his initial view, but on 14 March he said that after speaking to Lord Justice Rose he was &#147;wobbling down in favour&#148; of retaining the offence. Even Lord Lloyd, having listened to some of the arguments, decided to change his view. He wobbled, which is enough for me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para22"><a name="06061210000119">As has been said, non-jury trials will feature in another Bill and do not form part of this debate, but the points made today have been taken into account.

learned Friend the Solicitor-General made clear, those are not strict-liability offences. Case law has established that the phrase</p>
<a name="60612-0011.htm_brev1"><a name="06061210000161"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;for use in the course of...any fraud&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para23"><a name="06061210000120">means that the prosecution must prove at least a general intention of committing a fraud. Anyone who has no such intention has nothing to fear from these provisions. Whether they are conjurors or innocent members of the public, safeguards are provided by case law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para24"><a name="06061210000121">I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins) for what I thought was an important and worthwhile contribution to the debate. He made the point that the Bill is only part of the solution. That is absolutely right. He suggested the need, for example, for specialist fraud judges and perhaps for specialist fraud courts. Those are useful proposals and I assure him that we will put them into the fraud review, which will report shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para25"><a name="06061210000122">My hon. Friend raised a number of issues to do with receiving digital television and no doubt he can argue his points in Committee; I am sure that he looks forward to serving on that. He made the important point, which the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) also made, that fraud is not a victimless crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para26"><a name="06061210000123">My hon. Friend said that there is no definition of dishonesty. Although there is no definition of dishonesty, the established test results from the case of Ghosh.

Member for Somerton and Frome  raised many of the issues that we will need to look at in more detail in Committee. With that assurance, I will not mention all the points that he made. For example, we can discuss in Committee the issue of nationality jurisdiction. We do not think that the same justification for extra-territorial jurisdiction exists as it does for corruption. The corruption of officials overseas is dealt with in several international conventions. That stems from concern about corruption in developing countries and its effect on their stability. In contrast, fraud is a huge issue across the world&#151;domestically as much as internationally. Corruption is also far less common than fraud. The resource implications for &#147;policing&#148; UK nationals worldwide for fraud are therefore much larger. The cost would need to be carefully examined before any party committed itself to it. If a UK national commits a fraud in Hong Kong that has no effect in the UK and no part of the fraud was committed in the UK, do we want the SFO to pay to send a team to Hong Kong? A degree of caution is needed with respect to that matter, but, as I say, it is an issue that we can debate in Committee.</p>

Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) was right to draw attention to the need for an appropriate penalty for obtaining services dishonestly. In response to his question about the maximum sentence, I draw his attention to the fact that the existing offence of obtaining services by deception carries a maximum sentence of five years&#146; imprisonment. The Law Commission examined that issue and saw no reason why the maximum for the new offence should not be the same. The Government&#146;s consultation likewise did not elicit any  <br>

As others have made clear, it is important continually to make that point. Although some people find the issue of fraud dry and not very interesting, it impacts on thousands of people across the country. Therefore, today&#146;s debate is particularly important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="60612-0011.htm_para30"><a name="06061210000127">My hon. Friend made an important point when he talked about the issue of training for the police. I assure him that the police, particularly the ACPO national fraud working group, are playing a full role in developing the policy in the Bill. They have publicly welcomed the Bill and look forward to its early enactment. The City of London police are using their experience to look at how they can train police forces throughout the country in ensuring that it is as effective as possible. Indeed&#151;this will be of interest to the barristers here&#151;the Crown Prosecution Service is also looking forward to issuing advice to prosecutors to ensure that it is as effective as possible.</p>

The only problem with that Act is that it does not apply to fraudsters who operate from home. We already have nearly 40 years&#146; experience of the operation of that provision and we are not aware of any problems of innocent persons being troubled by it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para0"><a name="06061210000134">The hon. Member for Broxbourne pointed out, in his wide-ranging but interesting speech, that fraud is not a victimless crime. The Bill will help to tackle many of the examples that he gave of victims of fraud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para1"><a name="06061210000135">We have faced a growing threat from fraud. Tackling it requires effort by all concerned on several fronts and on prevention as well as enforcement. However, modernisation of existing criminal law is one essential building block. The existing statutory offences are specific and overlapping, yet they are not related to each other to convey the variety of fraudulent behaviour in an organised way. That untidiness in the law means that it is not always clear which offence should be charged and defendants have successfully argued that their particular deceptive behaviour did not fit the definition of the offence with which they had been charged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para2"><a name="06061210000136">Our reform efforts date back to 1998, when the then Home Secretary asked the Law Commission to consider whether a general offence of fraud would improve the criminal law. This is a tricky area of the law and the commission consulted stakeholders and gave the issue the most careful consideration. The 2002 report was the result. It decided that it was not a realistic solution to plug loopholes in fraud law by adding more specific offences, as has been done in the past. Such piecemeal law reform leads not only to further complexities and the potential for charging defendants wrongly, but means that the law will always be lagging behind any development in technology or new methods of committing fraud&#151;a point that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield made.</p>

 I congratulate the Minister on his promotion. Clearly criminals are increasingly using more sophisticated IT methods, on which the police will need to be constantly trained and retrained. Can he give the House some assurance that the police have systems in place to be able to do that and that they are not going to find that they are continually outsmarted by ever-smarter criminals?</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his good wishes. There is always a race between the police and the criminal. The police are always racing to keep up with the criminal, but in the brief time I have been in post I have been to the Serious Organised Crime Agency and other agencies that are at the cutting edge of technology and are trying to ensure that they keep up with the criminal. They are soliciting support from all over to try to do that, including from the private sector. I have seen examples of those agencies working with various internet and computer companies, using their expertise and experience to try to ensure that, as far as possible, they keep up with developments in IT and the internet to tackle crime in the way that we would all want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para3"><a name="06061210000139">Our reform dates back to 1998, when the Home Secretary asked the Law Commission to look at this issue. The 2002 report was the result, and it was decided that the proposal to which I referred earlier was not a realistic solution that would plug the loopholes. Piecemeal law reform leads to further complexities and to the potential for charging defendants wrongly. As I said, the law will always lag behind new developments in technology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para4"><a name="06061210000140">The Bill introduces a general fraud offence, as recommended by the Law Commission, which does not focus on specific acts, as previous fraud statutes have done. Instead, it defines three broad ways in which fraud can be committed. The aim is to cover a variety of fraudulent behaviour, and that the offences should continue to be relevant as methods of committing crime and technology change and develop. The offence of obtaining services dishonestly is also important, as it plugs a legal loophole whereby fraudsters obtain services over the internet but are not subject to the current fraud law, as they have not deceived a person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para5"><a name="06061210000141">The shift in emphasis that the Bill brings&#151;toward dishonesty and away from deception&#151;is a critical and powerful element of this legislation. While it has always been the case that attempts to commit deception offences can be charged, the Bill simplifies the law and avoids the difficulties that arise from the narrowness of the existing offences. In simplifying the law, the Bill will make it more easily comprehensible to juries and the general public, and make the prosecution process more effective by providing a clear definition of fraud. The aim is to encompass most forms of fraudulent conduct within a law that is flexible enough to deal with developing technology. That could prove particularly beneficial in complex and serious fraud cases, and could shorten the time taken by each trial and lead to more efficient prosecutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para6"><a name="06061210000142">In the end, the Bill will help us to prosecute the criminal and to defend victims&#151;a goal common to us all. I commend it to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para19"><a name="06061214000003">Mr. Laurence Robertson (Tewkesbury) (Con): I rather regret the need for this debate, but having said that, I am pleased to have secured it and thank the Minister for attending. I want to set out the picture regarding health services in Gloucestershire and seek clarification from the Minister on a number of issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para20"><a name="06061214000004">There are three primary care trusts in Gloucestershire and one hospital trust. Cheltenham and Tewkesbury primary care trust, which covers most, but not all, of my constituency, is in surplus, but other trusts have been in deficit. The result is that across the county, there are some &#163;40 million-worth of deficits. All the trusts together are proposing cuts in health services amounting to some &#163;30 million, as things stand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para21"><a name="06061214000005">There is of course great opposition in Gloucestershire to this proposal. I have a petition with more than 2,200 names on it, which I hope to present to the House in the next few days. That constitutes a high percentage of the population affected. Indeed, there have been rallies and marches across Gloucestershire. My hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper), who cannot be here tonight, initiated a debate in the Chamber on 25 May, and he has been very active in opposing the cuts. Indeed, there is united opposition to them throughout the House. Members from the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties, and from the Government party, will seek to catch your eye to contribute to the debate, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and it might be helpful if I confirm that they have approached me to ask for permission to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para22"><a name="06061214000006">I should say at the outset that we of course have no disagreement with organisations balancing their books; every organisation must do that. Also, no one is going to accuse the Government of having cut spending on the health service, as that is not the case, so I hope that the Minister will not defend the Government against charges that I am not going to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para23"><a name="06061214000007">I turn first to my main, particular and most immediate concern&#151;I shall come on to others shortly&#151;which is the proposal to close Winchcombe hospital. It was built in 1928, with a lot of the funding provided by local people and benefactors. It provides a caring and comfortable convalescence for people, especially older people, recovering from operations or other treatment. It also provides a very helpful minor injuries unit in a rural area where public transport is not particularly useful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para24"><a name="06061214000008">The White Paper on community hospitals issued some while ago made it clear that community hospitals should not close</p>
<a name="60612-0012.htm_brev21"><a name="06061214000040"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in response to short-term budgetary pressures.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para25"><a name="06061214000009">Sensibly, it recognised the value of, and need for, such hospitals&#151;as, indeed, do I. I was recently treated at Tewkesbury community hospital within five minutes of having had a rather nasty car accident. The staff were excellent, and I pay tribute to them, and place on the record my thanks to them. The alternative to that treatment would have been a long car journey and delayed treatment, thereby putting additional pressure  <br>

on staff at, say, Cheltenham or Gloucester hospital. So although the White Paper opposes such closures, that is exactly what is being proposed in Gloucestershire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para26"><a name="06061214000010">People in Winchcombe are united in total opposition to the proposed closure of their hospital; they value it and they need its services. If it closes, they, too, will have to go to Cheltenham or Gloucester for immediate treatment, and those who are currently being treated or operated on in one of those hospitals will, presumably, have to be sent home early if Winchcombe hospital closes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para27"><a name="06061214000011">I acknowledge that there is a debate going on about how long people should stay in hospital, and I accept that nowadays, some people can go home earlier than they might have done in the past. Often, home is the best place for people to recover, but not always. A while ago, my daughter was sent home from hospital after a major operation the very next day, even though she had no one to look after her and had two children to look after herself. That is unacceptable these days, but if we close hospitals and reduce bed numbers, it will become common practice, which I would greatly regret.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para28"><a name="06061214000012">Have the people who make these decisions considered the knock-on costs&#151;to social services, for example? Have they calculated when people need help at home? In the light of meetings that I and others have had with Gloucestershire county council, which would have to provide many such services, it appears that those knock-on services have not been costed. According to the local primary care trust, they have not been costed. Its director of finance said today, when asked about the future alternative proposals:</p>
<a name="60612-0012.htm_brev22"><a name="06061214000041"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we have not calculated detailed costs yet.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para29"><a name="06061214000013">How does it know that the books will balance even after the cuts have been made, if those cuts have not been thoroughly thought through or properly costed? What that director did confirm was that closing the hospital will save only an estimated &#163;240,000 a year. How can that be right? How can that make financial, let alone clinical, sense?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para30"><a name="06061214000014">I am also concerned by the lack of joined-up thinking about the knock-on costs, and generally. For example, just recently the doctor&#146;s surgery in Winchcombe closed, and it was proposed that another one be built outside the centre. Why was no consideration given to moving the surgery to the hospital, and expanding the services available there instead of cutting them? The surgery would have remained in the centre of the town, where many old people live, and there would have been no need to build another one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para31"><a name="06061214000015">If the hospital is not needed, why are local health chiefs considering buying in several beds, for the very purpose of convalescence? We already have 22 beds at Winchcombe hospital, so why lose them and buy in beds from elsewhere? I totally oppose the proposal to close the hospital, but other cuts across the county also worry me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para32"><a name="06061214000016">For example, Delancey hospital, which is just outside my constituency and in that of my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), is also proposed for closure, but it provides a good service. St. Paul&#146;s maternity wing in Cheltenham general hospital was opened just 10 years ago at a cost of &#163;6 million, and that is proposed for closure. The overnight facilities at Battledown children&#146;s ward, also in Cheltenham hospital,  <br>

will be closed, and other hospitals in neighbouring constituencies are closing. Mental health units are being proposed for closure, and further cuts are being &#147;considered&#148;, but are not confirmed yet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para33"><a name="06061214000017">All that represents short-term thinking. Where will it end? The proposed closure of those and other services is extremely worrying. Why are we having those cuts at all, and whose fault are they? People are taking a stand not only because of the present proposals, but the further ones that they fear. We are not a third world country&#151;we are supposed to be the fourth largest economy in the world&#151;so why do we face those cuts? Are we not entitled to expect enhanced, more efficient health services, not just services cobbled together to match the particular budgetary pressures at the time?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para34"><a name="06061214000018">On 6 April 2005, the Prime Minister said from the Dispatch Box:</p>
<a name="60612-0012.htm_brev23"><a name="06061214000042"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is correct that we raised national insurance to pay for extra investment in the national health service.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 6 April 2005; Vol. 432, c. 1409.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para35"><a name="06061214000019">My constituents have paid the extra tax, but where is the money going? All they are seeing is cuts. Yes, they are getting vague promises from local health chiefs about better provision being on the way, and that health care will be provided in a different way in future. Well, we will believe it when we see it. If there is a better way to treat patients, why was not that way pursued before? Why does it take budgetary pressure to force decision-makers to follow the correct clinical path?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para36"><a name="06061214000020">Who is to blame? It is an interesting question. No doubt the Government have increased funding, but have they increased their requirements from trusts to the extent that the extra money has been swallowed up in extra costs? Or have the local health chiefs mismanaged the extra expenditure? I would like the Minister to give me her view of Gloucestershire, because I do not necessarily blame the Government. I want to explore tonight exactly where the fault lies. Who is to blame for the deficits? What is the Minister&#146;s view? How do we sort the deficits out? It could be done by closing front-line services and making patients suffer, but it could also be done more sensibly, given a little more time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="60612-0012.htm_para37"><a name="06061214000021">The question that I would most like the Minister to answer&#151;it is a crucial question that has been raised before&#151;is about the balancing of the budget. The local trusts claim that they have to balance their books for the whole of this financial year, including making up historic deficits within this financial year. I quote from their consultation document published just today:</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060612/debtext/60612-0013.htm"/>

Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), said that trusts would be expected to make improvements this year and achieve month-by-month balance by the end of the financial year.

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para2"><a name="06061214000024">She went on to say that in some cases, the worst ones will be allowed even more leniency. Who is right? Do the trusts have to achieve total balance for the year, including historic deficits, or do they have to achieve monthly balance by the end of this year? Because if the Secretary of State is right, the consultation paper in Gloucestershire has been launched on a false, even dishonest, premise.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman knows my position on this issue, but an answer to his question would greatly help the strategic health authority. When I saw Trevor Jones, the chief executive, 10 days ago he made it clear that if the strategic health authority was given guidance that the aim was a month-by-month balance, it would change its interpretation of the strategic framework. It is vital that my hon. Friend the Minister provides some guidance, because we may be working on false premises.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, and I know that he shares my concerns. He makes the point well: the strategic health authority is in touch with the primary care trust and providing instructions&#151;I nearly said guidance&#151;but we do not know whether they are correct. If we go by what the Secretary of State says&#151;and that is in writing&#151;the SHA&#146;s interpretation is wide of the mark. I hope that the Minister will clarify the situation. I reiterate that the trusts should balance their books, but how long have they been given to do it? If it can be done over a slightly longer period, the cuts might not be necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para3"><a name="06061214000027">I wish to make a further point about top-slicing. The PCT covering most of my area in Cheltenham and Tewkesbury was actually in surplus last year. However, it is cutting front-line services to help to balance the books of others. That, it seems, is the penalty for achieving better financial management. As if that were not bad enough, the Government are forcing the Gloucestershire trusts to bail out the others under the same SHA to tune of more than &#163;6 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para4"><a name="06061214000028">In her statement last week, the Secretary of State said that</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is added nonsense in the concept of repayment in that particular case, of which the Minister may not be aware? For Cheltenham and Tewkesbury PCT to ask for the money to be repaid to it by Cotswold and Vale is a nonsense, because the two will merge in any case. So the money lost to Cheltenham and Tewkesbury will never be repaid.</p>

another, and west Gloucestershire makes up a large part of my constituency. However, it does appear that good financial management is being penalised by that top-slicing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para7"><a name="06061214000033">In fact, Gloucestershire loses out in the first place when it comes to funding. We receive only 88 per cent. of national average funding. That is supposed to be because we are healthier, but&#151;as local health chiefs point out&#151;healthy people live longer, and older people cost the NHS even more money. So where is the joined-up thinking in that particular philosophy? Where is the joined-up thinking about the NHS generally?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para8"><a name="06061214000034">To follow up the point made by the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood), I should explain that when I was elected in 1997 there was one Gloucestershire health authority. At present there are three PCTs, but there is a proposal to revert to one; in other words, we are to go back to exactly where we were nine years ago, except that there is now another tier of bureaucracy&#151;the pointless strategic health authority, which costs more than &#163;5 million a year to run. Even that is being tinkered with, because it will cover a different area. The situation is ridiculous. A number of PCTs and hospital trusts, under a single SHA, are making far-reaching decisions. Those PCTs will not exist come October, and the SHA will not exist in its present form by the end of the summer, yet massive cuts are being planned by people who probably will not be in post to carry them out&#151;or to carry the can for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para9"><a name="06061214000035">I referred earlier to the consultation document published by the health chiefs today. They wanted a consultation period of only five weeks, but Members and some members of Gloucestershire county council managed to exert enough pressure to get the deadline extended to 12 weeks. That is still not a long time, but, farcically, it takes us to the point when the people making the proposals might all be seeking alternative employment. At the end of the consultation period, none of them might be in post, such is the nonsense of the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para10"><a name="06061214000036">As well as containing dubious phrases such as the one I quoted earlier, the document insults the intelligence of the people of Gloucestershire. Among other &#147;motherhood and apple pie&#148; questions, it asks:</p>
<a name="60612-0013.htm_brev4"><a name="06061214000047"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Do you think that helping people to stay fit and well is an important principle?&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para11"><a name="06061214000037">For goodness sake, what kind of smokescreen, what kind of sham, is this public consultation exercise? Will the people be listened to or will their views be ignored, as they normally are?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para12"><a name="06061214000038">There is an unhappy situation in Gloucestershire. We are paying more tax to fund the NHS, yet we are losing our hospitals. The Government are piling billions of pounds into the NHS, yet a quarter of the country&#146;s PCTs are in deficit. Local health chiefs say that they have to balance the books within the current financial year, yet the Government say that they have to achieve a monthly balance. The Government claim that they are reforming the NHS, but in truth they are merely tinkering with its structures. The net result is that the people of Gloucestershire, especially older people, children, poorer people, the pregnant and the mentally ill&#151;in other words, the vulnerable&#151;all lose out.</p>

If she only does that we shall have made some progress, but otherwise the most vulnerable and the most in need will lose out.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) on initiating the debate. This is the fourth such debate in which I have taken part over the last month: two of them were about health in Gloucestershire, the others were about maternity provision and community hospitals, which relate directly to my area, where I face the prospect of losing both.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para14"><a name="06061217000002">Like the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), I took part in the rally in Stroud on Saturday&#151;I mentioned it to the Minister before we came into the Chamber. It is estimated that about 4,000 people were at the rally, at which both the hon. Member for Cotswold and I were able to speak. There was immense feeling about the proposals and I said that I would echo it in the Chamber&#151;it could certainly have been heard at Westminster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para15"><a name="06061217000003">Earlier today, I took part in a meeting of the overview and scrutiny committee organised by the county council, which included representatives from the district councils. I have come straight from that meeting, which is why my brow is more furrowed than normal, and I want to raise with the Minister some points about the consultation on partnership trusts. As the hon. Member for Tewkesbury said, although we managed to extend the PCT consultation so that it takes place over 12 weeks, the consultation period for the partnership trusts&#151;the mental health and learning disability trusts in Gloucestershire&#151;will finish on 23 June, which is a mere five weeks. Without putting words into the mouth of the overview and scrutiny committee, it is fair to say that it is looking carefully into the discontinuity between the PCT consultation, which has yet to start formally, and the consultation on partnership trusts, which has reached the mid-way point, if not the final stage. I hope that the Minister will comment on that, as the situation does not make much sense; another &#163;12 million has yet to be found from the PCTs and, given what they could later demand, that could have an enormous impact on the partnership trusts.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises an important point, because there is no reason at all for the dissimilarity&#151;for the general consultation to take 12 weeks and the consultation on mental health partnerships to take only five weeks. The overview and scrutiny process for mental health partnerships should be just as long because the mentally ill need more time to adjust to the changes that will be brought on them and those making representations on their behalf need more time to make their case.</p>

 I agree and make no apology for concentrating on that point, because that is the most urgent consultation. On Saturday, the hon. Gentleman heard a lady make a most emotional speech about the implication of the proposals for her nearest and dearest. People feel very let down because they have been given almost no time or opportunity to make their case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para16"><a name="06061217000006">The Chamber heard the request of the hon. Member for Tewkesbury that the Minister clarify whether we are talking about a month-on-month balance or historical deficits that have to be cleared in a matter of months. We need an explanation, because that is the nub of the problem we face in Gloucestershire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para17"><a name="06061217000007">There is a second problem and I make no apology for continuing to labour the point, because it is important: the relationship between Gloucestershire and its partners in the SHA. It is hardly acerbic to note that Gloucestershire feels let down by the fact that it happens to be in a strategic health authority, other parts of which have run up large deficits over a period of time. The hon. Member for Tewkesbury made several points about why that should not have been allowed to happen, but it has been allowed to happen. As a result, according to the operating framework that the SHA is passing down on tablets of stone, Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire SHA is being asked to reduce its turnover by 5.3 per cent., against a national average of 3.4 per cent. That may not sound much, but there is still a problem. Some trusts in Gloucestershire have been in balance or close to balance, although it is true that Cotswold and Vale PCT, which is my PCT and that of the hon. Member for Cotswold, has been a problem for a long time, but that problem does not extend to other parts of the SHA. We are being asked to provide ballast across an area for considerable problems in the past. We know that, because about &#163;175 million from the NHS bank has gone elsewhere into other parts of the SHA, not a penny of which was ever put into Gloucestershire, even though Cotswold and Vale has had its own problems. I ask the Minister for a commitment that we shall get some real figures&#151;disaggregation of the figures&#151;for the entire SHA, even in breaking it down within primary care trusts so that we know where the money has been spent as well as where the cuts are being levelled. It is vital that we know where the real money has gone and how that money can be accounted for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para18"><a name="06061217000008">I have one request from the overview and scrutiny committee, which I will put to the Minister. It wrote some seven weeks ago to the Secretary of State seeking clarification on budgetary issues. That was mainly in terms of the month-on-month balance. It has yet to receive a response from the Secretary of State. The committee seeks clarity and it wants to see the Secretary of State. I pass on to my hon. Friend the Minister that urgent request. The committee is now mid-way through the first of its consultations. Yet it could be labouring under a great misapprehension, as the hon. Member for Cotswold rightly said. The committee could be being asked to make a decision on something that is a false premise. There should be quick clarification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para19"><a name="06061217000009">I will concentrate rather more on the partnership trust, the mental health and learning disability trust in Gloucestershire, which is mid-way through its existing  <br>

consultation. What is the trust being asked to save? I have already said that the national average is 3.4 per cent. in turnover. The SHA is asking us to save 5.3 per cent. in turnover. The partnership trust is being asked to save 12.8 per cent., which is &#163;9.6 million, of its planned expenditure. I do not know whether that means one and the same as turnover. However, I take it to be that an even greater amount of savings is required of the partnership trust than anything else that is being required within Gloucestershire, and maybe within the entire SHA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para20"><a name="06061217000010">As the hon. Member for Cotswold said clearly, about 36 per cent. of older people&#146;s services for mental health and learning disabilities are to be cut. That is a huge reduction in expenditure. It is all driven by the mad idea that we have to come into balance. I do not know where the figures come from for the partnership trust. That is given the historic overspend, which I did not know was there until suddenly it appeared, and the deficit that is coming this year. I do know where the &#163;2.2 million comes from, which is the contribution to the NHS recovery programme. That seems so unfair given the other cuts that have to be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para21"><a name="06061217000011">It would help me and other Gloucestershire Members who are in their places this evening to know exactly where the figures come from and why a small trust&#151;a specialist trust&#151;is being asked to make a disproportionate contribution in trying to come back into balance. This makes a big difference to my constituency because of the potential changes at Weavers Croft. It is not likely that Weavers Croft will close completely but it will lose its beds. We do not know the impact of the beds that were brought across from Bourton ward in Cirencester, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Cotswold. As far as I know, that has never been evaluated given the impact that that had when we had some 120 beds for older people&#146;s services. We now intend to cut the number to 65 if the proposals are adhered to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para22"><a name="06061217000012">I move on to the Tyndale centre in Dursley in my constituency, where we have already lost day centre provision. That has been lost also at Weavers Croft. There must be questions about whether those facilities will ever be picked up and from where they will be run. As was rightly said by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury, we must focus on the impact, which will be dramatic on social services. I heard the social services committee make a presentation to the overview and scrutiny committee. I was not clear whether anyone has undertaken a detailed impact analysis of the changes that are being proposed. If that has not been undertaken, somebody should see that it is. In this place, we would never allow the nature of proposals to be given superficial treatment, which is what they appear to be receiving. That is not a criticism of the overview and scrutiny committee because it is saying that it has unclear and scanty information about the different proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para23"><a name="06061217000013">The organisations in the voluntary sector need to be brought into the process. Underneath the radar, as well as the institutions that are much loved and being fought over, many other changes are being proposed. For example, it is proposed that there should be a 50 per cent. further cut in the passenger transport service. In Gloucestershire, if someone does not have a car they have no quality of life. If someone does not  <br>

have a car and he or she is ill, it is unclear how they can get to the necessary services. The local newspaper&#151;I refer again to the lady who spoke on Saturday&#151;ran a particular campaign to try to get her to Cheltenham. Visiting took two hours and the situation was difficult for her. Is that something that people can and should be asked to do?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para24"><a name="06061217000014">I could go on much longer about the impact on maternity provision. There will be future debates in this place and I have no doubt that, if we do not get satisfaction, we shall go on to examine some of the other service provision, such as the community hospital closure programme, including the Berkeley hospital, which will not save any money because the idea is to move Berkeley up to the Cam and Dursley area. In some instances that makes sense because that is where the larger population is. However, I am not in the mood to agree to a cut in provision when we have no money, apparently, to re-provide a better service anywhere. It would be daft for any Member to say, &#147;I can see that that will be a good move.&#148; We are being asked to make dramatic cuts without any possibility of new investment coming into the county. It would be ludicrous to go along with the proposal unless we have some clarity on what needs to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="60612-0013.htm_para25"><a name="06061217000015">I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to provide clarity so that we can nail tonight what we mean by coming into balance. We must examine the particular problems of the strategic health authority. These are matters that are serious to Gloucestershire. We feel unfairly treated because of the nature of the SHA with which we unfortunately happen be placed. We need clarity also about the series of consultations that are being held so that we understand more about the impact analysis. That is clearly not happening at present. That is all to do with the speed at which the changes are being driven through. The direction may be right, but we need to separate the direction from the financial imposition. We certainly need to separate it from the speed at which people are being asked to make drastic decisions that have an impact on the young and the old and everyone else who is either a carer or someone who really cares for the facilities in question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="60612-0014.htm_para0"><a name="06061217000018">Why are we here? Are we here to complain about less money for healthier, wealthier areas? No, I am not. I accept the principle that health service funds have to be targeted and that that may mean that areas such as Gloucestershire receive less funds per capita under some circumstances than areas of greater overall deprivation. However, one of the problems with the cuts and the savings proposals that are being imposed on Gloucestershire is that even in towns that may be prosperous as a whole, such as Cheltenham, there are areas of deprivation. It is the most vulnerable and poorest people in those towns who are being hit hardest, because they are the people without transport. They are the people who find it difficult to access services in other towns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="60612-0014.htm_para1"><a name="06061217000019">Are we here to blame local NHS managers? That is what the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Lammy), said on &#147;Newsnight&#148; last week. He was asked whether local NHS managers were to blame and he said, &#147;Yes.&#148; But surely that cannot be true. As neighbouring Members have said, in Cheltenham and Tewkesbury in particular, we have a partnership trust with three stars that was about to be in the first wave of foundation trusts; Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Trust, which is a low-cost provider of health care by national standards and is very efficient; and, above all, Cheltenham and Tewkesbury primary care trust, which has never been in deficit and this year posted a &#163;1.2 million surplus. Our NHS managers have done everything right. They have done everything that the Government asked of them. The primary care trust was described in <i> The Daily Telegraph</i>, which I do not often read, but which I am sympathetic to today&#151;as arguably &#147;the perfect PCT&#148; that has done everything that the Government asked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="60612-0014.htm_para2"><a name="06061217000020">Are we discussing how patient care is improving everywhere, as the Secretary of State told the House last week? Well, no, that cannot be true either, although I will prevent the Minister from having to recite the usual things about additional investment in the NHS by saying that I am pleased that there has been additional investment in the NHS. I recognise that, and my party welcomed and supported additional investment in the NHS. We acknowledge the real improvements in health services that have taken place, including the reduction in waiting lists. However, that is not the issue today. The way in which the Government have gone about delivering that spending has led to breathtaking inconsistencies and results that I am sure that they did not intend, but which are proving devastating for our local NHS. We have overspending on things such as the GP contract, the consultant contract and the new out-of-hours service, and even on worthy initiatives such as NHS Direct, which I understand has gone massively over budget.</p>

to the trusts&#146; funding tariff, the change to funding NHS dentistry, the reorganisation of the strategic health authorities, and the reorganisation of the primary care trusts, which means that the very managers who are supposed to be coping with all this change and coping with the cuts in front-line services are in the process of having to be made redundant and applying for new jobs themselves. It is little surprise that the overall sense is of panic and confusion and that, as the hon. Member for Stroud pointed out, there is a real misunderstanding of exactly which numbers are which and whether savings have to be made month by month, or whether we are talking about clearing all the financial deficits in one year, which is the line that has been fed down to local managers, as they understand it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="60612-0014.htm_para4"><a name="06061217000022">Then we have the political decision&#151;in effect, the political decision that the deficits, however they have arisen and whoever&#146;s fault they are, have to be cleared in one year and have to be funded not from other areas of Government spending, but from the successful areas of the NHS such as ours. There is no law that says that the NHS has to live within its means in any particular budget year. Once the deficits have arisen, it is a political decision as to how unsuccessful areas are bailed out. If one wants to be brutal and insist that they live within their means and make up the whole deficit in one year themselves, that is one argument, but that is not what the Government are saying. The Government are saying, &#147;Well, actually, we will bail them out. They don&#146;t have to live within their means this year.&#148; Where one bails them out from is the political decision. The Government are saying, &#147;We won&#146;t bail them out from ID cards or from troop commitments in Iraq or any number of other areas of Government. We will bail them out from the most successful areas of the NHS such as Cheltenham and Tewkesbury.&#148;</p>

On 28 March, 27 Gloucestershire health community savings proposals were announced. I am afraid that no clinical justification was given with them. Of those proposals, 22 are about front-line care. For Cheltenham and Tewkesbury, this means that we have faced a triple whammy. First, our primary care trust economised and tried to live within its means&#151;despite less funding for being a healthier, wealthier area. It made economies and did not launch initiatives that it could not afford. So we lost out there. Secondly, there is top-slicing, which the hon. Member for Stroud has talked about. Finally, we are losing services that we simply share with primary care trusts such as Cotswold and Vale, because they are our neighbours and, overall, we have to make savings on the basis of what has now been invented as the Gloucestershire health community. The promise that I was given about a year ago that the savings and the financial recovery plans would apply only in their own geographical areas has gone by the wayside.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes some powerful points. Does he agree that there is a further problem, albeit a short-term one? Given that the PCTs are going to be changed this year, there could be redundancy payments and extra pension payments. I accept that that will be a one-off cost, but it will make balancing the books even more difficult. Is it not only reasonable that the trusts should be a given a little bit of time to balance the books?</p>

 I entirely agree with that. In fact, the atmosphere in which things are being done is so febrile that, at a recent meeting where all the county&#146;s MPs met the chief executives of the trusts, I asked about the impact of having to take more time&#151;quite properly&#151;over consultation. The impact was another &#163;1 million of savings that they were told to find. The manager who replied to the question said that they did not think that even the existing savings proposals would make up the amount that they were being asked to save by the strategic health authority and, above it, the Department of Health. The atmosphere of financial crisis is all-pervasive. The numbers vary. I managed to find a total of &#163;29 million, but the hon. Gentleman has mentioned figures in excess of &#163;30 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="60612-0014.htm_para6"><a name="06061217000026">I am afraid that the result is not, as the Secretary of State believes, patient care improving everywhere. Instead, there are real impacts on front-line care. St. Paul&#146;s maternity wing is a first class maternity ward that is just 10 years old. We celebrate its 10th birthday party this Wednesday. It is in Sandford park at 12 o&#146;clock if the Minister cares to come along. She might find a rather hostile reception. I was born in its predecessor hospital. We have had that service in Cheltenham since the 1940s&#151;long before this Government were elected. My children were both born in the ward. It delivers 2,600 babies a year and serves a town with a population of 110,000 people. It draws in mothers who wish to give birth there from as far afield as Banbury, Malvern and Evesham, and even from beyond Gloucester in the Forest of Dean. One might arguably say that if one maternity ward were to close it might be Gloucester&#146;s rather than Cheltenham&#146;s, since Cheltenham&#146;s seems to be rather more popular. However, I would not want to encourage recent accusations of snobbery in that respect. The most important thing is that Cheltenham women want to give birth in Cheltenham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="60612-0014.htm_para7"><a name="06061217000027">A patient safety argument has been made in favour of the proposal&#151;rather after the event since it came up as a savings proposals. It is argued that bigger and better maternity wards are always safer. That might be true, but in the end that is an argument for the entire country going to St. Mary&#146;s in Paddington for their delivery. There is always a balance of risk to be struck. In a meeting today, midwives put to me the risk posed by combining dual centres into one centre. That makes the maternity ward more vulnerable to infections such as clostridium difficile and the much more widely known MRSA. The whole trend of obstetrics and midwifery recently has been away from big hospitalised units towards smaller, friendly units, and away from treating maternity as a sickness and towards regarding it as a healthy, normal process.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is making the case for Stroud, which is a wonderful midwife-led unit. I am sure that he will agree that there is a lot of evidence that, where obstetrics and gynaecology are in an acute setting, there is a tendency for more intervention, whereas obviously in a place such as Stroud and in midwife-led units elsewhere, there is a belief in natural childbirth, which is what a lot of women choose. If we close down Stroud and Cheltenham, we are taking away that choice.</p>

interventions. The midwives I met to discuss this issue with, who were concerned&#151;indeed, appalled&#151;by the proposed closure of St. Paul&#146;s, were worried that a bigger, more industrial-scale unit at Gloucester would lead to more interventions, not fewer interventions, thereby achieving exactly the reverse of what Government policy is supposed to be. The notion of patient choice is ludicrous, because Gloucestershire has been left with a single maternity ward. Where is the choice? There is a choice of one, as we will close two maternity wards that would have provided some competition&#151;in new competitive speak.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="60612-0014.htm_para8"><a name="06061217000030">The increased drive time to the new maternity centre in Gloucestershire poses a risk to Cheltenham. The drive from one of the poorest parts of my constituency, Clyde crescent, to Cheltenham general hospital takes five minutes in the middle of the afternoon. If maternity services move to Gloucestershire royal hospital under the proposal, drive time will increase to 23 minutes, which is a fourfold increase and represents nothing other than an increased risk.</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman is concerned about the risk of travelling from Cheltenham to Gloucester, will he consider the position of my constituents in the north Cotswolds? It will take them at least 20 minutes to reach Cheltenham, even by ambulance, and they will have another 20 minute ride from Cheltenham to Gloucester, so they will indeed be at risk.</p>

The loss of non-geriatric mental health services at the Charlton Lane centre in my constituency will be reflected in the loss of adult mental heath places overall in Gloucestershire. The mother of a girl who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia&#151;I shall change her name to protect her identity&#151;recently wrote to me: </p>
<a name="60612-0014.htm_brev0"><a name="06061217000070"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Younger patients, like Emily, will either go to an already existing hospital in Gloucester, whose beds will be heavily over-subscribed, or be...treated in their own homes by rapid response teams. These people cannot give the 24 hour treatment that Charlton Lane Centre gives, patients will be left in their homes to fend for themselves for much of the time. When Emily is poorly, the voices take over the whole of her thoughts and she is unable to cook, clean, shop or take proper care of herself. Those are the physical problems, added to these are the mental problems, the fear, the thought that someone will kill her is always very strong in her mind at these times, that is why she runs, to escape. The voices always tell her she is going to be killed, which in itself is a totally distressing and debilitating state of mind. There are lots of mental health sufferers in the community, but there are times that they can only properly be cared for on a 24 hour basis with properly trained staff in hospitals designed for this purpose. With this closure, there will be a chronic shortage of beds. I feel the Government and the Local Government will be letting down the most vulnerable section of our community with what is so obviously nothing more than a cost cutting exercise. A broken arm can mend at home once the patient has received the correct medical care, a broken mind requires a lot more care and attention if the patient is to survive.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="60612-0014.htm_para10"><a name="06061217000034">I could not have put it more eloquently. We need to consider whether the decision to provide more care in the community for mental health is the correct direction of travel. There is an argument for trying to encourage clients to be less reliant on institutional services, but surely that proposal, along with bed closures, should follow the successful implementation of community care. It is particularly brutal to close the service and hope that those vulnerable people will cope while it is withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="60612-0014.htm_para11"><a name="06061217000035">There have been cuts in community nursing, health visitors and community palliative care, too. Surely, the Government should encourage such services in the new direction of travel, but I met nurses today who said that the implementation of the cuts had resulted in qualified district nurses being replaced by nursing auxiliaries. The mix of nurses in Cheltenham and Tewkesbury is 85 per cent. qualified and 15 per cent. unqualified nursing auxiliaries, but under the proposals, that will change to 50 per cent. qualified and 50 per cent. unqualified. Nurses will arrive in someone&#146;s home in the community and find that they have complex health needs. Those nurses may be unable to cope, whereas in hospital they could ask a more senior or qualified nurse for assistance. A palliative care nurse told me that she was certain that there would be a big impact on the care provided to patients. The first community palliative care nurse post has been frozen, although the population is ageing and improved therapies mean that people spend longer in the palliative care phase of treatment. As a result, more care is needed, not less.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="60612-0014.htm_para12"><a name="06061217000036">Finally, there is a deep sense of injustice in Cheltenham at the loss of overnight children&#146;s care at Battledown. The loss of that service is a stark illustration of the fact that, even though the clinical case was made for its retention, it was subject to a budget cut. A year ago, after a 27,000-signature petition and a &#163;40,000 consultation, in which 98 per cent. of correspondence was in favour of the service, a recommendation was made to accept the clinical case for keeping overnight care at Battledown children&#146;s ward, as 350 children a year would benefit. I pay tribute to Julie Coles, Carol Jones, David Downie and many others who campaigned tirelessly for the service. The recommendation resulted in the acceptance by all three primary care trusts in Gloucestershire that a nurse-led unit should proceed. The decision that overnight care should be saved was minuted&#151;I have provided the Secretary of State with a copy&#151;but it was overturned only weeks before the launch of the unit on the basis of cost. It was listed as a savings proposal, and thus the death knell was sounded for overnight care.</p>

 I know something about the issue, which I have debated as a governor of the acute trust.

That was discussed properly by the acute trust, but none of the proposals, including proposals from the trust itself, were discussed by the governors. Does the hon.

dragged to four such debates. She is in an unenviable position, but we would be grateful if we could get some answers and some clarity from her this evening. As has been pointed out by everyone who has spoken in the debate, the chief issue on which we need clarification is exactly what remit our primary care trusts are working to. Are they working to a remit of clawing back previous deficits, or are they working to a remit merely of bringing the situation back nearer to balance by the end of the financial year? That is critical.</p>

More important, I hope she will be able to give an instruction to the strategic health authority if the remit is different from the one to which it is working. If the SHA is working to the more severe remit, it may well be making decisions and unnecessary cuts to institutions. We had a dire announcement on what I call black Wednesday a few weeks ago, in which 12 of our health institutions in Gloucestershire were shut or severely curtailed, and several hundred jobs and 250 beds were to be lost.</p>

We may find beds being closed on the lure of a possible new facility, but we may well not get that facility. That type of comment pervades the whole debate. The hon. Members for Stroud and for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) made that point clearly. In Cirencester I am faced with the cut of an entire ward of elderly mentally ill patients.</p>

No new facilities are yet available in Gloucester, where all those elderly mentally ill patients are supposed to go. The existing facilities could be closed before the alternative is arranged. That would be a cruel irony for elderly mentally ill patients. The hon. Member for Stroud noted that a cut, if it is that, of 30 per cent. of the activity of the partnership or mental health trust is a huge cut, and it affects some of the most vulnerable people in society. My constituency used to have&#151;I do not know whether the statistic is still up to date&#151;the third highest number of over-80-year-olds of any constituency in the country.

For example, with digital X-ray technology, it is easy to send X-rays to a consultant sitting many miles away at the district general hospital and get advice as to the sort of treatment that should be given. It can then be given locally, instead of all the time wasted by the patient having to be taken, perhaps by ambulance, to the district general hospital on another day with another appointment, with all that costing a great deal of money. I urge the Minister to look into some of the modern technologies available and see what can be done locally.</p>

That is not what I am suggesting. If they cost a large sum to maintain, for goodness sake let us sell them and build new facilities that are cheaper to maintain. In Fairford, where the local community has rallied round the League of Friends of Fairford Hospital, we have a very innovative solution. Since March, they have got a private sector provider involved, they have found a new site, they have been talking to the planners, who have given the matter favourable consideration, and it is possible for them to propose a package to provide a new modern day care facility, combined with doctors   <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="60612-0015.htm_para7"><a name="06061217000057">Will the Minister lay out a blueprint of the pitfalls and the way forward for such a scheme? In particular, the League of Friends is asking how much of the proceeds of the sale of Fairford hospital they are likely to receive to put forward for the new facility. Such questions need to be considered. The Minister should consider this innovative proposal, as it might get her off the hook in similar difficult situations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="60612-0015.htm_para8"><a name="06061217000058">The situation of maternity services, about which the hon. Member for Stroud spoke, is one of the strands of the cuts that we are facing. As he said, he and I marched, along with 4,000 people, on a boiling hot day in Stroud on Saturday. We met young mothers and many of the children born at that hospital. About 400 young mothers a year have their children at Stroud maternity hospital. It is one of the few maternity facilities left in Gloucestershire, and if we lose that and the facility in Cheltenham, as the hon. Member for Cheltenham mentioned, all the young women will have to travel to Gloucester to have their babies. I was not making a disparaging intervention on the hon. Gentleman. I was trying to point out to him that if he is worried about the risk of patients travelling for 20 or 25 minutes from Cheltenham to Gloucester, the people from the north Cotswolds have first to travel to Cheltenham and then on from Cheltenham to Gloucester, so whatever the risk for his constituents, they are double for mine. If it takes 40 minutes to get there, I think it entirely possible that some babies, especially second babies, will be born in the ambulance long before they get to Gloucester.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="60612-0015.htm_para9"><a name="06061217000059">I think that there will be an increasing tendency for young mothers to have their babies at home. I am not a clinician and will not comment on that possibility, but we have been told for years that young mothers should have their babies in hospital because better care can be provided there. I think that more and more young mothers will choose to have their babies at home, particularly when no clinical danger is identified in pre-natal and post-natal classes. I am concerned about the large unit in Gloucester, and the hon. Member for Cheltenham has already mentioned the risk of MRSA. A small unit would be useful, because many mothers will not need to stay in it for very long.</p>

 I did not mean to dismiss the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern about his constituents&#146; drive times and accept his point. My point is that the percentage increase in drive times is probably greater from within the urban areas. When I asked the chief executive of the NHS trust about second children&#151;my second child was born within minutes of getting through the doors of St. Paul&#146;s&#151;and whether my child would have been born on the A40, he said that nature will take its course.

It is difficult for hon. Members who represent urban areas to understand that public transport in areas such as the north Cotswolds is almost non-existent. It is difficult for someone who is about to have a baby and who may have other children with them to catch a bus from the north Cotswolds to Cheltenham and to change buses in Cheltenham to go on to Gloucester. People who are sitting in offices trying to plan larger and, in their view, better units sometimes fail to take into account the extreme difficulties of people who must travel to those hospitals, particularly when they do not have cars and live in rural areas. My PCT has estimated that every year patients in Gloucestershire travel 1 million miles to out-patient appointments. We are all concerned about global warming, and such distances seem distinctly unsustainable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="60612-0015.htm_para11"><a name="06061217000063">One other aspect of the matter has not been emphasised sufficiently in debate this evening. At Friday&#146;s meeting with health chiefs, it was made clear that those people who are referred to the larger units in the acute hospitals in Cheltenham and Gloucester will be discharged more quickly, which means that they will require greater care. In the announcement several Wednesday&#146;s ago, however, we were told that community nurses, health visitors, physiotherapists and other at-home services would also be curtailed. We have got a lot of vacancies for community visitors in the north Cotswolds, and I think that when some people are discharged from hospital it will be impossible to deliver their home help care package, which will cause them hardship. I ask the Minister to consider that point carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="60612-0015.htm_para12"><a name="06061217000064">I do not think that social services have been sufficiently involved in the discussions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury has said, the effect of the changes on other agencies has not been costed. As the hon. Member for Stroud has mentioned, a lot of voluntary transport activity goes on in my constituency. If patients are going to be discharged from hospital more quickly, they may be distressed and more difficult to transport. As we are finding from our constituency postbags, some of the people who have been discharged from hospital are not suitable for home care. That means that they must be readmitted, which is, again, an extra cost.</p>

 I worry about patients with dementia who do not need to be in a clinical setting but who may need to travel periodically to the centre of excellence, which is a problem with the proposal to provide one unit at Charlton lane. Many such people will have to travel by voluntary transport, which is a difficult thing to ask a voluntary driver to take on.</p>

 I agree. The matter concerns patients going to and from hospital not only for treatment, but for consultations. The distances will be much larger than those currently travelled to the community hospital.</p>

When the Conservative party left office in 1997, there were area health authorities, which this Government reorganised into strategic health authorities. As has been said, there was one care trust for Gloucestershire, which was considered to be too big. It was reorganised into three primary care trusts, which are now considered to be too small and will be merged back into one PCT. Indeed, the SHA set up by this Government will be merged into at least two SHAs. All that reorganisation costs a great deal of money&#151;it means that people are made redundant and that offices are closed. We should reorganise the health service now, but then we should leave it alone for 10 years.</p>

It is important to have that written down. As Public Health Minister, I would say that for too long, and too often, health improvement and promoting good health have been the poor relations in terms of providing treatment in our NHS services. In my 12 months in this post, I have begun increasingly to realise that we could do more not only to prevent people from having the conditions that mean that they go into hospital in the first place, but&#151;now that technology and drugs are better than ever before for a person who has had, for example, a heart attack or cancer&#151;to make the step change in helping that individual to look after themselves, having had possibly the best treatment in the world, and to keep themselves fitter and healthier for longer.</p>

 I am glad that the hon. Gentleman makes that point. Historically, part of the problem is that public health has often lost out when pressure has been brought to bear on PCTs from the acute sector.

terms of outcomes&#151;we must have a discussion about how many of our services should be provided in hospitals, and how many of the services that are provided in hospitals should have a better link to community services, particularly for people with long-term conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="60612-0015.htm_para17"><a name="06061221000005">This lunchtime, I was at a conference with the Local Government Association. We are continuing to work, more than ever before, on looking at the role of public health in relation to the way in which local government runs its business. Factors such as the development of housing, safer communities and the general environment all have a role to play in public health. As for smoking cessation, next year we will put in place legislation that will make most public places smoke-free. That will be a major contribution to changing the culture around smoking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="60612-0015.htm_para18"><a name="06061221000006">To achieve a more mature, wide-ranging and long-term view of public health, we need to tackle the traditional situation in the health service whereby funding has overwhelmingly been directed towards those in the acute sector at the expense of those in the community. Painful choices are being made because of the need to deal with the deficits in a minority of organisations. That is causing problems even for PCTs that are in balance. My own PCTs in Doncaster&#151;an area with huge health challenges&#151;are in balance. In 1997 they were having to bail out other sectors of the NHS, but that was based on previous ways in which funding was organised and so was not done transparently&#151;it was a fix designed to make everything look all right. It was not all right then, it was not all right in 1987, it was not all right in 1977, and it is not all right in 2006&#151;but now we have an opportunity to try to get it right once and for all.</p>

In relation to the consultation launched today on the different services in the Gloucestershire area, I will not deny for one minute that there is clearly a financial imperative. I have read the document and had discussions with hon. Members and health professionals in other regions that I cover, and it is clear that in trying to find a way forward we have to take into account people&#146;s understandable commitment to the health provision that they perceive that they are getting at the moment, as against what they might want in future. Those may be two different things. Someone who is 80 might want something very different from someone who is 60, and very different from what I, as someone in my 40s, might want when I am 70, 80 or even older. Part of this process&#151;I am aware that it is a difficult one&#151;is the honest discussion that people need to have about the services currently provided, and the shortfalls and problems involved, as against what else would be on offer.</p>

costs by 15 per cent., for example, that should be done anyway; we should not have to get to this crisis point. People will not accept that these changes are being made for the right reasons, because they read in the press that the NHS has severe financial problems and is cutting, not planning. The problem is that local health chiefs are not planning.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that constructive contribution. I have met representatives of the strategic health authority and the primary care trusts. I hope that it is generally agreed that we cannot manage the health service from the centre, because the needs of one area are different from those of another and are affected by factors such as health challenge and geography.

We&#146;ve gone from &#163;30 billion to &#163;60 billion, and to &#163;90 billion for the NHS in the next few years.&#148; The last sentence is the only mantra that I shall recite in the debate but it is true, and worth saying. People may have put off making decisions, but when somebody says, &#147;Hang on, we&#146;ve got sort out these finances, because you can&#146;t carry on like this,&#148; perhaps they will suddenly start to take notice. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and others will make those points locally. I am sure that they will be raised with existing personnel and in the context of future reorganisation of PCTs. Managing the current position and, as the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) said, ways in which to ensure that it does not happen again, will be considered.

 There are all sorts of reasons why some organisations have got into financial problems, as the hon. Gentleman will be aware.

There is not just one reason for the problems. However, it is fair to ask those that are not in balance why they are not. Also, we need a system that will get them back into balance.</p>

<p><a name="st_o241"><a name="06061221000026"><a name="60612-0016.htm_spnew4"><a name="06061221000081"><b>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</b>
 We have suffered particularly in Gloucestershire because the Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire strategic health authority had the biggest deficit in the country, at some &#163;100 million. We are suffering because of the mismanagement in Bath and Bristol, and because for many years we have not had the capital allocations that other areas have had. Now the Minister is top-slicing us and giving some of our money away to Wiltshire, so we really are being hammered in Gloucestershire. I hope that she will take that into account.</p>

 I appreciate the difficulties experienced when areas that are in balance have to help out others. I, too, am in that situation locally to a certain degree. It is important that all Members whose areas are in similar situation should make this point locally, and ask clearly what they can expect back. This is not a process that will keep happening year in, year out. It is going to be put right, to provide a much more sustainable future. That is absolutely fair. From what I understand, trusts in deficit will have to provide to the strategic health authorities a clear plan for dealing with their deficit. This should also be open to the trusts that are in balance, so that those that are helping out in different ways will be clearer about what is being done to improve the situation.</p>

 The Minister repeatedly talks about the problems of tackling the trusts that are in deficit and their need to live within their means. However, the trust covering Cheltenham and Tewkesbury has lived within its means, but it cannot be repaid at some mythical point in the future, because it is merging with one of the trusts that is in deficit now. Local services are being hurt not only because of the top-slicing but because services that are shared with that neighbouring trust are being cut. So we are being penalised twice over.</p>

 I cannot be clearer than I already have been. I do understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. However, we also have to work within a wider health economy than just one trust. People in Doncaster, for example, go to Sheffield for cancer treatment and to other parts of South Yorkshire for different services. Other people come to Doncaster from elsewhere for services. That is how the health community in which we live operates. We want access to the very best health care in some of the most challenging and demanding areas of health. That is something that we all sign up to. That is why we have to get this right, and why we have a responsibility to support each other within our local health economies. That is not letting anyone off the hook. That is what happened in the past and it was part of the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="60612-0016.htm_para2"><a name="06061221000031">It is all about changes for the future. The amount of money going into the areas of hon. Members who have spoken in this evening&#146;s debate is substantial. There is no question that more money has been invested in the NHS. In all the constituencies of hon. Members in their places tonight, people have benefited from greater access to treatment faster than ever before. The minimum standards applied to our targets will continue to apply in the future, but to get to a place where we can think more creatively about provision of the services that we more or less all want, we have to deal with these financial problems and there is no easy route to achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="60612-0016.htm_para3"><a name="06061221000032">I want to highlight a few points about how health is changing. In the Gloucestershire area, more people are admitted to hospital than the national average and more people are spending longer there. I acknowledge the point of the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) when he said, &#147;Hang on a second&#151;we should not be kicking people out of hospital who need to be there.&#148; Of course not. I have to say that I have heard some worrying stories of older people being kept in beds on hospital wards in unsuitable circumstances when they really would be better looked after elsewhere. I accept that it can be an issue around partnership with social services and it is sometimes the result of a baffling lack of co-ordination with respect to the particular problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="60612-0016.htm_para4"><a name="06061221000033">Let me provide one example relating to another part of the country. Someone was receiving acute care in an acute hospital for his condition and was then transferred to a bed in a smaller community hospital. Why could he not come out of that community hospital? Partly because he had been diagnosed with diabetes and an at-home service for insulin care and management could not be provided. In that context, discussions about support for that individual included the point that choices had to be made about whether to provide the relatively straightforward services that were needed in that gentleman&#146;s home in the community or whether he should spend four months in hospital until something was sorted out. There are legitimate debates about that choice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="60612-0016.htm_para5"><a name="06061221000034">About 70 per cent. of people now have surgery as day-care patients, which is a huge change from the past. Nationally, the number of NHS beds has fallen by more than 30 per cent. over the past 20 years, while the number of NHS out-patients has risen by almost 60 per cent. That has changed over the decades, not just in the last few years. Of course, there are new technologies,  <br>

better drugs, advanced surgical techniques and improved management practices&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>The hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) keeps making comments from a sedentary position, but every time he raises questions about new drugs and other choices, it goes to the heart of the issue of trying to provide a health service that can meet people&#146;s needs, but needs to be managed locally.</p>

<p><a name="st_o245"><a name="06061221000035"><a name="60612-0016.htm_spnew8"><a name="06061221000085"><b>Martin Horwood</b>

 No, I am not giving way again. I have already given way several times to the hon. Gentleman and responded even to his sedentary comments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="60612-0016.htm_para6"><a name="06061221000037">The hon. Member for Tewkesbury raised some specific questions about Winchcombe hospital. I understand that, as part of the consultation, it is planned to enhance services at the Tewkesbury hospital, invest in community services and provide more rehabilitation and support in the home. The consultation will be for 12 weeks and he will be able to explore how that will happen&#151;a pertinent question for the consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="60612-0016.htm_para7"><a name="06061221000038">I understand that some of the Winchcombe hospital&#146;s problems relate to the building and that maintenance costs are &#163;500,000 a year. The point was raised whether the hospital could be refurbished and used for other services, but it is felt that the fabric of the building is too old, so it would not be cost-effective to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="60612-0016.htm_para8"><a name="06061221000039">I understand that out-patient and therapy services will be relocated and that, working in partnership, another eight beds will be provided elsewhere for rehab and palliative care. Clearly, those issues will be discussed as part of the consultation exercise. Certainly, in a number of areas, including Gloucestershire, as with other parts of the country, there are options that seek to enhance and improve some of the other community hospitals or services. I understand that one of the options for Dursley is to build a new health and social care facility in partnership with an independent sector provider.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="60612-0016.htm_para9"><a name="06061221000040">The hon. Member for Cotswold made a point about possible partnerships at Fairford hospital. It is difficult for me to comment to on that, but, clearly, he could have a conversation with PCTs and SHAs about any possible partnership development. Although the number of beds has been reduced at one facility&#151;I think it was Tetbury hospital, which is an independent not-for-profit hospital; I look to the hon. Gentleman for reassurance and see that he is nodding&#151;I understand that there is a discussion about how that service provider could provide more support and care in people&#146;s homes, rather than in hospital, and that it is keen to explore those opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="60612-0016.htm_para10"><a name="06061221000041">I will come to the financial balance, but I want to say something about maternity hospital services&#151;an issue that has been raised by several hon. Members this evening. I have glanced at the report in <i> The Citizen</i> local paper. Clearly, there was a well-attended rally on the issue at the weekend. As hon. Members will be aware, the proposal is that, over the next three years, all in-patient births at Stroud maternity hospital will move to Gloucester. I understand that there are just under 6,000 births in the Gloucester area, which services Cheltenham, Gloucester and Stroud, of which about  <br>

300 take place at Stroud hospital. Again, I am sure that that issue will be discussed as part of the consultation exercise, but that is quite a small number, and the birth rate is dropping, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="60612-0016.htm_para11"><a name="06061221000042">Clearly, considering what services need to be provided is an issue. This might not meet everyone&#146;s concerns, but I noticed in the article in <i> The Citizen</i> that one lady was talking about the fantastic service that she received in having a midwife-led home birth. That service will continue, including, I understand, both antenatal and postnatal support. The difference is&#151;I am not going to cover it up, because it is in the consultation&#151;that in-hospital births at Stroud will be moved to Gloucester. However, I want to put on the record that antenatal and postnatal services and the opportunity for those women who want to have a midwife-led home birth will still be available to women in Stroud and the surrounding area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="60612-0016.htm_para12"><a name="06061221000043">Again, this is a difficult issue. I have looked at the figures: women are having children older, which presents some issues. Women who have IVF treatment are more likely to have multiple births. Other issues need to be considered when providing consultant-led maternity services, particularly working times and the hours worked by consultants, as well as other health professionals. Again, those are factors in the provision of services. There are clearly financial considerations, as in everything, but there are some real issues about providing the best service possible, particularly to those most in need of that specialist service. Several Members have made points about the arrangements for getting to hospital in time, and there is no easy answer. Planning in relation to antenatal services is part of that process, and women and their partners and families need to be aware of what services are available and what arrangements they might need to make in such circumstances. Although I was in hospital for four days when I had my first child, times have changed, and for a straightforward birth, most people are in and out of hospital that day. Everyone wants to be there in the first few hours&#151;I am not trying to mitigate that&#151;but, for most people, days do not have to be extended for visits to their daughter or sister and her new child.</p>

Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) referred to the percentage contribution being asked from mental health services, which I will draw to the attention of the Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), who has been monitoring how mental health services are being affected, the proportions involved and what the safeguards should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="60612-0016.htm_para14"><a name="06061221000045">All Members who have contributed to the debate this evening referred to the financial balance. As they will be aware, strategic health authorities are responsible for the performance management of their NHS organisation and for ensuring that they achieve financial balance. The aim is for the NHS as a whole to have returned to financial balance by the end of 2006-07. As I mentioned this evening and in a previous debate with my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda), who asked similar questions, within an overall NHS balance position, a minority of NHS organisations might be unable to achieve a balance position within the time frame. However, all organisations that overspend will be expected to show an improvement during 2006-07. By the end of the year, every organisation should have  <br>

monthly income covering monthly expenditure or a date by which that will be achieved in 2007-08. Strategic health authorities take a reserve at the start of the year, mainly from PCTs, and will not redistribute resources to overspending organisations but will allow them to return to financial balance across the patch with any deficits offset by the reserve held by the SHA. Reserves will have to be paid back to organisations in future years when the organisations currently in deficit start producing surpluses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="60612-0016.htm_para15"><a name="06061221000046">The key benefit of the new system is that it provides financial certainty as reserves will be lodged from the start of the year. That means that SHAs will not need to spend time and energy later in the year trying to persuade organisations to underspend and produce a surplus. Despite the difficulties, that has tended to be the way that it has worked&#151;people have planned for a year and then been asked to pull back later in relation to the year ahead. Trevor Jones, chief executive of Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire SHA, said in his letter of 7 June that there is</p>
<a name="60612-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="06061221000066"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a clear requirement for NHS bodies to achieve in-year balance and to recover 2005/06 deficits...In exceptional circumstances, organisations formally included in the Department of Health&#146;s &#145;turnaround programme&#146; may be allowed more time to recover the 2005/06 deficit. In Gloucestershire, only Cotswold and Vale PCT is receiving turnaround support and it will receive &#163;6.8m from the PCT pool in 2005/06 which must be repaid in later years.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="60612-0016.htm_para16"><a name="06061221000047">That is saying that organisations must show that they are in balance in terms of their monthly income and expenditure, but that the pool provided allows the SHA to show that the whole local health economy is in balance against the deficits. That recognises that recovering some deficits might take more time in certain areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="60612-0016.htm_para17"><a name="06061221000048">That issue will have to be explored locally, but it must also be recognised that the recovery of deficits cannot keep being put off until tomorrow. That is why consultation, not just about finance but about creating a health service that is better for the future, is so important. We need systems that will improve outcomes, but will also put the service on track to achieve a meaningful financial balance that is not just secured through the reserve produced by the strategic health authority.</p>

 I think that the Minister is eliding two requirements. One is the return to financial balance by the end of the financial year: it seems that by the end of March next year, provided that primary care trusts are back in balance, the first of the Minister&#146;s criteria will be met. However, the Minister confused the issue by quoting from a letter from Trevor Jones saying that past deficits must be recovered by the end of the financial year. That is a much stricter and more stringent criterion than our PCTs have been led to expect. Are they to expect the first, or the first and the second?</p>

 I think it is a combination of the two. Organisations must ensure that their income and expenditure are in balance on a monthly basis by the end of the year, but must also establish plans to show how they will recover their deficits. By pooling reserve money, SHAs are helping to ensure that the whole health economy is better protected against the deficits that some areas are facing. I shall be happy to write to  <br>

the hon. Gentleman, but I can say no more than that.

 I think the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) made the point that I intended to make, but I will say this. I am grateful to the Minister for her sympathetic approach and I think we all accept that the organisations should be in monthly balance by the end of this financial year. That is a sensible requirement, to which we have never objected. We should like to know, however, whether the requirement for everything to balance&#151;including historic deficits&#151;relates to this financial year. Could it be extended to, for example, three years? That would make all the difference.

it mean monthly balance including the need to meet the top-slicing requirement? Can she clarify that?</p>

<p><a name="st_o257"><a name="06061221000060"><a name="60612-0017.htm_spnew0"><a name="06061221000097"><b>Caroline Flint:</b>
 I understand that it is in terms of income and expenditure, but there is also the issue around the outstanding deficits that organisations have. Those have to be dealt with too. Part of the top-slicing that is happening in those parts of the health sector or health trust that are in balance is to try to ensure that there is, if you like, shared responsibility for maintaining health across communities, to follow up on the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud made about what is being asked of different parts of the health service in his strategic health authority area to deal with particular problems and issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="60612-0017.htm_para1"><a name="06061221000061">That still requires an openness to debate some issues that involve some hard decisions and hard choices about the services that are necessary for the future. It raises issues around engaging the public. Importantly, as I said earlier, it involves having a discussion about what sort of services people want but also, in order to get those services, what is necessary. It is undoubtedly the case that, with the best will in the world, for some of our most advanced services to get the personnel to provide the best techniques in certain areas of health in our hospitals, some consolidation is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="60612-0017.htm_para2"><a name="06061221000062">It is also clear that, particularly in respect of older people, we have to address some legacy issues of community hospitals, which were created with the best intentions, and to consider whether they can meet the needs of the future. I raise another issue in relation to health staff. Talking to a nurse the other week, I found that one of the problems has been that, in some of our community hospitals&#151;as I say, I do not know enough about all the individual community hospitals in hon. Members&#146; areas&#151;the sort of service that they are offering, which is at its best a holding bed for older people, is not providing training and other opportunities for staff who want to work in this sector, particularly those who want to work closer to where people live in the community, providing a 24/7 district nurse service, for example, for people who most of the time do not need to go into hospital. They could get the services they need at home, with little disturbance to their life and none of the problems about relatives having to try to visit them and all those other things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="60612-0017.htm_para3"><a name="06061221000063">We have had an interesting debate. I hope that we have explored, possibly in a wider way, some of the challenges that face the health service. It is about value for money but importantly it is also about dealing with a problem which has been happening for many years in respect of the way in which health has been funded. It is also about dealing with perhaps some decisions that should have been made earlier about the sort of health service we want, which as I said is about prevention and support as well as treatment. However, to get to the place where we can have that discussion and start thinking about a 21st-century health service, undoubtedly, these problems have to be resolved financially but also in terms of the organisation of services.</p>
