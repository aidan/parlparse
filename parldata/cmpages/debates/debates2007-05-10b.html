 The Minister will know that the dividend tax credit changes have affected charities as well as pension funds. When I last raised that issue with the Chancellor, he claimed that gift aid changes had more than compensated for the reduction in tax relief. When he said that, was he aware that since 1997 the total tax repayment to charities has fallen by &#163;100 million in real terms? In other words, charities are being taxed by stealth just the same as the rest of us.</p>

 But the fact is that extra transitional relief was given to charities when the decision was made in 1997 and since then there has been a substantial rise in the amount of tax relief available for gift aid, as a result of decisions made by the Government.</p>

 Under the previous Government, one of the particular aspects of what happened was the offer of early retirement. In a whole range of employments, it was quite common for people to start retiring from their 50s upwards. Has any analysis been done of the impact that that has had on pension funds and, in particular, of the way in which that has completely skewed the employment of people in the labour market?</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to point out those trends. There is also the fact that in the early 1980s the trend began to shift away from occupational schemes. There are also the pension holidays that occurred in the 1990s. The fact is that a fall in the stock market and an increase in life expectancy were the main drivers of the change in pension funds. Despite that, as we discussed in the debate with the shadow Chancellor, the assets of pension funds have not gone down since 1997; they have gone up.</p>

 The fact is that those figures are nonsense. As I said, the assets of pension funds have gone up, rather than down. The number of pensioners in poverty has not gone up; it has gone down by 2.1 million. The Government made decisions in 1997 to make the Bank of England independent, to introduce fiscal rules, to have a windfall tax on the privatised utilities and to make tax changes&#151;all of which have delivered stability in our economy and all of which were opposed by Opposition Members. Government is about making tough decisions; we did that and they opposed them.</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend. Employment in the north-west is up by 250,000 since 1997. In every region of the country, employment has risen fast since 1997. One of the reasons why employment has risen is the new deal, which helps people to get back into work and to train for new skills. It would be an absolute tragedy if, at a stage when we are trying to get further people back into work, the Conservative party&#146;s policy of abolishing the new deal was adopted.

 The figure that the hon.

 As I told the hon. Lady and her colleagues a few moments ago, we took that action to address the historical problems of under-investment and short-termism which had held back the British economy, and following that, the assets of pension funds in our country rose.</p>

 The Economic Secretary has not replied to the simple question posed earlier: exactly how much? Does he recall the dire warnings given to the Chancellor, which were put into the public domain only after a two-year campaign by <i> The Times</i>? Those warnings highlighted the groups of people who would be adversely affected by the abolition of direct tax relief, and said that the lower-paid would be worse off under the new rules, that pensioners due to retire would lose out immediately, and that businesses would struggle to adjust to the change. Will the Economic Secretary apologise to those groups?</p>

 As I said a moment ago, that decision also involved the recycling of revenues back to pension funds and investors through corporation tax and other tax cuts. Some people feared that the stock market would fall in 1997; in fact, it rose. Some people feared that investment might go down; in fact, it went up. Some people claimed that pensionable assets would decrease in value; in fact, they went up. However, if Opposition Members think that that was the wrong decision, why will they not make a commitment to reverse it? The shadow pensions Minister has made that commitment, but the shadow Chancellor cannot tell us whether he agrees with the shadow pensions Minister or not. Until that is cleared up, there will be no clarity on this issue.</p>

The only legislation that they sought to introduce on party funding was against the Labour party&#146;s funding and also protected their funding. The legislation that I introduced in 2000 was done on an all-party basis. I want all-party agreement, but that depends on all parties to the talks being ready to be fair in respect of their opponent parties.

electoral arrangements in England? It should deal with the isolated but quite serious instances of alleged fraud&#151;to which the only response from all parties must be zero tolerance&#151;and the mismanagement in many areas that resulted in postal and proxy votes not being sent in time, and in polling cards sometimes being sent in multiple numbers or not at all. Such a statement will be needed sooner rather than later, given that we will surely have a general election following the forthcoming change in the Administration.</p>

Will the Leader of the House look into why that Bill, uniquely among public Bills, is not open to evidence sessions? Surely it is most important that those who are affected by the Finance Bill should be able to give evidence so as to facilitate an informed debate, but it is the one Bill for which we cannot have evidence sessions.</p>

The Government are precipitating a crisis of their own making in what is one of the key fundamentals of the welfare state. That crisis was precipitated by the report from Lord Carter&#151;who, for heaven&#146;s sake, has now been asked to review our prison arrangements. It is essential that we get an opportunity to have a debate on the matter and, I hope, to forestall a very serious result arising from the changes to legal aid.</p>

 The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome asked first for a statement on electoral fraud. All parties take very seriously any allegations of electoral fraud or mismanagement, and I shall certainly raise the matter with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Justice and invite him to consider making either a written or an oral statement. It is important that we learn the lessons in respect of fraud, which is isolated but which needs to be investigated, and any failures in the administration of postal voting.</p>

We introduced changes to the public Bill procedure to provide evidence sessions for Bills that are programmed. I do not think that there is any objection in principle to having evidence sessions for the Finance Bill, but they would have to be programmed and I am not sure that the House would find that acceptable. Moreover, if the hon. Gentleman looks at the parliamentary proceedings on the Finance Bill, he will see that they are more extensive than those on almost any other Bill. The four days of debate on the Budget deal mainly with the legislative proposals that it contains. They are followed by one day for Second Reading of the Finance Bill and two days for Committee stage on the Floor of the House, after which the Bill goes upstairs. Whatever else one might say about proceedings on the Finance Bill, one cannot  <br>

I am aware that there are some concerns about the future of legal aid, but the hon.

I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s concern and I am glad that she, in turn, recognises the pressures on the legal aid budget.

 I think that the Leader of the House is aware of the proposals of Post Office Ltd to close 70 of its Crown post offices in our town and city centres and also of the proposal to replace them with outposts in nearby branches of WH Smith, and in the case of Leicester in the basement of a nearby branch of WH Smith&#151;much smaller premises.

 I shall certainly consider that. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry will make a statement on the issue in due course. In my case, the Crown post office building in Blackburn is not an object of beauty&#151;unlike that in King&#146;s Lynn&#151;so I have never been given a print of it. The Crown post office was moved to one run by a private contractor. I am afraid that the public meeting I attended attracted only 50 people, so the move came into force without incident. Although it is hard, the fact of the matter is that the Post Office is having to adjust to major external changes in people&#146;s habits; above all, the internet facilities that have greatly reduced post office business.

Is it not wholly unacceptable that private and confidential correspondence between a Member and a Minister does not remain private and confidential? It should not be released into the public domain. Departments are releasing correspondence from Members, on what they say are legitimate requests, so will the Leader of the House give instructions to all Departments that Members&#146; correspondence with Ministers is private and, if necessary, will he come to the House and make a statement on the matter?

 I am happy to accede to all the requests that the hon. Gentleman makes. I share his concern. The House of Commons Commission has given consideration to the issue. New guidance has been agreed with the House of Commons and what was then the Department for Constitutional Affairs and is now the Ministry of Justice, advising public authorities on how to handle requests that involve the correspondence of Members of Parliament. I personally accept that certainly the spirit, and in some cases the letter, of the guidance has not been properly followed and that public authorities, including&#151;but not exclusively&#151;Departments have sometimes been too ready to accede to third-party requests for the release of such correspondence without giving the Member of Parliament any say whatever.

The problem seems to be that dwellings that were built with just two or three bedrooms are being converted to have six or seven bedrooms, with a major impact on parking, antisocial behaviour, noise and nuisance. Local authorities seem powerless to do much about it.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises an important issue. I will certainly look for an opportunity for a debate. It may have to be in Westminster Hall. If he wishes to give me more details, I will make sure that they are put before the relevant Secretary of State. There were some improvements to the powers for local authorities under housing legislation about two years  <br>

 May I ask for a debate on a sensitive matter? There is never a right time to mention it, but it is a serious constitutional point. I am talking about what happens when a Prime Minister suffers a sudden incapacity or dies. Neither of the two main political parties has adequate arrangements to deal with such circumstances. Is there not a case for institutionalising the post of the Deputy Prime Minister? The Conservative party does not have an elected deputy leader. The Labour party does, but that deputy leader might be out of government. Buckingham Palace would be obliged under the conventions to send for that person to fill the post. It is rather sloppy of our generation that, at a time when the country could be in the middle of an international crisis, we could have uncertainty about who should be in charge of Government if the Prime Minister were incapacitated or suddenly died.</p>

<a name="ordayhd_1"><a name="70510-0005.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="07051063000752"><h5 align="left">12.9 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o161"><a name="07051063000263"><a name="70510-0005.htm_spmin0"><a name="07051063000959"><b>The Leader of the House of Commons (Mr. Jack Straw):</b>
 As I said earlier, I am extremely grateful to you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me and many right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House the opportunity to express our condolences to Lady Weatherill and to pay tribute to the memory of Jack Weatherill, as so many of us knew him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="70510-0005.htm_para5"><a name="07051063000264">The most important and fundamental role of the House is to hold the Executive to account. The Speaker, above all, is here to protect and enhance the duty of all Members to fulfil that important role and to defend the rights and privileges of individual Members representing their constituents. From the moment that Jack Weatherill took the Speaker&#146;s Chair in 1983, he never forgot the duties of the House or the importance of his position in sustaining the democratic process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="70510-0005.htm_para6"><a name="07051063000265">Many of the tributes to and obituaries of Jack Weatherill have highlighted his kindness. He was indeed a kind man, as you and I, Mr. Speaker&#151;we came into the House just four years before he assumed the august office of Speaker&#151;have good reason to remember. Other obituaries have highlighted his professionalism and quick wit. Both were absolutely the case. He was always on top of procedure and Standing Orders&#151;and sometimes, when necessary, individual Members. Many of us who were around at the time will remember receiving the sharp end of his tongue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="70510-0005.htm_para7"><a name="07051063000266">Of all Jack Weatherill&#146;s qualities, the one that I wish to emphasise is his courage. In the early and mid-1980s, politics in this country was raw and the divisions between the political parties were bitter. Without television, as all of us who were here at the time will recall, this place could be like a bear pit. The external divisions of British politics ran very deep inside the House. Jack Weatherill had to control the House. He also had to resist the ire of Ministers&#151;I am not making a party point because you also know, Mr. Speaker, that that is a function of all good Speakers&#151;to ensure that the fundamental role of holding the Government to account could be fulfilled and so that Members on both sides of the House could give vent to their anger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="70510-0005.htm_para8"><a name="07051063000267">Jack Weatherill was a traditionalist. He was the last Speaker to wear the full-bottomed wig and while he sometimes used to complain about it, he continued with the tradition. However, he was also very alive to the need to modernise this place. He embraced the idea of television and was the Speaker in the Chair when television was first introduced. Through that, he became the first Speaker to become not just a national but an international figure. He thus enhanced the reputation of the House throughout the world. Although the notices that we receive for our performances in the House probably mark us down compared with our predecessors, the House is still regarded as one of the most vibrant democratic Chambers in the world. For that, we owe a huge debt of gratitude to the pioneering work of Jack Weatherill, who ensured that the introduction of television meant that Members were better behaved and properly reflected the dignity of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para0"><a name="07051063000268">There is much else that I could say about Jack Weatherill, such as his contribution to his party in which he had a distinguished career before he took the Speaker&#146;s Chair. In the other place, after he left the Chair, he pursued many great and small causes. I will mention just one such cause, which goes back to what I said about his courage. He had a profound commitment to the sub-continent of India. He had great affection for the place and he was ready to speak up for constituents and those who had made this place their home at a time when doing so was far less popular than it is today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para1"><a name="07051063000269">We send our condolences to Lady Weatherill and her family. We salute a great Speaker and mourn his loss.</p>

 I, too, am grateful for the opportunity to pay tribute to Lord Weatherill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para2"><a name="07051063000271">As many have already said, Jack Weatherill was not just an esteemed parliamentarian but a true gentleman. He served his country throughout his life. As a soldier during the war, he served in the Dragoon Guards and in the Indian army with the 19th King George V&#146;s Own Lancers. It was during his time in India that he learned to speak Urdu. During the 1942 famine, he became a lifelong vegetarian. Later, as we know, he served the constituents of Croydon, North-East from 1964 until 1992, after which he continued to serve his country in the other place. Between his service in the Army and Parliament, he worked as a tailor in the family business that his father established.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para3"><a name="07051063000272">Jack Weatherill was, in many senses, the embodiment of the changes to the world, politics and Parliament that took place in the last century. As the Leader of the House mentioned, he was the last Speaker to wear the traditional wig and the first Speaker to see television cameras in the Chamber. At a time when we all talk a great deal about connecting Parliament with the public, we would do well to remember Jack Weatherill, who was determined that Parliament should be as relevant to the real world as possible. He said that it was his absolute intention to ensure that everything that went on in our nation was exposed in our House. That is not a bad motto for us all to remember today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para4"><a name="07051063000273">I am sure that many hon. Members are familiar with the story that shortly after Jack Weatherill was elected, he overheard an elderly grandee complain, &#147;My God, what is this place coming to? They&#146;ve got my tailor in here.&#148; However, he was very proud of his background. As you said in your tribute on Tuesday, Mr. Speaker, he used to carry a thimble with him to keep him humble, to use his words. That was a mark of the man.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para5"><a name="07051063000274">Jack Weatherill was indeed a fine parliamentarian. As Speaker, he was a resolute defender of the rights of Back Benchers, which was not always easy in the face of his own party in government. However, in all that he did, he won respect and high regard from Members on both sides of the House. He was a devoted churchman and a loyal family man. I am sure that the whole House will want to send condolences to his wife, Lyn, and his three children and seven grandchildren. We will all remember Lord Weatherill as a great parliamentarian, a fine Speaker and a gentleman who spent his life serving his country.</p>

 I speak not only on my own behalf but, I hope, on behalf of many of Jack&#146;s ex-colleagues who would wish they could be here today to express their sympathies to the family. Like them, I remember him as an outstanding Speaker and, above all, as a delightful man.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07051063000276">Jack and I came into the House together in 1964, although we were each unaware of the other for a long time. Although I discovered this only the other day, we both ascended&#151;if that is the appropriate term&#151;to the Front Bench in 1967. I was a little green Under-Secretary in the Department of Economic Affairs, while he was a junior Whip. It is often the case that people can be together in the House for years and know each other to say hello without their paths crossing politically for long time. That was the case with Jack and me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para7"><a name="07051063000277">Our paths coincided, rather than collided, on an occasion that I will never forget, although I will come to that in a moment. I used to do the mischief job of trying to mobilise what the Leader of the House called the rather rowdy element on the Opposition Benches. Our job was to try to claim prime time. It was a matter not of being rowdy but of trying to use the procedures of the House of Commons to secure the time straight after questions when everyone was still in the Gallery. We used points of order and got people to table private notice questions that were backed up with requests under Standing Order No. 24. We were using the procedures of the House to try to seize the time when we still had a press audience. At the time, he was the Speaker and I was doing a massively less reputable job in the House, but I will never forget the time when our paths coincided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para8"><a name="07051063000278">Those of us who were here at the time will remember that Mrs. Thatcher did not often come to the House to take part in debates, although she took part in Prime Minister&#146;s questions. On one very big occasion&#151;it was a debate on the Wright affair, which was a great scandal that had run for a long time in the press&#151;the Chamber was absolutely packed. It was so packed that when I came in, slightly late, I could not even get on to the Front Bench; I had to sit on the steps between the Front Bench and the Bench behind it. During Mrs. Thatcher&#146;s presentation, various requests for information were made, and she insisted that she could not answer because there was a case under way in Australia and the matter was therefore sub judice. I was puzzled, because that did not quite fit in with my understanding of the rule, but I was not sure about the matter. Even Roy Jenkins, who was speaking from the third row below the gangway, did not challenge her, so I thought that I had better check.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para9"><a name="07051063000279">I left through the Door of the Chamber and came down to the Table, where the ever-helpful Clerks confirmed my suspicion. I came back, muscled my way on to the Front Bench and got up and made a point of order, in which I asked Jack, as Speaker, to rule on whether the sub judice rule applied to a case in the Australian courts, or whether it applied only in this country. He confirmed that the rule was that it applied only in this country. The Prime Minister made no secret of the fact that she rather disagreed with him and she set about him, to some extent, so I jumped up on  <br>

another point of order and said, &#147;Isn&#146;t it normal to apologise when you&#146;ve misled the House?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para10"><a name="07051063000280">Some time later, I met Jack in connection with another issue&#151;in fact, it related to the decision to move the time when points of order could be raised from straight after questions to after statements. In our conversation, I apologised for the grief that I had caused him on that day, and a broad grin broke out on his face. He said, &#147;Don&#146;t worry, I used to do the same job when I was in the Whips Office.&#148; He used to mobilise the Maxwell-Hyslops of the House&#151;not many of us will remember him&#151;and other Conservative Members who were discontented with the then Labour Government. Jack said, &#147;In fact, when I did that job, I had a nickname.&#148; He told me the nickname, but unfortunately the proprieties of the House will not allow me to repeat it, and if I tried to, you would stop me, Mr. Speaker. If anyone wants to know it, the obituary in the online edition of <i> The Independent </i>carries it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para11"><a name="07051063000281">Jack was proud of the role that he played on behalf of the Opposition. In a way&#151;I have said this on previous occasions, and not in a joking way&#151;it would be a good thing if every Member could serve in opposition as soon as they came into the House, because it is in opposition that Members learn what accountability is about and why Ministers need to be brought to book. Today, I remember a fair, kind and humorous man, but also a very firm Speaker. My sympathies and thoughts, and those of so many of his ex-colleagues, are with his family today.</p>

 Like the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May), and indeed the majority of Members of the House, I am afraid that I did not have the privilege of serving in this House while Lord Weatherill was Speaker, but I had the great privilege of meeting him, in rather odd circumstances, soon after I was elected. We were both at Farleigh Hungerford castle in my constituency on a cold December evening to celebrate the life of Sir Thomas Hungerford, the first recorded Speaker of the House. I suspect that he was a very good Speaker of a very bad Parliament. Indeed, it was dubbed &#147;the bad Parliament&#148; because it introduced cash for favours and the poll tax, so it was very bad indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para12"><a name="07051063000283">When I met Lord Weatherill on that bitterly cold night in Farleigh Hungerford castle&#146;s chapel, which had not been heated since the 14th century, and which was therefore not the most congenial of surroundings, what struck me first was his stoicism under the circumstances. He also gave the impression of being a kind, courteous man. He was interested in me as a new Member in a way that he had no need to be. He also struck me as a punctilious parliamentarian. He did not have to be in Somerset on a cold December evening, but he was there because, as a former Speaker of the House, he wanted to pay tribute to the first Speaker of the House, and he was there as a parliamentarian. The tributes that have been paid to Lord Weatherill all mention his fairness and assiduity in the post of Speaker and his preparedness to ensure that the people who make life difficult for Speakers, for Governments and for the Opposition were properly heard. That is the sort of testament that any Speaker would wish to hear.  <br>

 The office of Speaker of the House is never easy to fulfil, and over the centuries people have interpreted the role in entirely different ways. The tributes to Jack Weatherill have rather hidden one aspect of him that was of enormous importance, and that was his intelligence. He was an enormously warm and witty man and he was fun to know. When he left us for the House of Lords, he took with him his strong commitment to the essential qualities of a Parliament, which include the need always to represent the views of the whole community. Sometimes we underestimate the strains and the pressures that we put on the Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para13"><a name="07051063000285">I was honoured and delighted to know Jack Weatherill and to have the chance to work with him, not least because he interpreted the multicultural and multi-political views of our society in a very civilised way. His civility was very important. He was so cultured and so interested in everything that we did; he was a delight. He took enormous pleasure in his family&#151;in his marvellous wife, who made it possible for him to be such a good Speaker, and in his grandchildren and children. I remember him talking, in his last Christmas in the Commons, of the debate that the family had had about whether they should remain in the palace for that Christmas holiday. His final decision was that it had been such a pleasure and a delight to be Speaker that he wanted the opportunity to have the family with him in the palace for his last Christmas in office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para14"><a name="07051063000286">What Jack Weatherill did in the other place was representative of him. He took on the role of keeping the independent Members of the House of Lords involved in the work of the House and able to express their views. To me that was a demonstration of the man. He was a remarkable man; occasionally he masqueraded as a very ordinary man, although only idiots would have been taken in. His role in both Houses of Parliament, and among the population as a whole, was to do that very British thing of moving us forward while appearing to remain stationary, and only Jack could have done it. He will be very much missed, and I have the greatest admiration for what Jack Weatherill accomplished.</p>

 I am delighted to follow the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) in what she has said. To me, Jack Weatherill was, above all, a friend. Mr. Speaker, as you said in your tribute earlier this week, he was an excellent Speaker. He got to the Speaker&#146;s Chair not because he was the chosen representative of his party but because he was the person chosen by the House. I think that that indicates just how favourably Members from all parts of the House regarded Jack Weatherill. He was, as many of us know, deputy Chief Whip. He was, as you were, too, Sir, the Chairman of Ways and Means before achieving the highest office available to the House&#151;that of Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para15"><a name="07051063000288">Jack Weatherill was primarily a friend. He invited me to become a member of the Chairmen&#146;s Panel&#151;a job that I have done ever since 1986, and which is a huge privilege as it enables people to serve the House and the institution of Parliament. He was a very personable man. I remember speaking in a debate on textiles. He was in the Chair, and during the debate, he arranged for a note to be passed to me. It just said:</p>
<a name="70510-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="07062233000003"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Nicholas, well spoken. You spoke from the heart and I agreed with you. I am pleased I was in the Chair when you spoke.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para16"><a name="07051063000289">I think that that shows the personable nature of his relationship with Members from all parties in the House of Commons. He shared another common interest with me. He was very senior to me, and served for longer, but we were both members of a cavalry regiment. He greatly enjoyed his time in the Army, particularly, as has already been mentioned, his period in the Indian army. It is not wrong to say that he was indeed in every way an officer and a gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para17"><a name="07051063000290">When Lord Weatherill left the House, he did me a great favour. He was involved with three City livery companies. I invited him to be my guest of honour at a major livery dinner of the Worshipful Company of Weavers of which, between 1997 and 1998, I was upper bailiff. He attended that occasion, and it indicates Jack Weatherill&#146;s loyalty to those organisations with which he was involved. He was a man who was greatly liked. As the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich said, he had a wonderful wife, Lyn. She was a wonderful tennis player, and I remember many games on the tennis courts of Westminster school in Vincent square. Jack himself did not come and play, but Lyn was a wonderful tennis player and a huge supporter of Jack during his time as Speaker.</p>

The reception after the christening of our first grandchild was held in the Palace of Westminster in Mr. Speaker&#146;s State Apartments. Perhaps I should not have said that, as it may open the door to many approaches to you, Mr. Speaker, and I do not seek to do that. It shows the fact&#151;it has not really been said so far in the tributes&#151;that Jack was a real family man. Perhaps above all, to Jack Weatherill, whom we mourn&#151;we send our condolences to Lyn, his wife and to his two sons and daughter&#151;the House of Commons was his family; latterly the same was true of Parliament. He stood up for it. He was a great Speaker, and he will long be remembered.</p>

 I was fortunate in sharing some characteristics with Jack Weatherill. I shared with him the honour of having had conferred on me by the President of Pakistan the Hilal-e-Pakistan.

Commons:&#147;My God, what is this place coming to? They&#146;ve got my tailor in here.&#148; That, of course, was in the far-off days when the Tory party was led by old Etonian toffs. What was interesting about that, as has been said, was the fact that Jack Weatherill was always very proud indeed of having been a tailor. He always dressed immaculately. Indeed, if he was sitting in the Chair today, Mr. Speaker, he might well ask whether hon. Members have a tailor any more. He was a very generous man. The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) pointed out that he would be kind enough to send letters or notes to Members across the House when he appreciated something that they had done. Like the hon. Gentleman, I received one of those notes. He was very good, too, at protecting Members of Parliament when they were in difficulty.</p>

I was sitting on the Opposition Front Bench, and I muttered to a colleague that she should have been. That was picked up by the microphones in the House; it was heard by the whole House and it caused huge uproar. He beckoned to me when the event had taken place and said, &#147;Gerald, I think it would help you with the House if you apologised for what you said.&#148; I said, &#147;Mr. Speaker, I very much appreciate that, but I don&#146;t think it would help me with the Labour party if I were to apologise in that way.&#148; He laughed, because he was a House of Commons man and he fully understood the quirks of the House. Like you, Mr. Speaker, and like his predecessor, Jack Weatherill never held high office, and I think that that is a very high qualification for being the Speaker of the House of Commons.</p>

Before he was Deputy Speaker and then Speaker, he was a Whip. In fact, he was a Whip for longer than he was Speaker. He was the Opposition&#146;s deputy Chief Whip from 1974 to 1979 in a Parliament that ended with an Opposition Whip&#146;s dream&#151;the defeat of the Government by one vote. Whips get a bad press, but Jack never used the rougher tactics that are often attributed to members of the Whips Office. He was unfailingly courteous, good-humoured and totally disarming. If anyone threatened to rebel, he was not angry&#151;he was disappointed. One would be invited to his office, and he would explain that the Government were on their last legs: they were losing by-election after by-election and they would not last the year so it was not the time to rock the boat. That argument lost a bit of credibility when the Parliament entered its fifth year, but it was very effective. He had a rapport with the many senior members of the party who had a good war.</p>

Friend the Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers), Leon Brittan, Douglas Hurd, Nigel Lawson and the rest of that intake. He was kind and paternal to us. He was totally discreet, loyal and a shrewd judge of character, and he was very supportive of colleagues who went through a difficult time. He was a stickler for punctuality. It was not a good idea to be late for the 2.30 Whips meeting, which began with the order from Jack, &#147;Stand by your beds.&#148; One colleague was late, but before Jack could rebuke him, he said he was late because his tailor, a colleague of Jack&#146;s, had been late for the appointment and had held him up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="70510-0006.htm_para23"><a name="07051063000299">Jack Weatherill had a difficult relationship with the leader of our party. There was a free vote in the 1974 Parliament&#151;on whether we should have proportional representation for the Scottish Parliament, I think. Those who voted for PR found as they came out of the Lobby Margaret Thatcher taking the names of those who had voted that way. When we won in 1979, Jack Weatherill was the only member of the Front-Bench team who was not appointed to the Government. As we know, he then began an alternative career as Deputy Speaker and Speaker. He was totally fair, standing up for the rights of Back Benchers, and standing up to the gentle intimidation he received from members of his former party.</p>

He unearthed an old Victorian song about the MP who could not catch the Speaker&#146;s eye, which we all had to sing, with Toby Jessel on the keyboard. Jack was supported by Lyn. He had one of the happiest of political marriages. He was decent, honest, without pretension, without malice, one of the straightest men I have come across. He was not totally infallible. Just after the 1974 Parliament, he sidled up to a newly elected colleague sitting on the Back Benches and said, &#147;I&#146;ve been reading all about you. You&#146;re exactly the person we need to sit on the Council of Europe.&#148; My colleague was delighted that his talents had been recognised so early in the Parliament. Five minutes later Jack came back. &#147;I&#146;m frightfully sorry,&#148; he said. &#147;Just remind me of your name.&#148;</p>

Chair with such distinction. I first came across him during my Croydon days, in the 1960s, when I had a Croydon constituency with a marvellous majority of 81. From the beginning I found Jack&#151;a political opponent, obviously&#151;very easy to get along with. Over the past few days I have tried to recall whether I ever had a quarrel with him. All that I could remember was that we had a tiff some time in the late 1960s. Given my record, one disagreement is not bad. I am glad to say that we got on extremely well.</p>

What has struck me about the obituaries of Jack Weatherill is that they have been spot-on. To a large extent, they reflected his personality, which has been spoken about today. He was naturally a kind man. He was modest, as I found on many occasions, and very helpful in situations relating to oneself or family, as the case may be. Those who wrote the obituaries understood him well, I am glad to say.</p>

I do not know what sort of Conservative one would describe him as&#151;perhaps not in the Thatcherite tradition. I have no doubt in my mind that Jack had a genuine interest in people outside who never had the advantages that he had, and was very sympathetic, as he was to migrants in his constituency and elsewhere, bearing in mind his Army service in India.</p>

I remember that he said once that it was his mother who suggested that he should always carry it in his waistcoat pocket. If his mother had not suggested it, he probably would have kept it anyway. He knew his family background. His father had been an active trade unionist, sacked because of his union activities, and apparently his father had also been a Fabian socialist. I would have wished that Jack was a Labour Member, but he was not. Nevertheless, he was a person with the qualities that have been described. I kept in touch with him, as other Members did, when he was in the Lords. He was a good man, he was a kind man, and we shall miss him greatly.</p>

I echo the remarks that have been made. It was obvious that, as Speaker, he had command of the House, particularly when it was a little buoyant, a little excited and a little excitable. He controlled the House well on those occasions, but it is right to say that he was also a man with a great sense of justice. He recognised that the Speaker of the House had a responsibility not only to the great and the mighty, but to the relatively humble, particularly those who were new in the House.</p>

At the end of my speech the Speaker called me over, looked at me sternly and said, &#147;Mayor? Not at all.&#148; I thought that was terrible. Then, with a smile, he said, &#147;I wouldn&#146;t aspire to those dizzy heights.&#148;</p>

In the end, it is the humanity that has come across today and in the various obituaries that we have all read, which is the mark of a man who was a good, sound parliamentarian, a very good colleague and a good advertisement for what we as a democratic Parliament should be about.</p>

I entered the House in 1987 alongside the late Member for Tottenham, the former Member for Brent, South, and the current Member for Leicester, East. It is a long time ago now, but we were regarded with extraordinary trepidation by the House authorities, not least our own party managers. We were considered the very last word in black and ethnic extremism. The particular concern of the House authorities was that we would turn out to be the equivalent of the 19th-century Fenians and submit the House to endless disruption, all-night sittings, chaos and so on. I clearly remember that Speaker Weatherill went to enormous trouble to make us feel welcome and involved, even to the point of sharing a few late-night glasses of port with the late Member for Tottenham. The point of that was not just his courtesy, but that what he taught us was that every Member of the House was the equal of any other&#151;that we were all primus inter pares. That reflected not just his kindness but his concern for the House as a living, democratic institution in which everybody ought to feel able to make a contribution; and I think that all of us, in our different ways, made some contribution to the House over the years.</p>

I had been here for a couple of years and had made a particularly robust speech from the Back Benches, which in the days of Margaret Thatcher&#146;s Government was quite a brave thing to do. I got a little note of encouragement, and felt absolutely wonderful as a result. One gets very little feedback in this place. Our Whips will tell us if we are not doing the job properly from their standpoint, but nobody comes up and says, from an impartial point of view, &#147;You&#146;re doing a good job&#148;, or &#147;You&#146;re doing a bad job.&#148; To get a note from the Speaker, a person whom one immediately respects&#151;one&#146;s new headmaster when one comes into this House&#151;is very special indeed. He did, in a way, maintain a pastoral watch over Members of this House and make certain that we got the odd little bit of feedback and comment that was ever so useful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="70510-0007.htm_para18"><a name="07051063000328">I recall, equally, that when he left this place that kind of feedback and interest in what one was doing as an individual did not stop. I would see him in the Lobby or walking somewhere around the place, and he  would stop and say, &#147;How are you, Michael? How&#146;s it   <br>

 I should like to pay my own very brief personal tribute to the late Speaker Weatherill. I was one of the cohort of 1983, among many colleagues who are in the House today. I well remember sitting almost diagonally opposite at the time when Jack Weatherill, as we all knew him, was dragged to the Chair. He was indeed a gentleman in the true sense of the word and was very much respected. He had a depth to him that at first, perhaps, people did not realise, and he had an independence of character. He was personally extremely kind, and opened up Speaker&#146;s House to Members on both sides of the House and their families. I remember going to Speaker&#146;s House on many occasions and meeting Mrs. Speaker, as she was known&#151;Lady Weatherill. I would like to express my deepest sympathy to her and her family on their great loss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="70510-0007.htm_para19"><a name="07051063000330">At one of those informal occasions, I was able to say to Mr. Speaker Weatherill that we had in fact met many years previously. When I was about 11, I won an award at the Royal Windsor horse show for best rider in one of the show pony classes. The prize was a pair of jodhpurs to be made by, I think, Bernard Weatherill Ltd. So I was taken by my father by train to London&#151;a big day out&#151;and went to this very smart tailor&#146;s emporium, where I met Jack Weatherill. I told him that I still had that small pair of jodhpurs with buckskin strappings, which we had in those days, how very proud I was of them, and how they had done stalwart service. He was extremely pleased by that story. The fact that he carried a thimble in his pocket for the rest of life to remind him of what he was showed the character of the man. He will be greatly missed. He was a great man who was much loved, and the tributes that have been paid today bear out those comments.</p>

 Several colleagues from my 1983 intake have spoken about how they found Speaker Weatherill when they were new to the House and the proceedings and he was new to the Chair. Hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="70510-0007.htm_para20"><a name="07051063000332">Like you, Mr. Speaker, and Mrs. Martin, he and his wife were equally generous in Speaker&#146;s House. When my daughter, Claudia, who is now 18, was baptised here, Mr. Speaker Weatherill generously allowed us to have the post-christening reception in his apartment. My middle son, who is now 21 but was then three-and-a-half, complained on my daughter&#146;s arrival that he would have preferred a rabbit and was disappointed to have a baby sister. Speaker Weatherill heard about that, so after the christening, at the reception in Speaker&#146;s House, he proposed a toast of health to Claudia&#151;squalling baby that she was then&#151;and, from behind his back, produced a stuffed rabbit and presented it to Freddie, who has it to this day. That was the mark of the man.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="70510-0007.htm_para21"><a name="07051063000333">The number of times that people have commented on not how Mr. Speaker Weatherill conducted himself in your great office, Mr. Speaker, but his human side is enormously pleasing. I am sure that, although Lyn and his children and grandchildren will mourn the loss of Jack as a husband, father and grandfather, they will take enormous comfort from and great pride in the fact that, as the tributes have made clear, he was personable, kind and, above all, a great family man. That was reflected in his conduct in the great office that he held. He will be fondly remembered by those of us who saw him as our first headmaster as well as our first Speaker. </p>

 As a member of the 1997 intake, I can offer only the tiniest cameo from my knowledge of Lord Weatherill because I did not meet him until I attended a private dinner in 2003. In the course of the conversation, I happened to mention that my father, who was then only 90, had been a tailor for 71 years and recently had, sadly, had to go into residential care in the evening of his life. Lord Weatherill immediately insisted that I should give him not only my father&#146;s name but that of the residential home and the address. He said, &#147;I&#146;m going to write to him as one tailor to another.&#148; That is precisely what he did. When, from time to time in the years that followed, I bumped into him in the Corridors of the House, he unfailingly inquired after the welfare of Sam Lewis, my father. If you judge the largeness of a person&#146;s character by the thoughtfulness of their small acts of kindness, I will always remember Lord Weatherill for that act of wonderful kindness, if nothing else.</p>

I am sure that hon. Members will be pleased to hear that I do not intend to go through all the arguments again.

How can that happen when there is no information on the certificate as to what it is that the Director of Public Prosecutions is concerned about or what judgment he has made about whether a person is or was a member of a proscribed organisation or an associate of such a person? If there is no information about what has motivated the DPP&#146;s certificate, how can anyone mount a meaningful challenge?</p>

 I echo the concern, which has been discussed at length in the past, about the complete opaqueness of the process of issuing a certificate. That, as we have already argued, is one of the fundamental flaws of this legislation. I hope that the Minister will provide some further clarification today, but I am not optimistic that, even now, the Government realise the weakness that we are pointing out.</p>

The reference to &#147;exceptional circumstances&#148; rightly includes cases where there was a &#147;lack of jurisdiction&#148; or other significant &#147;error of law&#148;. For that reason, it evidently extends the breadth of the clause&#146;s operation, which is welcome, but as I said at the outset and as the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) has just pointed out, it still does not overcome one of the fundamental deficiencies of the legislation&#151;the opaqueness of the issuing of a certificate in the first place.</p>

us back to Second Reading and Committee consideration of the legislation. Where we are at now is that we have achieved a great deal of consensus, including around clause 7, and are coming towards the conclusion of our deliberations. There is a clear test, which is set out in the legislation, and a decision has to be made. We have never hidden from the fact that the decision may rest in particular circumstances on intelligence or other information that is not in the public domain, or that we do not believe that the issuing of the certificate should be the occasion for putting such information into that domain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="70510-0008.htm_para14"><a name="07051063000357">The question has been how best to balance the need to keep a certain level of protection of the information, while allowing people in certain circumstances to be able to challenge the issuing of the certificate. We now think that, with this further Lords amendment, the balance is as right as it possibly can be. I am pleased that we were able to achieve a consensus in the other place and I hope that it is maintained here this afternoon. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Foyle has pursued this issue and I fully understand the reasons why. However, I ask him to understand that what we have sought to do is to provide the necessary balance, including what I accept are narrow grounds for challenge, but grounds for challenge nevertheless.</p>

 That is all. The certificate will be issued by the DPP and it will not include any of the sort of information to which my hon. Friend refers. He knows that from our earlier discussions. All that we are doing today is further to clarify the grounds on which an appeal can be made. There has been some suggestion that what we are seeking to do here is completely to remove grounds for appeal. We are not seeking that at all, but we are limiting those grounds.</p>

 I will give way in a few moments, but I fear that, perhaps understandably, colleagues want to take us back to discussions that we have had long since. What we are seeking to do is to express our support as the Government for amendments agreed in the other place after extensive discussion and deliberation both on the Floor of the House and elsewhere, which brings us closer to the balance that we seek to strike between making sure that the grounds are narrow, but none the less there in appropriate cases.

 The House has heard the Minister and I do not want to provoke him into answering much of what I am going to say, but I want to make two or three sensible and serious remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="70510-0008.htm_para17"><a name="07051063000367">First, the likelihood of judicial review happening will, I suspect, be low, particularly if many of the hopes built up over recent months are carried forward, but it remains an important issue. The Government tend to operate to a degree by precedent and, if this goes unchallenged and unremarked, I do not believe that the House will have done its duty. I am glad that some hon. Members have put questions to the Minister and that he has responded to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="70510-0008.htm_para18"><a name="07051063000368">Secondly, it may be possible to think of a parallel, albeit not a direct parallel. I remember being involved in the case of a senior officer of the Metropolitan police who had warrants issued by judges and certificates signed by Ministers saying that a particular person was a very serious threat to national security, providing reasons to grant those warrants. It turned out, however, that the information given to Ministers was completely wrong. Without opening all that up again, I hope that there will be some system whereby afterwards&#151;whether it be immediately afterwards or after the trial or perhaps even some years after that&#151;the information becomes open to review. If and when either judges or Ministers issuing certificates realise that they should not have done so, I hope that they will find some way of saying so.</p>

There needs to be some invigilation of the uses of the certificate to exclude review. I happen to believe that there are too many applications for judicial review for too many cases, but there are certainly times when they are important. There are the examples of Clive Stafford Smith&#146;s work on Guantanamo Bay, which has embarrassed other American lawyers, including military defence lawyers; and the work of Gareth Peirce in this country, opening up to judicial supervision cases that would otherwise have gone  <br>

 This group of amendments provides that the non-jury trial system in the Bill will expire after two years unless the Secretary of State makes an affirmative resolution order to extend it for subsequent two-year periods. The system contained in the Bill has always been intended to address the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland, especially the paramilitary and community-based pressures that jurors in Northern Ireland face.</p>

Initially, it was our view that the special provisions should be allowed to wither on the vine. We have listened carefully to the debates on this matter, however, and that has given us cause to reflect on our initial view. We have paid attention to the quickening pace of change in Northern Ireland and the move towards more normal circumstances. Such a move has been evidenced by, among other things, Sinn Fein&#146;s commitment to support the police and the rule of law, and by the events earlier this week involving the devolution of power to Northern Ireland.</p>

principle of non-jury trials beyond July 2007 because of the improving security situation. The Independent Monitoring Commission had reported favourably on the activity&#151;or lack of activity, as it described it&#151;of the IRA, and Sinn Fein had publicly declared its support for the police and the criminal justice system. We recognised, however, that there was some way to  go regarding dissident republicans and loyalist paramilitaries, so we supported the retention of an ability to hold a trial without jury. We welcomed the change of emphasis, however, and the change to a presumption that trials would be held with a jury unless otherwise stated by the Director of Public Prosecutions&#151;although we disputed who should actually make the decision.</p>

 I, too, welcome the fact that the Minister has reflected further on the provisions to make permanent the option of non-jury trials in Northern Ireland. When the Government introduced the Bill, they said that those provisions were all about normalisation but, in trying to make permanent the temporary, annually renewable provisions relating to the Diplock courts, they were attempting to normalise the abnormal. I welcome the fact that the Government have thought better of permanently providing for a non-jury court option subject to a review by the Secretary of State, and that they have restored the principle that, if this provision is to be extended, it must be renewed by Parliament.</p>

The Government&#146;s move from introducing legislation last year to end Diplock courts in July this year&#151;or July next year at the latest&#151;to providing permanently for the non-jury option did not seem to rhyme either with the Government&#146;s judgment of the more benign circumstances or with the very positive prospects that we see now. I was always at a loss to understand how special, annually renewable, temporary provisions that were introduced in the vicious heat of the worst violence of the troubles would be necessary as a permanent feature in the cool calm of the current circumstances.

points raised in earlier debates. The amendments provide reassurance that the Government truly expect the provisions to be temporary. I am also pleased that the affirmative resolution procedure will be used to renew them.

The renewal decision will remain with Westminster. Clearly, three of the four conditions in the first limb of the statutory test relate to proscribed organisations, and the system of non-jury trial falls within that part of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 dealing with national security matters. It is therefore clear that the matter should remain one for Westminster, and that renewal should be considered by the House. That does not mean that we cannot discuss such matters with a future Justice Minister, First Minister or Deputy First Minister, as we reach a conclusion about whether to bring forward further affirmative resolutions.

 May I remind the House of how far we have come? We are now talking about restorative justice schemes being regulated in a formalised way. If we remember the previous position, that is a great step forward. The fact that we are arguing about the details is a source of great hope, because in the past there was no question but that acts of vigilantism, rather than formalised restorative justice schemes, were taking place in Northern Ireland. Let us give credit to those in Northern Ireland who have made that change, and to the Government for getting us this far.

 I welcome the amendment, particularly as a member of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee. Last year we conducted an investigation of community-based restorative justice schemes, looking at those in Andersonstown and Bangor. It was clear that while the schemes required some form of regulation, which the amendment will clearly provide, they were effective on the ground. That was because many of those involved had spent 30 or 40 years performing deeds that they now regretted&#151;everything up to and including murder&#151;and were now able to intervene early in the lives of young people, telling them &#147;Do not follow the path that I took&#148;. We saw for ourselves the success of that programme. Reoffending rates were at least 10 times higher among people who went to prison than among those who had benefited from community-based restorative justice schemes.</p>

I am sure we all support that, but there have been concerns about various schemes.

The advice from parliamentary counsel is that the amendments that he initially brought to our attention are defective, in that they make specific requirements that are not necessary. Indeed, if we made specific requirements in relation to these schemes, we would need to legislate for reports and requirements in relation to a range of others that are not included in legislation.

 The Secretary of State is required to make an order abolishing the deputy Justice Minister post three years after the devolution of policing and justice functions, unless the Assembly has resolved that it be abolished earlier or, alternatively, that it be retained beyond that time. As originally drafted, the Bill made such an order subject to the negative resolution procedure. However, the Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform considered the order-making power and observed that the circumstances specified in the Bill in which the Secretary of State is required to act are matters of ascertainable fact, not of opinion, and the timing, too, is preordained. In other words, the time scale is set, the period of three years is in statute, and it will be a matter of fact that either the three years have been completed or the Assembly has made a specific request.</p>

 I welcome the fact that the Minister is moving to tidy up an absurdity that had been built into the legislation, for all the procedural and logical reasons that he has pointed out.

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="70510-0010.htm_para3"><a name="07051063000436">This motion precedes a Bill being introduced to the House that will take forward recommendations made by Kate Barker and Sir Michael Lyons that the Government bring the rating of empty commercial property into the 21st century. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced on Budget day, this reform has environmental, social and economic merits. Any Member who supports the continued regeneration of urban areas, the use of brownfield sites for developments to meet both our housing and commercial property needs, and the abolition of distortions in the tax system that artificially hold rents up and apply unwarranted costs to business, will want to join me in supporting the motion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="70510-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07051063000437">Perhaps it is worth setting out why Kate Barker and Sir Michael Lyons both considered reform of the rating of empty property to be important. Currently, a commercial property is subject to full business rates when it is occupied but is given relief when it is empty. Different types of property get more or less relief when they are empty. Shops and offices have full relief for three months after they fall empty and then 50 per cent. relief ad infinitum. On the other hand, industrial property enjoys complete relief for as long as the premises are empty. This distinction between the relief given to different types of property&#151;which is, in fact, a very large form of state aid&#151;has its history in the depressions of the 1970s and 1980s, when demand for industrial premises was low and demand from alternative users for such land was also low.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="70510-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07051063000438">Two important things have changed since that distinction was drawn into the legislation. First, after a decade of sustained growth the demand for, and price of, land has increased dramatically, placing a burden on both households and businesses needing to access property. Efficient land use, and in particular the use of brownfield land to protect greenfield sites, has become a key priority for the Government. Tax relief for empty property&#151;currently worth more than &#163;1.3 billion&#151;needs to be considered in this light.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="70510-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07051063000439">Secondly, and as a direct result of this increased pressure on land, the Government asked Kate Barker to consider the incentives for efficient land use in her assessment of planning and land use. As part of her analysis, Barker found that the current empty property reliefs are not aligned with risks&#151;there is little difference between the risks of different types of property falling empty. On that basis, the different tax treatments afforded to different types of property do not reflect real conditions in the market and are therefore creating a distortion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70510-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07051063000440">On those grounds alone there is reason enough for Barker to propose reform, but the data become more startling when we look at where the tax relief is going. Sunderland, Redcar and Alnwick were each listed in  <br>

the top 10 authorities with the lowest proportion of their commercial property stock claiming relief, while the City, Manchester and Birmingham are all in the top 10 authorities with property claiming relief. Clearly, land is not in such over-supply in those parts of the country that we should be offering tax relief to property that is not in use&#151;and in doing so shift the burden of taxation on to other taxpayers.</p>

 Does the Minister concur with the views expressed by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which suggests in respect of the demise of the United Kingdom engineering industry in the 1970s that a major contributory factor was that the inability to mothball factories during recession and the requirement to pay full rates on non-producing premises frequently led to machinery being sold off and buildings being demolished?</p>

<p><a name="st_o225"><a name="07051063000442"><a name="70510-0010.htm_spnew6"><a name="07051063001023"><b>Ed Balls:</b>
 I will come back to the views of that institution in due course. Clearly, at that time the combination of low rents and the fact that in the &#146;70s, &#146;80s and early &#146;90s recessions were a regular occurrence was a concern for businesses. As a result of the stability that we have put in place in recent years, that is now less of a concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70510-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07051063000443">The level of rents in the UK is also a key driver for reform. A series of recent reports by the private sector&#151;including by CB Richard Ellis in 2006 and DTZ research in 2004 and 2005&#151;have identified UK rents as among the highest in the world. That west end office space in London is regularly ranked as the most expensive in the world reflects a variety of influences; land supply and planning restrictions are two important factors. However, as London is the world&#146;s financial capital, it is perhaps less surprising that there are high rents in London than it is to find that office rents in cities such as Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Edinburgh are ranked as more expensive than in Manhattan, Madrid, Frankfurt and Sydney by these various reports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="70510-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07051063000444">There are significant regional variations in headline rents. In the south-east, Guildford&#146;s rents are &#163;10 per sq ft but Brighton&#146;s are &#163;5.50 per sq ft. In the north-west, rents are &#163;6.25 per sq ft in south Manchester but &#163;6 per sq ft in Trafford park. In the north-east retail sector, rents peak at &#163;330 per sq ft in Newcastle, and fall to &#163;145 in Sunderland and &#163;65 in Stockton.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70510-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07051063000445">There is also significant variation within towns and cities. For example, in Newcastle rents vary from &#163;330 in Eldon square&#151;the central shopping mall&#151;to just &#163;70 on Lower Grainger street, which is within half a mile of Eldon square. Office rents in London range from more than &#163;60 per sq ft in prime west end and the City to &#163;48 in prime mid-town and &#163;50 in prime Canary Wharf. In contrast, rents are &#163;21 in Brentwood and &#163;13 in Harlow. Rental prices have a real impact on business, and finding ways in which we can address the efficiency of the commercial property market is a key objective of the reforms.</p>

All were in favour of reform and recognised that the measures set out in this Bill will increase the supply of land and commercial property available for occupation and redevelopment.</p>

Birmingham city council suggested bringing industrial premises back into the scope of rating empty property, and bodies with wider development objectives also responded. For example, Merseytravel recommended that the unlimited period of rate relief in the current system be done away with. The Federation of Small Businesses had already identified this as an important area for reform in its 2005 report. It realised, as did the Barker report, that increasing the opportunity cost of holding property empty will increase downward pressure on rents. As companies that predominantly rent their premises, the availability of property at lower rents is critically important to small companies across the country.</p>

These are serious issues that we have reflected on, and they will in part be incorporated into the detail of the regulation that will be put before the House in due course, and into some of the accompanying measures that I will discuss in more detail in a moment. However, on balance, the Government agreed with Sir Michael and Kate Barker that reform should go ahead. Sir Michael said:</p>
<a name="70510-0010.htm_brev5"><a name="07051063000733"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Demand for land for development is growing as a result of economic change and household growth, and it is clear that, more than ever, we need to ensure that all previously developed land is used most effectively.</p>
</ul><a name="70510-0010.htm_brev6"><a name="07051063000734"><ul><p class="tabletext">Analysis shows that vacant property is found in areas of high demand as well as in areas of low demand and former industrial areas.</p>
</ul><a name="70510-0010.htm_brev7"><a name="07051063000735"><ul><p class="tabletext">Finding ways to raise the opportunity cost of holding unused land and property in areas of high demand at such a time would be desirable. Reforming the empty property relief would help to provide this, and thus assist local authorities&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70510-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07051063000455">It was on the basis of Sir Michael&#146;s advice that the Budget announcement on this issue was made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70510-0010.htm_para19"><a name="07051063000456">Let me discuss the detail of our proposals, which will be set out in due course before this House in detailed regulation and legislation. The proposed reform will mean that most properties will enjoy a three-month rate-free period on becoming empty; the period for industrial properties will be six months. Three months was the limit on the rate-free period already established in legislation, but because Kate Barker demonstrated in her report that there is no inherently greater risk of particular types of property falling empty, it is right that there should be convergence in the tax treatment of all forms of property. We are therefore bringing the treatment of industrial property toward that for office and retail property, allowing it a six-month period with no rates. We intend to exempt charities and community amateur sports clubs altogether from paying rates on empty properties that they own.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="70510-0010.htm_para20"><a name="07051063000457">These reforms will impact on the owners of long-term empty property, including existing and new build premises, but because the Government now have the evidence that we need to create targeted support in areas where it is needed, we are bringing forward reform to empty property rates as part of a wider package of incentives for the future use and re-use of land and property.</p>

 I welcome the fact that the Economic Secretary appears to want to target this relief.

part of ongoing consultation on the legislation. However, what we can do is to target particular help on low-demand areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="70510-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07051063000460">We recognise that in some parts of the country there are low levels of demand and that, as a result, commercial property can sit empty for longer periods. By way of response, we have introduced with effect from 11 April&#151;a full year in advance of the proposed changes to empty property rating, which will not come into effect until next April&#151;a new 100 per cent. capital allowance for the renovation of business property in assisted areas across the UK. The business premises renovation allowance is available to owners in these areas of property that has stood empty for more than one year, and it will provide a huge boost to those who want to create attractive commercial property fit for the needs of new and existing businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="70510-0010.htm_para22"><a name="07051063000461">Given that we also want to maintain high levels of development on brownfield land, especially that which it is costly to remediate, we are consulting now on the extension of land remediation relief to a wider range  of contaminated sites. The consultation includes extending the scope of the existing 150 per cent. capital allowance to the clean-up of sites with long-term derelict property on them, as well as to those that have been invaded by Japanese knotweed&#151;which I am sure at least some Members will recognise as a serious threat to many urban and rural locations. We intend also to increase the incentives for on-site remediation, thereby decreasing the pressure on landfill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="70510-0010.htm_para23"><a name="07051063000462">To provide flexibility for leaseholders faced with onerous penalty payments to enable them to rid themselves of leases that they no longer need, or which do not provide them with the flexibility that they require, we intend to consult on changing the tax treatment of such payments to ensure that they are fully recognised by the tax system. For those companies actively using property and paying business rates, we have also accepted Sir Michael Lyons&#146; recommendation that the retail prices index cap on business rates be retained. This fits into our wider strategy of improving business competitiveness. We will also examine the case for local supplements on the rates, as set out by Sir Michael, but while paying the closest attention to ensuring that business has a strong and clear means of holding local authorities to account. Reforms to be outlined in the planning White Paper will help to provide an environment for the development of the quality and quantity of property that UK businesses and homeowners demand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="70510-0010.htm_para24"><a name="07051063000463">Finally, let me put this in a slightly broader context. Investment in property is essential to business and to creating a modern, dynamic economy. At the centre of the reforms that we have put in place in recent years has been the launch of UK real estate investment trusts. Thirteen companies have already become UK REITs since the beginning of this year. In addition to the measures that we are debating today, REITs are another way in which we can improve the quantity and quality of finance available for property in a revenue-neutral fashion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="70510-0010.htm_para25"><a name="07051063000464">We also announced in the Budget that we are taking the same principles that shape UK REITs and building tax equivalence for property authorised investment funds, thereby allowing open-ended investment in property through unit trusts to enjoy the same tax  <br>

treatment as that enjoyed by UK REITs. These are supportive measures to boost the supply of property suitable for investment that meet the needs of British firms. Today&#146;s motion is one part of that reform and modernisation, which spans the whole commercial property market and provides incentives for owners, developers and tenants to produce the right kind of property, and to take advantage of efficiencies in the use of land and property that will increase supply and drive down costs for their consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70510-0010.htm_para26"><a name="07051063000465">The Government are working hard to ensure that we provide the right conditions for businesses to grow, for land and property to continue to be developed, and, once developed, for it to be used efficiently. In its submission to the Callcutt review of house-building delivery, the Home Builders Federation signalled the supply of land as the major factor that will determine whether the Government&#146;s target of 200,000 new homes built by 2016 will be met. As the Government increase the supply of housing to meet the needs of households across the UK, a tax relief for property sitting empty on developed sites makes neither economic nor environmental nor social sense. That is why this is a principled reform that is overdue and forms part of a positive set of announcements on the future taxation of land and property.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="70510-0010.htm_para27"><a name="07051063000466">The measure has had extensive work and consultation by my hon. Friends the Financial Secretary and the Minister for Local Government. It is hard to achieve a consensus with the Opposition on the importance of building new homes, given the continual opposition of shadow Front Benchers to house building in our country, but I hope that we will reach consensus at least on this measure.</p>

operation of the property market as to speak in service of yet another tax increase. Fluent and authoritative as he so often is, all that fluency and authority were bent towards one end&#151;ensuring that the Chancellor can get the &#163;900 million additional revenue that this measure will raise every year. The most compelling argument in favour of the measure was not made at the Dispatch Box today by the Economic Secretary, but in the Red Book when that figure was produced. That is the principal justification for the change. The Chancellor&#146;s imperative is plugging his black hole, not the sensitive rebalancing of rates and reliefs to secure the better working of the property market.</p>

 As ever, my hon. Friend makes an excellent point.

answers to those questions. The three broad areas are a matter of theory, a question of principle and the reality in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="70510-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07051063000482">On a matter of theory, on what basis do we levy business rates? What is the theoretical principle behind them? As widely understood, they are a tax on business activity. As my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) might say, it is one of all too many taxes on business activity. Nevertheless, business rates are an accepted part of the Chancellor&#146;s portfolio. Business rates are supposed to be a tax not on land values but on commercial activity. That is why there is a relief when there is no activity. Changing the principle to remove that relief does more than increase revenue: it changes the very nature of the levy, and it raises key questions in turn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="70510-0011.htm_para4"><a name="07051063000483">The principle that there should be tax relief on empty properties was outlined by the admirable Kate Barker, whom the Economic Secretary prayed in aid in support of the measure. However, it is also clear that, in her report, she made the case for a relief on business rates when properties are empty. She said:</p>
<a name="70510-0011.htm_brev0"><a name="07051063000736"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The principle behind empty rates relief is to create a broadly symmetrical tax, given uncertainty. When property earns a positive revenue, it is taxed; when it does not, relief is granted. This helps remove what would otherwise be a distortion.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="70510-0011.htm_para5"><a name="07051063000484">According to Kate Barker, therefore, the Government, by removing the existing relief, are introducing a distortion. They are levying a tax that should be designed to get revenue from activity on property that is inactive and, in the process, changing the nature of the tax itself. Why? Do the Government accept Kate Barker&#146;s argument that the change would be a distortion? If not, why not? What is the justification for the change?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="70510-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07051063000486">We acknowledge that, all other things being equal, the change will raise revenue. The Economic Secretary said with some pride that the amount would be &#163;900 million. However, that tax increase raises another issue. One of the principles underpinning business rates is that, overall, the yield nationally from them should remain broadly neutral in real terms. In other words, when business rates rise, they should do so broadly in relation to the retail prices index.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="70510-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07051063000487">If the proposed change is made, the amount generated by business rates will increase by more than the rate of inflation&#151;even as that has been adjusted under this Government, and even as inflation rises and the Governor of the Bank of England writes to the Chancellor warning of the consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="70510-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07051063000488">The question that we have to ask is as follows: are the Government contemplating a balancing reduction in the burden on business? My hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough asked that question earlier. Alternatively, are the Government breaking another golden rule&#151;that business rates should not be used to make up losses elsewhere?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="70510-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07051063000489">The danger in using business rates as another source of revenue to make up shortfalls elsewhere was explored in the review by Sir Michael Lyons.

The process of assembling suitable sites for redevelopment or of putting together the complex business deals that can bring regeneration is often complex, with many variables.

relief into their calculations. That is not merely a theoretical concern, as it goes to the heart of the active business of regeneration today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="70510-0011.htm_para18"><a name="07051063000498">I have discussed the theory of business rates, and the matter of principle in connection with certainty. I turn now to some specific matters of reality, in an attempt to discern what happens on the ground when it comes to regeneration. I have a series of questions to which I hope the Minister will respond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70510-0011.htm_para19"><a name="07051063000499">First, it is appropriate that we learn from history. A very similar measure to the one being proposed was introduced in February 1974, when the Conservative Government of the day were on their way out and desperate to secure tax revenue by any means necessary. If any historical parallels suggest themselves, I am more than happy that Ministers should draw them.</p>

<p><a name="st_o242"><a name="07051063000500"><a name="70510-0011.htm_spnew12"><a name="07051063001040"><b>Ed Balls:</b>

<p><a name="st_o243"><a name="07051063000501"><a name="70510-0011.htm_spnew13"><a name="07051063001041"><b>Michael Fabricant (Lichfield) (Con):</b>
 Interest rates have just gone up again today, to the highest level since 2001.</p>

<p><a name="st_o244"><a name="07051063000502"><a name="70510-0011.htm_spnew14"><a name="07051063001042"><b>Michael Gove:</b>
 I am grateful for the other historical comparisons being drawn to my attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="70510-0011.htm_para20"><a name="07051063000503">One consequence of the removal of rate relief introduced in 1974 was that empty properties were not proposed for development or deployed for commercial use. Instead, some properties were wrecked or left to become dilapidated so that people could escape paying rates on them altogether. What guarantees can the Minister give that the change will not create a perverse incentive? Can he assure the House that empty properties will not be turned into derelict sites rather than being proposed for productive economic use?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="70510-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07051063000504">Secondly, the presumption inherent in the Economic Secretary&#146;s speech was that business is deliberately keeping property idle instead of using it, because it wishes to earn that relief. Will the Minister for Local Government give us the evidence base for that assumption? Can he point to specific examples of companies that have not put sites to productive use because they prefer to earn the tax relief rather than create viable economic activity? I can understand the theoretical justification behind the Minister&#146;s argument but he produced no practical examples, from any business sector or from any part of the country, to show that landlords or owners were deliberately sitting idle to earn the relief. Production of that evidence base would certainly be useful for the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="70510-0011.htm_para22"><a name="07051063000505">The change in timings goes to the heart of the measure so, thirdly, what assessment have the Treasury and the Department for Communities and Local Government made of the genuine turnover in the business cycle? For example, the British Retail Consortium argues that it can often be 21 months between one business winding up and another being economically active on the same site. Have the Treasury and the DCLG conducted a proper survey into the speed with which vacant and void sites become not just occupied but economically active as new tenants take them over? What evidence base is there to justify the change?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="70510-0011.htm_para23"><a name="07051063000506">Fourthly, there is a real risk, which has been outlined by both the BRC and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, that the change will hit the areas of the country most in need of redevelopment. Property developers face the greatest risk in those areas, because by definition that is where there is the least current demand for property, whether commercial or residential. By removing the relief, the risk of making an investment in those areas increases, because one would have to be absolutely certain of securing occupancy to make the same investment viable. What assessment has the Minister made of the impact on areas most in need of regeneration of, in effect, introducing an extra cost and an extra risk for development in those areas?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="70510-0011.htm_para24"><a name="07051063000507">Fifthly, the change could have a particularly adverse effect on businesses in the event of a recession, as my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough pointed out. It will add lead to the economic pendulum, because it will mean that businesses that have to relinquish property to downsize during an economic downturn will face an additional cost just as the economic weather is turning. Has the Minister factored into his calculations the impact of an economic downturn on the commercial property market once the reliefs have gone?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="70510-0011.htm_para25"><a name="07051063000508">Sixthly, there is a clear disincentive for certain businesses to take on leases. Given the operation of the commercial leasehold market, taking on a lease could involve bearing additional cost and risk in the event that commercial activity means that the property becomes vacant at any point in the future. Again, what assessment has the Minister made of the likelihood of companies shying away from taking on leases because they have to take into account on their balance sheet an additional risk factor?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="70510-0011.htm_para26"><a name="07051063000509">Overall, I have spelled out a number of ways in which there is increased risk. My seventh, and final, point about the genuine, practical, real-time effect of the measure is that increased risk may have an effect on property values. If there is a downward effect on commercial property values as a consequence of increased risk, it may have an effect on the share price and on the dividends paid by commercial property companies. Given what has happened elsewhere in the economy, especially in equities, over the past 10 years, more and more pension funds&#151;public and private sector&#151;rely on commercial property as part of their portfolio. If there is downward pressure on the balance sheets of companies that operate in the commercial property sphere and if it has a knock-on effect on the portfolios of pension funds, what is that effect likely to be? What calculation has been made? We know from the past that there can be, and often are, dangerous unintended consequences of changes made by the present Chancellor that have a knock-on effect on pension funds and the capacity of individuals who have saved to receive an appropriate rate of return?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="70510-0011.htm_para27"><a name="07051063000510">I would like answers on those seven practical points, as well as the two theoretical matters that I mentioned. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s clarification before the debate concludes.</p>

legislation that we have not yet seen&#151;I agree with the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) that that is the best way to approach the measure&#151;I want to start by asking about the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="70510-0012.htm_para0"><a name="07051063000513">The Economic Secretary based his presentation on the Lyons recommendations, and although it is certainly true that the Lyons report recommended precisely what the Government want to proceed with, that recommendation does not quite fit with his recommendation in a later paragraph, which is not a criticism of the Government but of the report. In paragraph 8.6, Lyons recommended:</p>
<a name="70510-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="07051063000740"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Government should conduct a review of exemptions and reliefs to consider the scope for removing inappropriate subsidies and distortions, and to simplify the system.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="70510-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07051063000514">There was thus a firm recommendation, but also a recommendation for a review, so it was not clear how the two would hang together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="70510-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07051063000515">Having read through the relevant paragraphs of Lyons, it is fair to say that although he made a firm recommendation, on which the Government have acted, his arguments were more equivocal and balanced than those in the Minister&#146;s presentation&#151;I know that the hon. Gentleman takes economic arguments seriously. Lyons called in aid Tony Atkinson and Stiglitz, who made a good theoretical case for keeping empty property relief, because of the risk-sharing problems. So, there are clear arguments on both sides, which is all the more reason to have proper consultation and consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70510-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07051063000516">The other reason why the process&#151;whatever the outcome&#151;needs to be carefully staged is that the feedback that the Government have had from both interested and disinterested bodies is not clear cut either. The Federation of Small Businesses is quite supportive of what the Government said, but it made the interesting recommendation that the legislation should take account of the fact that some businesses are making a genuine effort to fill their property. It is not clear how the legislation will accommodate that. The Campaign to Protect Rural England was, again, broadly supportive of what the Government are trying to do, but it said that the Government must undertake the measure in conjunction with changes to the VAT regime to make it more attractive to improve property. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the British Retail Consortium were much more critical. The first issue is about the process and why the Government cannot undertake a process of consultation over the next year or so, which is what Lyons appeared to envisage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="70510-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07051063000517">My second set of questions is about the revenue implications. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath has suggested that, whether we call this measure a withdrawal of state aid or a tax, there clearly are major revenue implications. That may indeed be right. First, I would like to be clear what the implications are. In his speech, the Minister referred to various offsets. I want to be clear whether he envisages a full whack of &#163;950 million on the commercial property sector or whether there are any offsets and, if so, what they are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70510-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07051063000518">My other question is about the behavioural implications of the change. I think that the Government are arguing that the measure is necessary both to raise revenue and to change business behaviour to make it more efficient. There is nothing wrong with that. In the context of  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 May 2007">

environmental taxation, we argue&#151;as do the Government&#151;that it is possible to raise revenue and change behaviour at the same time. There is nothing wrong with the argument, but I want to be clear what assumptions the Government are making. Lyons implies that the cost of empty property rate relief is &#163;1.3 billion. The Government say in the Red Book that they will raise an additional &#163;950 million. Does that mean that the difference is accounted for by improvements in the utilisation of commercial property? Are the Government assuming that commercial property use will improve by a factor of a quarter? Or are the figures completely unconnected?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70510-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07051063000519">A related question is: who will pay the tax? As we know, with all business taxation the cost is shifted in one direction or the other. There is an assumption that the tax will be paid by inefficient landlords and over-exuberant speculators, but is that in fact the case? We must assume that, in most cases, the increased taxation of commercial property will, at some point, be paid for by occupiers. It could be paid for by the landlords&#146; other occupiers or in the form of longer leases.</p>

<p><a name="st_o246"><a name="07051063000520"><a name="70510-0012.htm_spnew1"><a name="07051063001044"><b>Mr. Stewart Jackson:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman touches on an important point. Does he agree that the Government have not looked at the macro-economic impact in respect of the cumulative impact on inflation that this change may well have? As he concedes, the cost will be passed on in the form of higher rents and service charges, which could potentially cancel out any overall benefits to the economy.</p>

<p><a name="st_o247"><a name="07051063000521"><a name="70510-0012.htm_spnew2"><a name="07051063001045"><b>Dr. Cable:</b>
 Whether the measure will lead to more inflation or to less utilisation of capacity elsewhere in the economy is not clear, but the hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that there are knock-on effects. One that has not been referred to and that is potentially rather important is the fact that a large chunk of commercial property is owned by pension funds. Eventually, the measure will feed through into reduced returns for pension funds. There will be a hit on pension funds. Of course, they have had other hits&#151;some of which have been much more important than this&#151;but it would be useful to have some acknowledgement from the Government and some estimate of what the measure will ultimately cost the owners, who are institutional finance bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="70510-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07051063000522">I have several questions about such a measure&#146;s possible impact on the market. I understand the basic problem involving empty commercial property and have a couple of anecdotes to illustrate it. An appalling derelict Co-op completely blights the whole of one of my local high streets. As far as I can establish, the property has been sitting empty for many years simply because of the lethargy and incompetence of the Co-op management. If a change to the tax regime would persuade the company to do something with the property, that would be welcome. However, we all know of shops in our local shopping centres that were not viable and had to be closed by the occupiers. Those people are often desperate for planning approval to convert the property into a housing development, but local planners refuse to give that because it would change the nature of the shopping centre. Are we going to penalise those shopkeepers? How will they be accommodated following the change?</p>

 I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware that people who wish to change a commercial building to a different form of development, such as housing, have to market it actively for a considerable time to show that the property has no commercial use. Unless the Minister tells us differently, I assume that such people would be paying business rates during all that time. The planning process can often hold things up for a considerable time, so several years could pass while there was a debate about the matter, or even during the assembling of sites.</p>

 The hon. Lady is absolutely right and makes the point that I was trying to raise. The Federation of Small Businesses asks what we will do about commercial occupiers who are genuinely trying to do something about the utilisation of their properties. Should they be treated in exactly the same way as companies that wilfully keep their properties unoccupied, or do so due to incompetence? As far as I can tell, that distinction will not be captured. It is possible that the distinction cannot be made because it can be difficult to legislate for such things. However, we should realise that there is a distinction in the real world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70510-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07051063000525">Several issues are being raised by representatives of the property industry. We understand that some of them are self-interested, but it is worth quoting the British Retail Consortium, which has considered the matter primarily not from the perspective of property developers, but in the context of its interest in the retail sector. It comments unequivocally:</p>
<a name="70510-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="07051063000741"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The BRC believes that there has been a fundamental misunderstanding of the mechanics of the property market and this reform will, as a result, fail to achieve its objective of bringing empty property into use.&#148;</p>

For example, an email that I received from a group in Wales said:</p>
<a name="70510-0012.htm_brev2"><a name="07051063000742"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Here in South Wales we have a number of redundant large industrial buildings. They are a legacy from when previous administrations enticed overseas manufacturers to set up here with offers of cheap land, cheap labour and big grants...By introducing a new rates liability for empty industrial buildings in particular, we fear that...property entrepreneurs will not be prepared to take the risk and these buildings will crumble and die.&#148;</p>

trade who are making these assertions might well have an interest in opposing the Government&#146;s proposal, but it would be useful and appropriate for us to have an understanding of whether the Government have made an assessment of those possible effects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70510-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07051063000529">Finally, I have a series of questions about how the measure would be implemented. One of them relates to a point that I have already made, and to the issue that the hon. Member for St. Albans (Anne Main) raised in her intervention: what will happen to those companies that are genuinely trying hard to market their property and to utilise it, but that are none the less caught by the new provisions? That was the issue raised by the Federation of Small Businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70510-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07062785000001">My second question relates to local discretion. The Economic Secretary mentioned that there is a bigger issue to do with whether commercial rates should be localised. As it happens, my colleagues and I want to push that idea as far as it can go, but the current controversy raises the question of how much local discretion should be allowed under the provisions that the Government are proposing. For example, would people in a depressed part of south Wales be allowed to implement the measure over a different time frame and in a different way from people in a more prosperous part of the country? Will local discretion be allowed, and if so, how will it be applied? There are many quite major issues to consider. At the end of the day, the provision may well be sensible&#151;it certainly has endorsement from some authoritative sources&#151;but it clearly needs a lot more thought and a great deal more consultation.</p>

They need the money and it is amazing, really, that we have avoided the measure thus far, but as a grab on a particularly vulnerable area, the proposal is not much better intellectually than the window tax.

The first case concerns hard-to-let village premises. Anyone with a rural constituency will know the problem of a pub closing and the owner applying to convert it into a house. The village usually reacts by setting up some sort of co-operative venture to try to buy the pub and run it. The problem is that if people do not buy their beer in the pub, it does not matter who owns it&#151;if it does not make a profit, it is going to close. There are implications, too, for the village shop and post office, which are in a similar situation.</p>

However, the Hutchinsons decided that the time had come to retire, so they tried very hard to let the property. As far back as 2001, in fact, they tried to do so. They put the property on the market for six months, as required before a change of use, but they did not make a sale. They waited and they eventually found a tenant. They invested &#163;14,000 to adapt their property so that it could be used as a hairdressing salon, which involved a change to A1 use. Sadly, however, the tenants&#146; business failed, so the Hutchinsons were left with nothing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="70510-0012.htm_para21"><a name="07051063000537">Mr. and Mrs. Hutchinson took professional advice again and they submitted an application to the planning authority. The planning committee agreed, but the regulatory committee threw out the application. They have now been told, some seven years after the original decision, that they must go back to square one. They have spent almost &#163;20,000 because of the planning system, which impacts on such matters, as my hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans (Anne Main) rightly said. I referred the matter to the head of development services and asked which planning policy was causing apparent distortion in the market. It was Salisbury district planning policy PS3, which says:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="70510-0012.htm_para22"><a name="07051063000538">That is the justification for the distortion. The fear is that as a consequence of the proposals, in the intervening period after the planning authority, acting on behalf of the local community, has decided that people should not be allowed to stop a shop being a shop if no one wants to buy anything there, the owners must pay business rates on the property for years. It is not their fault&#151;it is because the planning system has introduced a distortion in the market allocation of resources. That is a very important issue that I hope Ministers will consider.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="70510-0012.htm_para23"><a name="07051063000539">My second case concerns redundant farm buildings. Late last year, my constituent, Philip Kitson of Manor farm in Chilmark, referred me to a problem with a unit in his farm buildings. He has wonderful farm buildings, but they are completely useless for farming. They were built in the early 19th century, and one could not get a quad bike in there, let alone a modern tractor. The Kitsons did what the Government wanted and diversified. They sought to convert the property, and they did so professionally and successfully. However, tenants move on, so they were left with a building&#151;in this case, a B1 workshop and office premises. They therefore had to find money for business rates for an unoccupied building . Mr. Kitson pointed out to me:</p>
<a name="70510-0012.htm_brev6"><a name="07051063000746"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are a farming business, not a property company, and have no alternative sources of income to offset any loss of rental income...we have invested a considerable amount of time and money renovating buildings for rental which have rarely been empty.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="70510-0012.htm_para24"><a name="07051063000540">The district council has benefited hugely, at no risk to itself, because those buildings are bringing in business rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="70510-0012.htm_para25"><a name="07051063000541">In the end, the matter went to the desk of the Minister for Local Government&#151;I am pleased that he is in the Chamber today&#151;and he and I have been in correspondence for some months. Referring to the Lyons report, he said to me in a letter of 17 April this year:</p>
<a name="70510-0012.htm_brev7"><a name="07051063000747"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We understand that these reforms will increase the liability on owners like Mr Kitson. However, as the Chancellor&#146;s announcement made clear, the purpose of reform is to enhance the supply of commercial property, reducing rents and improving access for new and existing firms. Downward pressure on rents will have significant benefits for UK business and wider UK competitiveness.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="70510-0012.htm_para26"><a name="07051063000542">That is not what the local market says in my constituency, where there is already overcapacity. It is all very well saying that that might be the impact in urban areas, but in scattered rural communities in south-west Wiltshire there is already overcapacity in such units, and I fear that the measure will make matters worse. Can we be quite sure that when Ministers are working out the process and the machinery for introducing the change, they take due account of the need to be careful about rural proofing the measure? The least they should do is introduce it over a number of years and not say, &#147;From 1 April 2008, wham! Bang! You&#146;re going to have to pay the bill.&#148;</p>

 I want to understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument. I am worried that the point he is making is not market-based and is more dirigiste. When he uses the term &#147;overcapacity&#148;, he means properties that are unused. Are they unused because there is no demand or because the rent is too high? Are we not looking for a way to get the price down so that they can be put back into use and there can be more activity?</p>

<p><a name="st_o252"><a name="07051063000545"><a name="70510-0013.htm_spnew1"><a name="07051063001050"><b>Robert Key:</b>
 That is an entirely fair point. Without getting into either endogenous growth theories or Marxism, I would point out that the Minister is right to ask the question, but the answer is no. The problem is overcapacity, not rents that are too high. I will illustrate that with my next example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para0"><a name="07051063000546">We have a large number of former military establishments in my constituency and in Wiltshire as a whole. One of them is the former royal naval armaments depot at Dean Hill, which was built in 1938 and became a major armaments depot, storing under the chalk hills enormous quantities of arms for the Royal Navy from Portsmouth, and latterly for the RAF as well after the closure of RAF Chilmark, which was another establishment that was redundant to the needs of the Ministry of Defence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07051063000547">The area is huge&#151;some 500 acres with 1,600 sq m of office space. It has a variety of business units&#151;more than 40 of them&#151;and 24 vaults cut into the chalk offering more than 9,000 cu m of high quality dry, secure storage. That is where the bombs and depth charges were kept. The problem is how the Ministry of Defence disposes of property. It is part of the Chancellor&#146;s remit to persuade the MOD to get rid of redundant property.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07051063000548">After the property had been empty for years, a splendid company has taken over the site, bought it from the Ministry of Defence, and is successfully converting it into very attractive office and industrial premises in a wonderful environment, with a site of special scientific interest on the spot. I cannot speak warmly enough of the effort of Mr. Richard Parry and his company, who have taken a substantial risk. Having taken over 500 acres from the MOD with all those buildings and facilities, which they had expected to be able to bring into use over a number of years&#151;with the agreement of the planning authorities in order to avoid overdevelopment, too much traffic on rural lanes in south-east Wiltshire and Hampshire and so on&#151;they could face a crushing liability for business rates if the measure is suddenly introduced now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07051063000549">That will dissuade investors like Mr. Parry. They simply will not do it. The holding costs of the property will be too great. What about valuation? The district valuers already value Ministry of Defence estates, but they put them on a low value because they are of military use or are not used at all. To return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath, they are not producing business activity or generating wealth, so they currently do not qualify for taxation. What about the district valuer now? He has been to Dean Hill park and assessed individual buildings. As they are brought into use, the district valuer assesses them and the owners rightly start paying their business rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07051063000550">What will happen in future? We need to be sure that Ministers have thought about that. Will they suddenly  <br>

create an extra army of district valuers who can go round to all these Ministry of Defence sites and revalue hundreds of buildings and other facilities? Have they got the staff to do it? I guess not. When will the clock start ticking? Will people have to start paying this new business rate on 1 April next year or six months afterwards? Perhaps the Minister has not thought that question through yet, but I would be grateful if he could answer it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07051063000551">We see here, once again, the need for rural proofing. I wonder what the Ministry of Defence will say about this, given that the defence budget is still strapped, despite a modest increase in cash terms. The pressure on it is enormous. Will it be liable to pay the new business rates on all its empty industrial properties, given that it no longer enjoys Crown exemption? I would be grateful if the Minister could answer that, and I dare say his colleagues in the MOD would like an answer too.</p>

 My hon. Friends and I have a lot of questions about this proposal. As my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Robert Key) said, we all have our own particular set of problems that it will draw to the surface. I should like to give the Minister a few illustrations from my constituency. It is a city, not a rural area, but it has its own set of unique issues that will be exacerbated or affected by perverse consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07051063000554">One example is the West Hall site in Napsbury, formerly the site of a hospital. It has many buildings that do not come under the national listings but are locally listed as having importance. The site has been designated for housing, but many such applications get stuck in the system for a long time, and rightly so according to local residents, who do not want bad development in St. Albans. While they accept the need to have housing on the site, they also feel that a degree of caution should be exerted. They do not want to end up with 37 flats all squeezed into one commercial building; that is also seen as unacceptable by the local authority. Being stuck in the planning system can be a good or a bad thing. The problem is that we are not sure whether the proposals will make matters better or worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07051063000555">Another example is the former Evershed&#146;s commercial print works site, which has been vacant for a considerable period. It was redesignated for housing, and housing permission was sought and obtained. However, it has since been sold on to Tesco, which is trying to develop it as a commercial site again. We would prefer that it remained designated for housing. I am worried that the rush to try to make it a commercial development will stand in the way of local people who would rather see housing on what is a truly sustainable site, and that Tesco will try to get its big building up as quickly as possible before local people can exercise a degree of pressure on their local authority to ensure  <br>

that the local district plan is upheld and housing is built there. Can the Minister tell me at what point the commercial building rates will be paid? Will they have to be paid until development occurs that changes the site&#146;s use?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07051063000556">On the London road in St. Albans, we have a listed cinema&#151;the Odeon, which has an art deco façade. Unfortunately, it went out of use some 11 years ago. People are desperate to keep that landmark property in St. Albans. It has been stuck in the planning system for 11 years. Perhaps it will be turned into some form of housing development, but local people welcome the fact that there is no rush to do that because they hope to bring it back into commercial use as a cinema, which we do not have in St. Albans. There is huge support for that but, because the building is small, it is difficult to find somebody who is prepared to take it on. Delicate negotiations are going on all the time behind the scenes, conducted by those who want a cinema in  St. Albans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07051063000557">However, 11 years have passed. At one point, the decision was held up speculatively and then applications for housing were constantly refused. However, local people do not want things to be rushed. They do not want the cinema, with its characterful façade, which could be revitalised, to be quickly put to another use because of the commercial rates that suddenly have to be paid on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07051063000558">There are flip sides. Good results can be achieved through bringing buildings back into use, but I am worried that the process may mean the loss of the slow pace of change that local people welcome when they want to ensure that historic sites and buildings are not suddenly put to commercial use or demolished, with the site used for housing. We need answers, and I believe that the planning system will play a crucial role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07051063000559">A roof tax has been mentioned. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury and many reports stated, there is a concern that it may mean that the roofs are simply removed from buildings, resulting in some vandalism. The Odeon cinema still has its roof. The vandals have picked away at it, but it remains intact. I would hate to allow commercial vandalism, resulting in the removal of the roof, simply because people who are suddenly in the position of having to pay tax on a building want to ensure that it is useless, and thus take away all hope from local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07051063000560">Estate agents, such as Cluttons, who have an interest in the matter, have expressed some views. I would like some answers to their concerns and to ascertain whether the Minister has conducted any assessments. People already challenge the Valuation Office Agency&#146;s level of rating. Several cases of buildings, which currently pay only 50 per cent. but seek a nil value, have been heard before the tribunal office. If empty commercial property owners now have to appeal against rating assessments and any new categories that are introduced, surely the appeals will create an increased administrative burden, as people in the nil rating bracket find themselves in a new rating bracket. Has any assessment been made of the extra staff that the Valuation Office Agency may need and the  extra costs that it will incur through the additional burden?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07051063000561">I should like some clarity at some point in future, if not today&#151;I understand that we are exploring the  <br>

matter today&#151;about buildings that might be considered exempt. I should like to ensure that the many historic buildings such as churches, which may not have charitable status and could simply be landmarks, do not face an extra tax burden. I am sure that it is difficult to identify the ownership of some buildings. I know of a house in St. Albans that was caught up in that sort of confusion for some time. It was eventually compulsorily purchased. I am also concerned to ensure that a retrospective charge is not levied against families who are unaware that they own and may have some ongoing interest in a building, which suddenly comes to their notice. There are some complex probate cases and I wonder whether the Minister has taken them into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para15"><a name="07051063000562">We are being asked to vote for a pig in poke if we are not absolutely sure that all the questions that my hon. Friends have asked today are considered. We do not want properties to remain empty. The Economic Secretary made the valid point that that makes no environmental sense, and I agree with him. However, it does not make environmental sense to rush towards removing roofs or damaging buildings in some way, yet such acts may be the perverse consequences of the proposals. As my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury said, it makes no environmental sense to charge people who are genuinely trying to market a building.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para16"><a name="07051063000563">In areas where there is a commercial property, people often have to fight the rigmarole of a local district plan to prove that the building no longer constitutes viable commercial premises. That can take such a long time that some poor family or small business could be left with an enormous charge on a property that has been incurred through no fault of their own. That is perverse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para17"><a name="07051063000564">I welcome the exploration of the idea of bringing back buildings into use, because St. Albans is very tight on space. It is a matter of record that I feel that we are put under enormous pressure to build and develop in St. Albans, but we also consequently have commercial premises sandwiched in areas that we do not want to be vandalised. We want to see buildings brought back into use, but where that is not feasible, we want to ensure that time is spent considering the best uses for them and that nobody pushes through a quick commercial use order to avoid paying any form of development tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para18"><a name="07051063000565">I would welcome the Minister&#146;s consideration of all the points raised in the debate, and particularly of whether, when a change is made under the planning system&#151;as on the Evershed sites, for example&#151;it should apply when planning is granted or when development occurs. Those vagaries will not provide much confidence or support for the measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para19"><a name="07051063000566">I agree with some of the business-related comments that have been made, as the proposal is seen as a stealth raid grab. If it is seen as a stealth raid grab with good consequences, there may be some support for it; but if it is seen as a stealth raid grab with perverse consequences, I feel that many Conservative Members will view it as a move too far. Given that the Federation of Small Businesses also has many concerns, I am sure that we are going to hear a lot more detailed comments about the measure in the future.</p>

Friend the Member for Salisbury (Robert Key). They were perhaps far too polite to state the obvious and place this particular proposal in context by observing that it is one of 111 stealth taxes that the Government have imposed over the past 10 years. It represents the big clunking fist approach to commercial property, and we are no doubt going to see a lot more of it over the next few years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="70510-0013.htm_para21"><a name="07051063000569">This proposal has all the characteristics of the stealth taxes that we have learned to know and love. It is a consummate stealth tax because it is typical of the sleight-of-hand taxes that we have become used to over the past 10 years. It is sneaky. It has been announced only in the last few months, but its effects will not come into force until April 2008. Of course, it does not appear in the Finance Bill, but has been brought before the House through a Ways and Means resolution. It is also ill considered and damaging, and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury eloquently explained, it will have unintended consequences. It is indeed, as my hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans said, a straightforward tax grab, netting the Treasury &#163;1.85 billion over the next two years. The proposal is, of course, dressed up in euphemistic language, when it is described as modernising empty property relief. That is rather like the Prime Minister saying that Labour&#146;s local government election results were a springboard for a general election victory, when we all know that it was more like a belly-flop.</p>

This is a Government who have entrenched the principle of holding capital by way of property&#151;forgive me if I sound rather like the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher), who is the Minister&#146;s parliamentary neighbour&#151;when foreign nationals who are non-domiciled in this country own huge portfolios of property, which are left empty while people are left homeless and more people than ever before in the past 10 years are on waiting lists or in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. There are 6,000 of those people in my own constituency. At the same time, the Government seek to penalise and disadvantage British business people with this particular tax grab.</p>

Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), this has been a &#163;50 billion tax grab over the past 10 years, and there has been no corresponding offsetting tax reduction, as expounded by the Treasury. Indeed, small businesses took a significant hit in tax increases in the Budget.</p>

The corollary of this policy is that entrepreneurs will take far fewer risks when investing in difficult areas&#151;areas that find it difficult to attract niche entrepreneurs&#151;which will affect the creation of jobs, businesses and, obviously, the tax take for the Treasury.</p>

The Government are ignoring the underlying factors relating to the fact that some commercial premises are sometimes empty for longer than is desirable. This can happen, for example, as a result of restrictive alienation clauses preventing sub-letting or assignment. I do not think that the Minister mentioned that, although I might have missed it.</p>

 We have had a good, short debate. I commend hon. Members on the thoroughness of their research. The points have been made reasonably and, in response to the tribute to my hon.

that it will. If I am not able to answer all the points that have been reasonably raised, I commit the Government to attempting to do so, should the House pass the resolution, in further consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70510-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07051063000588">An important point has been made about the possible impact of the measure, and constituency Members of Parliament have done their research. The hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key) in particular has researched the possible impact on the three examples that he gave. The law of unintended consequences bedevils legislation, so we must give the matter proper consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70510-0014.htm_para2"><a name="07051063000589">The hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) set out a logical argument based on theory, principle and practice. Let me deal with the theory first. Non-domestic rates are not a tax on business activity, but a tax on property. The domestic rate is partly a tax on property, for property services, and partly a tax on individuals. Although Members have referred to business rates today, the motion refers to non-domestic rates. That answers the points made by the hon. Member for St. Albans (Anne Main), who sought exceptions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70510-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07051063000590">As for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points about the principle, there is a misunderstanding&#151;I forgive him for perpetuating it&#151;that bedevils the debate about non-domestic rates, and I am grateful to Sir Michael Lyons for shedding light on it. Many people assume that the retail prices index cap on non-domestic rates is a cap on the individual bill paid. Non-domestic rates, unlike council tax, are based on the rental rather than the capital value, although some argue that the system should be different. In considering the impact of this measure, therefore, we must consider its impact during the two periods before and after revaluation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70510-0014.htm_para4"><a name="07051063000591">That pulls the rug from under the feet of those who say that this is a smash-and-grab raid on businesses. The intention of the measure is to decrease rents across areas. By increasing the supply of available premises, it will decrease rents after revaluation. In this country there are regular revaluations every five years, as there have been since the system was introduced. It is worth noting that revaluation for the purpose of non-domestic rates proceeds without a murmur in the House or a column inch in the newspapers, in stark contrast to the hundreds of thousands of column inches devoted to the non-revaluation of domestic properties. That, to my mind, justifies my policy of not proceeding with the domestic revaluation: goodness knows how many column inches would be spilled if such a revaluation took place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70510-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07051063000592">The principle of the RPI cap is clearly there, and I restate our commitment to it. That is important, because it will decrease rents in the future. The hon. Gentleman assumes, however, that it is a simple cap on the yield. In fact, the cap is on the increase in the business rate multiplier&#151;what we all know as the penny in the pound. We used to call it rateable value, and I think we should reintroduce the term because more people understand it. I make that commitment as well: I shall not use the horrible phrase &#147;business rate multiplier&#148; again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="70510-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07051063000593">The exception arises at the time of the revaluation, when overall rateable values increase if that is the way in which the market is going. The multiplier is adjusted, and the resulting increase in yield is pegged to inflation.  <br>

That has been the case throughout the system of non-domestic rates, and it is a very strong pro-business measure. It deals with the point that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath rightly made about general stability. We must remember why uniform business rates were introduced in the first place. I think it right for me to concede that my party got it wrong before that. Our actions led to instability, and were bad for business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="70510-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07051063000594">As for the practice, the hon. Gentleman asked a number of questions&#151;more than he said he had. I counted 10, although he said there had been seven. In any event, I shall try to answer them as best I can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="70510-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07051063000595">The accusation has been made that pension funds may be damaged because they hold property portfolios. Empty properties are only a small part of pension fund portfolios, and properties that are occupied will benefit in the medium and long term from the reduced rents that will result from the pincer effect that I have described. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point in respect of the short term either. The actively managed property portfolios experience low levels of voids. However, the most important determinant for growth in yields to pension companies and other investors in property is demand from the wider economy. I do not dismiss the point that has been made, but I always think that it is a good debating point to look at one side of the equation. The argument about pension fund tax misses the point that corporation tax was reduced at the same time; from the overall point of view, that must also be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="70510-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07051063000596">I hope that I have answered the point about consultation and proper parliamentary scrutiny. The next question that was asked was about the alleged failure to consult on what is an appropriate rate-free period. A three-month rate-free period currently exists, and we will not change that&#151;there is certainty in that regard. The Kate Barker review found that there is no structural difference in the propensity of properties in different sectors to fall empty. None the less, we will provide an additional three months of rate-free period for industrial property, returning the total rate-free period to six months, so there is movement in that direction. We can debate these matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70510-0014.htm_para10"><a name="07051063000597">It has been argued that there is no evidence to justify the making of the reforms that alter the rate and the length of the rate-free period and that there is also no evidence of what their exact nature will be. That was also addressed by Kate Barker and Sir Michael Lyons. As has been said, she carried out a fairly thorough assessment of the case for reform, and so did Michael Lyons. That is part of the evidence base that we are using in bringing forward our proposals. However, I concede that there is a question to do with balance in respect of some of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70510-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07051063000598">The hon. Gentleman also asked questions that perhaps anticipated an economic downturn should his party ever form the Government; the DNA and mindset of the Conservative party is to plan for recessions, as that is what its experience shows happens. The Bill will provide&#151;I appreciate that Members have not seen it, so I do not criticise those who asked about this&#151;a new power for the Secretary of State to reduce the rate for empty properties from the new level of  100 per cent. of the occupied rate back to a minimum  <br>

of 50 per cent. There is some flexibility in that measure. The hon. Gentleman should not now rush away and write in his newspaper column that the Government plan for a recession; there is always a danger of that happening when we talk about introducing prudent and cautious measures. It is important that measures such as this one are not locked in stone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70510-0014.htm_para12"><a name="07051063000599">The hon. Member for Salisbury referred to the Valuation Office Agency. It is already the case that an empty property is valued, so we do not anticipate a surge, or even a blip, in the work of the VOA. Its work is already part of the tax base. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath will know&#151;perhaps from reading lurid headlines, which I think of as scaremongering&#151;that we are computerising the valuation process. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Well, it is the central premise of the Conservative argument against our policy that we are doing that, so it is not fair of Members to criticise this point. We are successfully computerising the valuation process. The VOA has been successful at non-domestic rates revaluation, which has passed without a comment; I have been surprised about that. That is a reasonable point to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70510-0014.htm_para13"><a name="07051063000600">The question was also asked why this measure will be implemented in 2008, rather than in 2010. Lyons&#146; recommendation was of course linked to the revaluation process, and we propose to introduce the measure in 2008 because we believe that its benefits&#151;I do not mean just the increased revenue, which I shall come to in a moment&#151;are required now. As my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary explained, relatively speaking we have very high rents. In my view and as the <i> Financial Times</i> reported this morning, it is daft that the taxpayer effectively subsidises empty properties, given that we have among the highest rents in the world. When my constituents heard that rental values in Manchester are higher than in Manhattan, they were surprised, as was I. So I checked it out and it proved to be true.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70510-0014.htm_para14"><a name="07051063000601">On the question of certainty, I appreciate the point that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath was making about the micro level. However, stability will be provided at the macro level because, as evidence shows, if the policy is successful&#151;as we of course expect it to be&#151;it will have a beneficial effect in the medium to long term. I have already dealt with the point that he made about the Lyons report and increased revenue from empty properties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="70510-0014.htm_para15"><a name="07051063000602">Members also asked about assessing the location of empty properties and whether there will be differential effects. It is clear that the policy needs to be examined in relation to areas such as the cities of London, Manchester and Birmingham, and Slough, which my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary mentioned. Analysis of England by region and by value shows that, unsurprisingly, the north-east and the south-west have the lowest figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="70510-0014.htm_para16"><a name="07051063000603">Some important points have been made about regeneration areas, and I was grateful for the recognition earlier of my own commitment to regeneration; I did indeed not only read the available evidence, but consulted some of the urban regeneration organisations. Renovation funds are available in areas with Department of Trade and Industry assisted area status. However, compared with areas such as the City of London, a major obstacle in regeneration areas is of  <br>

course the availability of land. We do not believe that there will be a negative impact on business confidence as a result of this measure. For example, redevelopment and regeneration schemes in Liverpool are already making available &#163;8.2 billion for development, with planning permission already granted. That is not related, except in a tiny way, to the empty property issue. I concede that one has to consider the impact in different parts of the country, and Members have made strong points about the potential impact on their local economies. If I cannot deal with those points today, I hope to be able to do so on Second Reading, should the House resolve this motion today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="70510-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07051063000604">The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) called for further consultation, which is clearly desirable. However, we in this country sometimes suffer from consultation fatigue, and Opposition Members have criticised us for having too many independent reviews. One cannot have one&#146;s cake and eat it, but the point about consultation, particularly parliamentary consultation, is a fair one. The hon. Gentleman also referred to the twin objectives of raising revenue and changing behaviour, both of which are indeed objectives in this policy area. Such measures are part of the revenue-raising measures in the Budget. They have to be taken in the round, alongside decreases in corporation tax over the years&#151;and, of course, the most successful stewardship of the economy in our country&#146;s history over the past 10 years. I shall say that especially loudly today. However loudly or softly I say it does not change the fact that it is true, and I wish that people would sometimes listen to the argument and not who is making it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="70510-0014.htm_para18"><a name="07051063000605">The hon. Member for Twickenham asked about the &#163;1.3 billion in Sir Michael Lyons&#146; report and the &#163;950 million. It is important to point out that in our assumptions we build in a &#163;900 million figure in year two, recognising that the impact overall will be to lower rents. That addresses the point that the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) rather sceptically&#151;I do not say cynically&#151;raised. I think that he called the measure a stealth tax or a smash-and-grab raid. It is not. It is part of the revenue-raising measures, but it will also have the desirable consequence of changing behaviour, as the hon. Member for Twickenham pointed out.</p>

I am not making an accusation, but for the figure to be valid the company had to assume that the property would be vacant. I do not suggest that that was that company&#146;s deliberate policy, but there are many examples of companies who build offices, turn the lights on brightly to advertise them, stick a For Rent notice outside, hire a security guard and disappear to the Mediterranean. In my view, that is undesirable.</p>

 For clarification, the local development framework has allocated that site for housing, and housing permission was granted on the Evershed site. The site was sold on to Tesco and, although any commercial development business could have acquired it just as easily, that company has kept it and now wants to develop it. The matter has not got as far as planning but remains at the consultation stage. That means that the original permission has not been overridden yet&#151;thank goodness!</p>

 I apologise. The cinema would be an asset to her city, but the fact remains that there appears to be no developer willing to take the project on, despite the public support that it enjoys. Nothing that the Government might do about planning legislation will change that. I do not believe that the proposal before us would hinder that process: on the contrary, I believe that it will help because, if it impacts business activity by changing planning decisions, that will be beneficial.

 I know that the Minister for Local Government, who replied to the previous debate, has handed over responsibility for this debate to his ministerial colleague the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela E. Smith). However, while he is here, I want to draw to his attention to the fact that every Member of Parliament for Northumberland is in his place for this debate. They all agree in their preference for a two-district solution to local government in the county, and they do not support the single-district solution that the county council has proposed. The Minister has kept both options on the table and we shall be discussing them in this debate, which his colleague the Under-Secretary will answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para2"><a name="07051063000631">It is a unique situation: four MPs in three political parties are in broad agreement about the direction that Northumberland should take. I defy the Under-Secretary to find another example from the whole round of local government reorganisation in which she is so assisted by unanimity on one proposal. I hope she and her colleagues take that factor carefully into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para3"><a name="07051063000632">Northumberland is inherently a difficult area in which to implement a unitary system. The advantages of unitary local government are strong and obvious: it is much less confusing for the public, savings can be made and there are more opportunities for the council to deploy its funds to a wider range of services and to relate those services to each other. However, for geographical reasons, we have hung on to the two-tier system until now, even though in parts it is under severe strain and presents real problems in the smaller districts. These days, the county council is not a successful authority&#151;certainly much less so than in my earliest years as a Member of Parliament&#151;and has run into serious problems. I do not say that the problems have nothing to do with who controls the council, but a number of other factors are involved, too.</p>

The council has had to hand out that function to consultants who may in future be employed by the very developers on whose applications they are giving advice. That is a deeply unsatisfactory situation.</p>

right hon. Gentleman accept that one of the main difficulties is that successive Governments have not always recognised the county&#146;s super-sparsity, which has a particular impact on education and social services? Recently, the county council tried to get rid of surplus school places, but on three occasions an appeal against school closure went against the council. Is that not a particular problem?</p>

<p><a name="st_o268"><a name="07051063000635"><a name="70510-0015.htm_spnew2"><a name="07051063001066"><b>Mr. Beith:</b>
 That is one of the factors I had in mind when I said that there are many reasons why there are difficulties with the two-tier system. The hon. Gentleman is right: the financial formula has not worked in Northumberland&#146;s favour at all. Indeed, one of the merits of the two-district solution is that sparsity may be taken more into account, instead of being masked by the fact that there is a significant urban population. Furthermore, some of the deprivation factors that apply in urban areas might be given more weight if there were two separate authorities. At present, we miss out on all sorts of things that are intended for rural areas even though we are one of the most sparsely populated areas in the country, because there is a mixture of extremely sparse and highly concentrated areas of population in the same county.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para5"><a name="07051063000636">If the two-tier system were to continue, lots of joint working would be needed, but the county has shown no willingness at all to engage with the idea of enhanced two-tier working. There have been approaches from the districts, but the county has shown no interest. There is a danger that we may still end up with a two-tier system and no great prospect of changing or improving it; Northumberland may be put on the &#147;too difficult&#148; pile, because two possible unitary solutions are in play. That would be a pity, because we need to move forward in some way and I am disappointed that the county has not actively pursued the enhanced two-tier alternative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07051063000637">That all six district councils in Northumberland have agreed that there should be a two-unitary solution is extremely unusual in local government reorganisation. The councils are controlled by different parties and in most cases there is no overall control, but every district and every political party involved agreed on the same solution. The county leadership decided to put forward a one-unitary solution, but it could not get that through its own council, despite having a majority. It had hastily to redraft the resolution supporting a single authority solution to indicate that both proposals were going forward. Without the acknowledgement that both proposals were valid, its resolution would not have got through at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para7"><a name="07051063000638">The Northumberland proposal is a one-size-fits-all approach and is not capable of responding to the needs of the diverse communities of the county. There are two distinct parts of Northumberland. When I say &#147;Northumberland&#148;, I mean the present administrative county. If we were talking about the real Northumberland, we would be talking about areas long since transferred into other authorities such as North Tyneside and Newcastle. This is not an argument about the historic county of Northumberland, which is much bigger and has a much larger population than the administrative county whose future as one or two unitary authorities we are discussing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para8"><a name="07051063000639">Within the administrative county, there is an urban south-east and a rural area of west, mid and north  <br>

Northumberland. Not a single member of the county&#146;s cabinet comes from the rural area and I think that there are only two members on the executive of the county council who come from outside the Wansbeck and Blyth Valley districts. That is an inherent weakness in the way in which things work and its results can be seen in the decisions that the county takes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para9"><a name="07051063000640">Many regional organisations say that unitary status is needed and that they will work effectively with whatever structure is implemented, because they think that it will be more efficient than a two-tier system. The White Paper is all about allowing citizens the opportunity to shape the communities that they live in. In that case, why are we still considering a single unitary proposal that does not have the support of Northumberland residents, its community organisations, its district councils or its Members of Parliament? Instead, we have the option of having a rural Northumberland authority, with a population of 164,000 and a south-east Northumberland authority, with a population of 142,000. Let me just underline the difference between the two. The population of the rural area works out as one person for every 3 hectares; the population of the urban south-east proposed authority works out at 10.6 people per hectare. That gives an indication of the fundamental difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para10"><a name="07051063000641">On 27 March, the Department for Communities and Local Government announced which proposals were going forward to stakeholder consultation. To quite a lot of people&#146;s surprise, in Northumberland two proposals went forward: the county&#146;s proposal for one unitary authority and the districts&#146; proposal for two unitary authorities. I think that all the councils in Northumberland would probably have preferred the Secretary of State to identify a single preference, but, along with Bedfordshire and Cheshire, we have two potential solutions and probably a longer period of uncertainty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para11"><a name="07051063000642">Why is that so, when the people of Northumberland have already voted on the matter? In the referendum in November 2004 on regional government, they were given the opportunity to decide between a two- authority solution and a one-authority solution in exactly the format that they are now proposed. Some 56.2 per cent. voted for the two-unitary option and only 43.8 per cent. opted for a single council. Far from there being any evidence that opinion has moved in favour of a single authority since then, an ICM opinion poll in December 2006 showed that 67 per cent. were in favour of a two-council option.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the number of organisations, including political organisations, that support the two-unitary system is well made. Is he aware that the boundary committee, in its report published in May 2004, stated:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para12"><a name="07051063000644">Does he think that that statement takes the argument forward?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para13"><a name="07051063000646">The Government have put forward assessment criteria against which the authorities have to be measured. Both bids qualified as capable of delivering savings. Some people expressed concern about whether there is an element of cross-subsidy from the urban to the rural area that might be lost if we had a two- authority solution. My belief is that that will almost certainly be offset by what happens with the funding formula&#151;for the reason that I gave earlier. At present, the rural area is deprived of the provision that the Government rightly make available for sparsely populated rural areas because its figures are buried within those of a larger area with a substantial urban component.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para14"><a name="07051063000647">Three different marks could be given for the likelihood that the outcomes specified in the criteria would be satisfied: a high likelihood, a reasonable likelihood and little likelihood. Both bids passed on all counts, so it was judged that there was at least a reasonable likelihood of each of the criteria&#151;affordability, cross-section of support, strategic leadership, neighbourhood engagement and service delivery&#151;being achieved. However, I am puzzled by how the scoring was done. For example, the proposal for a single unitary council got a reasonable rating for cross-section of support, but there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that there is a cross-section of support in Northumberland for the county&#146;s single-council solution. In fact, there is a great deal of evidence to the contrary. The districts&#146; two-council bid also got a reasonable rating for cross-section of support, even though all the evidence shows that there is a high cross-section of support for that proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para15"><a name="07051063000648">Councils have not yet been given any information about the rationale behind the scoring, except for that in the Department&#146;s letter of 27 March. Having scored the criteria, the Department seems to be saying that the really important issue is whether the overall threshold is passed, rather than the scoring of the individual criteria. However, during some of the discussions, a lot is being made of the scorings that have been achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para16"><a name="07051063000649">Let us consider the cross-section of support again. I have mentioned the referendum and the opinion of the four Northumberland Members. More than 100 local organisations support the two-authority option. That bid has as wide a cross-section of support as could be achieved for any reorganisation proposal. However, the county council&#146;s bid was only just supported by that council when it was considered alongside the other bid, so the support was very qualified. Some regional stakeholders said that they were doing no more than commending unitary government in principle, rather than distinguishing between the proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para17"><a name="07051063000650">Most of the regional bodies that have indicated support for the county&#146;s bid are much bigger than the county itself. It suits them to have fewer local authorities to deal with, and their structure does not address the problem that we are examining: how to keep local government reasonably local. The arguments about the police are sometimes cited. The police force covers a much larger area than the existing county and it wants to be bigger still. It wanted to amalgamate with two further police forces, but the Government wisely decided that that would not be a  <br>

good idea. I do not think that the police authority is the best body on which to rely in this matter, given that the Government have not seen fit to support the authority&#146;s record. The White Paper is about putting communities at the centre of decision making, so the scoring should have reflected that more accurately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para18"><a name="07051063000651">Curiously, the scoring received by the proposals on strategic leadership did not seem to be entirely accurate. However, perhaps even more doubtful is the scoring on neighbourhood engagement. Some councils have scored extremely well on neighbourhood engagement. Blyth Valley is a beacon council for community engagement, while Wansbeck district council&#146;s LIFE&#151;local initiative for everything&#151;model has been praised. The county&#146;s neighbourhood engagement takes place through a system of area committees. While that could work well, the authority is not taking much notice of the area committees in some parts of the county, so even the existing mechanism is not being used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para19"><a name="07051063000652">I realise that the Under-Secretary will not be able to say a lot in response to the debate because she is part of the consultation process. However, if the Government were to adopt the county&#146;s proposal for a single authority, would the county be treated as a continuing authority under the Local Government Act 1992? If it were, the existing county apparatus would essentially survive, and rather than having new authorities in which all positions would be up for open competition to allow people with the experience and qualifications to do the job to be selected, the county&#146;s staffing structure would be preserved to a large extent. I hope that the Minister will address that matter, even though I hope we will not face such a situation because I want the Government to go for the two-council option.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para20"><a name="07051063000653">The next criterion I want to consider is service delivery. Satisfaction levels and residents&#146; experiences of the authorities demonstrate that the county council&#146;s services are, in a number of respects, worse than those of most of the district councils. There are a number of respects in which having an authority the size of the present county manifestly does not work. We have experienced particular problems with education and school transport. The county council has failed every attempt to win Government support for its projects under the building schools for the future programme. Every single bid that it has made has been turned down. It now looks as though it will be 2014 before we are even in with a chance. There must be something wrong, and I put that to the Minister for Schools, who came up to the region. Clearly, officers in the relevant Department do not regard the county&#146;s bids as satisfactory. There is a serious element of the Government not valuing the kind of proposals that the county makes. That may partly reflect the difficulties of running education services in such a diverse county.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="70510-0015.htm_para21"><a name="07051063000654">To take the case of school transport, the county failed to bid for funds that it would have received from the Learning and Skills Council, and so deprived itself of money that was available. Partly as a consequence, it is charging everyone over 16 who needs school transport &#163;360 a year to get to school or college, and that is in an area where the take-up of post-16 education is low. It has denied college students from Berwick rail passes to get to college in Newcastle. Instead of a 45-minute train journey, they face a bus  <br>

journey of an hour and a half, or an hour and three quarters, and many of them simply opt out, or pay to travel on the train. Those points illustrate the fact that the county is not able to administer some of its services satisfactorily in such a diverse area. That is one of the drivers behind people feeling that they would be better off with two authorities, rather than one.</p>

 May I raise the issue of the vulnerable, including the homeless and old people?

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. He knows the area well, particularly the strains and stresses in the urban area around Blyth Valley. It gives me no pleasure to say that the county is letting us down on a number of key services. There are some difficulties that have made that the case. However, people should take certain things into account before they assume that because we have a county council it could be the basis for a unitary authority and that everything will work well, including all the services now run by the district councils, including housing. Recently, there was a sharp increase in charges for home help and community care. That really hits vulnerable people in the area. I hope that the Government can help the county council to do better in various ways, but the examples that I have given do not represent evidence that running a single authority on the basis of the present county would be a good idea.</p>

 That brings me to another point: the council put up the charges for home help for old people by &#163;5. That increase was to generate &#163;1 million. My wife, who is a county councillor&#151;I declare that as an interest&#151;has three times asked what had happened to that money. The argument was that it would go back into services for old people, but it disappeared and no one could find out where it had gone. I know where it has gone, but of course no one wants to say. My wife is still hanging on to that question; she still has not had an answer on where the money that the old people were charged went.</p>

 Given the exchanges that have taken place, the Under-Secretary must be beginning to understand that there are four people in the Chamber who have an intimate knowledge of the problems that the county council faces. We have all been led to the conclusion that there is no basis for a single unitary authority in Northumberland, and we have given a number of examples of why that is so.</p>

On the other hand, if the Government opt for two unitary authorities, the county council will have no mandate to campaign against the proposal, as its own resolution actually supports both proposals.

are going to go to the barricades to try to save a proposal that has been so widely criticised. If the Government want to win the confidence and support of people in Northumberland, they should opt for the two-authority scheme. If they were so unwise as to try to promote the single-authority scheme, they would face severe opposition.</p>

 I thank the right hon. Gentleman for giving way again. The county council&#146;s problems are compounded by the fact that in its proposal it suggests that a political status quo exists in the single unitary authority&#151;that is, it would be quite happy if a leader were elected from the cabinet&#151;whereas the two-unitary system obviously proposes that there should be elected mayors, which is very much in line with the White Paper.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman reminds me of a point that I should have made earlier. On those grounds, the two-unitary solution proposed by the district councils satisfies the Government&#146;s criterion for strategic leadership much more closely than the county&#146;s own proposal. It is a much more explicit attempt to meet that particular demand from the Government.</p>

Let&#146;s just leave it alone&#148;, there would be a great deal of disappointment among people on all sides of the argument, and there would not be a very promising atmosphere in which to achieve an enhanced two-tier system, which is the only viable alternative. It would be a system in which authorities would have to share services a great deal. I am not saying that it would be a bad thing, but it would be necessary to plan the sharing of services, staff and so on. It would require a big change of attitude in the county council and in the district councils, too. I have not seen any evidence in discussions that the county is willing to undertake such lateral thinking. All the indications&#151;certainly everything that my three colleagues would want to propose&#151;suggests that a two-unitary authority solution is the right way forward.</p>

She should not fall into the same trap as the Prime Minister and think that Northumberland is the same as Durham, because it is not. Northumberland has one Tory Member of Parliament&#151;the hon.

If the county wanted to hold a referendum, it could have done so in March, but it did not go down that road. It huffed and it puffed, but it did not do so. If it had done, we might have had a proper referendum in Northumberland, although we have already had one, as the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed said. That proposal failed, but I have decided to run my own survey in my constituency. In fact, I have the honour of being the first Member in the House of Commons to use the communications money in that way. I phoned the authorities straight away and said, &#147;Can I use it for a survey and an article in the newspapers, and ask people to indicate which tier of local government they want in Northumberland?&#148; That was duly done, and the first advert appeared last week&#151;the second one will appear this week. There was an overwhelming response. I am just counting the responses, which stand at 200 in favour of the two-tier system and 49 in favour of the single-tier system. A pattern is emerging, as the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed said. There is support for a two-tier system. It is a pity that we cannot have a referendum throughout Northumberland. That would give a better picture, but there is already some information from Blyth. As soon as the survey is finished, I will send the results to the Minister, as they are a reflection of people&#146;s views.</p>

Council members must accept that such things happen, although I do not blame them for fighting to keep their seats. However, the county council is not a gravy train for them. It is for the people of Northumberland to decide what they want, and they are overwhelmingly in favour of a two-tier system.</p>

It has two stars for two services and none for services to the vulnerable, which I mentioned earlier, because it has closed all the homes. The council acted rashly and, I think, made a big mistake. The Government did not give the county money for the schools programme.

Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that this is the third attempt. Under the Conservative Government, Lord Heseltine, as he is now, had a go at it, but eventually walked away when there was no final agreement about its shape. This time, we have some solid agreement between all four Members of Parliament and all six district councils.</p>

Local government reform in Northumberland has always been bedevilled by the geography. We have a population of some 300,000&#151;about the size of a small London borough&#151;yet the county is one of the biggest in England. As we heard, students at Berwick take an hour and a bit to get to Newcastle. Getting to one of the hospitals in the east of the county used by my constituents takes a drive of an hour and 20 minutes. We are talking about very substantial distances&#151;probably 70 miles from north to south and 50 miles from east to west.</p>

opportunity to do some new things, because it is a model that does not exist anywhere else in the country. It may be possible for two authorities co-operating on several matters to deliver the efficiencies of scale that people say would be delivered by a unitary county. We have heard about the loss of services. In Northumberland, social services are already provided jointly with the NHS. We should also put into the picture&#151;perhaps unhappily for a Conservative&#151;the fact that we now have a fairly strong regional dimension, so decisions on matters such as planning and transport infrastructure, which could have been taken at county level, are taken at a higher level. The two authorities should be more than capable of co-operating to deliver efficient services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="70510-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07051063000677">Let me cite a slightly controversial example of where the system would work. The county council has determined that the three-tier school system, which we still have in Northumberland, should change to a two-tier system. There are arguments for changing to two-tier and for maintaining three-tier, but the arguments for two-tier are undoubtedly stronger in the urban, more densely populated areas than in the rural areas. The consequence of moving to a two-tier system in my constituency&#151;I am sure that it is the same for the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed&#151;would be that nine-year-olds would have to travel for more than two hours a day in coaches to get to school. After reorganisation, a three-tier system would have to exist anyway. That is an illustration of how the education system in a rural area would be better determined by a rural authority than by a unitary authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="70510-0016.htm_para13"><a name="07051063000678">I accept that our funding problems arose because the formulae have never properly taken population sparsity into consideration. It always amazes me that Northumberland has a lower sparsity than Norfolk. That is based on some spurious system invented by somebody long departed who took with him or her the secret of how to calculate it. It is apparently calculated on the basis of parishes, but it seems to affect rural areas very much. There is a chance of getting some better funding into our area, which is much needed to provide services.</p>

Existing arrangements in some two&#151;tier areas do not deliver the governance that places need today. All hon. Members made that point, especially the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed.

In making that decision, the Government had to have regard to all the relevant information&#151;the submitted proposals, any supplementary material from the proposers and any other available relevant information.</p>

They also had to be supported by a broad cross-section of partners and stakeholders. Comments were made about the relative value and relative merits of the amount of support for each proposal, which will be taken into account in the consultation that proceeds.

Consultation is now under way and judgments will be made about which part of the proposals will go forward, if either go forward, on the basis of that consultation and subsequent evaluation and judgment. I hope that that satisfies the right hon. Gentleman on that matter.

Again, those may be submitted and taken into account as part of the consultation. The consultation will last for 12 weeks, finishing on 22 June. As I have said, we welcome comments, information and views from key partners and stakeholders who have an interest in the areas affected by the two short-listed proposals. As the invitation explains, partners and stakeholders include all local authorities, the wider  <br>

 I think that we concluded earlier that both bids had passed the basic tests&#151;that they had both crossed the threshold. I have not seen any new information to date, and unless any emerges the Government must surely now be considering what the people of Northumberland actually want&#151;I submit that their view is more important than that of large or outside organisations&#151;and what quality can be achieved. We are not really going back to whether the proposals are affordable, because that has already been established.</p>

 We have established the likelihood of affordability, and we are satisfied. That is why the proposals have gone forward. However, we cannot discount any new information that might come to light. We shall take into account the views of the people of Northumberland, and of organisations&#151;there are many organisations in Northumberland that clearly want to make their views known&#151;but I shall not discount any new information that is relevant to all the criteria that have been set out. It would be wrong to write off any information that we might receive on the range of issues that we have to take into account.</p>

far more effective ways of working together. The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed made a point about the problems of inefficiency and ineffectiveness in some areas with a two-tier system. That proposal will not change for the areas that do not get a unitary system; they will all have to work better and more effectively, whatever the outcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70510-0017.htm_para1"><a name="07051063000702">We are talking about the devolutionary principle, and about the Government giving local authorities the opportunity to make a bid for unitary status. We have received two bids from Northumberland. This is a new era of local government, and when it comes to the choices about how we move forward, it is down to local councils, their partners and their citizens&#151;in this case, the citizens of Northumberland&#151;to make responses to the Government.</p>

 I did ask the Minister a question of which I gave her office notice earlier today: if the Government were unwisely contemplating acceptance of the single authority proposal, would that be treated as a continuing authority under the 1992 legislation, as that has pretty serious implications?</p>

 We are jumping ahead a little bit in presuming the outcome; decisions have not been taken. The right hon. Gentleman used the term, &#147;continuing authority&#148;, which has sometimes been used in the  past during reorganisations. Any unitary authority implemented as a result of the current process would be, as generally understood, a brand new authority; it would not be a continuing authority. The use of the term &#147;continuing authority&#148; was for a technical reason in relation to proceeding with a new organisation. No decisions have been taken on how a particular proposal would be implemented. A working group of stakeholders has been set up to examine all the implementation proposals. Within the limits of the legislation, we are prepared to be flexible on that. His point is noted, but no decision has been taken on implementation.</p>
