people who might need some support and technical assistance in
switching over, but, particularly for those people, we need a help
package that will give the assistance that they need. Digital UK is
taking the lead on that. I know that it will want to work closely with
the voluntary sector to ensure that those who are used to visiting

of the city of Aberdeen cannot get Channel 5. I was one of them. I
recently bought a digital television. I have 20-odd other channels, but
I still have not got Channel 5. If the Minister is going to make it

chosen to switch to digital because of the opportunities that it gives
them, the multi-channel service, and the availability of interactivity
on the services. He will know from his time on the Culture, Media and
Sport Committee that there is a major engineering exercise involved in
turning off all the various transmitters that need to be fixed and so

disadvantage people, that helps them to make the change over to the

running to make people aware of the switchover. Awareness has risen
from about 66 per cent. to 70 per cent. in just the last few months, as

borders, which will be the first region of the UK to switch over
entirely at the end of 2008&#151;that there is as high a level of
awareness as possible. That is why Digital UK has taken a special

their television signal on relay transmitters, rather than main

second-tier service after switchover because they will receive only a

come and go, but the truth is that at every opportunity the Scottish
people have rejected the politics of grudge and grievance and of

to remain within the United Kingdom, which is why Scotland has

misunderstood the proposals in the local government White Paper. It
sets out three new relationships: a new relationship between central
and local government; a new relationship between local government and
its partners; and a new relationship between local government and the
citizen. The desire is to reduce the number of targets from up to
1,200, and to concentrate on about 35. If we get that right&#151;I am
sure that we will, through the comprehensive spending
review&#151;local authorities will be freed to innovate locally, to
be creative in responding to local challenges, to lead their areas in
relation to the services that they deliver and to speak out for all
services delivered. To me, that is equivalent to devolution and

point in the White Paper. Because of the new framework, and the new
relationship between central and local government, we will be able to
reform the rolling system of inspection for each local government
service and to replace the present comprehensive performance assessment
with a proportionate, risk-based, comprehensive area assessment. The
Local Government Association and other local government stakeholders
have been calling for this reform for many years, and it should
massively reduce the costs for local authorities and make it possible
for them to lead their areas better.</p><br>

the process of reorganising boundaries. That would distract them from
their main job, which is to improve the quality of local services, and
to increase prosperity for local citizens and respond to their

would allow London the freedom that everywhere else in the country has
to determine neighbourhood arrangements. If local people think that
they are better served through parishes rather than, for example,
neighbourhood forums, it would be for local people to feed that view to
the local authority. The proposals are about making services responsive
to local citizens&#146; and community concerns. I hope that both
sides of the House share the view that it is in everybody&#146;s
interests to ensure that we meet citizens&#146; rising expectations
and tailor services to meet local needs.</p><br>

increased resources to local authorities by 39 per cent. in real terms
since 1997, as against a cut of 7 per cent. in real terms when the
Conservative party was in power. The Government value local services
and local provision, which is why our White Paper proposes a new local
settlement. Just as important as the distribution of funding, however,
is the flexibility of funding. While it is right that we always keep
under review the appropriate balance between different local authority
areas, it is also right that we give local areas the flexibility to
manage the resources channelled to them. That is what the White Paper
proposes.</p><p><a name="st_o83"><a name="06110743000130"><b><a name="61107-0003.htm_spnew17"><a name="06110743000473">Andrew

investment in public services, this Government are delivering that
investment to local authorities. Through the local area agreement, we
are giving local areas much more flexibility over how they use those
resources. For example, &#163;500 million is currently funnelled
through local area agreements, which could rise in future to
&#163;4.7 billion. He is right, too, that if we impose new burdens on
local authorities, they should be funded from central Government for
that purpose. The Government are committed to that, as will be seen

should like to make a statement on the single payment scheme
administered by the Rural Payments Agency. The House will recall that
in my written statements of 9 May and 5 July and in my oral statement
of 22 June, I said that the well-rehearsed difficulties in the
administration of the 2005 SPS would create challenges for delivery of
the 2006 scheme, and I promised to keep the House informed of
developments. On this occasion, as on every other, I would like to
reiterate the apologies that I have offered already to farmers on
behalf of my Department, and my commitment to remedy the
problems.</p><p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="61107-0004.htm_para1"><a name="06110743000178">Today I can report progress
with the 2005 scheme, and plans for the 2006 scheme. However, the
interim chief executive of the RPA and I are clear that much more needs
to be done to learn the right lessons from the National Audit
Office&#146;s recent report and to build on the helpful guidance that
I am sure we will see in the forthcoming reports from the Select
Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Public Accounts
Committee, the Office of Government Commerce and the Hunter
review.</p><p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="61107-0004.htm_para2"><a name="06110743000179">As I mentioned
in my written statement on 5 July, the total amount to be paid by the
RPA for the 2005 scheme will not be known for certain until the last
claim is completely validated and necessary corrections are made.
However, the latest estimate at 3 November puts the figure at
&#163;1.528 billion, of which more than &#163;1.516
billion&#151;in other words, 99.2 per cent.&#151;has now been paid.
Some 110,244 claimants have received a full payment and a further 4,756
have received a partial payment and are awaiting their
top-up.</p><p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="61107-0004.htm_para3"><a name="06110743000180">The combined
total of 115,000 represents 98.5 per cent. of the revised estimated
total claimant population entitled to a payment of 116,661. All but 50
of the claimants still awaiting any payment are currently calculated to
have a claim value of less than &#8364;1000. Those 50 are all
difficult cases, involving issues such as probate or business
liquidation, which would be challenging in any year. Dedicated teams
are in place to deal with those cases, and the other outstanding
payments, as soon as possible. Similarly, on hill farm allowance
payments, some 95 per cent. of claimants have received a full or
partial payment, and a dedicated team is exploring all avenues to make
the outstanding payments as soon as
possible.</p><p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="61107-0004.htm_para4"><a name="06110743000181">During
October the RPA moved the bulk of its processing staff to detailed
validation of the 2006 claims. Initial validation of those claims has
been undertaken over the summer and has gone relatively smoothly. The
same can be said of the 2006 round of eligibility inspections. However,
the difficulties involved in completing the 2005 claim processing have
inevitably impacted on the 2006 payment timetable. I am sure that
everyone in the House wants claims paid in full assoon as
possible. I understand that, and the new management of the RPA are
dedicated to build stability and predictability into the system so that
full claims are delivered in an efficient and timely way.</p><br>

executive has reported to me that he cannot guarantee that the agency
can deliver full payments within the payment window for the 2006
scheme. Neither he nor I believe that it is acceptable to expect
farmers to wait until next June or beyond for payments. I have
therefore agreed with the RPA a challenging formal performance target
of paying 96.14 per cent. of valid 2006 claims by 30 June 2007, and it
is determined to do all in its powers to deliver on that. However, in
addition, I have also decided to pursue a partial payment
plan.</p><p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="61107-0004.htm_para6"><a name="06110743000183">Our aims can be
simply stated. First, we want to maximise the number of payments to
farmers that arrive on a timely and predictable basis. That means
making full payments where possible and partial payments where
necessary. Secondly, we want to minimise the risk of late payment
penalties and disallowance. Thirdly, we want our decisions this year to
help the RPA to establish a new and sound footing for the delivery of
the single payment scheme in the future. I have therefore agreed with
the RPA that where full payments are not possible in the early part of
next year, partial payments should start in mid-February for eligible
claims above &#8364;1000. The RPA estimates that the process will take
around three weeks. Payments will be made for not less than 50 per
cent. of claim value. This reflects the level that EU regulations
permit without diverting significant resource away from, and therefore
delaying, work on validating claims for full
payments.</p><p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="61107-0004.htm_para7"><a name="06110743000184">Needless to
say, I will be keeping the situation under close review, but the
interim chief executive of the RPA has set out for me, and for Lord
Rooker, the basis on which he is confident that partial payments can be
made, and we believe, in part on the basis of the partial payments
experience in May this year, that the money will be
delivered.</p><p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="61107-0004.htm_para8"><a name="06110743000185">The single

clearly that this will not happen overnight, but I believe that the
staged approach that I have set out is the only one that is prudent and
responsible, and I commend it to the

the hon. Gentleman made. I am sure that we are completely united on two
things. The first is that none of us underestimates the problems or
hardships involved. Secondly, about a third of the way through his
questions, he asked whether farmers were entitled to full payment. Of
course they are entitled to full payment, and it is the
Government&#146;s job to deliver it to them in an efficient and
timely way.</p><p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="61107-0004.htm_para17"><a name="06110743000196">I fear
that the hon. Gentleman is labouring under a misapprehension about the
&#163;131 million referred to in the National Audit Office report; he
suggested that it was somehow responsible for, or related to, cash
cuts. We are using what is referred to, in Government budgeting, as a
non-cash provision, which means that the Government are making
allowance for future claims on the sum. It is designed to be a prudent
provision, and it precedes the normal audit work done by the European
Union. There has been no such demand for &#163;131 million, and I do
not think that it is in the interests of hon. Members on either side of
the House to talk up the potential for penalties further down the road.
I assure the hon. Gentleman that the &#163;131 million referred to in
the NAO report is not related to the &#163;200 million deficit with
which the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is
working.</p><p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="61107-0004.htm_para18"><a name="06110743000197">The hon.
Gentleman asked why I described the96.14 per cent. target as
challenging. I did so because the chief executive of the Rural Payments
Agency reported to me that there was no chance at all of the RPA
delivering full payments to all farmers by the date proposed. The hon.
Gentleman is right that, as I have said on many occasions in the House,
96.14 per cent. is the minimum level below which late payment penalties
are incurred. He asked about Ireland and France, and they, of course,
are paying 50 per cent.</p><p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="61107-0004.htm_para19"><a name="06110743000198">The hon. Gentleman asked why we
are not paying80 per cent. I referred in my statement to the
importance of the EU regulations on the subject. He will know that over
the past 10 or 15 years, hon. Members on both sides of the House have
thought it important that the EU should have proper regulation for the
disbursement of EU moneys, especially in relation to the common
agricultural policy; we have been arguing for that. I am sure that he
does not want to query the provision of that level of
rigour.</p><p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="61107-0004.htm_para20"><a name="06110743000199">The reason for
specifying 80 per cent. this year is that when the Agriculture Council
discussed the issue in 2003, and considered the first year of the new
scheme, which is 2005, the Commission said clearly that it would regard
2005 a transitional, exceptional year&#151;a year in which it would
be flexible about how partial payments were made. We used that
flexibility to deal with the circumstances that arose last May, which
all of us wish had not come about. The reason for the 50 per cent.
target is that that reflects the EU regulations, to which I think that
hon. Members on both sides of the House are committed.</p><br>

of the failures of the RPA, but there is also the blow to the
reputation of the Department, and it is very important to put things
right as effectively as possible. However, I must tell the hon.
Gentleman that farmers have said to me, time and again, that the most
important thing about this scheme year&#151;the 2006 scheme

on. That is why I put such stress on timeliness, and on the confidence
of the RPA&#146;s chief executive; when he says that partial payments
can be delivered in February, he knows that they can. I hope that
farmers will recognise that it is right that we should proceed step by
step, secure in the knowledge that each step is a safe step. That is
better than raising their hopes only to dash them

responsibility for the funds that are at their disposal. We have moved
to three-yearly budgets, for which there is support in many parts of
the House. The important thing is that, except in the most exceptional
circumstances, Government Departments work hard to live within those
budgets. At a time when we have a comprehensive spending review ahead,
we will be able to address in the round the issues of DEFRA&#146;s
budget. My judgment is that one cannot support the Government&#146;s
economic strategy on the one hand, and on the other, go running to the
Chancellor for funds every time there is a problem.It is about

David Gauke (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> On a point
of order, Mr. Speaker. I wish to return to the matter of
outstanding answers to Home Office questions, which I raised with you
last Thursday. You will recall, Mr. Speaker, that I had
tabled a parliamentary question asking how many questions tabled before
the summer recess remained unanswered when we returned on 9 October. At
that time, I had not received a response, but I have now done so. The
answer was that 86 questions fell into that category. Given that you,
Mr. Speaker, had intervened and raised your concerns with
the Home Secretary, I have two further anxieties. First, 86 questions
took at least two months to answer. Secondly, a question that would
reveal the Home Office&#146;s failure to comply with the Home
Secretary&#146;s commitment has taken the best part of month. The
House was thus unaware of that failure until now, so I would be
grateful for your continued involvement in this matter, Mr.
Speaker, and your advice on how best to take it
forward.</p><p><a name="st_o172"><a name="06110743000259"><b><a name="61107-0006.htm_spnew21"><a name="06110743000567">Mr.
Speaker:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising that point
of order. My first bit of good advice is that he should be the first
Member in the new Session to visit the Table Office to put down a
question or several questions if he wishes. I must also be fair to the
Department and the Home Secretary. It has come to my attention that
some hon. Members have tabled as many as, or even in excess of, 100
questions to be answered. That is unfair to any Department, because it
puts a terrible pressure on officials who are already working hard to
clear a backlog. I understand that that is not the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s problem, but I appeal to hon. Members who are
tabling large and substantial amounts of questions to Departments to
bear in mind the fact that dedicated staff have to sift through all
those questions, which have to be answered and which add further to the
backlog. I will continue to keep an eye on the
matter.</p><a name="06110743000003"><br>

because of the transfer. Clause 6 tackles those unwanted consequences.
It allows the Treasury to make tax provision by regulations in relation

amendment makes explicit what was implicit in the draft of the Bill
that left this House. The ability to remove sanctions for doing or not
doing something in the course of an activity does not permit the
removal of sanctions from unlawful and criminal activities such as drug
dealing or people trafficking. In other words, the amendment makes it
clear that only lawful activities would be affected by orders carried
through for better regulation purposes. It is therefore a safeguard
against inappropriate use of the order-making power. It would ensure
that any change to sanctions for unlawful activity could not be
delivered by an order under the Bill, but must be made through an
alternative route.</p><p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="61107-0007.htm_para3"><a name="06110743000273">It

activity. This is not new; it was possible under the Regulatory Reform
Act 2001 as well. It has been shown to be a useful power in delivering
better regulation and the provision will ensure that offences can be
repealed and that sanctions can be reduced or removed when they are
considered no longer to be targeted or appropriate. The Bill also
carries over the ability under the present Act by order to replace
sanctions with new sanctions, or to create a new offence that is
punishable on indictment up to a limit of two years
imprisonment.</p><p><a name="st_o178"><a name="06110743000274"><b><a name="61107-0007.htm_spnew1"><a name="06110743000573">Mr.

it should be no part of a deregulation Bill to allow by order the
removal of criminal sanction. That should be a matter for primary
legislation. We said that in Committee, but the Minister did not accept
it. We said it again on Report, but the Minister still did not accept
it. Now, however, it appears that wiser heads have prevailed. Someone
has taken a grip on the Bill while it has been in the other place. It
is a significant improvement that it now states what we knew it should
have stated in the first place. I welcome the Lords amendment and I

over-regulation. That sledgehammer has now had some of its power
removed by the Lords amendment. The problem is that, throughout the
process, Ministers have refused to give us examples of how the very
real powers under clause 1 would be used. They still seem to have no
idea what they wish to deregulate. If they had spent the time that we
have spent trying to water down the Bill&#146;s less desirable facets
by putting through a proper deregulation Bill, we could have spent all
that debating time repealing a whole lot of unnecessary regulation.

the spirit of amity on this particular proposal, however, I am happy
that we shall not be able to use this mechanism for repealing criminal
law. It is still proper that criminal law should be repealed by proper
and open debate and the normal legislative scrutiny of the House. I
hope that the Minister will be able to explain which of the sanctions
he would like to remove under the power that remains, as that is surely

concern the power to confer legislative functions by orders.
Specifically, they restrict the categories of persons to whom
legislative functions can be conferred. They respond to concerns that
functions of legislating should be conferred only on appropriate bodies
or persons. Amendments Nos. 2, 4, 5 and 6 clarify the purposes for
which functions can be conferred and make drafting changes to relevant
parts of clauses 1 and 2 to do so. Amendments Nos. 3, 16, 17, 26, 27

there was some discussion of this area of the Bill. I hope that the
amendments will clarify the situation. We have also sought to listen
and respond to the conclusions of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee in another place. That Committee stated that including
a power to confer legislative functions by order in the Bill, while not
inappropriate, should be limited. In the light of the
Committee&#146;s concerns and wider discussions on the issue, the
amendments restrict the persons or bodies eligible to be given such
powers to three categories.</p><p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="61107-0007.htm_para11"><a name="06110743000289">The first category of persons
who are most likely to be given powers to legislate as part of future
orders is Ministers. The second category is persons or bodies who have
had functions conferred on them or transferred to them by an enactment.
That will ensure that powers to legislate can only be conferred on
persons or bodies already recognised by Parliament as suitable. The
third category is the body or holder of an office created by the order
itself. That power will be useful, for example, in the case of a
merger, where a successful transfer of functions might necessitate the
creation of a new body, when that is for the purposes set out in either
clause 1 or clause 2. The Government consider that ability essential if
the Bill is to provide a workable and effective vehicle for delivering
reforms, such as the types of merger proposed by Philip
Hampton.</p><p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="61107-0007.htm_para12"><a name="06110743000290">I hope that
the amendment will deal with someof the off-stage characters
who have occasionally appeared in our deliberations. There were
accusations that it was possible that President Bush, former Prime
Minister Berlusconi or various other characters might end up
legislating through the Bill. As discussed previously, while I do not
believe that that was ever the case, the amendments now make it pretty
clear whom we are talking about in relation to delegation.</p><p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="61107-0007.htm_para13"><a name="06110743000291">The Government have also sought
to respond to concerns surrounding the ability of bodies or holders of
offices, who have been given legislative powers by an order, further to
delegate those powers to others. I remember an exchange on that issue
in earlier Commons stages. Reference was made to

deal of debate in the House, but it would appear that the Government

write to us some time later to ask how a measure could become law with
no fuss, no argument and no debate, we have to reply that it was easy,
because it had been decided that the matter was a statutory instrument,
under a general framework from a piece of primary
legislation&#151;such as the European Communities Act 1972, to name
but one such piece. Wide-ranging provisions can go through as an SI
under an Act with no proper scrutiny or debate, and certainly without

decent time and a procedure that can explore the possibilities and the

problem that the traditional balance between primary legislation and
statutory instruments is being eroded, and that more and more weight is
being put on the statutory instrument. Often, nowadays, there are
truncated guillotine debates&#151;albeit rather longer debates, with
the opportunity to amend and probe&#151;on primary legislation, in

effect constitutional change. We made it plain in amendments that we
tabled in Committee and on Report, and in speeches on Second and Third

difficulty with saying that the Minister&#146;s decision will be open

by which the Minister reaches his decision; what is open to such review
is whether that decision is a reasoned opinion of a reasonable man or
woman. That is not what we are saying. What we are saying is: is it the
right decision? That is an objective test, and one that the court can

effective mechanism in meeting any concerns about the Bill&#146;s

examine whether a Minister acted reasonably in reaching his judgment;

doctrine that not only did any item of constitutional significance go
through a full legislative process, but all stages took place on the
Floor of the House. I do not think that what constituted such an item
was ever codified or written down. It was rather like an elephant: it
was difficult to define, but we would recognise one when we saw it.
People in those days handled constitutional significance in that way.
As a compromise, would it not be possible for the Minister to accept
that perhaps the Speaker, on the advice of the House authorities,
should decide whether an item is of constitutional significance? Then
it would be treated
appropriately.</p><p><a name="st_o226"><a name="06110748000034"><b><a name="61107-0009.htm_spnew8"><a name="06110748000712">Mr.

important: these things are not codified and they are matters of
judgment. We believe that the Bill and the safeguards in it provide the
best way of proceeding by making it a matter of whether the Minister
considers, in the first instance, that the issues are of constitutional
significance. There is no agreement about what would be in any written
constitution should we wish to try to change the system that we have
had for some time. For example, what the Constitution Committee in
another place would want to be part of any constitution is unlikely to
be the same as what this House, or even perhaps the judges, would want.
A decision on whether provisions are of constitutional significance is
therefore inherently a matter of judgment. Our belief is that that
judgment should be exercised by Ministers, subject to parliamentary
views.</p><p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="61107-0009.htm_para10"><a name="06110748000035">In the context
of the Bill, the Minister is required to set out his reasons in the
explanatory document that must be laid alongside any order. It is then
for Parliament to scrutinise rigorously both the content of the order
and the Minister&#146;s decisions, along with the reasons that he has
given for them. On the basis of its own judgment after considering that
evidence, Parliament must decide whether it agrees or disagrees with
the Minister&#146;s opinion. If the relevant parliamentary Committees
in either House of Parliament do not agree with the Minister that the
order meets the preconditions in clause 4, including the constitutional
precondition, they have a statutory power of veto. The Government have
also given an undertaking that they will not force through orders in
the face of opposition from Parliament. That process is in keeping with
the tradition of the primacy of Parliament. We believe that the Bill
should not be used to alter that balance of
power.</p><p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="61107-0009.htm_para11"><a name="06110748000036">In summary, as

of even a subjective test, although it seems rather odd that if a
Minister objected to judicial interference, such interference would not
be ruled out on the basis of the subjective test in the Bill. The
difference would be the kind of test that the courts would apply. There
would be a difference between saying what a Minister
considered&#151;or perhaps, in certain circumstances, what a Minister
reasonably considered&#151;and deciding what actually is the law and
a matter of constitutional significance. The question is not whether
judges have a place in the system, but the test that they use when
exercising their
powers.</p><p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="61107-0009.htm_para14"><a name="06110748000040">A further
question has been raised about whether this would make any difference
in practice. My view differs slightly from that of my hon. Friend the
Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) because I think
that it will. If Ministers were to face judicial review on the basis of
what is really, in law, a matter of constitutional significance, they
would be more risk adverse. They would not want to waste
everyone&#146;s time by bringing forward a regulatory order that
would not get through the courts. As a matter of constitutional
propriety, that is right, because there should be a bias in favour of
full parliamentary procedure when dealing with matters affecting the
political process. This is not a question of Parliament versus the
courts&#151;the opposite is the case. If a court found that a
regulation concerned a matter of constitutional significance, the
matter would have to be brought back to the House and dealt with by way
of a full Bill. The main point of contention throughout our debates on
this Bill has been what can be pushed through by statutory instrument
and what should be dealt with through primary
legislation.</p><p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="61107-0009.htm_para15"><a name="06110748000041">As part
of the constitutional conversation that goes on among the Government,
the courts and Parliament, it is appropriate that the courts should
have the right to determine the extent of scrutiny that we should give
such matters. The question for a court is not what the
Government&#146;s policy should be, or what constitutional changes
should be made, but the procedure that should be used to decide the
matter. Amendment (a) would ensure that if a court decided that a
matter was one of constitutional significance, it would have to be
dealt with by way of a full Bill&#151;the full parliamentary
procedure.</p><p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="61107-0009.htm_para16"><a name="06110748000042">The idea
that Ministers should have a privileged right to decide what is a
matter of constitutional significance is a constitutional monstrosity.
It might well be that Ministers are well placed to make judgments on
policy&#151;the Minister referred to matters of policy&#151;such as
whether an end could be better attained without legislation, as is set
out in the Bill.

protection from such orders. I saw the Minister shaking his head when I
mentioned the Scottish Parliament. However, during the progress of the
Sewel consent motion in the Scottish Parliament earlier this year, the
Scottish Minister in charge of securing its passage went as far as to
say that the Executive are of the view that no part of the 1998 Act
could be said not to be of constitutional significance, and that
amending it by an order would be a practical impossibility. Yet it is
not a practical impossibility but impending reality. Clearly, his
understanding was that the 1998 Act would be exempt. Before saying
something as bold and as stark to the Scottish Parliament, he must have
been given some sort of assurance from this House. Will the Minister
clarify that?</p><p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="61107-0010.htm_para0"><a name="06110748000059">A coach

will further undermine any future assurances given to this House about
legislating on behalf of the Scottish Parliament. After seeing the
debate in the Scottish Parliament and looking at the minutes of the
Committee that dealt with the matter, I fully expected an amendment
that would exempt the 1998 Act, along with the Human Rights Act 1998,
as being beyond the scope of the Bill. Yet the Lords amendment, while
it exempts many measures that are considered to be of constitutional
significance, could still alter matters that are &#147;minor or
consequential&#148;.</p><p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="61107-0010.htm_para1"><a name="06110748000060">One person&#146;s

whether matters are constitutionally significant or minor and
inconsequential. I concede that some matters in the 1998 Act that need
amendment are of no constitutional importance, but why can they not be
considered by the Scottish Parliament? Why should it be left to this
House to consider such measures?</p><p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="61107-0010.htm_para2"><a name="06110748000061">I am personally disappointed

possession of the Scottish Parliament, and a conduit between it and
this House. It was said in another place that the 1998 Act is a
responsibility of this House constitutionally. However, in the real
world of Scottish politics we are all moving on. In the Scottish
Parliament, this debate is changing dramatically, as is the whole
culture. It is increasingly likely that next year my hon. Friend the

theFirst Minister of a Scottish National party-led
Administration, and we will look carefully at the whole Sewel

legislated for it and believe in it, so we will not imperil it through
this legislation.</p><br>

<b>7 Nov 2006 : Column 760</b><br><p><a name="st_o249"><a name="06110748000596"><b><a name="61107-0011.htm_spnew0"><a name="06110748001247">Mr.
McFadden:</b> We mentioned the matters covered by the
amendments earlier, so I shall be brief. Clause 6 restricts the powers
in clauses 1 and 2. It prevents an order from imposing or increasing
taxation. Concerns were raised on Report in the Commons and in
Committee in the other place that, unamended, the Bill would leave it
open for a Minister, by order, to reduce or remove taxation. As with
several other matters that we have discussed, it was not the intention
that orders should be used to reduce or remove taxation. Other
parliamentary mechanisms have always been in place for dealing with
taxation, but amendment No. 18 makes it clear that an order under part
1 cannot be used to impose, abolish or vary any
tax.</p><p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="61107-0011.htm_para0"><a name="06110748000597">The second
amendment concerns potential tax liabilities that could arise from the
merger of regulators. When transferring regulatory functions from one
regulator to another, it may be necessary also to make provision in an
order to transfer assets and liabilities from the old to the new
regulator. In certain circumstances, without further provision, a
transfer could result in inappropriate tax consequences for the
transferor or transferee body which would arise solely because of the
transfer.</p><p><a name="st_o250"><a name="06110748000598"><b><a name="61107-0011.htm_spnew1"><a name="06110748001248">Mr.
Redwood:</b> If the amendment were carried, would it still be
possible under this accelerated procedure to abolish a regulator or a
regulatory requirement that might include a fee or licence
charge?</p><p><a name="st_o251"><a name="06110748000599"><b><a name="61107-0011.htm_spnew2"><a name="06110748001249">Mr.
McFadden:</b> I will come back to the right hon. Gentleman on
that matter.</p><p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="61107-0011.htm_para1"><a name="06110748000600">The
amendment addresses the unwanted consequences that might arise from the
transfers that I have just described. It will allow the Treasury to
make tax provision by regulations in relation to a transfer of
property, rights and liabilities under an order under part 1. This
power will enable the Treasury to make appropriate tax provision at the
appropriate time to ensure that a transfer does not give rise to a tax
charge, or confer a tax advantage, on either party. It is unlikely that
the powers will be used often; they will be used only in the unusual
instance that a merger is being pursued by order which involves the
transfer of such property, right and liabilities. I hope that the House
will agree to the Lords amendment.</p><p><a name="st_o252"><a name="06110748000601"><b><a name="61107-0011.htm_spnew3"><a name="06110748001250">Mr.
Heath:</b> I welcome Lords amendment No. 18. It makes
precisely the point that we made in Committee. I apologise to the House
for the repetitive nature of these exchanges, but we have to keep
saying to the Government, &#147;We told you so.&#148; We did make a
point about this matter in Committee. It was also made very forcefully
on Report by the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe
(Mr. Clarke), when he said that taxes could go down as well
as up&#151;although that does not happen often&#151;and that this
provision was therefore necessary.</p><p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="61107-0011.htm_para2"><a name="06110748000602">However, the Minister has
coupled the provision with Lords amendment No. 19, which deals with tax
variation in respect of any changes in function. Presumably that
relates to clause 2, which provides for amending the constitution of
regulatory bodies. The Minister simply cannot get away with saying that
this is a consequence of Lords amendment No. 18, or that the provision
should not have been there in the first place

<notus-date day="7" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>7 Nov 2006 : Column 761</b><br>in order to deal with the tax variation that should
have been present in respect of changes of function for bodies and for
transfers of liabilities. There was clearly an omission. That is why we
had to have the Ways and Means resolution earlier. This is indicative
of the way in which the Bill has been brought in. There have been gross
errors and omissions by the Government all the way through. Happily,
most of them&#151;I hope all of them, but I have no confidence in
that&#151;have been corrected during the passage of the Bill. That is
why it is so important that we do our work of scrutinising Bills in
this Chamber effectively, as I believe we have done in this
case.</p><p><a name="st_o253"><a name="06110748000603"><b><a name="61107-0011.htm_spnew4"><a name="06110748001251">Mr.
Redwood:</b> As someone who would dearly love to see some
taxes abolished, I accept the normal form for doing that.
Unfortunately, we have an annual Finance Bill, and it is an
increasingly large Bill under this Government. It gives them ample
legislative opportunity to make changes to taxes. I would like to press
the Minister a little further on surrogate taxation or quasi-taxation.
In the regulatory world, many regulators now have the power to impose
all sorts of regulatory costs on businesses, individuals, institutions
and families, and even to impose direct fees or charges. I would like
the reassurance that we shall be able to deregulate, in the sense of
getting rid of part or all of a particular regulator and their task,
rather than just removing the indirect regulatory costs. Shall we be
able to remove the direct fees and charges involved? They should not be
deemed to be a tax, under these amendments.</p><p><a name="st_o254"><a name="06110748000604"><b><a name="61107-0011.htm_spnew5"><a name="06110748001252">Mr.
McFadden:</b> By leave of the House, Mr. Deputy
Speaker, I should like to clarify this issue for the right hon.

order reducing fees, including fees charged by a regulator, for
example.</p><p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="61107-0011.htm_para3"><a name="06110748000605"><i> Lords

concluded that it was unlikely that many, if any, of the individual
cases would pass the standard tests for prerogative pardons. The
quality of the surviving evidence was an important factor in reaching
that conclusion. However, my noble Friend the Minister for Defence
Procurement was able to announce on Second Reading in the Lords, on 14
June this year, that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State had
decided to re-examine the issue of pardons for first world war

the 2,700 who were not executed are not being pardoned, whereas the 300

remove the stigma. Surely the stigma results from conviction rather
than execution. If I were a member of one of the families concerned who

were convicted of military offences for which the death penalty could
have been awarded. That does not include civilian capital offences such
as murder. Of those 20,000, something over 3,000 were actually
sentenced to death. Approximately 90 per cent. of them escaped

recognise the importance of discipline. We do not have the death
penalty for military operations today, and that is right and proper and
reflects the mores of our times. With this amendment, we are dealing
with a different society with different mores. That is why we joined
the Government in resisting attempts in the other place to water down
the penalty for

approach the nation&#146;s annual service of remembrance we should,
and shall, reflect on the courage and sacrifice of those who have
fought and died for these islands, for our wider interests and for the
values that we hold dear, and those who continue today to lay their
lives on the line for our country. Among those whom we remember will be
the victims of harsh judgments made in good faith by good men of their
day, often in the heat and smoke of battle. If the amendment brings
consolation to the families of those victims, it is a welcome benefit.
However, in the interests of justice and for the proper understanding
of history, let this be a one-off&#151;a

in this week before 11 November we debate the amendment granting a

year, on 11 November, we stand as a nation in silence, mourning and
remembrance for all those who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving
our country during that bloody, awful war and the conflicts that
followed. The people of these islands are a free people today thanks to

to me to examine the matter further, not least because of the case

by Members of both Houses. I looked at four possible options and I

taken a step that others may have been reluctant to take. I also join
the appreciation on both sides of the House for my hon. Friend the

duty required of them. They held the King&#146;s commission to
prosecute a war. They had to maintain discipline and administer
military justice as the law of that time prescribed. In my view, they
acted properly and honourably in the discharge of that duty.</p><p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="61107-0013.htm_para9"><a name="06110759000054">Some will say that the

today&#146;s standards. That is a perfectly reasonable argument,
although I do not accept it because I do not believe that the amendment
condones cowardice, desertion, mutiny or assisting the enemy, as the
hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace) suggested a
moment ago. Military discipline was and remains the cornerstone of our
armed forces&#146; behaviour. However, the amendment is necessary as
a recognition of the fact that many&#151;I accept not all&#151;of
those shot were suffering from mental illnesses, of which people at the
time knew very little.</p><p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="61107-0013.htm_para10"><a name="06110759000055">I have had meetings with the
families of some of the men who were shot and I was touched by their
quiet determination to see those men pardoned. They were motivated by
nothing more than a wish to see their loved ones remembered, without
shame, alongside the tens of thousands of others who went to war in
September 1914 full of high spirits and pride, but who never came back.
I pay tribute to the families&#146; quiet dignity, as many have lived
with the terrible stigma associated with having a father, grandfather
or great-grandfather going bravely off to war only to be shot by his
own side.</p><p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="61107-0013.htm_para11"><a name="06110759000056">The
amendment will not ease the pain and heartache that the verdict of the
field courts martial caused, but I hope that, in time, it will be seen
as having put right a terrible wrong. It is all too easy to forget that
the soldiers of the first world war had none of the modern
world&#146;s benefits of free education and health care. Most of the
accused were poorly educated, working-class young men: often, they were
inarticulate and illiterate, with no ability to represent themselves in
a tense court room where life or death was at stake. If all the young
men who stood trial were medically examined according to the standards
of care enjoyed by our soldiers today, I am sure that the result would
not have been that 306 of them were
shot.</p><p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="61107-0013.htm_para12"><a name="06110759000057">No one can turn
back the clock. The passage of time means that we are left with only
the records of the cases, most of which make no reference to the mental
or nervous illnesses from which the soldiers were suffering. This week,
we will remember our war dead. I hope that, as a country, we can at
long last find it in our hearts to pardon and pay our respects to all
the young men who lost their lives on the foreign battle fields of the
first world war. Whether they were shot by the enemy or by their own
side, all were victims of a terrible and bloody
war.</p><p><a name="st_o302"><a name="06110759000058"><b><a name="61107-0013.htm_spnew9"><a name="06110759000269">Nick

really would be an attempt to rewrite history. The same is true of
lifting the sentence: although I abhor the capital sentences that were
handed down, they were the sentences that applied to such offences at
the time. We cannot go back over history and lift the sentences or
query the convictions. We cannot remove the pain that followed for

has been shown in the support that has been evident in all parties and
in consecutive Parliaments. It has also been evident in support for the

I believe that it is, but it will not be for ever. I regret that a
Conservative Member shouted out earlier, &#147;What about
Agincourt?&#148; As he did so, I will respond to that point.
Agincourt demonstrably is history. The first world war is still a live
and relevant issue for us, because each and every one of us have known
and loved veterans of world war one. Some are still alive today. The
immediate dependants of the executed men are still alive today. The
issue cannot be dismissed in the way that people might dismiss the
American civil war or Agincourt. Referring to Agincourt was a poor

it.</p><p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="61107-0013.htm_para25"><a name="06110759000072">The issue is still

say, &#147;You are surely not suggesting that all these were good

the trials were flawed, according not to the rules of today but to the
rules that applied then. The rules of natural justice have not just
been invented. The rules of natural justice required then, as now, that
a person should be able to prepare a defence, call witnesses and be
properly represented. Every trial was flawed on those counts.
Furthermore, no one was given the opportunity of appealing against

the principle of justice. Justice has to be consistent and clearly

issue a statement of regret. Finally, in January, I introduced a short
debate in Westminster Hall on the subject, to which the right hon.
Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig)
replied.</p><p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="61107-0014.htm_para9"><a name="06110759000104">Almost every
Member in the Chamber is wearing a poppy, and the debate about the
executed soldiers has much to do with our national consciousness of the
first world war&#151;our guilt and our emotions. That war produced
one of the highest numbers of casualties suffered by the British Army
and the imperial armies. Our European neighbours had of course been
only too conscious of such casualties; we had been fortunate enough
never to have suffered to such a degree before.</p><p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="61107-0014.htm_para10"><a name="06110759000105">From a British perspective, the
first world war has somehow been seen as not such a good war as the
second world war, which was demonstrably between good and evil. The
public&#146;s interpretation of the first world war does not stem
only from folk memories of their fathers and grandfathers. In many
ways, the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) is correct; it is
history, but near history rather than far. Both my grandfathers served
in the first world war. Both were wounded, but they
survived.</p><p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="61107-0014.htm_para11"><a name="06110759000106">Certainly,
30 years ago, it was possible to speak to many such veterans. As much
as anything else, it all comes down to the fact that the first world
war is seen through the prism of the film &#147;Oh! What a Lovely
War&#148;, and of &#147;Blackadder Goes Forth&#148;, which
features the caricature figures of General Melchett, Baldrick and
others. In its last, most evocative scene, the whole cast, except
General Melchett, go out into no man&#146;s land, and the scene is
then freeze-framed. There is a powerful emotional element to the
subject.</p><p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="61107-0014.htm_para12"><a name="06110759000107">It always
struck me, when I talked to the highly professional members of the Army
historical branch&#151;I give them great credit for the work that
they have done over many years&#151;that the problem is that the
record is incomplete, as Ministers know. As the hon. Member for
Thurrock says, access to the files was limited for most people, so it
is inevitable that there were conspiracy theories about that. The
record is incomplete not because it has been weeded, but because of the
nature of the war and the nature of some of the field courts martial.
Some of the files on individual cases are quite thick, running to 20,
30 or40 sheets of paper. On Private Farr, there are some half
a dozen sheets.</p><p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="61107-0014.htm_para13"><a name="06110759000108">I
have concluded that it would be incredibly difficult to ensure a
judicial review, in which judges consider each case in turn, although I
know that the hon. Member for Thurrock and others were keen on that
idea. Such a system would, ultimately, be unfair. I suspect that the
judges would clear some people, but that in other cases they would say,

However, there would have been a great tranche of cases in the middle,
on which they would have said, &#147;I&#146;m sorry, but
there&#146;s insufficient evidence; if we could call witnesses, we

interest: I have always believed, and still do, that the situation
should be left as it is. I can understand why we politicians might want
to take a view on past events; after all, the Prime Minister, very soon
after taking office, issued a statement of regret about the Irish
potato famine. To me, as a historian, that seemed a somewhat simplistic
interpretation of what happened, but the Prime Minister had every right
to do what he did, although I would have thought it best to leave the
matter alone. I have sympathy for the families, and particularly for
people who remember what went on, but although we have spent so much
time and emotion on the subject&#151;the hon. Member for Thurrock
might say, &#147;And so we should&#148;&#151;we tend to forget,
marginalise or take for granted the actions of hundreds of thousands of
men. Most of those who fought in the first world war were civilians,
and not all of them were young&#151;many were in their 30s and 40s;
after all, incredibly, the overwhelming majority of soldiers who served
in the first world war were volunteers. However, I shall not go down a
discursive route and discuss the history of the amazing
&#147;pals&#148; battalions, made up of volunteers.</p><p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="61107-0014.htm_para15"><a name="06110759000110">A significant proportion of
soldiers were pre-war regulars, but after 1917 large numbers were, of
course, conscripts, so not all soldiers were fresh-faced youths. We
should remember that most of them, at different periods in their
service, were terrified. When I have talked to veterans of the first
and second world wars and of Iraq, and to soldiers in Afghanistan, I
have found that they were motivated by many things. Because they are
British, they are embarrassed to say that they are fighting for Queen
and country, but they will frequently talk about their regiment.
Usually, however&#151;and there are hon. Members present who have
experience of this&#151;they were motivated by small-group loyalty,
which basically comes down to a soldier&#146;s sense of being part of
a team. Soldiers rarely work as individuals; they are a team, and that
is how they survive. They survive because they are part of a team in a
mortar section, running a heavy machine gun, or in an armoured fighting
vehicle. In normal, civilian life, those team members might not get on
well together, but as soldiers they work, live and die together, and if
one of them decides to leg it, not only do they let the others down,
but somebody else has to take over their
duties.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_17"><a name="61107-0014.htm_ordayhd1"><a name="06110759000248">7.45

war, and won the distinguished conduct medal, then went back to being a
doctor. He volunteered in 1915, when he was in his 40s, and served for
nearly two years with the 2nd Battalion the Royal Welch Fusiliers. He
won the distinguished service order and the military cross and bar. His
DSO was the result of a failed Victoria cross application, and he had
had both Siegfried Sassoon and Robert Graves as patients. His diaries
document his eventual breakdown; he later found that he could no longer
trust himself not to duck when a shell came overhead. His main worry
and concern was about showing fear in front of others. He recognised
that the way to deal with what they call shell shock was to try to rest
soldiers as much as possible. He had a hard-nosed view of desertion. He
was one of only two regimental medical officers to give evidence to
what was called the shell shock committee. The written evidence that he
produced, which is in the Royal Welch Fusiliers museum, is the only
evidence submitted to that committee that is still extant, as the
evidence was weeded at some stage.</p><p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="61107-0014.htm_para18"><a name="06110759000113">I was fascinated by the fact
that that man, who was in many ways very sensitive, and who was greatly

had let down their friends, and that was the most important
element.</p><p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="61107-0014.htm_para19"><a name="06110759000114">The only

line to dig a communication trench to the German front positions. They
worked in full moonlight for three and a half hours under heavy machine
gun fire from the enemy. Fortunately, no one was injured and those
soldiers were awarded the military medal for their gallantry and
service. Their commanding officer, Second Lieutenant Cecil Harold
Wight, was awarded the military cross for supervising the work, and
received a pension of five shillings a

one in the 18th Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment was shot at dawn,
so my grandfather did not face the prospect of being called to serve on
a firing squad to dispatch summary justice. Of the 306 soldiers shot at
dawn in the first world war who are the subject of the Lords amendment,
254 were privates, 15 were riflemen, five were drivers, one was a
gunner, one was a drummer, one a labourer, two were sappers, one was a
trooper, 4 were sergeants, three were lance sergeants, six were
corporals, 11 were lance corporals, one was a second lieutenant and one
a first lieutenant. All but two of the 306 soldiers shot at dawn were
&#147;other ranks&#148; and non-commissioned officers. The most
senior officer shot at dawn was Lieutenant Edwin Leopold Arthur Dyett,
who was a volunteer reserve with the Nelson Battalion of the Royal Navy
Division. He was the son of May Constance andW. H. R. Dyett of
Rock Ferry; his father, too, was a Royal Navy

Dyett was executed on 5 January 1917 at the age of 21, and he was
buried in the Le Crotoy communal cemetery. In many cases, as has been
said, the soldiers who were shot at dawn were suffering from shell
shock. I was interested to hear about the shell shock committee in the
speech by the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson). In
a war diary by a member of the 18th Battalion of the Middlesex
Regiment, the first mention of the condition appears in June 1916, when
it is recorded that men were suffering from shell shock&#151;the
diary does not elaborate further. Officers who suffered from shell
shock were deemed to be not fit for duty, and were returned home, but
that was not the case for other ranks. That is an important
point.</p><p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="61107-0014.htm_para23"><a name="06110759000119">We are not
close to understanding the full effects of shell shock, but soldiers
who suffered from it were subjected to summary justice. They were not
properly represented and they were not given leave to appeal. The
morning after their court martial, they were bound, blindfolded and had
a marker placed overtheir heart. They were tied to a stake and
shot by12 members of a firing squad, usually from their own
battalion. One soldier was given a blank to fire, so that no one could
be sure that they had fired the fatal
shot.</p>

Work&#148; by Ernest Thurtle, who was MP for Shoreditch. The book was
published in the 1920s, and the cases it highlights still make for
difficult reading. Responding to an intervention, my hon. Friend
pointed out that the Australian army did not impose the death penalty
for battlefield offences. Anyone who has read Field Marshal
Haig&#146;s diaries will know that he viewed that as a serious
weakness that made it difficult to maintain discipline in the
Australian army. However, the lack of a death penalty did not stop the
Australians from playing a full part in the eventual allied victory in
the first world war.</p><p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="61107-0015.htm_para2"><a name="06110759000122">I
wish to turn to the case of Lance Corporal 13857 James Holland of the
10th Battalion of the Cheshire Regiment, which was part of the 7th
Brigade of the 25th Division of the 3rd British Army. Lance Corporal
Holland was shot at dawn. On the night of 19 and20 May 1916,
the Germans launched a heavy bombardment against the British positions
at Berthonval facing Vimy ridge. At 5 am on 21 May, the bombardment
intensified. At 3 pm, following a pause, the British front line was
once again pummelled by intense enemy shelling, mortar shelling and
tear gas. The 10th Battalion of the Cheshire Regiment was stationed at
the front line at Berthonval. In a four-hour period, 80 German
artillery batteries positioned along a 1,800 m front launched 70,000
shells at the British positions around Berthonval in front of Vimy
ridge. That was the heaviest enemy shelling of the war sofar.
The British trenches were levelled and all communications were severed.
The British artillery replied, but to no
effect.</p><p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="61107-0015.htm_para3"><a name="06110759000123">At 7.45 pm,
the Germans blew a mine under the British position, lifted their
artillery barrage and directed it at the British support lines. At the
same time, the German infantry launched a ground attack across the
smashed British defences, and crossed our front line, where they met
little resistance. The German infantry secured their objectives. The
10th Battalion of the Cheshire Regiment was tasked with holding the
flank of the British position during the German onslaught. On 23 May
1916, the British counter-offensive to re-establish a defence line
failed. The Germans anticipated the counter-attack and launched their
own artillery barrage of heavy shells against the British lines. The
British infantry ground assault scheduled for 8.25 pm was met
immediately with German machine gun fire and repulsed before it
began.</p><p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="61107-0015.htm_para4"><a name="06110759000124">On 26 May, the

forward for the pardons is, in my view, misguided. Much of that case is
also full of inaccuracies. For example, the fact is that we did
recognise shell shock at that time, but what we did not do was treat it
correctly. We often took officers out of the field and sent them far
back to Blighty, where they received what we now know to have been the
wrong treatment. But although we got our medical treatment wrong at the
time, should we judge the people of the day because their knowledge of
medicine was not as good as ours is now?</p><p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="61107-0015.htm_para11"><a name="06110759000132">That case is also full of
inaccuracies because the names of many of the people for whom pardons
are sought have changed&#151;they have fluctuated. It is interesting
that the Government cannot produce a definitive list of those who were
executed in the war who deserve a pardon. As we know, there is a lack
of records. Members of various parties have made it clear that in the
cold light of day, perhaps by judicial committee, they could not make
decisions on whether a pardon would have been an appropriate way of
dealing with some of the problems.</p><p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="61107-0015.htm_para12"><a name="06110759000133">I am mystified that people
convicted of &#147;mutiny and sedition&#148; under section 7 of the
Army Act 1881 will be pardoned. Mutiny is not cowardice. Mutiny is not
desertion. Mutiny is undermining the very core of military discipline,
sometimes for subversive reasons. As many of the French corps and
British units in the first world war knew, it can cause catastrophic
problems for fighting on the front, and, in the end, it can lead to a
breakdown of the whole war effort. I am amazed that a pardon for that
has been added.</p><p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="61107-0015.htm_para13"><a name="06110759000134">It is

security guard falls asleep, someone comes in and nicks all the stock.
But if someone falls asleep on sentry, they might well condemn their
men to death&#151;not only their men in their platoon, but also,
perhaps, their men in their company. There are plenty of historical war
stories of such events occurring in every conflict; they have occurred
in Northern Ireland, and they have happened since time immemorial. This
is not the kind of issue that we can just move aside because that suits
us. Some of these offences have real consequences for other people who

People did not appear from nowhere dressed in nice pressed shirts to
judge these men; they were often tried by their peers. We might not
like the trial process that they faced, but sometimes they faced those
trials because of the conditions that people were in&#151;because
they did not have the luxury of being able to leave the front line, as
they had to get on with doing their job, which was playing their part

part of the 19th Durham Light Infantry, were guarding their positions
on the western front. They were retreated when a senior officer
informed them that an ambush was taking place that was advancing from
the German lines. That proved to be unfounded, and Corporal Goggins was

have campaigned together in other areas and he has been a marvellous
ally in one particular campaign involving constituents who have faced
injustice. I greatly admire his tenacity and determination. Obviously
we should salute that this evening, because he has worked tirelessly on

Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson), who is my
parliamentary neighbour, made a learned and erudite speech. He knows a
huge amount about this subject. He made one point that certainly had
resonance, because I remember my grandfather making the same point
clear to me when we discussed the issue, which we did many times. My
grandfather lived until about 1970. He was badly wounded in 1916. He
was then badly gassed the following year and never really recovered. I
was quite young&#151;about 12 or so&#151;when he died, but I
remember speaking to him at length about this issue. He said that he
and his friends fought first for their chums, secondly for their
regiment, and thirdly for Queen or King. That was the point that my
hon. Friend made: there was a feeling among the millions of people who
fought in the first world war that those who let the side down put not
just their own lives, but the lives of many others, at risk.

Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)&#151; he was then the right hon. and
learned Member for Edinburgh Pentlands. We looked at the issue in great
detail and decided that it would be wrong to reopen the matter and
rewrite history. Successive Labour Secretaries of State have done
exactly the same. I well remember the right hon. Member for Airdrie and
Shotts (John Reid) making it clear that he felt that this was not the
right way to go. He argued persuasively and with huge intellectual
rigour that pardons should not be granted. I do not know what has

beggars belief that Ministers can devote time to this
matter&#151;important as they may regard it&#151;when they face so
many other priorities and issues. Just look at the huge challenges in

Afghanistan and Iraq that do not have the necessary armour and the

is very unpopular with the armed forces. I am concerned that the trust
and respect of the armed forces for the Ministers of Her
Majesty&#146;s Government will be damaged by this issue. I only hope

who were sentenced to death, but had their sentences commuted? Will
they be affected? Will they receive a pardon? We heard about the Farr
case, which was moving and tragic. However, every single case is
different. If one has a look at the breakdown, as some colleagues have
already, out of the 346 soldiers who were executed, 37 were executed
for murder and will not benefit from the pardon. I mentioned earlier in
an intervention that there were five who were executed for disobedience
to a lawful order. One of them was a private in the Royal Norfolks who
disobeyed four separate orders, on four different occasions. He was
given umpteen warnings. He was sentenced to death by firing squad for
disobedience to those lawful orders before he even got near the front,
so he certainly could not have suffered from any form of shell shock.
As my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr.
Wallace) pointed out, 18 soldiers were sentenced for mutiny and various
other offences.</p><p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="61107-0016.htm_para10"><a name="06110759000176">The
issue is complicated and every single case is different, which is why I
took the view that perhaps we should have set up a tribunal of
Commonwealth judges or learned judges to look at every single case
totally separately on its merits. In my judgment, what we are doing is
illogical. Whatever colleagues say, if we not rewriting history, we are
certainly writing it. What happened in the great war was horrific and
tragic, but we are looking at it from a modern-day perspective. We are
imposing our modern-day values on events that happened nearly 100 years
ago. Of course those men would not have been executed today. In the
second world war, there was not a single British soldier executed by
firing squad. I gather that one American was executed during the battle
of the Bulge. To put that into perspective, 10,000 German soldiers were
hung for either desertion or cowardice in the last war and 25,000
Russians were shot by firing squad&#151;probably double that number
were shot by the commissars who were attached to each single
unit.</p><br>

Those of us who have doubts about this matter should not be taunted by
the other side for not putting it to a vote, because we have asked a
lot of sensible questions. Can the Minister really give us a
categorical assurance that this measure will not set a precedent? Is
this really a one-off? We are all decent, compassionate human beings.
Of course we can regret the past and observe the deeds of our ancestors
with astonishment, incomprehension and even sad regret. Obviously we
can feel only pity towards those luckless soldiers who were executed
nearly a century ago. There is little doubt that many of them showed
incredible bravery and astonishing mental toughness when they were
finally led out to be shot, blindfolded and alone. We have to applaud
their courage in extremis. They were as much victims of that war as the
three quarters of a million of their comrades, in addition to the
millions of other soldiers, who were killed. However, I do not believe
that we should reinvent the past to suit our wishes today. That way
lies madness. That is why I have serious regrets about what the

that we might have a bit more of a debate on this amendment. It takes
account of concerns expressed in the House and the other place about
keeping a commanding officer in the loop. It will mean that the Bill
will provide that service police must notify the commanding officer
when a schedule 2 case, or a case in prescribed circumstances, is
referred directly to the Director of Service Prosecutions. In addition,
the Lords amendment provides that when notifying the CO of the
referral, the service policeman will be required to send him relevant
documents. We have provided that the detail of the documents should be
set out in regulations. They will essentially be the case
papers.</p><p><a name="st_o359"><a name="06110759000216"><b><a name="61107-0016.htm_spnew17"><a name="06110759000326">Mr.

consider this to be one of the most important issues in the Bill.
During the passage of the Bill in this place we tried to persuade the
Government that it was necessary under the new arrangements to ensure
that the commanding officer remained in the loop, in the event that the
proposals as originally set out in the Bill were enacted.</p><p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="61107-0016.htm_para36"><a name="06110759000217">Our concerns were that under
the proposals originally put before the House by the Government, the
commanding officer, having lost the right to dismiss a serious
charge&#151;that is, essentially, one of murder or rape&#151;would
be required on a serious charge simply to inform the service policeman,
who would then conduct an investigation, instead of the investigation
thatthe commanding officer would previously have undertaken,
and that the military policemen undertaking the investigation would
report to the Director of Service Prosecutions as to the nature of the
investigation and whether he believed that there was sufficient
evidence for the Director of Service Prosecutions to
proceed.</p><p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="61107-0016.htm_para37"><a name="06110759000218">Under those

together with the noble Lord Ramsbotham, the noble Earl Attlee and the
Lord Campbell of Alloway, all of whom, on any reading of the debates in
the other place, made a significant contribution not only to the
improvement of the Bill, but to the quality of the debate. By the way
in which they conducted themselves in the other place, they
demonstrated the virtue of having in the other place men and women able
to bring to bear on debates such experience and expertise, which would
not be available if we moved to an elected upper House. It is important
to recognise the contribution made in the other
place.</p><p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="61107-0016.htm_para38"><a name="06110759000219">Much was made

understand it, despite not being, as the hon. Member for North Durham

political aspirations and wanted to come to the House, and I was
successful in that. The chain of command is an important issue because
it goes to the heart of how the Army, in particular, is
organised.</p>

The amendment is better than the original form of the Bill and better

commanding officer ought not to have a veto on a prosecution, but it is
entirely right that he should be involved and kept in the loop, so the
amendment is welcome. I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the

Prosecutions has the discretion to direct no further prosecution, but
at what stage of the proceedings would the Attorney-General&#146;s

informed that there was to be a charge under clause 118 and it had been
referred to the Director of Service Prosecutions, would the
Attorney-General have the opportunity to intervene and to switch

the way in which he, or she, lives his or her life. My experience is

or at least has been in the past, a very special relationship between
the ordinary soldier, seaman or airman in the junior ranks who trusts
his commanding officer implicitly and understands the background that
he or she comes from, and the commanding officer who, vice versa,
understands the backgrounds from which those soldiers, sailors and

other criminal activity in the UK. I can imagine that the DSP might
want to seek the Attorney-General&#146;s advice in such a case and
the decision taken could be that it should be handled in the UK

There was broad consensus among those of us who served on the Armed

of the disciplinary procedures of the three services, it was vital in
the eyes of the accused that those sitting in judgment on him or her in
a court martial should predominantly be members of his or her service.
It would be preferable if they were drawn exclusively from that
service, however, because that would ensure that it was the
defendant&#146;s peers from his or her own service who were sitting
in judgment. Will the Minister give us an assurance that those sitting

be expensive, however, and will cause a time delay. I speak with a

found remarkable the draconian attitudes that we had to take towards
the relatively minor offence of absence, which is almost unknown in the

court martial was subject to the same objections as were found to exist

civilian trial in the UK, because the charge was murder. The court did
not decide whether there had been "compelling reasons" for court

David Anderson (Blaydon) (Lab):</b> It would be impossible to
have any debate on social housing without recognising the fact that we
have spent the past 30 years in a state of upheaval. Social housing has
been in constant flux. At the same time, there has been massive change
in the social attitudes and needs of the people of our country. We have
seen the evolutionof one-parent families, the development of
single occupancy and the breakdown of traditional family frameworks. At
the same time, we have seen the sell-off of social housing and the sad
failure to match demand with adequate supply. We have seen the
development of various forms of public ownership and private ownership,
which has led to serious political differences right across the
board.</p><p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="61107-0019.htm_para10"><a name="06110767000127">I should not
have to ask whether our attention has been diverted from the real task
of providing good-quality affordable homes for people to live in while
we have been discussing the ownership of those homes. It is against
that background that I want to bring some good news to the House. In
Gateshead, the borough in which my constituency lies, the council still
has strategic responsibility for housing. However, in 2004 it set up a
housing company as an arm&#146;s length management
organisation&#151;an ALMO&#151;which has responsibility for housing
offices, neighbourhood relations, rent and income, leasehold services,
refurbishments, of which there are many good examples, repairs,
maintenance and other housing management services.</p><p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="61107-0019.htm_para11"><a name="06110767000128">With a great big agenda that
included spending a quarter of a billion pounds to improve the houses
of the people of Gateshead, why has the council produced the Gateshead
young persons&#146; housing plan? There are three reasons: first, it
is absolutely the right thing to do; secondly, the council was
instructed by the Audit Commission that if it wanted to improve from a
two-star to a three-star ALMO, it would have to do much more work with
that age group; and, thirdly, the plan is in line with a
Government-driven initiative for councils to develop plans for children
and young persons.</p><p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="61107-0019.htm_para12"><a name="06110767000129">The
key to the plan is wide liaison and consultation, starting with the
company itself. It talked first and foremost to the 1,335 young people
aged between 16 and 24 who already held tenancies. It worked with the
young women&#146;s outreach project, with youth information services
and, critically, with the Gateshead youth assembly, positively led by
Valerie Ender who is a credit to her region and to the young people she
looks after. The company worked with the Connexions team on career
progress and with the Gateshead children and young people&#146;s
partnership and the teenage parents partnership. It worked with
Gateshead college, the Hit squad and Skills for People&#151; young
disabled persons&#146; groups&#151;and the learning support group
at Gateshead college, which also supports disabled people. The black
and minority ethnic forum was involved, as were the Gateshead
Bangladeshi and Muslim societies; and most importantly, the company
worked with the Gateshead youth offending team.</p><br>

positive news for young people in Gateshead. Youth crime has fallen for
the past three years. Only 8 per cent. of 16 to 19-year-olds are
unemployed or not in further education or training; that is too many,
but we are working on it. Our GCSE results are among the top 10 in the
country and the improvements since 1997 mean that we are among the

spoken. Local young people face problems, as do young people across the
country. Some face issues of homelessness or rooflessness; some do not
have enough money coming in; some have poor or no credit ratings, or
have no bank account. They may face unemployment and low pay. They have
to abide by the housing benefit rules for under-25s, and they may not
know how to use housing services or get help. Rents are very high in
the private sector, and young people may have no furniture, may never
have lived independently before, and may have absolutely no experience
of being a tenant.</p><p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="61107-0019.htm_para20"><a name="06110767000137">The

realised that the key issue was that they needed more information and
guidance. To provide that information and guidance, the housing company
committed itself to promoting more effectively the housing services
available directly to young people. It agreed to provide appropriate
information as and when it was needed, so that young people could make
informed decisions when considering where to live. It also agreed to
improve access to information and advice about housing services, and as
part of that, it developed a multilingual service, and a service for
people with sight
impairments.</p><p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="61107-0019.htm_para21"><a name="06110767000138">The
housing company has provided a great deal of help and support. It
realises that maintaining a tenancy is not easy, particularly for young
people, who may never have faced that worry before. The accessible
information has now been provided, and people are using it. A key part
of the process is the MyPad website, which is advertised on the card
that I have in my hand. It is a website for, and developed by, young
people; they are responsible for it, and it provides access to
information.</p><p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="61107-0019.htm_para22"><a name="06110767000139">More
than 80 per cent. of young people clearly said that it would help them
if they had access to IT services, so that they could find out more.
The housing company has responded to that positively. There is a clear
need to work with other agencies, including those that I listed
earlier. Such work is being developed, and the housing company is
taking that seriously. It is identifying individuals who will be the
key persons working with its partners, so that there is no blurring of
who does what.</p><p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="61107-0019.htm_para23"><a name="06110767000140">There
is a clear problem with housing, and thereis a lack of both
permanent and temporary accommodation. The sad thing about the
company&#146;s plan is that it does not provide us with one brick,
one key to a door, or one extra house; however, it does give shape to
what must be done. It is accepted that waiting lists are too long, and
that it takes too long to get a property. It is accepted that not
enough council accommodation is available in the areas where young
people want to live. Young people who are offered accommodation often
find that it is outside the areas where they want to live, which means
that they will be away from their family and their support network.
There is a lack of emergency accommodation for young people, too. Some
of the housing stock is not at its best, although we are in the middle
of a massive refurbishment programme. On some estates, the paintwork on
houses is in poor condition. Problem neighbours are a concern for young
people, too, and the repair service is perceived to carry out poor
quality repairs, and to take too long to complete
them.</p><p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="61107-0019.htm_para24"><a name="06110767000141">A key question
put to the young people was, &#147;What do you want?&#148; Their
answers were clear, and they made simple but important points. They
wanted to live in houses on estates and in communities where they felt
safe and secure, and they wanted to live in a clean house in a clean
area. They wanted to live in a house that had been improved, and that
was furnished. They want more options&#151;they do not want to be
pushed into a place and to be given Hobson&#146;s choice, but want a
real choice. They want places to be open at hours that are helpful to
them. They want services to be available

also want a new letting system, because the previous system, which was
based on points, was hard to use and to understand. They need more

too.</p><p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="61107-0019.htm_para25"><a name="06110767000142">I have set out
the background of the problems that the housing company faces. It has
set up a plan to show how, over the next three years, it will fulfil
its commitment and deliver on the agenda that the young people have
set. I now turn to what the company has done. It says that it will
concentrate on young persons&#146; issues first, and it has appointed
a lead officer who will develop young people&#146;s priorities. That
will ensure that the company complies with the key age discrimination
legislation. It will regularly scrutinise young people&#146;s
services to make sure that people are satisfied with them, and it will
listen to their complaints.</p><p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="61107-0019.htm_para26"><a name="06110767000143">Young people are encouraged to
join the company both as employees and as officers who run the company,
thus giving them a democratic say in the shaping of the future for
themselves and for other people living in Gateshead. We need to find
out what problems prevent young people from using the company&#146;s
service and try to solve them. A task force must be given the job of
identifying any barrier that young people face when accessing the
service. We must ensure that company employees have the required
information so that they can provide advice tailored to young
people&#146;s needs, which are different from those of the rest of
the population. Advice and information about housing services in
Gateshead must be accessible. As I said before, a web-based housing
information resource has been developed, based on the needs of the
young people concerned, and it has had an extremely positive effect in
promoting available housing.</p><p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="61107-0019.htm_para27"><a name="06110767000144">Young people have been
encouraged to take part in training so that we can learn about what
they need. Their views are paramount. Support is always available so
that they can become involved, and dedicated training is resourced
directly from the housing company budget. The company is keen to work
with Connexions&#151;the careers organisation for young people in the
north-east&#151;the council, young people&#146;s support
organisations and groups to improve things for young people in the
area. We must make sure that the company&#146;s representatives are
involved at every level with various organisations so that
people&#146;s needs are heard loud and clear and are
addressed.</p><p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="61107-0019.htm_para28"><a name="06110767000145">Finally,
the company has made sure that the employment of young people is a
positive thing. Working for the company should be a positive goal and
career step for people leaving university and school. The
company&#146;s recruiting practices are very much targeted on a young
work force. That approach is unique in its detail&#151;if not unique
among all housing providers, certainly among arm&#146;s length
management organisations. We should share good practice. Most of us who
have been involved in public services and politics for years have been
to thousands to meetings at which we said that we should share good
practice, only to go away and forget all about it. The truth is, the
company provides an example of good practice, and it is the way
forward. We should take it on board and develop it.</p><br>

company works with other organisations, and asks young people whether
it can help them to stay at home. Are there family breakdowns at home,
or are there financial problems? It tries to help them in different
ways. I have been scratching my head, because I cannot imagine another
company telling someone not to take their product. A company selling
new cars would not suggest that someone take the bus or use their bike.

people, the problems can be daunting, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Blaydon described very well. To set up on their own with limited
knowledge, money or assistance is a frightening and bewildering
prospect for many young people. It could be that family problems have
forced them into a world of tenancies, leases, rent and
responsibilities for which they are ill-prepared. Low wages,
unemployment, the lack of a bank account, no credit history&#151;all
can make that situation much more difficult. If we fail our young
people, they may end up homeless and, as such, much more likely to fall
victim to a vicious spiral of crime, drugs and perhaps even
violence.</p><p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="61107-0020.htm_para10"><a name="06110767000159">In the 2002
report &#147;Reducing Re-offending by Ex-Prisoners&#148;, the
social exclusion unit found that the presence of stable accommodation
for young people can mean a reduction of more than 20 per cent. in the
reoffending rate. Everyone has a right to a decent home, and the
Government want everyone to be given the help and advice needed to make
a good start. So we are allocating more than &#163;80 million to
local authorities over the next two years to invest in further
homelessness prevention schemes; such schemes have already demonstrated
considerable
success.</p><p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="61107-0020.htm_para11"><a name="06110767000160">As well as
dealing with people who are homeless, we must work to help people to
avoid becoming homeless. There needs to be co-ordinated working between
children&#146;s services and housing services to address young
people&#146;s specific needs, as they often go beyond housing needs
alone. Young people are particularly vulnerable if they do not have
help and support in establishing a structured lifestyle. I commend the
work being done in Gateshead on this issue.</p><p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="61107-0020.htm_para12"><a name="06110767000161">My hon. Friend described how
the organisation&#146;s first step is to question the young person to
see whether this is the right step for them, and whether there is a
better alternative. He might not know that I used to be a social
worker. I worked with young people who often did not have an
alternative, and I saw first hand how they would struggle in a new
tenancy to deal with issues that, frankly, had never occurred to them.
They wanted their own space, which is understandable, but they often
found that dealing with loneliness&#151;let alone the problems
associated with paying bills&#151;could become simply too much. Many
young people struggle to sustain that first tenancy, so my hon. Friend
was right to identify this
issue.</p><p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="61107-0020.htm_para13"><a name="06110767000162">On housing
provision, which my hon. Friend also rightly raised, we are working to
achieve the decent home targets in the public and private sectors. We
have invested more than &#163;20 billion of public money in improving
council housing since 1997, and more than &#163;40 billion will have
been invested by 2010. Since 1997, we have also levered in an
additional &#163;7.4 billion through borrowing by housing
associations. We have increased the number of decent social homes by
over 1 million, and increased the proportion of vulnerable households
in the private sector who have a decent home to 66 per cent. We
continue to seek ways of delivering more affordable housing and of
increasing the building rate for new homes. There is a great deal more
to do, but we have to do more than just deal with the physical fabric.
Everyone, regardless of age or background, has a right to a decent,
safe and secure home. It was no surprise to hear from my hon. Friend

they have not previously discovered. Any efforts to be innovative in
dealing with the housing needs of young people are to be welcomed. That
is why I commend the excellent Gateshead strategy that my hon. Friend

consulted. What is impressive about this approach is that a great deal
of thought has been put into finding out the views and opinions of lots
of young people from different backgrounds and different ethnic

development of this kind of plan is evidence of that. Together with the
council, it is working proactively and is spending more than &#163;1
million a week on improving homes. In particular, I commend its
excellent website, as both my hon. Friends have rightly done. I had a
quick look at it myself yesterday and found that it was easy to
navigate. The address www.mypadgateshead.co.uk is helpful and
user-friendly. If you ever find yourself with a moment to spare at your

regional housing boards in the English regions that have already shown

Gateshead has thus done considerable work by examining the aspirations
of young people. Some of those young people might not become
householders for a considerable time, but such planning for the future
is enormously
important.</p><p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="61107-0020.htm_para22"><a name="06110767000171">My hon.
Friend the Member for Blaydon asked something of Ministers, which is
always a good reason to apply for an Adjournment debate. On this
occasion, it will not be too difficult to give him the response that he
wants. He asked whether I would make a visit. The work is very
impressive, so I give a commitment that a Minister from the Department
for Communities and Local Government will visit Gateshead to learn
about what is going on. My hon. Friend is absolutely right that
spreading good practice is important, so it is useful if Ministers are
able to see such practice for themselves. A Minister from the
Department will thus make a visit as soon as that is
possible.</p><p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="61107-0020.htm_para23"><a name="06110767000172">I am sure
that that Minister will want to meet the newest member of the board.
Again, it is impressive that Gateshead not only asked young people what
they wanted on one occasion, but is ensuring that the voice of young
people is part of the ongoing work and management by having a young
person on the board. Such practice is to be commended and the
Government would certainly welcome it being followed
elsewhere.</p><p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="61107-0020.htm_para24"><a name="06110767000173">I once
again commend both my hon. Friends for their support for the work. I
congratulate Gateshead on producing the report, and I thank my hon.
Friend the Member for Blaydon for giving me the opportunity to discuss
this important
issue.</p><p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="61107-0020.htm_para25"><a name="06110767000174"><i> Question put
