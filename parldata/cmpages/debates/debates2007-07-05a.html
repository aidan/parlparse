 My hon. Friend makes a strong point. Such committees can play an important role. I shall just mention the kind of work that they could consider doing, in the context of current problems. For example, the RDA in Yorkshire moved very quickly in response to the recent floods; it has made &#163;1 million available in business support.

The simple fact is that to the Indian market, to take just one example, the United Kingdom is a very small place, and the differences between the west midlands and the east midlands, or the north-east and the south-west, are irrelevant to that market. We want business to come back to UK plc, and once it gets back here, we will decide where it goes. What will the Minister do about that particular problem, and that waste of money?</p>

Of course we have a duty to make sure that our efforts are properly co-ordinated, but we would not accept a situation in which it was suggested that something was seriously hampering our efforts to attract inward investment; the record shows that we are an extremely attractive location. The hon. Lady mentioned India. She will know that the UK is home to about 60 per cent. of Indian inward investment in Europe. I think that we are performing well in the Indian market. I am sure that we could do better in that market and in others, and I assure her that my colleagues and I will do everything that we can to make sure that that is the case.</p>

People are not using the post offices in the same way that they did, and we cannot hide from that fact.

There will be a full and open consultation in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s area, and I urge him to take part in it. Let me remind him of some of the facts that he overlooked.

 The introduction of the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive in the UK from 1 July is a positive step for the environment, given that Britain produces and disposes of some 2 million tonnes of such electrical waste every year. The new arrangements will reduce toxicity and the volume of waste going to landfill, as well as encouraging both resource productivity and sustainable development. All retailers of electrical and electronic equipment are obliged to offer in-store take-back, unless they are members of the distributor take-back scheme. So far, over 2,500 retailers have joined the scheme. That accounts for more than 75 per cent. of such sales.</p>

 We took a little while to introduce the scheme because we wanted to get it right. Offering producers and retailers who are producers the opportunity to join a take-back scheme, rather than their having to handle electrical waste in their own stores, is a move in the right direction. It is encouraging that new companies are springing up that see a commercial opportunity in recycling such waste, and that local authorities such as Croydon are turning what used to be known as the local dump into recycling centres, as evidenced by the excellent Purley Oaks recycling centre in my neighbourhood and the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency.</p>

 Voluntary organisations and local charities are making efforts in that regard.

 We will, of course, keep that under close review. The measures have been in operation for only a few days, and I have no doubt that we will need to revisit certain aspects of them. Their overall direction is absolutely right, however. There is a statistic that is worth highlighting: each of us during our lifetime throws away 1 or perhaps 2 tonnes of goods such as kettles, toasters and white goods. We must stop that; we must move away from being a throwaway society to being an environmentally conscious society, and we are doing so.</p>

So could she tell us whether there will be a role for the public to have a say, as well as politicians? Is she willing to accept, and to put on the record her view, that much more power should be transferred to the House? In particular, is she willing now to say that responsibility for the business of this place should be driven by this place in co-operation with the Government, not by the Government alone, and that it should be this place that chooses the Select Committee Chairs to scrutinise the Executive? It would be very helpful if she could indicate that that is in her plan too.</p>

of Britain&#148;, a document proposing an ambitious programme of constitutional reform that has enormous implications for the House of Commons. Should not the Government be interested in the response of the House to that document, and should we not have a two-day debate, in Government time, so that the Executive can reflect on the views of the House?</p>

 The document to which the right hon. Gentleman refers sets out work for a number of Departments&#151;on local government, on the relationship with the judiciary and on House issues. I suggest we ensure that each responsible Department, and I as Leader of the House, take forward the proposals outlined in the document, ensuring as much consultation as possible, and, on the journey on which the Prime Minister has set us, keeping in mind the overall picture. My right hon. Friend has said that we need not only to take individual measures forward, but to take an overview. We will have to consider how we do that without losing sight of the overall programme.</p>

There have been many resolutions on Darfur, and it has now been acknowledged that there should be a peacekeeping force. The matter is of huge interest to Mr. David Moorhead, head of religious education in one of my local schools, Sacred Heart, and to hundreds of his pupils and of my constituents. We would like something to be done, and we want to send a clear signal from the House that we take the matter very seriously and want the action that has been promised.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for her warm words of welcome to me and to my hon. Friend the Deputy Leader of the House. She raises an issue of concern not only to her, but, as she rightly says, across the House, and among the public. We debated in the House the progress that needs to be made in Darfur through the United Nations, supporting the African Union and the work of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development. I think that her point is that we need to hear more from the Government, so perhaps she could make the issue the subject of an Adjournment debate.</p>

 Yesterday in the House I highlighted the case of a constituent who was going blind, but who had to have private treatment because it was not available on the NHS. Yesterday evening, another constituent rang me to say that exactly the same thing had happened to her: she could not get NHS treatment and the only way to save her sight was to go private. Will the Leader of the House arrange for a debate or statement on access to NHS treatment in north Northamptonshire for blindness?</p>

The Parliamentary Information and Communication Technology team recently sold HTC mobile communication devices to a number of hon.

Given that many Members were forced into buying them because of the faulty equipment available to Members who have distant offices in the Palace system, and who cannot use the Library computers because they are not working, may we have a debate in the Chamber on the quality of services available to Members, so that we can actually communicate with our constituents and the support teams in offices at some distance from the Chamber?</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for raising the question of all-women shortlists, which was the vehicle by which we have managed to get more Labour women Members of Parliament into the House. When I was first elected to the House 25 years ago, I was one of only 10 Labour women MPs. We now have 97 Labour women MPs. Then, the House of Commons was 97 per cent. men and only 3 per cent. women. We have changed that, but we still have a long way to go. I know that the right hon.

Today, on the &#147;Today&#148; programme, I heard a spokesman from Hizb ut-Tahrir saying that it was acceptable for British soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq, like Corporal Rigby, to be killed.

I, too, heard the comments of Hizb ut-Tahrir this morning on the &#147;Today&#148; programme. I know that my colleagues in Government are extremely concerned to enforce rigorously the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 in respect of those who promote terrorism. They will have heard what was said. The matter is under continuous review. I had the bizarre experience of Hizb ut-Tahrir coming to see me, as a woman parliamentarian, in my constituency surgery and arguing to me that they would prefer to see a caliphate rather than a parliamentary democracy. They do not believe in women doing anything outside the home. We must be very concerned to make sure that subversion and support for terrorism are not fomented in this country, and my colleagues in Government are very much concerned with that.</p>

 May I refer to a matter of business that the Leader of the House has announced&#151;I know that that is an unusual practice during these questions&#151;which is the debate on forced marriages, which is to occur on 10 July? I congratulate the Government on taking over the private Member&#146;s Bill and look forward to legislation to tackle forced marriages. However, because it started as a private Member&#146;s Bill, there has not been the kind of preliminary discussion and debate that we usually try to have about new legislation, and that, following the very welcome statement by the Prime Minister, will clearly happen more in future. Can the Leader of the House use the summer to try to initiate a widespread debate about what is in the legislation and what should be added to it, so that by the time it comes back to the Floor of the House for Report and Third Reading we can ensure that all the communities have been properly engaged in a debate on this very important subject?</p>

 What my hon. Friend says is important for two reasons. Obviously, the House needs to be sure that we get the legislation right and that there is proper scrutiny. Also, what she proposes is important because it will be part of reinforcing the message that we want to go out to all communities in this country&#151;that forced marriage is not acceptable. Women and men must be able to choose their own partners in marriage and not be forced. I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Lord Lester, who introduced the private Member&#146;s Bill in the House of Lords, and my colleague Baroness Cathy Ashton, who took it through. As my hon. Friend said, the legislation has been introduced in a rather unusual way. I will consider how we deal with that, but the Bill, and its principle, is very important.</p>

 May I echo the views expressed on both sides of the House that we should have an early debate on the constitution?

 With permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a statement on reforms to support for students in higher education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="70705-0006.htm_para3"><a name="07070539000302">I am delighted to make my first statement as the first Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills. In establishing my Department, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister charged my colleagues and I with the twin aims of providing a strong, integrated permanent voice across Government for effective investment in research, science and skills at all levels and ensuring that research, higher education and further education serve their wider purposes&#151;supporting social mobility and inclusion for the disadvantaged, and cultural growth. Success in higher education will be one key measure of my Department&#146;s work. The skills and talents of our people are our greatest natural asset, and our universities and colleges must offer world-class standards of teaching and research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="70705-0006.htm_para4"><a name="07070539000303">Since 1997, the number of home and overseas students has increased by over 400,000, and the funding of higher education institutions has risen by over 20 per cent. in real terms. Before 1997, funding per student had declined by 36 per cent. in less than a decade. In today&#146;s global economy, we cannot afford to stand still. The growth in the number of graduates being produced in India and China is dramatic. Around the world, countries are increasingly investing in the high-level skills and the cutting edge research that universities provide. To compete and prosper in this world&#151;to respond to the needs of leading global and national businesses&#151;we must enable many thousands more people to study and graduate each year. To become a world leader in skills, as Lord Leitch recommended, we must aim for at least 40 per cent. of adults to have higher level qualifications by 2020.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="70705-0006.htm_para5"><a name="07070539000304">Everyone who has the potential and qualifications to succeed in higher education, whatever their family background, should have the opportunity to participate. No one should be held back from realising their potential. That is fair, and it is right for our economy. We cannot be satisfied when only 28 per cent. of students come from low-income backgrounds. We are wasting the talents of too many young people for whom university study should be a realistic ambition, not out of reach. We recognise, too, that hard-working families on modest incomes have concerns about the affordability of university study. They have high aspirations&#151;rightly so&#151;and we should help them to fulfil those aspirations. To meet the challenges of achieving world-class skills, and to make the most of the talent and ability of every individual, we need to be willing to change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="70705-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07070539000305">That is why I propose four major changes to our system of student support. First, we will increase substantially the number of students entitled to maintenance grants. These changes will take effect for students from England entering higher education in 2008. More students will receive full grants worth &#163;2,835. From September next year, full grants will be available to new students from families with incomes of  <br>

<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1109</b><br>
up to &#163;25,000, compared with &#163;18,360. We estimate that 50,000 more students each year will receive full grants once the system is fully up and running. With the addition of &#163;310 bursaries from higher education institutions, these students will be guaranteed &#163;3,145 a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="70705-0006.htm_para7"><a name="07070539000306">Moreover, eligibility for maintenance grants will be extended to many more students from families on modest and middle incomes&#151;hard-working families who are doing the right thing by encouraging their children to go to university. Students whose families have household incomes of up to &#163;60,000 a year will in future benefit from eligibility to a grant. More than 100,000 extra students at any one time will be entitled to a partial grant once these proposals are fully implemented. More than 250,000 students will gain from our proposals once fully implemented. Of those, 35,000 will gain by more than &#163;1,000 a year and a further 125,000 by more than &#163;500. For a student from a household on &#163;25,000 a year earnings, that will mean an extra &#163;1,100 a year in maintenance grant. For a family on &#163;50,000 a year with two children at university, it will mean that each student receives a grant of &#163;560 a year. Today, just over half of students who entered higher education in 2006 received a maintenance grant. From 2008, two thirds will do so. A third of students will get a full grant, compared with 29 per cent. now, and a further third will get a partial grant, compared with 22 per cent. now. To fund this improvement and the other measures that I am announcing today, we will be investing over &#163;400 million a year when the system is fully in place. That is a major increase in support to students.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="70705-0006.htm_para8"><a name="07070539000307">Secondly, able young people from low income homes should aim for university, confident of the financial support they will receive. From the 2008-09 academic year, a 16-year-old who qualifies for an educational maintenance allowance will be guaranteed a minimum level of maintenance support at university. This 16-year-old will be guaranteed at least five years of maintenance support for their studies&#151;through school, college and university. The guarantee will support aspirations for higher education. It will provide certainty about the financial support to fulfil their potential. Young people starting their studies at sixth-form or college will see a clear route into higher education. More than 250,000 16-year-olds a year will get the guarantee. Of course, in developing that package, I will work closely with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families to ensure that support goes to those students who are qualified and demonstrate their rigorous compliance with the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="70705-0006.htm_para9"><a name="07070539000308">Thirdly, for students whose parents have not attended university, the support of others can be crucial in deciding to go to university. We want to give new emphasis to students acting as role models and mentors for young people who might not otherwise go on to higher education. I propose to double the number of such mentors on our popular and successful student associate scheme from 7,500 to 15,000. That means one generation of students supporting the next generation of children towards college or university.</p>

Students starting in 2008 will have that option once they complete their degree. When graduates face significant new out-goings in their lives, such as buying their first home or starting a family, they will have the option of taking a break from their loan repayments.

 Let me begin, alongside all the other welcomes that you have already heard, Mr. Deputy Speaker, by welcoming the new Secretary of State to his post. I look forward to debating and questioning the Government on the important issues that he raised today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="70705-0007.htm_para3"><a name="07070539000314">We agree with the Government about wanting the greatest possible access to higher education of good quality. We also recognise that, contrary to some of the fears that were expressed, it looks as if top-up fees have not so far made the problem of access to university worse. However, it must also be acknowledged that we do not appear to be making significant progress in improving access, as the figure for students from modest backgrounds has been stable at about 28 per cent. over the past few years. We therefore welcome any measures that the Government can take to improve access to higher education in future. However, I should like to ask the Secretary of State for more information about some of his proposals and their scope.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="70705-0007.htm_para4"><a name="07070539000315">First, what about part-time students? Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that many students from modest backgrounds who go to university are looking for part-time study? Progress has been made in more modular courses. Will any of the provisions that he announced today make it easier for part-time students at university?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="70705-0007.htm_para5"><a name="07070539000316">Secondly, will the Secretary of State tell us a bit more about who will be responsible for delivering some of the measures that he announced? Aimhigher is an excellent programme, which involves links between universities and schools. Is not it a pity that we now have two education Departments when, in the past, the programme was clearly in the Department for Education and Skills? Which Department will be responsible for Aimhigher?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="70705-0007.htm_para6"><a name="07070539000317">We welcome the extension of the mentoring scheme that the Secretary of State announced. It appears to involve people at university visiting schools and   <br>

arranging programmes in schools through the school system. Surely it will be far more complicated now that two Departments are involved instead of one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="70705-0007.htm_para7"><a name="07070539000318">The Secretary of State referred to extra spending of &#163;400 million. Will he confirm that the sum is within the education spending totals that the then Chancellor announced earlier this year, and thus in the totals that were already set? If so, will he make it clear where exactly the resources are coming from in the overall Budget that the now Prime Minister announced when Chancellor of the Exchequer? <i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I hope that the Secretary of State can respond to the questions, which will concern many people in higher education, including students.</p>

There has been media comment in the past few weeks about what might happen to bursaries, and Minister with responsibility for higher education, the hon. Member for Harlow (Bill Rammell), made carefully drafted comments, in which he appeared to cast doubt on their long-term future. Will changes to bursaries form any part of the package and funding changes that he announced?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="70705-0007.htm_para9"><a name="07070539000322">On a wider point, does the Secretary of State accept that approximately 90 per cent. of people who leave school with two good A-levels already get to university? The deep challenge that we must all confront is that, if we want more people to have access to university with the right qualifications to benefit from higher education, we need to examine what is happening in schools. Is not the fundamental challenge, which everyone raises with us, increasing access to the GCSEs and A-levels that students need if they are to have a prospect of getting to university? Is not that the problem that the Government need to tackle?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="70705-0007.htm_para10"><a name="07070539000323">Let me tell the Secretary of State about a visit that I recently paid to one of the excellent summer schools, which are aimed at broadening access to university. There, teenagers who had not previously thought of going to university suddenly realised that they could benefit from it, and then one saw their shock when they realised that the GCSEs that they had been studying, and perhaps the A-level for which they had been entered, were not those that they needed to do the course about which they had become excited. The Government&#146;s targets and points system mean that many teenagers are encouraged to do the GCSEs and A-levels that do not offer them the best prospect of getting to university.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="70705-0007.htm_para11"><a name="07070539000324">Meanwhile, study of the subjects that are often crucial to getting to our most academically valuable universities are declining. There is a decline in the number of people who study modern languages and individual real sciences at GSCE and A-level in state schools, and an increase in the proportion of students who study the crunchy and more academic subjects&#151;further maths and modern languages&#151;at private  <br>

schools. How can the Government achieve their objectives of widening participation if the only lever that they pull changes the maintenance grant when fundamental improvement in the quality of education at school is the key? Is not that another reason why splitting the Department for Education and Skills in two will make it harder to achieve those important objectives?</p>

<p><a name="st_o182"><a name="07070539000325"><a name="70705-0007.htm_spnew3"><a name="07070539001539"><b>Mr. Denham:</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his opening remarks and congratulate him on his appointment&#151;I welcome him to his new job. I have known him for a long time and always admired his wide interest in social policy. In his previous job in particular I admired his intellectual honesty, and I hope that he gets more support from those behind him in his current job than he did in his previous post.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="70705-0007.htm_para12"><a name="07070539000326">My impression is that the hon. Gentleman does not have a great deal to say about the package. It is a shame that he has not grasped its importance to delivering two things: the skills that we need as a society to prosper and the opportunity for many of our fellow citizens, especially young people, who currently do not fulfil their full potential. I hope that, perhaps in later debates, we will get a more generous welcome for the Government&#146;s reforms today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="70705-0007.htm_para13"><a name="07070539000327">Let me deal with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s specific points. The package is not about part-time students. However, last year, the Government introduced a system of support for fees. Many higher education institutions offer support for part-time students through access to learning funds. In 1997, when the hon. Gentleman was last in government, there was no support for part-time students, and most of today&#146;s part-time students would not have had the chance to be in higher education. Part-time study is important and we are building, especially with industry, co-funded courses in higher education. We expect many, if not all, to be on a part-time basis, and to deliver the higher quality vocational skills that are needed. We therefore recognise the importance of part-time education in the overall picture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="70705-0007.htm_para14"><a name="07070539000328">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the splitting or creation of the two Departments. Some years ago, I was the Minister with responsibility for children and young people, and personally I feel that there is a compelling logic to having a Department&#151;which the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, my right hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Ed Balls) now leads&#151;that is able to look at family and children&#146;s issues in such a coherent way. There will be certain issues at the interface between my right hon. Friend&#146;s Department and mine, which we will sort out&#151;they are easy to identify, and they will be easy to tackle&#151;but the gains for our children from having the focus that the new structure offers will be enormous. I do not believe that it will make the slightest difference to the already successful scheme involving university students going back into school to work with students, particularly in science, maths, technology and engineering&#151;the subjects that the hon. Gentleman is concerned about&#151;to ensure that they have the right qualifications. We have already recognised the importance of that work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="70705-0007.htm_para15"><a name="07070539000329">The bursary scheme is enormously important. I have been in this post for only a few days&#151;</p>

 Eight days. I have been in post for only eight days, but the Minister of State, Department of Innovation, Universities and Skills, my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Bill Rammell) encourages me to say that we have no plans to change the bursary scheme. It is an important part of all this. Indeed, my statement slightly understated the extent to which some students will be better off, because many bursary schemes offer an amount that is much more generous than the minimum that I mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="70705-0007.htm_para16"><a name="07070539000332">Of course higher school standards are important throughout the system. We already have the best ever school standards. The standards in our poorest performing schools have improved faster than across the education system as a whole, and that will continue to provide students who will come into higher education. We all know, however, that at the moment some of those students will get to the age of 16 and lose their way and go out of the system because they do not think that university is for them. These measures will address the needs of those students and get them into higher education.</p>

 I genuinely warmly welcome my right hon. Friend to his new job. What a way to start. His statement is good news for working people and their families, and for students who will be encouraged to enter higher education for the first time. Those of us who have looked at this area know that what is needed is the full package, and that the earlier we start, the better. My right hon. Friend will know about my passion for the mentoring role, which is at the heart of the recommendations. I welcome them very sincerely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="70705-0007.htm_para17"><a name="07070539000334">Of course, all of us who are interested in education will add one proviso. The full package must go right the way through, keeping these young, talented people in the system so that they go into higher education and then into postgraduate education, so that they can become PhDs, researchers and leaders in technology and innovation. But we will give my right hon. Friend a little time before he needs to come back to us on that.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for his comments. However the Select Committee structures are determined by the House, I am sure that we will be drawing on his considerable expertise in this area and in this new role. Mentoring is enormously important, and some young people do not get the necessary support at home to achieve their full potential. If we can provide it in other ways, that is enormously important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="70705-0007.htm_para18"><a name="07070539000336">A second matter on which I agree with my hon. Friend involves another part of the story that we can tell. The higher education institutions are doing increasingly effective work on ensuring that, once students have entered higher education, they stay there and complete their first degree or other qualification as successfully as possible. That is essential. Internationally, we have a very good completion rate in higher education. I am convinced that the measures that we have put in place today will relieve some of the pressures that can divert students who feel that they cannot complete their courses,   <br>

 I welcome the Secretary of State to his new job. May I say how much I look forward to working with him? I also welcome the fact that the Prime Minister was here earlier. I am afraid that he is not in his place now, as usual for the Liberal Democrat response. Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that he was here at the start of the statement; I hope that that means he will be making student support a priority. I certainly welcome the recognition that the previous system was woefully inadequate, and that a family on an annual income of &#163;17,5000 is hardly wealthy. My concern, however, is whether the extension of maintenance grants to more people might be a prelude to lifting the cap. Is that the Secretary of State&#146;s intention? I would be grateful if he could make that clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="70705-0007.htm_para19"><a name="07070539000338">The Secretary of State spoke earlier about part-time students. Does he recognise the challenges for students who are studying at less than 50 per cent. of a full-time course and who therefore have no access whatever to maintenance grants? Part-time students are often older or poorer. They are more likely to be from an ethnic minority background, and very likely to have caring responsibilities. Yet they are just the kind of people whom Leitch recommends must be attracted into education. Does the Secretary of State recognise that the income of such students is severely affected by having to pay fees up front? Does he propose to change that? I must remind him that we were vehemently opposed to the introduction of those fees in the first place. Similarly, does he have any plans to extend maintenance loans to students studying courses in further education colleges?</p>

I should like to add my comments to those that others have made about the increase in funding for mentors. That is welcome, as long as it happens at a very early age, because young people make choices about their future as they enter secondary school. He failed to answer a question from the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) on how the proposals are to be funded. Does he intend to fund them by cutting other aspects of the higher education package, or should we expect to hear of changes to the interest rates on maintenance loans over the next few years?

that would attract assistance with fees, and the decision was made a few months or a year ago to limit that assistance to those who were studying at 50 per cent. intensity or more. There are some people who fall outside that category, but many of them are in work, and that is the reason for the low intensity of their study. Also, there are special provisions for those whose ability to study is limited by a disability. We put together a good package; it was certainly much better than anything that had existed previously for part-time students.</p>

On the CSR settlement and allocation, the House will have to wait until later in the year for the details to be published. However, what I have announced today comes within our CSR settlement limits. Nothing that I have done today puts in jeopardy any commitments that we have already made in higher education, including the funding of student places or the desire to increase the number of participants in higher education.</p>

We will want to bring that group together at a very early stage to look at how we can effectively communicate that message right down through the system. Taking into account the comments made by hon.

 What I have said, and I repeat, is that the settlement enables us to say to universities that we will maintain the real level of funding per student as student numbers increase.

Will the Secretary of State tell the House whether he intends to promote a review of the education maintenance allowance? Eligibility for that is crucial for the commitment that he made to 16-year-olds to support them through higher education.

 You have asked me to be brief, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I merely say that nothing in the package makes any changes to the loan repayment regime other than the welcome flexibility that graduates who start their courses in a couple years&#146; time will get.

 My hon. Friend is right to raise that question.

My earlier answer about the role of the communications group should address that issue. I hope that it will get the message across.

 My hon. Friend raises an important point that I will discuss with the universities when I meet with their representatives. I know that, in part, that requirement reflects the demand from business, as employers, to ensure that students study the degrees that will be most useful to them and their own future.

 As I said earlier, we cannot be satisfied that only 28 per cent. of students come from low-income backgrounds, so we must improve things. I believe that, when the hon.

Will he talk to the Scottish Executive and the other devolved Administrations about strengthening those reciprocal arrangements and ensuring that no divisions develop? Students should be able to enjoy an educational experience in other parts of the country.</p>

 I agree that it is right that talented students should be able to attend the right university for them; that is an important statement of principle. That there are different financial regimes reflects the fact that we have devolved Administrations, but it would be sensible for the higher education Ministers of the various Administrations to be in reasonably regular contact to address how their systems are evolving and developing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="70705-0009.htm_para3"><a name="07070539000406">One of the matters that received a lot of attention in Committee was part 3 of the Bill, which deals with the regulation of estate agency. New clause 1 and the Liberal Democrats&#146; new clause 2 give us a very good opportunity to have a real discussion on Report today about what the Bill does and does not cover in terms of regulation of the residential market. There are indeed some grey areas, which I shall come to in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="70705-0009.htm_para4"><a name="07070539000407">The purpose of our new clause is to permit the Secretary of State to amend the definition of estate agency work by statutory instrument, subject to affirmation by both Houses. This follows the amendments that we tabled in Committee to amend the definition of estate agency work in the Estate Agents Act 1979. Clearly, 1979 was a long time ago, and the residential market has moved on a great deal since that legislation was enacted. Indeed, residential lettings, which are not covered by the Bill, have increased by at least a third since then. The purpose of the new clause is therefore to amend the definition of estate agency work in the 1979 Act to take into account direct and off-plan sales by house builders, and to bring residential lettings within its scope. As a result, all those activities would be subject to the new redress and other procedures in the Bill&#151;we welcome them&#151;which would aid consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="70705-0009.htm_para5"><a name="07070539000408">The Government rejected the Conservative amendments, claiming that they wanted to consult consumers and the industry before deciding whether the law needed amending, and I have no doubt that the Minister will say that today. The idea is that Ministers would in future introduce legislation to deal with that subject. However, the Government have had more than enough time to consider these matters, and there has been more than enough in the way of studies and lobbying from the various groups involved to be able to consider how the residential market should be regulated. The new clause allows us, as I said, to debate the need to update the definition of estate agency work to take into account the rising number of direct sales of houses and the need to include residential lettings so that everyone is covered under the improved redress scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="70705-0009.htm_para6"><a name="07070539000409">Estate agents are already regulated by a number of Acts. The 1979 Act contains a negative licensing provision whereby an estate agent who has breached the Act&#146;s provisions and/or been convicted of certain criminal offences may be banned. However, that is a negative, after-the-event licensing regime. Section 22 of the 1979 Act contains a provision to regulate the standards of competence for estate agency, but it was never enacted. The Earl of Caithness tried to move an amendment on Third Reading in that regard, but it was not carried.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="70705-0009.htm_para7"><a name="07070539000410">The Property Misdescriptions Act 1991 made provision for it to be a criminal offence to make false or misleading statements, in written or oral form, about certain matters relating to property. Estate agents were further regulated by the Enterprise Act 2002, which enabled the Office of Fair Trading and trading standards to obtain injunctions to stop estate agents breaching protective legislation, so there is already a considerable amount of legislation surrounding estate agents, who were of course further regulated by the Housing Act 2004. Some 10,000 estate agents are   <br>

members of the National Association of Estate Agents, but it is estimated that only 66 per cent. of all estate agents are members of that professional body.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="70705-0009.htm_para8"><a name="07070539000411">At this point, I should declare an interest as one of only four chartered surveyors in the House.</p>

 Ah&#151;my hon. Friend, who is now an Opposition Whip, has pointed out that he, too, is a chartered surveyor. I was of course including him among the four, but I congratulate him not only on being a member of the eminent body of chartered surveyors, but on his promotion to the Opposition Whip&#146;s Bench. It is great to see him there. So there are only five chartered surveyors in the House, and I am delighted to be here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="70705-0009.htm_para9"><a name="07070539000414">Perhaps I should say a little more about estate agents and some of the practices that they get up to when I discuss the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer), but suffice it to say at this stage that the purpose of our new clause is to update the regulation of estate agents. Although we do not approve of the Liberal Democrats&#146; proposal for a full licensing scheme, not including the residential letting sector, the direct sales from developers sector and some agency sales via the internet are a considerable lacuna&#151;perhaps the biggest in the Bill. We want to be very clear whether the Bill does cover that latter activity; I hope that the Minister can enlighten us when he replies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="70705-0009.htm_para10"><a name="07070539000415">As I said, the rental sector has increased by at least a third since the 1979 Act was passed. The letting sector is huge and if today&#146;s interest rate rises are anything to go by, I suspect that it will become even bigger. Of course, it deals with some of the more vulnerable in our society&#151;those who are less able to defend themselves when things to wrong&#151;so not including it in the Bill seems a huge lacuna. I should be grateful if the Minister enlightened us as to why the Bill does not cover the rental market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="70705-0009.htm_para11"><a name="07070539000416">Also on the increase&#151;and also not included in the Bill&#151;is direct sale from developers to consumers. Anybody involved in the housing market, particularly in the south-east, knows that this sector, too, is growing apace. However, it seems that that sector is not to be regulated, either. A lot of people buy houses off-plan directly from developers. They might be first-time buyers, and they probably have not got the expertise genuinely to assess whether the developer in question is selling them a pup, or they are getting the purchase that they envisage from the perhaps rather over-coloured plans. That is the second sector that, in our view, the Bill does not adequately cover, and which new clause 1 would include.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="70705-0009.htm_para12"><a name="07070539000417">The third sector consists of the various types of organisations&#151;and they do vary&#151;which sell or let houses via the internet. According to a rough estimate that I made the other day, there are at least 100 such organisations offering services in that way. Again, the more vulnerable will be tempted use their internet search engines to find some form of letting arrangement and to deal with such an agency. They might not have the knowledge to understand whether their transaction is being handled through a true and  <br>

honest mechanism. For that reason, such activities need in some way to be regulated under the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="70705-0009.htm_para13"><a name="07070539000418">Before the Minister replies, I should point out that our new clause would not alter the Bill one iota: all it would do is give the Secretary of State the power to deal with such matters. As the market is developing in a fairly dynamic way, particularly on the internet, it would be very sensible to include this power in the Bill. It might prove to be like section 22 of the 1979 Act, in that it is never used, but given that the House is unlikely, owing to pressure on parliamentary time, to return to the issue of regulating estate agencies for at least five years&#151;perhaps even 10 years, given how this House operates and the sheer volume of legislation that it has to handle&#151;not dealing with this issue now would be a real missed opportunity. I hope that the Minister will think again, even at this late stage, although I do not hold out any particular hopes.</p>

 Thank you for that guidance, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) worked very hard and constructively in Committee, along with my hon. Friends, and I understand&#151;for some of the reasons that I have already set out&#151;why she wishes to try to provide a positive regulation scheme for estate agents, although I do not support that. There is considerable legislation covering estate agents already, and there is more in this Bill.</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman knows, I have a high regard for him and it is in that spirit that I wish to put a question to him. I was a member of the Committee, although as a Scots Member I would not have dreamt of intervening on matters so vital to England, and I was left with a doubt in my mind. On the one hand, the official Opposition argue about the role of estate agents, and the hon. Gentleman rightly expressed his worries about how often we can address these issues; on the other, they did not seem to be keen on regulation. They seemed to think that market forces would be sufficient. If the hon. Gentleman could clarify that point, I would be very grateful.</p>

 I have great regard for the right hon. Gentleman, and the clarity with which he made his intervention demonstrates the quality of the service that he gives to the House on a wide range of issues. I congratulate him on that. He will know that my party&#146;s whole stance is opposition to unnecessary regulation and we believe that it is unnecessary to have wholesale regulation of estate agents. As I have said, there is already a considerable volume of legislation that licenses estate agents. The Bill provides a redress scheme and further penalties, and we would like to see how that works out before jumping in with a sledgehammer to try to make it more difficult for youngsters and others to set up as estate agents.</p>

If new clause 2 is accepted, there would still be rogue estate agents, because some of the bright youngsters, who are bright enough to be rogues, will still pass whatever exams or tests might emerge from the licensing scheme. So a licensing scheme of itself would not stop unethical behaviour. It could set a framework and make it easier to deal with rogue estate agents, but it would not stop them. I would like to set up a framework that encouraged everybody to operate to higher standards. I would like all estate agents be members of the RICS or the National Association of Estate Agents, and put that in their windows. Those bodies could then set standards for continuing professional development, training and so on. Just having a licensing scheme would not stop rogue estate agents.</p>

 Before the hon. Gentleman leaves this issue, does he agree that someone who intentionally sets out to mislead or even defraud may have all the necessary qualifications? That also applies to solicitors. However, would not a positive licensing system mean that everyone would at least start out with a minimum qualification and understanding of what they are doing? Therefore the likelihood of estate agents acting in ignorance would be reduced and that would be a great benefit to the industry and the customer.</p>

 That is a reasonable point, and I partly agree and partly disagree with the hon. Lady. She made my case by talking about rogue solicitors. We generally regard the legal profession as having some of the highest standards of any professional body. However, that does not stop rogue solicitors. We still see the odd court case in which a solicitor is struck off. The solicitor&#146;s body and regulation by Government means that rogue solicitors can be banned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="70705-0009.htm_para17"><a name="07070539000428">As for whether the scheme would raise standards, there is already enough legislation for estate agents. The Bill will introduce new redress schemes and penalties and we need to see how that settles down, although I am not saying that we would be opposed to a full licensing scheme for estate agents for ever more. I know that the hon. Lady probably will not agree with me, but I hope that I have given her some reasons why we will not support new clause 2.</p>

that estate agents can encounter and thus fall short of what they should do. The whole issue of offers is a difficult one and I am not sure that all estate agents handle offers in the most open and transparent way. They may not always report them to their clients as they should or give their client proper advice. They may use offers to wind up the price or fail to report them if they are trying to get a lower price on a house for a friend. The area of offers can be difficult for some less scrupulous estate agents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para0"><a name="07070539000431">Estate agents and chartered surveyors&#151;my own profession&#151;have often been criticised over valuations, which can be difficult and which may vary for several reasons. In a fast-rising market, such as that in London today, or even a fast-falling market that might occur in a slump, one can value a property one day without knowing that the next that special purchaser will come along and offer 20 per cent. more, making one&#146;s valuation look stupid. That often happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para1"><a name="07070539000432"><i> Which?</i> has been campaigning alongside the hon. Lady to introduce a full licensing scheme and it sent round anonymous inspectors to see whether estate agents were signing unfair contracts. It found that in many cases the contracts were unfair. I hope that the Minister will confirm that the other provisions in the Bill on solicited calls, as opposed to unsolicited calls, will also apply to estate agents. Let us suppose that an estate agent went to see someone on a solicited basis&#151;that is to say, an appointment has been made&#151;and said, &#147;It will cost this much for us to provide this service to let your house. Please sign on the dotted line now.&#148; If the consumer decides overnight that the charge is unreasonable, will the solicited provisions in the Bill apply to the transaction? Will the consumer have the right to rescind the signed contract the next day?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para2"><a name="07070539000433">I welcome the redress scheme, but it does not go far enough. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) said on Second Reading, estate agents can be fined up to &#163;25,000 under the existing legislation, but in only six of the 497 cases brought in 2005 did the fines amount to more than &#163;3,000. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure the House that the Bill will give the redress scheme real teeth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para3"><a name="07070539000434">The Minister may well say that the Government are to have a review of the three categories that I have set out, but that would be no more than an excuse for inaction. I hope that he will tell us precisely what the Bill covers and, more important, that he will describe the Government&#146;s thinking about lettings, internet sales and direct development sales, and his proposals for their regulation in the future.</p>

have had, but the text contains none of the relevant language. We also note that the new clause contains very little discussion of timing, and makes no mention of consultation. I associate myself with the various observations that have been made about the lack of adequate regulation for lettings and direct sale, but I shall not repeat arguments that have been expressed in Committee and again today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07070539000437">The key purpose of new clause 2 is to establish minimum standards of training and qualifications for estate agents, and for people who do estate agency work such as lettings and direct sales. We also want to ensure that firms have adequate professional indemnity insurance and, where appropriate, insurance to protect clients&#146; money. Any order made under the new clause would need the approval of the House under the affirmative procedure, and the Secretary of State would be required to consult before making any such order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07070539000438">We touched on these matters in Committee, but in no great depth. Our debate focused on the arguments made by <i> Which?</i>, the various anonymous surveys that it carried out, and its investigations into issues such as offers, valuations and contracts. Those arguments were well set out earlier by the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), and the response to the magazine&#146;s inquiries showed that British people do not trust the estate agent industry or believe that they are treated in a way that is always responsible, competent or honest. The fact that the profession is not respected is very significant, and we believe that people&#146;s concerns should be heard and understood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07070539000439">When we raise the issue of requiring proper training and qualifications, we are always told that that would place an undue burden on the industry and act as a restraint on people entering the profession. However, new clause 2 is supported by <i> Which?</i>, the National Association of Estate Agents, and by Halifax estate agents. The two chartered surveyors in the House will be interested to hear that the new clause&#146;s principle and intention are supported by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, although it would prefer the provision to be included on the face of the Bill rather than introduced as a statutory instrument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07070539000440">The argument that the new clause would be onerous and act as a barrier to entry is fallacious. It has been pointed out that good estate agents want a requirement for qualification and training, and that it is those who are not competent who run away from the proposal. In addition, it takes only about six months to meet the present NAEA qualifications: that is hardly a barrier to entry, and the exam is being adapted so that people can do it online, at their own convenience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07070539000441">People do not have to give up jobs to enrol in a complex school programme. There is a great deal of flexibility, and the NAEA qualification can be provided in an efficient way that fits with people&#146;s general diaries and schedules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07070539000442">Interestingly enough, the pass rate for the NAEA qualification is about 62 per cent., and the people who want to do lettings do rather worse than that. That means that something like 40 per cent. of the people taking the exam&#151;which is equivalent to national vocational qualification level 3&#151;do not pass and have to do further study to achieve the qualification. That makes it clear that many people go into the estate agency business who simply are not competent. The  <br>

exam structure focuses on basic law, building construction techniques and valuation techniques. How can a person who does not have mastery of those three disciplines advise people on what is probably the most important investment that they will make in their lives?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07070539000443">The sums of money are very large, and people are bound to lack competence of their own because they are likely to buy a house only once, twice or three times in their lives. It is not surprising, therefore, that they look to estate agents for competence, and new clause 2 would make minimum standards and qualifications a requirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07070539000444">It has been claimed, both on the Floor of the House and in Committee, that rogues are not stopped by requiring them to take exams, but exams can prevent incompetence. I do not oppose the redress scheme, because rogues in the industry must be dealt with, but we also have to tackle incompetence. Prevention is better than either cure or punishment in that respect, and we should ensure that the industry meets the standards that the public expect. We would not dream of allowing an unqualified solicitor to draft the language of a contract, or of hiring an unqualified surveyor when we are buying a house. It is beyond belief that anyone would want to use an incompetent estate agent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07070539000445">I advise the House that we did not discuss these matters in depth in Committee, and that we had no opportunity to divide on them.

wishes to her in her new responsibilities. I endorse what my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke) said about the contribution that she has made to debates on the Bill in recent months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07070539000449">The hon. Member for Cotswold explained what new clause 1 would do. I must say to him that it would give the Government a very wide power to amend a central concept that underpins the Estate Agents Act 1979. He said in defence of the new clause that it might never be brought into effect, but it would not be sensible for the House to agree a measure if it did not want it to be enacted. The House would need to be comfortable that this was a reasonable measure before it agreed to its introduction. It would represent a large and, I suggest, ill-advised addition to the regulatory burden. There would be little restriction on how the power could be used. All sorts of activities could be brought within the definition of estate agency work if the Government of the day were so minded, albeit with the affirmative parliamentary procedure as a check.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para15"><a name="07070539000450">If there were a power to amend the section 1 definition, we would have to consider the implications for other pieces of legislation that rely on that definition such as the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991, the Money Laundering Regulations 2003 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. They all refer back to that definition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para16"><a name="07070539000451">The 1979 Act was intended only to apply to those engaged in estate agency work. The controls imposed by the Act would not all be appropriate to impose on the other categories of commercial organisations that he suggested&#151;lettings agents, property developers or other property professionals. We would also have to rewrite the rest of the 1979 Act to make it compatible with a new definition. For example, if lettings work were included in the definition of estate agency work, as the hon. Member for Cotswold suggested, we would probably also have to amend the definition of an interest in land. And if such a power were to be added, we would in effect have the ability to rewrite large chunks of the Act via secondary legislation. That on its own should give hon. Members pause for thought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para17"><a name="07070539000452">Let me comment on the three categories to which the hon. Member for Cotswold drew attention. He rather unkindly said that the Government were carrying out some reviews as an alternative to action. I suggest to him and to the House that it is right to proceed on the basis of careful thought. The Office of Fair Trading is conducting a market study of the house building industry. The study will allow the OFT to consider the potential competition and consumer concerns in the market and will focus in particular on the delivery of housing and customer satisfaction. It will follow on from Kate Barker&#146;s review of housing supply, which recommended that the house building industry should demonstrate increased levels of customer satisfaction. She also recommended that if progress was not satisfactory, the OFT should conduct a wide review of whether the market was working well for consumers. That study is now under way and is expected to report by the summer of next year. It is right to await the outcome of that work before we decide whether to take legislative action.</p>

Where activities over the net fall within the meaning of estate agency work under the 1979 Act, internet property retailers will be required to be members of redress schemes.</p>

Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) explained in Committee the reasons why we have not sought to change the definition of estate agency in this Bill. We have already taken action to deal with some of the problems in the lettings sector. The tenancy deposit scheme, which was introduced in April, has improved the rights of tenants by ensuring that deposits cannot be withheld unfairly. The Housing Act 2004 gave new rights to vulnerable tenants by requiring landlords who manage houses of multiple occupation to be licensed. We have committed to looking closely at the lettings sector as part of the wider property review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07070539000458">We need to look carefully at the evidence, make sure that we have the evidence that we need and then consider recommendations from the reviews that have been put in train before deciding what next steps are necessary.

be a number of activities in which estate agents hold peoples&#146; money. It will not be long before we have a scandalous case of a rogue estate agent holding a client&#146;s money and disappearing with it. I wonder whether the Government could give some thought to that.</p>

 Let me turn to new clause 2; I have not yet started to address the points made by the hon. Member for Richmond Park, and I am happy now to do so. I know that there was a substantial debate on the issue in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para23"><a name="07070539000462">We have made it clear throughout the passage of the Bill that we want to raise standards in estate agency. By requiring membership of redress schemes for all estate agents, this Bill gives estate agents the incentive to raise their own standards to avoid being investigated by an ombudsman. Businesses will be able to judge for themselves what training is needed to ensure that staff deliver a good service. If they do not make it clear to staff that best practice standards are expected and train staff accordingly, they will know that they are likely to face costly payouts in due course. That is a pretty effective way of concentrating the minds of those involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para24"><a name="07070539000463">In response to the case that the hon. Lady presented to the House, it would be a mistake to force all estate agents to belong to an industry body and then give that body, or bodies, free rein to decide the standards of conduct estate agents should adhere to and the training they require. The hon. Lady pointed out that her proposal has the support of the National Association of Estate Agents, which does not surprise me. The NAEA is a reputable organisation and does tremendous work promoting higher standards in the industry, but it is not a regulator. It would be unwise and confusing to give it a regulatory function in addition to the role it already fulfils.</p>

<p><a name="st_o256"><a name="07070539000464"><a name="70705-0010.htm_spnew7"><a name="07070539001613"><b>Susan Kramer:</b>
 The Minister will know from reading the new clause that it includes no mention of that organisation. I gave the NAEA as an example of an organisation that provides a qualification, which is not onerous but is recognised. It demonstrates the fact that many people who go on to become estate agents cannot reach that standard and thus cannot meet the test of competence. That is today&#146;s world.</p>

<p><a name="st_o257"><a name="07070539000465"><a name="70705-0010.htm_spnew8"><a name="07070539001614"><b>Mr. Timms:</b>
 If the hon. Lady does not have in mind an industry body for the performance of that role, which body would it be? The debate in Committee focused on the idea that it should be an industry body, so as an important rejoinder I underline the dangers attached to the route she suggests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para25"><a name="07070539000466">I accept that the discussion would be slightly different if another kind of body was involved, but the approach in the Bill is right. It is based on the work of the Office of Fair Trading. The Bill gives force to recommendations based on evidence provided by the OFT, whose study showed that the best incentive for raising standards is the threat of being taken before a redress scheme. I agree with some of the points made by the hon. Member for Cotswold; the real danger is from rogue estate agents whose problem is not competence but honesty. They know exactly what the rules are but they also know how to get round them. Handing over control to an industry body would  <br>

simply restrict entry to the profession with no guarantee of getting rid of the rogues, as the hon. Gentleman said. The clear advice from the OFT was that the cost of putting up barriers to entry, which would also be likely to raise prices for consumers, would outweigh the benefits of that approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para26"><a name="07070539000467">We are confident that requiring estate agents to belong to approved redress schemes will improve standards in the industry. We are also strengthening the enforcement powers in the Estate Agents Act 1979 so that the Bill ensures that breaches of statutory undertakings and enforcement orders under the Enterprise Act 2002, as well as the commission of specified criminal offences, can result in an investigation of an estate agent&#146;s fitness to practise, which will enable enforcers to deal more effectively with agents who rip off their customers, and take them out of the market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70705-0010.htm_para27"><a name="07070539000468">New clause 2 highlights issues about professional indemnity insurance and the handling of customers&#146; funds, and I shall comment on both. Estate agents would be unwise to trade without a minimum level of professional indemnity insurance, which is a condition of membership of the National Association of Estate Agents. It is also a condition of membership of the existing voluntary redress schemes for estate agents; for example, the ombudsman scheme for estate agents requires firms to have minimum cover of &#163;100,000 and the surveyor ombudsman scheme requires members to have cover of at least &#163;250,000. The Bill will require estate agents to belong to such schemes.</p>

 Will the Minister clarify what may have been my misreading of the Bill? Does it say anywhere in the measure that a requirement of joining a redress scheme is adequate indemnity insurance and insurance protection for clients&#146; money? Did I miss that?</p>

<p><a name="st_o259"><a name="07070539000470"><a name="70705-0010.htm_spnew10"><a name="07070539001616"><b>Mr. Timms:</b>
 The hon. Lady knows the answer. No, she did not miss it. There is no mandatory requirement in the Bill, because if the level were set too high it could operate as a barrier to market entry. I emphasise again the importance of not erecting unnecessary barriers as the impact would be to raise prices for consumers, which would be unhelpful. Nevertheless, such a requirement is a feature of the two schemes I mentioned.</p>

 A few moments ago, the Minister said he thought it would be unwise for a company to practise without such insurance. Is he comfortable with an environment in which companies are supported in their continued existence when&#151;in his view&#151;their practice is unwise? We need an answer to that important question for the industry.</p>

selling a property. Estate agents who handle money have to comply with the requirements of the 1979 Act and with the Estate Agents (Accounts) Regulations 1981. Non-compliance is an offence that can lead to prosecution in a magistrates court. Thanks to the Bill, it would be open to the consumer to seek redress for any problems they experienced with an estate agent who was handling their money, so a legislative requirement is not needed.</p>

 The debate has raised two major difficulties with the scheme proposed by the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer). The first, which has already been mentioned, is the question of who will carry out the training. We have already seen the difficulties that arose when the Government tried to get their scheme for home inspectors off the ground, so the training would probably be left to one of the existing bodies. The second real difficulty, which has not been covered in the debate, relates to the training that would be required. As chartered surveyors, my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon) and I know that it takes four years to train for that profession, and part of the training is a year&#146;s experience actually doing the job. The hon. Lady&#146;s proposal for a six-month training course would not include any training on the job, which is one of the best ways of learning how to become an estate agent.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman speaks from extensive experience and I am happy to draw attention to his expertise and that of his four chartered surveyor colleagues in the House.</p>

Member for Richmond Park, and I thank all those who contributed to the debate. The Government remain of the view that ensuring that all estate agents belong to a redress scheme, alongside tightening up the available enforcement powers, is the right approach. On that basis, I hope Members will feel able to withdraw the proposal, but if not, I urge my hon. Friends and others to vote against it.</p>

 I thank the Minister for accepting the principle that my hon.

The new NCC must be independent, and it was important to seek from the Government an assurance that there are satisfactory management and audit oversight provisions to ensure that public money is well spent. I am sure that the Minister agrees with that. The power in the original clause was wide, and there was concern over the lack of a specific mechanism to prevent the NCC from incurring significant losses on a particular business venture. We have seen that with certain educational institutions that go out into business ventures abroad. Specifically, the amendment ensures that the reasons behind any consent given by the Secretary of State will be in the public domain, thus ensuring accountability and transparency. Again, I thank the Minister for tabling it.</p>

 I beg to move amendment No. 8, page 16,  line 43, leave out subsection (4).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para0"><a name="07070539001142">The CBI has significant concerns relating to the protection of commercially sensitive information under the Bill. Under clause 24, the NCC is given wide-ranging powers to obtain information from a number of bodies, including the Office of Fair Trading and various sectoral regulators, as well as businesses. The only limitation seems to be that the information must be required for the purposes of exercising the council&#146;s functions. I am sure that the House can begin to see that the purpose of the amendment is to protect sensitive commercial information that has been demanded from a company under the powers in the Bill from reaching the public domain and thus, perhaps, some commercial competitors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07070539001143">The provisions in the Bill on disclosure of such information are contained in clause 29 and are complex. They are linked to part 9 of the Enterprise Act 2002, which includes clear safeguards against the release of consumer and competition information which has been provided to public authorities. Such safeguards were seen as essential in building business support for, and confidence in, the new enforcement regime that was established under 2002 Act. That legislation struck a careful balance between the need for enforcement authorities to seek and obtain sensitive information in the effective discharge of their functions while protecting commercial information from disclosure except under specific and deliberately narrow gateways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07070539001144">The council will need to have regard to the considerations in section 244 of the 2002 Act before disclosure. Those include the need to exclude from disclosure, as far as is practicable, commercial information which the authority thinks might significantly harm the company&#146;s legitimate business interests. However, the underlying presumption against disclosure under part 9 will not, by virtue of clause 29(4), apply to the NCC. We do not understand the justification for not applying that presumption, which is deemed necessary to prevent the release of business information by public authorities, to the council. There is a risk that commercially sensitive information could find its way into the public domain and thus to competitors. The amendment would ensure that part 9 safeguards applied to the new NCC.</p>

 The amendment would remove a necessary provision and I will therefore resist it. It is necessary for technical reasons and I hope that I can at least outline them, as I understand the concerns that the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) has about clause 29(4).</p>

to discharge its statutory functions and ensuring that it respects the confidentiality of the information that it has obtained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07070539001147">In creating the new council, we need to ensure that it can deal with not only the issues that span consumer interests generally, but the specific sectoral issues in the gas, electricity, and postal services markets. The current National Consumer Council does not exercise statutory functions and is therefore not subject to the general information disclosure provisions in the Enterprise Act 2002. Energywatch and Postwatch are subject to the specific information disclosure regimes in the Utilities Act 2000 and the Postal Services Act 2000 respectively, which apply to those bodies and to the regulators.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07070539001148">In bringing together the statutory consumer bodies in the energy and postal services sectors&#151;and in providing for the possible inclusion of the consumer body for water too, following consultation next year&#151;we have set out a single information disclosure regime for the new council instead of subjecting it to separate information regimes, depending on the source of the information. That would have resulted in complex and perhaps even unworkable provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07070539001149">The existing gateways in the Enterprise Act 2002 provide for disclosure of information by public bodies in the exercise of their functions and to facilitate the exercise of functions by another public body. However, the new council has several functions of publishing reports or information, and they are listed in clause 29(4). We concluded that, when the function was to publish information, the disclosure involved could not be said to</p>
<a name="70705-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="07070539001315"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;facilitate the exercise of the function&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07070539001150">The publication or disclosure was itself the function and so did not fit the structure of the existing part 9 of the 2002 Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07070539001151">Consequently, the regime in part 9 did not deal effectively with protecting confidential information in such cases. Subsections (5) and (6) were therefore inserted in clause 29 to provide protection. They require the council to consult the individual or business to which the information relates and to have regard to the principles in section 244 of the 2002 Act, which apply to disclosure under part 9. Those are: the public interest, the necessity for disclosure, and the need to exclude from disclosure information which might significantly harm the individual or business to which it relates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07070539001152">Those provisions draw on the existing models in the gas, electricity and postal services sectors. For example, section 19 of the Utilities Act 2000 applies to publication of information by Energywatch In each case, the general disclosure regime in the legislation is disapplied and special provision is made for the function of publication.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07070539001153">So, to give protection to business and personal information, we have included subsections (5) and (6) in clause 29, and made it clear in clause 29(4) that the prohibition on disclosure in part 9 of the Enterprise Act 2002 does not apply. The result is proper safeguards, including consultation with individuals or businesses to which the information relates, before disclosure can be made in exercising the council&#146;s functions under which information may be published.</p>

 I thank the Minister for giving way. This is a technical matter, as he says, and the official Opposition do not dispute the need for one disclosure regime for the various bodies brought together in the Bill. That is entirely understandable. What is not understandable, however, is why the careful balance established in section 244 of the Enterprise Act 2002, relating to disclosure by public bodies, has been moved in this way. There is an important balance to be struck in regard to what information is disclosed by public bodies that obtain sensitive information. We want to question carefully why that balance&#151;which has been altered by the Bill to make it easier for the public bodies covered by the Bill to disclose that information&#151;has been disturbed.</p>

<p><a name="st_o271"><a name="07070539001156"><a name="70705-0012.htm_spnew3"><a name="07070539002271"><b>Mr. Timms:</b>
 It is for technical reasons. Part 9 of the Enterprise Act cannot merely be applied here. Part 9 works when information is provided by a body in pursuit of its functions, but legally that does not work when the body in question&#151;in this case, the new council&#151;has a specific function to provide information. That is the rather technical distinction. That is why there are separate provisions in clause 29(5) and (6), which provide safeguards in the specific circumstances, and in the context, of the new council&#146;s functions. I believe that those safeguards will be effective, and that they will deal with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns.</p>

 I am not entirely satisfied with the Minister&#146;s explanation, but this is a highly technical matter.

<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1147</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para14"><a name="07070539001161">The amendment has been tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer). We have bundled two issues into this amendment: the application of the regulations to small enterprises, and the principle of best practice in the handling of complaints. Paragraph (a) is relevant to small businesses. Although it is clear that the general definition of &#147;consumer&#148; in clause 3 includes businesses&#151;or non-domestic consumers, which could include small voluntary groups, and so on&#151;there is still a gap in clause 43. Subsections (2) and (3) say that complaint-handling standards can be restricted so that they do not cover all relevant customers. In other words, Ofgem, or whoever, could say that these regulations apply only to natural persons. The amendment seeks to require their interests to be considered without reopening the wider business/consumer debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07070539001162">The Minister might say that this argument is irrelevant because clause 44 includes requirements to consult, but that is not quite right. The requirement to consult applies only to those likely to be affected by the new regulations. If the complaint-handling standards apply only to private individuals, one would have to consult people representing those consumers&#151;the energy supply companies and so on&#151;but one would not necessarily have to consult small businesses, because they would arguably not be affected by the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para16"><a name="07070539001163">The standard defence at this point is that businesses do not necessarily need protection as consumers. Indeed, consumers often need protecting from businesses. However, that argument is flawed. Why should a village shop or a charity have to be an expert in all the services that they consume? Ed Wilson of Energywatch makes the point that redress is available for small businesses and other non-domestic consumers in telecoms but not in energy. The Bill provides an opportunity to improve the situation for those consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para17"><a name="07070539001164">On a related point that goes a little beyond the amendment&#146;s scope, it seems from clause 49(3)(b) that business or other non-domestic consumers will have access to redress schemes. Lord Truscott confirmed that in the Grand Committee in the Lords on 9 January. He also said that business suppliers will not have to join redress schemes. I would be grateful if the Minister clarified that and the suggestion that the new Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform is minded to include businesses with 10 employees or fewer within the redress provisions. Approximately 96 per cent. of small businesses would be covered by that and it would be a welcome step. It does not appear to require any change to the text. Is it the Government&#146;s intention to include other non-domestic consumers such as those that I outlined?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para18"><a name="07070539001165">On complaint-handling standards, the other part of the amendment would ensure that the regulations were governed by &#147;principles of best practice&#148;, the language used in clause 49 for redress schemes. That matters because clause 49(1) was toughened up to say that the regulator &#147;must&#148; have regard to those, in the face of objections from Ofgem.

important to get best practice standards for complaint handling than it is for redress schemes as we are relying on the energy companies to fill the gap left by the abolition of Energywatch and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para19"><a name="07070539001166">Part of the reason for the difference is the series of concessions from the Government during the course of proceedings on the Bill. Those were very welcome. The language on redress schemes in clause 49 was upgraded from &#147;good&#148; to &#147;best practice&#148; in the Grand Committee in the Lords, and in Committee in the Commons the Government upgraded the requirements for the regulator to prescribe standards for complaint handling from a &#147;may&#148; to a &#147;must&#148;. In a speech that the then Minister for Trade, the right hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney), made to the National Consumer Council on 21 May, he said that he would</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07070539001167">It is difficult to square that with not wanting best practice to be the standard for complaint handling. I therefore urge the Government to accept the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_o274"><a name="07070539001168"><a name="70705-0012.htm_spnew6"><a name="07070539002274"><b>Mr. Timms:</b>
 I listened to the hon. Lady&#146;s case with interest, but the procedures that a regulator needs to follow in making regulations prescribing the standards to be met for complaint handling by regulated service providers, as set out in clause 44, are sufficiently robust. There is a requirement on a regulator to consult widely by conducting research to obtain and then take into consideration the views of a representative sample of persons likely to be affected by the regulations, and publicising the proposals in full detail to bring them to the attention of those likely to be affected, which is to a rather wider audience. In addition, the Bill provides that the regulations to be made are to be subject to the consent of the Secretary of State. Those requirements will mean that full and proper consideration will be given to proposed standards before a final decision is made by a regulator. The consultation requirement in the clause will enable all interested parties to contribute their ideas and advice on the complaint-handling standards which should be adopted, including any views on where best practice lies. It will be an open process, rather than the more restricted one about which the hon. Lady, understandably, expressed concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para21"><a name="07070539001169">The prescribed standards will relate to the handling of complaints that are made to the regulated service providers by consumers of their services. The Bill sets out in clause 42(1) the regulated gas, electricity and postal services providers that will be subject to the new complaint-handling standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="70705-0012.htm_para22"><a name="07070539001170">As for which users and customers will be covered by the standards, that is at the discretion of the regulator and can include small businesses if the regulator determines that it is appropriate that they should come within the scope. On the question of the criteria for approval of redress schemes as opposed to complaint-handling schemes, the processes are quite different. For redress schemes, it is the regulated service providers that can establish schemes and seek the approval of the regulator. Key criteria for approval are set out in clause 49, where the regulator is obliged to have regard to generally accepted principles of best practice.</p>

 These amendments relate to clauses 44 and 47, and the new redress and complaint-handling provisions to be introduced in the energy and postal services sectors, and potentially in the water sector after consultation in 2008. Those elements of the new framework for consumer representation and redress are important to the new arrangements in the Bill. A direct consequence of those new provisions is that regulated providers in the energy and postal services sectors, and potentially water, will be required to take full and proper responsibility for handling complaints from consumers of their services.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, especially as he was in full flow.

The new regulations will apply to all contracts for goods and services entered into at home, with some exceptions.

For example, they will be required to keep adequate records of their dealings with a client for a period of six years. The Bill will bring about the creation of the new national consumer council, which will be a strong and powerful advocate for consumers across all sectors. The new body will be able to represent energy and postal services consumers even more effectively than the existing arrangements.

The chair will require considerable skill to lead the new body during the transition from the framework in this Bill to the realisation of a stronger, more effective advocate for the consumer interest.

In determining its final structure, the new council will be required to take into account the recommendations of the Lyons review and the Government&#146;s objective of locating jobs outside the south-east when possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="70705-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07070539001201">Thirdly, my Department is today launching a consultation on the scope of the redress schemes proposed to be established in the energy and postal services sectors as a result of the measures in the Bill. The consultation invites views about whether all regulated providers in the gas, electricity and postal services sectors should be required to become members of a redress scheme; whether domestic consumers and&#151;to pick up the point made on Report by the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt)&#151;the smallest businesses are the right groups of consumers to have access to the schemes; and whether the schemes should handle all types of complaints from those consumers. Those developments set us well on the way to creating the new National Consumer Council, and I am glad to be able to make these announcements just as the Bill completes its passage through this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="70705-0013.htm_para15"><a name="07070539001202">In conclusion, the Government believe that the measures in the Bill will make a real difference to millions of consumers across the UK. We want consumers to be effectively represented; to be empowered with the right information to get the right deal; and to have access to redress when things go wrong. We also want rogues and villains to be removed from the market. We believe that the measures in this Bill will be effective in achieving those goals, and so I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

They are responsibilities that we intend to discharge. We have set in the Bill a mechanism by which we can oversee exactly what is taking place. It will make it as easy as possible to gain access to the people who can deal with complaints. In that spirit, I congratulate my right hon.

 It is universally agreed in the House that what we want to see in the United Kingdom is the best consumer protection in the world.

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70705-0013.htm_para23"><a name="07070539001212">We believe in strong consumer choice and freedom. We believe that information should be accessible so that people can exercise that choice. Conservatives have supported the broad thrust of the Bill, and we welcome this move by the Government. To that end, we have scrutinised the Bill in a positive and constructive way, as have the Liberal Democrats. We tabled more than 45 amendments in the Public Bill Committee alone. The Government have either accepted them or introduced amendments of their own. They introduced 11 as a direct result of that scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70705-0013.htm_para24"><a name="07070539001213">We are pleased by the bipartisan nature of the Government&#146;s conduct of this part of the business. Conservative amendments have improved the Bill both in the Commons and in another place. Our emphasis was on enhancing the accountability of the new National Consumer Council. That has included ensuring that the Minister makes public the reasons behind any approval that the Government give to the NCC to acquire a corporate body.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="70705-0013.htm_para25"><a name="07070539001214">We welcome the announcement that the Minister made in his Third Reading speech of the new chair of the NCC, Lord Whitty. He has come a long way since he was general secretary of the Labour party, and he now has a huge challenge on his hands. We wish him well because we want to make the provisions in the Bill work, especially the combining of all the functions of the consumer council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70705-0013.htm_para26"><a name="07070539001215">I welcome the fact that the NCC will have offices in three parts of the United Kingdom&#151;London, Cardiff and Belfast. I just hope that the good citizens of Scotland will not feel left out. I was delighted to follow the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and not forgetting the good citizens of Bellshill (Mr. Clarke), but I am surprised that he did not refer to the fact that none of the offices were in Scotland. I hope that his constituents will not feel left out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70705-0013.htm_para27"><a name="07070539001216">We have helped consumers by ensuring that best practice in complaints handling is followed by all energy companies. We have ensured that the new NCC better reflects the successful operation and follows the best practice of the existing council. However, on the question of estate agents and supporting consumers, we feel that the Government have been half-hearted in their approach. I know that we had a bit of banter across the Dispatch Box on Report, but the opportunity to look at the regulation and operation of estate agents has been missed. Some of the most vulnerable in our society who get involved only in the letting side of the residential market will feel left out. I am sure that that is a matter that this Government or a Government of a different colour will have to deal with in the future. So the Bill has missed an opportunity in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70705-0013.htm_para28"><a name="07070539001217">I welcome what the Minister said today&#151;that those functions laid down in the Estate Agents Act 1979 will be extended to cover activities on the web and direct sales by developers. If those activities were covered by the definition laid down in the 1979 Act, they would be covered by the redress scheme and so on in the Bill. It is a lacuna in the Bill that it does not include the lettings market, especially as it is now becoming such a big sector of the residential market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70705-0013.htm_para29"><a name="07070539001218">As my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) said on Second Reading, the Bill is important for consumers. We all recognise that.  <br>

It merges key consumer bodies and makes a serious attempt to give consumers greater rights when buying or selling their house. I pay special tribute to the work done in another place by my noble Friend Baroness Wilcox, a former chair of the NCC who is greatly knowledgeable on this subject. I pay tribute, too, to my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk) who would be handling the Bill but he cannot be in the Chamber today, as I have already explained. He played a big part in Committee. I pay tribute to all those who have taken part in the Bill&#146;s proceedings. We cannot be proud of every Bill that goes through this place, but we can be proud of this one; it is a major step forward in consumer protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70705-0013.htm_para30"><a name="07070539001219">Consumer protection is best achieved through a spirit of shared responsibility, with the Government, businesses and consumers all working together, although that is not always reflected in reality when businesses fall short of their responsibilities. As the Minister said, it is important that consumers have the means to obtain timely, efficient redress. That is the whole thrust of the Bill. If consumers cannot obtain that redress, we are all failing. It is on the basis of those principles that we approach the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70705-0013.htm_para31"><a name="07070539001220">We set out a three-point plan when we began our deliberations on the Bill. The first point was to update the definition of estate agency work to include off-plan sales, internet property intermediaries and direct home sales by house builders. As we all recognise, 28 years have passed since the original legislation came into force, and we have had more than enough discussion about estate agents to understand what is in the Bill and what is, sadly, lacking. Secondly, we want to widen the scope of the Estate Agents Act 1979 to cover lettings and the residential property market and, thirdly, to increase the penalty for rogue estate agents to a maximum of &#163;10,000. A maximum of &#163;5,000 was set in 1979 and the figure has been unchanged since. Our belief is that it no longer represents a real penalty for rogue estate agents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="70705-0013.htm_para32"><a name="07070539001221">We recognise that following the Government&#146;s farcical efforts to introduce home information packs, they will be more wary of regulation for the housing market, but as I have explained, it is important in respect of the lettings market where there are some vulnerable people. Estate agents would have largely policed HIPs, and although we have regulated HIPs we have not yet completely regulated the estate agents who will administer them. There seems to be a certain irony in that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="70705-0013.htm_para33"><a name="07070539001222">We differ from the Government in how best to ensure that complaints are dealt with quickly and effectively. Redress schemes are at the heart of the Bill, yet they are the last resort of an unhappy consumer. In the first instance, redress should be sought from the company from which goods or services were purchased. Effective complaints procedures at that stage would ensure that more complaints were resolved at the outset, which is surely a desirable objective. That would reduce rather than increase the burden on the new NCC and make for better satisfied consumers, too. Good internal complaints procedures are the best way to protect and empower consumers, yet there is little on the subject in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="70705-0014.htm_para0"><a name="07070539001223">Existing redress schemes vary greatly, from granting intermediate access to insisting on a three-month wait before the consumer can invoke the services of the ombudsman. Three months is a long time to wait and creates an opportunity for supplier companies to avoid resolving complaints quickly, knowing that the process may turn out to be too long and drawn-out for the consumer to bother pursuing things further. As Members of Parliament, we all know that unless our constituents instruct us to pursue complicated and time-consuming matters on their behalf, they tend to be deterred; they say that it is all too difficult and just go away. It would be unfortunate if that were an inadvertent effect of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="70705-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07070539001224">Conservative Members believe that companies should have in place effective internal complaints procedures to deal with consumers quickly. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton has pointed out, a similar model already exists in the financial services sector. The Financial Services Authority requires that membership of the financial ombudsman service is dependent on an organisation&#146;s having an appropriate and effective internal complaint-handling function. We hope that a similar system will be replicated by the NCC and the bodies it looks after.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="70705-0014.htm_para2"><a name="07070539001225">Initially, the Government made only a small concession towards that approach when the issue was raised in another place. The phrase they introduced in clause 49 was deliberately vague; they required regulators only to</p>
<a name="70705-0014.htm_brev0"><a name="07070539001319"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;have regard to...such principles as...the generally accepted principles of best practice&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="70705-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07070539001226">That is far from specific and far from instructive. Through guidance to the NCC, we hope that the Government can help to resolve this issue. We are pleased that they have finally accepted the arguments we made in Committee and introduced seven amendments to make it compulsory for regulators to set standards of best practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="70705-0014.htm_para4"><a name="07070539001227">Our third area of disquiet concerns the independence of the new National Consumer Council. The Government have said that they want the new NCC to be independent and for the relationship between it and the Government to be transparent and accountable. That is a laudable aim, but I fear that the text of the Bill reveals a rather different approach. Clauses 17 to 19 concern reports and advice that the NCC may produce on consumer matters. In each of the circumstances described in the Bill, there is discretion as to whether the reports are made publicly available. When the NCC itself determines that the reports shall be produced, it has discretion to publish. I think that, in this day of openness, there should, on the whole, be a presumption that the NCC should publish all reports unless, as we discussed previously on Report, they are commercially sensitive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="70705-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07070539001228">When the Government ask the NCC to report on specific matters, the Secretary of State chooses whether the public ever get to see what the NCC has to say. This is a serious matter of public accountability and transparency for the consumer. The NCC will receive public funding, but the reports that it provides to the Government are not necessarily, so it seems, to be made available to the very taxpayers who fund it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="70705-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07070539001229">As I have said, we believe that all reports produced by the NCC, unless they cover commercially sensitive information, should be automatically available to the public. That need not be a cost issue, as has been claimed. The documents could simply be made available via the NCC&#146;s website&#151;a very simple matter these days. The Minister in the other place argued against that suggestion by claiming that not all such reports would be &#147;of interest to consumers&#148;, but I fail to see how reports from a public body set up to look after consumers&#146; interests would not be of relevance and interest to consumers. I fail to work out what bizarre leap of logic produced this decision. It is not up to the Government to decide whether the reports are of interest to the consumer; it is up to consumers to decide whether they want to see the reports. If they are published on the website, they will be able to exercise just that choice. It seems a bizarre decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="70705-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07070539001230">It seems that the Government wish to use the NCC partially for their own purpose, or, at least, that could be the perception. The fact that the NCC will not have the right to publish its own reports goes to the heart of the question of whether the relationship between the Government and the NCC is sufficiently transparent. Conservative Members believe that it is essential that all such reports are published and that the NCC is perceived to be genuinely independent from the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="70705-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07070539001231">For years the NCC has been funded by the Government, but it has been unhindered in choosing for itself the focus of the work that it undertakes and then reporting on it as it wished. I hope that the Minister will agree that this is a better way to continue in the interests of empowering consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="70705-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07070539001232">We have had lengthy debates that have thoroughly examined the Bill, most of whose aims we thoroughly applaud.

handled complaints and investigated underlying issues. An excellent example was given by the right hon. Member for Coatbridge&#151;he has given me leave not to attempt to pronounce the rest of his constituency name. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Others are more able to pronounce it than I am. The work that those organisations have done to try to expose the issues surrounding energy pricing has earned them the gratitude of a large number of consumers, especially those who are most vulnerable. In many ways, those organisations have set a standard for complaint handling against which the new National Consumer Council and the whole system that has been set up under the Bill will in effect be judged. This is an opportunity for us all to pay tribute to the many individuals who have been so dedicated and have been involved in that process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="70705-0014.htm_para12"><a name="07070539001236">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt), who has supported me on the first piece of legislation that I have attempted to take through the House and who has brought so much wisdom and expertise to the issue. From the Lords, I would like to mention Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer and&#151;perhaps this is slightly unusual&#151;Lord Caithness, who sits on the Conservative Benches, but who has been quite an ally in working on the estate agent language, even if he was not necessarily supported by his own party. We value his contribution. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="70705-0014.htm_para13"><a name="07070539001237">I appreciated the positive and constructive approach taken by the right hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney). It was a pleasure to be able to raise an issue and get a straight answer and to feel that the issues that we raised were understood and taken seriously. The atmosphere that he created and the way in which he took the Bill forward have allowed this to be a constructive process and I greatly appreciate that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="70705-0014.htm_para14"><a name="07070539001238">The Government gave way on a number of issues and made a number of improvements in the course of our debates. I will touch on a few of them. In the end, they strengthened the language on sustainable development as a principle of which the new council must take note in exercising its functions. We appreciate that, even though we wish the Government had gone further, given the importance of establishing that in this era. There were many occasions when instructions to the NCC were couched in the language of &#147;may&#148; rather than &#147;must&#148;. We appreciate that there was at least one occasion when the shift from &#147;may&#148; was towards &#147;must&#148;. I am talking about the measure to require the regulator to prescribe standards for complaint handling. There was clearly a switch in the presumption of what the activity and focus of the NCC should be and we appreciated that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="70705-0014.htm_para15"><a name="07070539001239">We and others, including the Conservatives, were particularly concerned that the penalties that were initially to be levied on an estate agent who refused to join a redress scheme were so paltry as to be almost pitiful and ineffective. The penalty was set initially at &#163;500. The Government moved that to &#163;1,000, which is an improvement. The Conservatives called for &#163;3,000. We wished to have scope for a penalty as high as &#163;10,000 to be levied, particularly for multiple offenders who whenever they are challenged simply keep refusing to do as they are supposed to do and join a redress   <br>

scheme. At least there was some movement in the right direction. As the Minister will be aware, the context is that the typical fee for an estate agent from the sale of a property is &#163;3,000. We think that the penalty should at least bear some relation to the earnings from carrying out a transaction not covered by the redress scheme.</p>

 I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Lady&#146;s constructive contribution, but does she agree that, as the average sale fee is about &#163;3,000, a maximum penalty set at that amount will be wholly inadequate because it will not deter an estate agent from conducting shoddy business? The penalty should have been several times that amount.</p>

 I can only agree with the hon. Gentleman. That was our position, but his Front-Bench colleagues stuck at &#163;3,000. There was scope for more agreement on that point. If we had had free votes on several issues, we would have seen a stronger outcome in several clauses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="70705-0014.htm_para16"><a name="07070539001242">I have remaining worries as we conclude our proceedings on the Bill. I fully appreciate that the Government mean well, but there has been much discussion about how to handle complaints made by vulnerable consumers and how to ensure that they are able to get adequate compensation and a satisfactory resolution of their problems. The right hon. Member for Makerfield made it clear that he wanted the definition of a vulnerable consumer to be flexible and wide. He gave the example of a widow who might be grieving and thus unable to cope with resolving a problem with an energy company, the Royal Mail or a company covered by the Bill. His example was good, but when we pressed the Government on the way vulnerable consumers would be identified&#151;when we moved into the arena of implementation&#151;it became apparent that almost no thought had been given to the matter. The Government might have put themselves into a box from which they will be unable to deliver.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70705-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07070539001243">The NCC will receive information on consumers via the consumer voice&#151;over the telephone. If someone calls with a problem regarding an energy bill, it will be likely that the energy company&#146;s records will show whether that person is in receipt of benefits, or on a special tariff that might indicate vulnerability. However, many people will not be on benefits or a special tariff, yet will be vulnerable. In addition, the process will certainly not cover the kind of example cited by the right hon. Member for Makerfield. There will be no special tariff for a grieving widow who is in an especially difficult period of her life. If someone calls the NCC with a problem about the postal service, there will be no existing track record to reveal whether that person is vulnerable.</p>

Do we really think that someone will say on the telephone, &#147;Excuse me, but do you have a low IQ or are you vulnerable?&#148;, &#147;Have you recently been diagnosed with depression by a doctor?&#148;, &#147;Is your schizophrenia particularly active at the moment?&#148; or, &#147;Have you lost someone in the family so that you are unable to cope with complex paperwork?&#148;?

over the telephone. I have asked many times what mechanisms will be used to try to identify vulnerable consumers, but I am still waiting for an answer. I hope that the Minister will take that point on board.</p>

The Minister will be aware that 2,500 post offices will be closed over the next 18 months. Postwatch will play an essential part in enabling residents throughout the country to be consulted so that they can raise points to influence whether a closure goes through. Postwatch has a regional structure, whereas the new NCC does not. I should be grateful if the Minister confirmed the verbal assurances we have been given that Postwatch will be left largely intact until the closure process is completed. Is the Minister aware that members of Postwatch, whose role is so critical, will inevitably be distracted by whether they are about to receive a redundancy notice. Morale will be undermined, and in this critical period it will be hard to achieve the focus necessary to protect consumers and ensure that their voices are heard in the closure of their local post offices, which will have broad consequences for them and their communities.</p>

 I shall close by asking the Minister to ensure that the Bill&#146;s implementation is closely monitored. The Bill sets up a sequence of redress schemes, which, as the hon.

Consumers are unlikely to pursue a complaint to redress unless the process is easy, positive and offers encouragement. The Minister will have seen the energy supply ombudsman&#146;s forms, which are not easy to complete with the detail necessary to pursue a complaint.

Scaling up now to deal with a greater number of complaints means that the process will have to be closely monitored. Strangely enough, even though Energywatch has no power to deliver compensation, the average compensation achieved by it was &#163;125 per case.

welcome for the appointment of the chair of the new National Consumer Council. We have explored some disagreements this afternoon, and some of them were set out again in his speech and that of the hon. Lady. I am happy to join both hon. Members in their tributes to their hon.

 Towards the end of her speech, the hon. Member for Richmond Park raised an important point. We all know from our constituency work that it is difficult to succeed with the ombudsman. She quoted figures from the compensation attained by Energywatch. It would be a tragedy if the Bill led to a weakening of consumer protection, if the ombudsman redress schemes did not work properly.

 Let me say to the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis), who has drawn the short straw in having to reply for the Government, that I appreciate that, since the earlier debate ended well before its expected time, he has had to step into the breach. Under those circumstances, if I raise issues that are unfamiliar to him, will he do me the kindness of investigating them? We are considering significant matters that have an impact on some of the most vulnerable people&#151;certainly some of the most vulnerable children&#151;in our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para8"><a name="07070539001277">I want to consider a subsection of the issues that are covered by today&#146;s debate: assessment and treatment of families with severe mental health disorders. I was drawn into the matter because the Cassell hospital is in my constituency. It is a specialist hospital, which deals with, assesses and treats families with severe mental health disorders. It also assesses and treats adults and adolescents and is considered exceptional in its field. It provides a service to a vast area of southern England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para9"><a name="07070539001278">I was brought into the matter originally because the Cassell hospital had to amalgamate its adult and adolescent wards. I innocently assumed that I would come across the more general problem of cutbacks in spending on mental health that local primary care trusts&#146; financial difficulties had forced on several areas. There is an element of that, but it is not the key problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para10"><a name="07070539001279">I came to understand, through being exposed to experiences at the Cassell, that a major issue was a reinterpretation of the Children Act 1989. Section 38(6) requires:</p>
<a name="70705-0015.htm_brev4"><a name="07070539001325"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Where the court makes an interim care order, or interim supervision order, it may give such directions (if any) as it considers appropriate with regard to the medical or psychiatric examination or other assessment of the child&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para11"><a name="07070539001280">In the early days of implementing the clause, it was interpreted to mean that assessment inevitably led to treatment. In other words, when a problem was assessed and a treatment could be prescribed, it was expected that the treatment would be followed through and funded by the local authority or the PCT, whichever was appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para12"><a name="07070539001281">In 2005, a court case that was brought before the Lords of Appeal overturned that specific interpretation. Consequently, the courts concluded that the requirement to fund affected assessment but not treatment. It has changed the whole way in which families with severe mental health disorders are treated and managed in the UK. That decision by the Lords of Appeal in November 2005 reinstated the distinction between medical or psychiatric assessment and the treatment of the child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para13"><a name="07070539001282">Although that sounds like a nuance in the law, it runs foul of current practice in child psychiatry. Medical treatments under the NHS in the circumstances that we are considering are not neatly captured because psycho-social treatments are frequently the approach that needs to be taken. That is why specialist centres, such as the Cassell, are so engaged in the process.</p>

<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>5 July 2007 : Column 1166</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para14"><a name="07070539001283">Let me provide some sense of the impact of the case. A test case, generally known as Ray G, was one of the cases that shows the importance of linking assessment and treatment. It is the case of a family who were treated at the Cassell hospital. The mother was not initially able to provide the child with the care it needed, due to her own traumatic history of neglect. Initially, the child therefore had a fraught relationship with the mother.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para15"><a name="07070539001284">Under a court order, the family&#151;mother, father and child&#151;engaged in an assessment, and treatment followed that assessment. When that transition into treatment was contested by the local authority&#151;we all recognise that treatment is expensive&#151;the High Court approved the treatment and the family is now doing exceedingly well. The child is flourishing and the family remains intact. The social justification for assessment and treatment being combined is well illustrated by that instance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para16"><a name="07070539001285">Following the reinterpretation of the law, however, families can be assessed but, if the local authority chooses not to fund the treatment&#151;as they frequently do, because treatment is expensive&#151;the family is then sent back into the circumstances that caused the court to look at their case in the first place. They are returned to the local authority, where services are typically inadequate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para17"><a name="07070539001286">Another case has been brought to my attention. I do not have a pseudonym for the person concerned, so I shall not use any names. An 18-year-old mother had suffered extreme emotional and physical neglect at home, as is frequently a key factor in such cases. When she became pregnant, she hoped for something better for her child. Initially, she cared well for the baby, but as the baby grew more demanding, that care fluctuated and raised the concerns of the local authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para18"><a name="07070539001287">Mother and baby were removed to a foster care placement, but the concerns continued unabated. There were scant local resources to provide support to the mother, who had never lived away from home. She became so distraught that she threw the child on the bed in despair. The result was a court attendance and an assessment at a specialist centre&#151;the Cassell hospital, where most of my information on this issue has come from.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para19"><a name="07070539001288">There, the mother&#146;s difficult history of neglect and deprivation was gradually understood, explored and worked through, as was her wish to provide something different for her daughter. The history was so protracted as to warrant a specialist investigation. The child began to flourish, and the mother engaged well. At the end of the assessment, a recommendation for a move to treatment was made by the clinical staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para20"><a name="07070539001289">The local authority refused to fund the treatment, however, and demanded an immediate return to the original, unsafe, foster care placement that had previously proved inadequate. That was in no way supportive of the child&#146;s experience or in keeping with the welfare of the family or the child, given that it would have involved an abrupt change of setting and the loss of relationships with the staff. The mother was distraught at the thought of returning to the place in which she had not coped before. In this case, the Cassell made the decision to fund the treatment for free. As a consequence, mother and daughter are now doing well. They have returned to the community and  <br>

are out of the care system altogether. They have a positive future ahead of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para21"><a name="07070539001290">These are obviously difficult and complex cases. The Government clearly expressed their intent in supporting the original interpretation of section 38(6) of the Children Act, in which treatment followed assessment. The collective resources of the NHS and the local authorities were focused on keeping the family together and giving it a chance to recover from an environment of severe mental health disorder. It seems to me that we cannot read the Children Act or listen to the language of Ministers without believing that that is the intent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para22"><a name="07070539001291">Since the reversal of the interpretation of that section in 2005, however, the Government have taken no new action and introduced no new legislation to reinstate their original intent. The consequence has been that, in specialist hospitals such as the Cassell, families are being assessed as capable of treatment and in need of treatment, but the treatment is not being funded and the families are being returned to the local community. As I understand it, the courts themselves have now become inhibited. Judges are asking, &#147;If the treatment cannot follow the assessment, why am I sending this family for assessment in the first place?&#148; So the assessment process itself is breaking down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para23"><a name="07070539001292">When I first began to look into this matter, I thought that I was dealing with the standard funding issues relating to mental health. When this case was raised, however, I became aware that I was dealing with a piece of legislation. As I have discussed the matter with colleagues, I have begun to understand&#151;perhaps this is new only to me&#151;that I am entering a minefield of problems. We are starting to hear of cases in which children are being very easily removed from families in which mental health issues have been raised. If those issues are evident in the form of neglect or even abuse, they raise massive concerns with social services in the local authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para24"><a name="07070539001293">Rather than trying to treat the family and enable it to overcome the problems and become successful, children are simply being removed from home and put into foster care or adopted. That is surely not the purpose of the 1989 Act or the Government&#146;s intent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para25"><a name="07070539001294">My goal is to ask the Minister to become a champion for those families. I ask him to investigate what is happening on all those issues and to consider amending the law so that its original purpose and original interpretation, with which the Government were satisfied, is reinstated. I also ask him to go further and take up the issue of families with severe mental health disorders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para26"><a name="07070539001295">The Minister will be well aware that when children are removed from a family, even the most difficult family, it is a highly traumatic experience. Many would argue that there is almost no way to repair the damage that is done to a child who is removed. Sometimes it is inevitably the necessary and better option, but there is a general agreement, both across most of the professions and in the language used by the Government, that if the family can be helped to recover and restore itself to a positive environment, that is better for the child and family as a whole. That is why I took the opportunity offered by this debate to raise such issues.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) on securing the debate. It may well be that the problem affects a relatively small number of families in our society, but that does not make it any less important. Enduring and severe mental health issues are a challenge for the individual child and young person&#146;s development, but they can also have a major effect on family dynamics, and relationships. We should be trying to create a system that not only assesses but treats a family holistically and does everything that it can to support a family to get through and to cope with those psychiatric or psychological problems, enabling the family to remain together. Unfortunately, in some circumstances it is in the interests of both the child and the family for the child or young person to be removed from that home environment. However, in many circumstances, with the right preventive and holistic support, that child and young person can be supported to remain within the family environment.</p>

It has changed some of the decisions that have been made within the health service in terms not only of the assessment but of the treatment of families in such circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para28"><a name="07070539001298">In recent times&#151;I should put the matter in context&#151;we have made major progress in respect of mental health services for children and young people. Child and adolescent mental health services teams have built up in every part of the country, from a very low base, after the Government set a target and, as a result, there is a much more comprehensive range of child and adolescent mental health services in every community. The Mental Health Bill, which finally passed all its stages in this House yesterday, deals with age-appropriate treatment for young people with mental health problems. That is another advance with regard to mental health provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para29"><a name="07070539001299">I acknowledge, however, that the hon. Lady has identified an anomaly and possibly an unintended consequence. The ministerial team at the Department of Health has undergone a major change, so it is not entirely clear who will be responsible for which policy area, but that will be finalised today or tomorrow. I assure the hon. lady, however, that I will take responsibility for ensuring that the Department looks specifically at the consequences of the court judgment, its impact on the way services have related to families and, where appropriate and necessary, that the Department makes changes to ensure that those families have access to the kind of treatment that would give them the best chance of getting through those difficult and stressful life experiences and coming out of the other end with as decent a life as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="70705-0015.htm_para30"><a name="07070539001300">I do not want to go on any longer than is necessary. The hon. Lady has raised an issue of import and significance and I give her and the House a commitment that we will take it seriously and respond directly to her in the next few weeks on the progress that we have been able to make.</p>
