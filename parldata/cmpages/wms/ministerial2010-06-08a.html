 The coalition's programme for Government set out the Government's belief that a vibrant media sector is crucial for our well-being and quality of life. The Government's intention is to create the conditions that will allow enterprise to flourish in a way that avoids over-regulation or over-subsidy. I am therefore today announcing:</p>

The Government propose to take this forward in two areas: (i) backing the commitment to make a service level of 2Mbps available to those parts of the country still without a basic level of access; (ii) announcing three rural market testing projects that will bring superfast broadband to rural areas.</p>

 The Sea Fish Industry Authority (Seafish), is a UK-wide, levy-funded non-departmental public body established by the Fisheries Act 1981. It has a statutory duty to promote the efficiency of the sea fish industry as a whole. It is jointly sponsored by the four fisheries administrations in the UK.</p>

The result was to significantly reduce its levy income.</p>

 I am announcing today a review of motorcycle tests in Great Britain. The new two-part motorcycle test that was introduced in April 2009 has clearly led to some concern among motorcycle groups, particularly about the safety of the off-road module 1 part of the test and about the difficulty of accessing the limited number of off-road test centres. The new test was introduced in order to meet the requirements of the second EU directive on driving licences. While most  <br>

elements in the module 1 test are required by the directive, there may be scope for us to make some changes to the way in which the test is carried out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="100608m0001.htm_para8"><a name="10060833000026">We will be working with the motorcycle community and road safety groups to look again at the current form of the motorcycle test.

Views should be submitted to the Department for Transport (RUSD4consultation@dft.gsi.gov.uk) by 31 July. We aim to conclude the review by the autumn.</p>
