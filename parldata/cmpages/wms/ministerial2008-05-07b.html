<p><a name="st_78"><a name="08050766000013"><a name="80507m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="08050766000059"><b>The Minister for Local Government (John Healey):</b>
 Earlier this year Parliament approved orders creating, from 1 April 2009, nine new unitary councils for the seven areas of Bedfordshire, Cheshire, Cornwall, Durham, Northumberland, Shropshire and Wiltshire. I explained to the House during debates on these orders the approach we intended to adopt for the transfer and appointment of staff to these new councils. Today, I am confirming these arrangements and publishing draft regulations and draft guidance, which cover both the transfer of staff to the new councils and the appointment of the chief executives and other senior managers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="80507m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08050766000014">We have developed this approach in consultation with the councils concerned, the local government employers and the trade unions, based originally on our discussion document of August 2007, &#147;Councils&#146; Proposals for Unitary Local Government: An Approach to Implementation&#148;. Today we are sending to these interested parties drafts of the regulations and draft guidance, inviting any further comments on the detailed drafting over the next two weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="80507m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08050766000015">I plan to make staffing regulations which will apply the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE) to any transfers of staff occurring as a result of local government reorganisation. The staffing regulations will also require the post of chief executive (head of paid service) of each new unitary authority to be recruited by means of open competition, to be held by 1 April 2010 at the latest. Furthermore, our planned guidance makes clear that the Government expect to see open competition as the means of recruiting to all other senior management board posts, unless there are clear and specific circumstances on the basis of which the council considers there is a compelling case for an alternative approach, which would not detract from both the reality and the perception of the authority being genuinely new.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="80507m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08050766000016">We believe that this approach will create a clear and consistent framework for the transfer and appointment of staff to all the new unitary councils, which will give both the level of reassurance staff rightly need and expect over their employment, and the flexibility the new councils need to establish innovative arrangements for empowering local communities and delivering improved local public services. Whilst recognising concerns about continuity, particularly through the transition period, the importance that we attach to open competition for senior management board appointments is a recognition of how the new councils will need senior officers with new skills, experiences and perspectives if they are to take full advantage of the opportunities they have to become genuine flagship councils for the future of local government.</p>

 I am, with the Minister of State, Department for Children Schools and Families, my right hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston (Beverley Hughes), today announcing improvements to the way that the Government measure their performance in reducing reoffending. The statistics will focus on how many reoffences are committed and how many of those are serious offences. The delay in reporting adult reoffending statistics will be reduced. This broader range of information on reoffending rates, will allow for better, more timely analysis of reoffending and ultimately help to reduce crime and make communities safer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="80507m0001.htm_para11"><a name="08050766000032">The Government currently measure the proportion of offenders who reoffend within a given period (two years for adults, one year for juveniles) following either their conviction where a community sentence is given, or release from prison where a custodial sentence is given. The reoffending rate is then compared against a predicted rate. The predicted rate is based on how statistically likely offenders are to reoffend, based on factors such as age and criminal history. If the actual rate of reoffending is lower than the predicted rate, then reoffending has fallen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="80507m0001.htm_para12"><a name="08050766000033">This measure has been helpful in providing an accurate picture of the difference that work to reduce reoffending has made to reoffending rates. We will continue to monitor progress using predicted rates and measure progress against the 2002 spending review target that covers the years 2000-06. The target data will be published in autumn 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="80507m0001.htm_para15"><a name="08050766000036">While the current regime measures whether a known offender reoffends or not, the new metric focuses on how many reoffences an offender commits. The new headline measure will monitor the frequency of reoffences per 100 offenders (in the cohort). This will provide a better measure of our impact with those offenders who cause most damage to communities through committing most crime. In addition we will measure the frequency per 100 offenders of reoffences which are classified as serious, such as violence against the person (including grievous bodily harm, murder and manslaughter) and serious sexual offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="80507m0001.htm_para16"><a name="08050766000037">The new measures look beyond simply whether some one reoffends or not and reflects the balance between serious and prolific reoffenders, offenders who commit a small number of reoffences and those who do not reoffend at all.</p>

recorded has been reduced from two years to one year. The time allowed for convictions to be made and processed has also been reduced from nine months to six months.

We will also continue to publish a reoffending rate that compares the actual and predicted rates.</p>

 Over the past decade Britain&#146;s roads have become much safer. The number of people killed or seriously injured in road accidents has fallen by a third, keeping road travel in this country safer than almost anywhere else in the world.</p>
