 Tomorrow my Department is publishing a formal response to the consultation on how Government Departments, Regional Development Agencies, local authorities and non-departmental public bodies should support business in the future. This looks not just at the support my Department provides, but much more broadly across the whole of government at a national, regional and local level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="71218m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07121859000030">The formal response document builds on the initial Government response to the &#147;Simplifying Business Support&#148; consultation. It summarises responses received and provides further information on the future, shared framework for publicly funded business support we are developing in the light of evidence and consultation feedback. This shared framework will enable Government and the broader public sector to implement our vision for business support in 2010.</p>

Business Link will continue to be developed as the primary publicly funded access channel to business support. In the spirit of simplification, Business Link will aim to build on best practice partnership working with local authorities, business support providers, business membership organisations and other key partners.</p>

This is the process that we set out in the consultation document &#147;Means of Prioritising Proposals&#148; issued in June 2007. She has therefore decided to confirm her earlier &#147;minded to&#148; decision, and accordingly intends to implement the proposal for two unitary authorities in Cheshire by order made under section 7 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007.</p>

Local people will rightly expect nothing less than their successful delivery.</p>

This consultation fulfils the promise made in our strategy &#147;Securing the UK Border&#148; published in March 2007 to consult on four main categories of visitor: tourist, business, short-term student and family. Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

The points-based system will ensure that only those the UK needs will be able to come here to work, study or train and we are currently consulting on new arrangements for marriage visas, including whether to introduce an English language requirement.

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="71218m0002.htm_para13"><a name="07121859000107">The consultation contains a number of options to ensure that the system is fit for the 21st century. These include reducing the maximum leave available to tourists from six to three months; introducing a UK-based sponsor for visitors travelling to see family in the UK, requiring this sponsor to put up a financial deposit to guarantee that their family member will leave the UK at the end of their stay and reforming appeal rights for these visitors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"><a name="71218m0002.htm_para14"><a name="07121859000108">The consultation period will run for 12 weeks and the final date for responses is 7 March 2008.

Incorrect figures were used in a small number of other instances in reply to members&#146; questions and in another place. However, I was informed on Friday 14 December by the LSC that the correct figure is 2.3 million and that the mistake was due to a computer programming error which has now been detected and rectified.
