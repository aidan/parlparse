<p><a name="st_9"><a name="09112437000156"><a name="91124m0005.htm_spmin0"><a name="09112437000531"><b>The Minister for Housing (John Healey):</b>
 The Government have recognised the serious global risks from climate change and have set in legislation a challenging target to reduce UK carbon emissions by 80 per cent. against 1990 levels by 2050. Emissions from the way we heat, cool and power buildings are important in achieving this target: 17 per cent. of UK emissions are from non-domestic buildings and 27 per cent. from homes. The scale of the challenge means that we need to find ways of reducing emissions from all types of building as part of the UK's transition to a low carbon economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="91124m0005.htm_para16"><a name="09112437000157">I am today reaffirming the Government's commitment to the ambition for all new non-domestic buildings to be zero carbon from 2019, and publishing a consultation document that sets out policy principles and options for meeting this ambition. I am also setting out our plans for how new public sector buildings could lead the way, building on the work of a cross-departmental task force of government officials. We are seeking views on these options and their implications for viability for individual developments and sectors. The consultation closes on 26 February 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="91124m0005.htm_para17"><a name="09112437000158">This follows my statement in July, when I confirmed the Government's policy that all new homes will be zero carbon from 2016 and announced further details on the definition and standards we will legislate for. One in three of Britain's homes in 2050 will be built between now and then. So today I am also providing an update on the definition and measurement of zero carbon homes, following the report of a specialist task group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="91124m0005.htm_para18"><a name="09112437000159"><i>Zero carbon non-domestic buildings</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="91124m0005.htm_para19"><a name="09112437000160">In December 2008 we published a consultation on options to meet the definition of zero carbon, which included some initial thinking about what this could mean for non-domestic buildings. I am announcing today our more detailed proposals and the next steps needed to enable new commercial buildings to be zero carbon from 2019.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="91124m0005.htm_para20"><a name="09112437000161">We will adopt the broad framework for zero carbon that has been developed for homes, but adapted appropriately to reflect the differences in the non-domestic buildings market and the variation between non-domestic buildings. This means that, as supported by responses to the 2008 consultation, we will be using the threefold hierarchy of energy efficiency, followed by onsite or linked low and zero carbon technologies ("carbon compliance"), followed by primarily offsite "allowable solutions".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="91124m0005.htm_para21"><a name="09112437000162">The policy will also reflect the important differences in non-domestic buildings, including the much wider variation in building types, locations, and uses, which can impact on both potential solutions and costs. We are therefore proposing that new non-domestic buildings should improve through an approach with differentiated targets to reflect the different potential different buildings have for energy efficiency and for onsite levels of carbon abatement. The consultation seeks views on this approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="91124m0005.htm_para22"><a name="09112437000163">Non-domestic buildings often have greater potential for onsite renewables (for example, more roof space) and to play a central role in the viability of community heat or energy networks. We need to determine the extent to which we encourage use of these opportunities,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Nov 2009">

and the consultation covers these questions. Onsite heat and energy generation will also be eligible for financial assistance under Government incentive schemes for small-scale renewable generation, providing future income streams.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="91124m0005.htm_para23"><a name="09112437000164">Any carbon not mitigated onsite will be dealt with through a range of good quality 'allowable solutions'. We are proposing that we will bring in some allowable solutions from 2016, alongside the approach for homes, and thus develop a single system for delivery and assurance. This early deployment could help to increase the volume and therefore viability of the allowable solutions market in its early years, and could increase the opportunities for non-domestic developments to contribute to community energy solutions. I have said that I will make a further announcement later about the allowable solutions that will be included.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="91124m0005.htm_para24"><a name="09112437000165">For non-domestic buildings, the variation in energy uses is considerably greater than for homes-reflecting the range of different uses for individual building types as well as the range of energy-intensity of different commercial activity. As a minimum, the zero carbon standard for non-domestic buildings will include 100 per cent. of energy uses currently covered by the Building Regulations (principally space heating, cooling and internal lighting). We are considering in addition a simplified way of accounting for ongoing energy use in the building (such as machinery, refrigeration, or computers), through requiring either 10 or 20 per cent. extra improvement on top of regulated energy. The consultation seeks views on this and its potential impact on market viability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="91124m0005.htm_para25"><a name="09112437000166">The public sector can play a significant role in supporting market development of low and zero carbon buildings. We confirm our ambition from Budget 2008 that the public sector should aim to make the move to zero carbon for new non-domestic buildings by 2018, one year ahead of commercial buildings. The consultation sets out our proposals for a work programme to deliver this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="91124m0005.htm_para26"><a name="09112437000167">I have placed a copy of the consultation document and the detailed impact assessment that accompanies it in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="91124m0005.htm_para28"><a name="09112437000169">I announced in July that I would set up a specialist task group to examine the energy efficiency metrics and standards that should be part of zero carbon homes, in order to realise our ambition for the highest practical energy efficiency level realisable in all dwelling types.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="91124m0005.htm_para29"><a name="09112437000170">Following an intensive period of analysis and wider involvement of industry, commercial and environmental bodies, the task group has now reported to me.

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="91124m0005.htm_para30"><a name="09112437000171">The recommendations are for an energy standard that is measured as the amount of energy required to provide space heating and cooling. The proposed standard is 46 kilowatt-hours per square metre per year (kWh/m<sup>(2)</sup>/year) for semi-detached and detached homes and 39 kWh/m<sup>(2)</sup>/year for all other homes. The further details of what that means are set out in the task group's report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="91124m0005.htm_para31"><a name="09112437000172">I am satisfied that the task group's recommendations strike the right balance between a high level of ambition and a standard that can be realised in practice by 2016. I therefore intend to use this standard within the definition of zero carbon homes. I will be using our forthcoming  <br>

consultation on updating the Code for Sustainable Homes to check that there are no unintended consequences from this standard and to seek views on the energy efficiency standard to be adopted in 2013. By aligning our approach to energy efficiency and zero carbon within the Code, we will smooth the transition to zero carbon homes in 2016.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="91124m0005.htm_para32"><a name="09112437000173">The task group has made a number of additional recommendations for further research and modelling to support the proposed energy standard. I shall be taking these recommendations forward, in collaboration with the Zero Carbon Hub and other relevant research and industry bodies. One of the particular recommendations is that industry will need design guidance to support the standard. I recognise that industry will need such guidance and will work with industry to produce this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="91124m0005.htm_para33"><a name="09112437000174">I can also announce that the Government-funded Technology Strategy Board is allocating £3.2 million of funding to boost long-term research into how we design and build low carbon homes. The research will use new technologies and materials to provide valuable evidence for future standards and how to drive down energy bills. This funding is part of the Technology Strategy Board's £50 million Low Impact Buildings Innovation Platform, which is being allocated to projects in the period to 2011. The money will be used by a consortium-including Barratt Developments, Crest Nicholson, Stewart-Milne, H + H Celcon, Oxford Brookes University and the Building Research Establishment-to build demonstration homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="91124m0005.htm_para34"><a name="09112437000175">These homes will be built without the use of on-site renewables so as to test just how far it is possible to go towards zero carbon through energy efficient fabric measures alone and the implications of doing so. Having designed and built the homes, they will be monitored to find out the energy savings that occupants realise in practice and to learn more about the occupants' experience of living in highly energy efficient homes. The lessons we learn from these homes will be valuable evidence to support the way that the zero carbon homes of the future are built.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="91124m0008.htm_para5"><a name="09112456000023">On economic and financial issues, I noted the importance of addressing the issues of most concern to citizens, especially jobs and economic growth. I also said that the UK was in favour of more and better international financial supervision so long as this protected the fiscal autonomy of member states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="91124m0008.htm_para6"><a name="09112456000024">Ministers' discussion of climate change focussed on the Copenhagen conference on 7-18 December. The Presidency concluded that the EU position remained as agreed by Heads at the October European Council.</p>

The paper set out four priorities: creating value by basing growth on knowledge; empowering people and fighting exclusion; creating a competitive greener economy; and making Europe mobile and connected. The paper proposed that the European Council should steer the strategy and set objectives, and the Commission should undertake a yearly review of progress. The Presidency sought views on these ideas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="91124m0008.htm_para12"><a name="09112456000030">I noted the need to draw a line under the process of treaty reform so that the Union could address the issues of most concern to citizens across Europe, namely jobs, competitiveness with emerging economies and individual economic opportunities. Member states needed to address these issues in a united fashion, maintaining the fiscal stimulus until such time as growth was established. I said that the Government supported the Commission's paper, except for two points: we wanted it to emphasise more clearly the need to open markets yet further and to avoid protectionism; and to promote and deepen the single market.</p>

and monitoring of the strategy could be improved. The Commission confirmed that four priorities had emerged since their communication was published in July: the move to a low carbon, low input economy; protection of biodiversity, water and other natural resources; social inclusion; and the international dimension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="91124m0008.htm_para16"><a name="09112456000034">The Presidency concluded that it would take Ministers' views into account in its preparations for the December European Council.

I stressed that it was important to maintain a regular and respectful dialogue with Russia, but that the EU should be robust in defending its interests and speaking with one voice to send clear messages. Following a wide-ranging discussion, the Presidency concluded that the priorities for the Summit were: climate change, energy, WTO/trade issues, human rights and the common neighbourhood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="91124m0008.htm_para24"><a name="09112456000042"><i>Ukraine</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="91124m0008.htm_para25"><a name="09112456000043">The Presidency said that at the EU-Ukraine Summit on 4 December they would urge Ukraine: to get the IMF Programme back on track; to ensure funding mechanisms were in place to pay its gas bills; to conduct free and fair Presidential elections; and as soon as possible to undertake constitutional reform. I stressed the need to push Ukraine hard on compliance with the conditions attached to the IMF programme.</p>

The Presidency said the EU needed to continue working on how it could practically support a settlement, in case prospects improved, and continue to support the Fayyad Plan. The Government broadly support the Presidency's approach.</p>

<a name="91124m0009.htm_brev4"><a name="09112456000359"><ul><p class="tabletext">First, we will only apply this change to advertising campaigns that start on or after 14 December. Businesses that have already run advertisements will not need to do so again to meet the new requirement.</p>
</ul><a name="91124m0009.htm_brev5"><a name="09112456000360"><ul><p class="tabletext">Secondly, while we will require all jobs to be advertised for four weeks before a migrant worker can be appointed, we will not require the four weeks to be continuous. This will mean that businesses will not need to advertise all their vacancies for four weeks on the off-chance that no suitable resident workers apply and they need to recruit a migrant worker. For example, we will allow businesses to advertise skilled jobs for two weeks initially. If a suitable resident worker applies, the business can appoint them straight away. However, if no suitable resident workers apply, the resident labour market must be tested for a further two weeks before they can appoint a migrant worker.</p>

 I would like to update the House on the humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka. Six months ago the end of the conflict in Sri Lanka created almost 280,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs). I visited Sri Lanka in early October and advocated freedom of movement for the IDP population who continue to be held in closed camps. At the time of my visit, this population numbered almost 253,000 people. I would like to reiterate that meeting the humanitarian needs of the IDPs remains the most immediate priority for the UK Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="91124m0010.htm_para0"><a name="09112456000288">I welcome the recent announcement by the Government of Sri Lanka of their intention that all IDPs will have total freedom of movement from 1 December in the camps in Sri Lanka. It will be important that humanitarian agencies have access to fully meet the needs of the IDPs who choose to remain in the camps until they can return to their homes or go to host families. Approximately 130,000 IDPs still remain in these camps. Conditions  <br>

remain basic but have improved since the separate visits to Sri Lanka earlier this year by the Foreign Secretary, a cross-party group of MPs led by Des Browne as well as my own previous visits in April and October. The monsoon has now started and it is raining heavily. Many of the temporary shelters are deteriorating and there is a risk that flooding will occur. With freedom of movement then it would be much more acceptable for humanitarian agencies to be able to improve conditions in the camps and support any moves to make them genuine welfare villages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="91124m0010.htm_para1"><a name="09112456000289">I also join with the UN to welcome the recent progress made by the Government of Sri Lanka over the last four weeks in returning the IDPs from the closed camps in Vavuniya to their home areas. As of 20 November, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that over 132,000 IDPs have now either returned to their home areas or have been released to institutions or host families elsewhere. The majority of those returning to their homes have been to Jaffna. Returns are now starting to other areas in the Vanni such as Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="91124m0010.htm_para2"><a name="09112456000290">However, I also have concerns. The pace of returns is increasingly limited by the challenge of ensuring that areas are free from land mines and unexploded ordnance. I am pleased that we are helping to meet this challenge by funding the work of two British demining NGOs-the HALO Trust and Mine Action Group-to help make areas safe again. A further concern is that not all returnees enjoy unrestricted freedom of movement outside of their immediate home areas. Moreover, in some areas where the IDPs have been able to return home, humanitarian access for agencies to assist them is still restricted. This is making it unnecessarily hard to meet the basic needs of returning IDPs. I urge the Government of Sri Lanka to co-operate fully with all concerned humanitarian agencies so that they can undertake their usual assistance and protection activities, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="91124m0010.htm_para3"><a name="09112456000291">DFID continues to support the relief effort to Sri Lanka as the situation on the ground allows. Since September 2008, we have committed £12.5 million. Last week I approved a further £1 million from this budget to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to support the safe and dignified return of IDPs to their home areas. This grant will help provide transport, emergency shelters, temporary health clinics, immediate access to high quality water and sanitation facilities and livelihoods support for the returning IDP population. It will also allow IOM to extend their existing IDP registration programme to all IDPs. This registration programme was originally supported by DFID in April and is an essential part of enabling returning IDPs to access basic services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="91124m0010.htm_para4"><a name="09112456000292">We have always made it clear that the IDP camps should not be anything other than temporary in nature. During my recent visit, I confirmed that once the critical monsoon season is over DFID will only fund-life-saving emergency interventions in the existing closed camps. The focus of our funding will shift further towards early recovery activities in the area of demining, support to the returns process and livelihood recovery. Once again, I would like to reassure the House that all DFID funding is provided directly to neutral and impartial international agencies. Some £2.87 million remains to be committed as the situation on the ground allows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="91124m0010.htm_para5"><a name="09112456000293">Looking forward, we recognise the progress that the Government of Sri Lanka have made towards their own original target of returning 80 per cent. of the IDPs  to their areas of origin by the end of the year. After  26 years of intermittent conflict, there remains an additional 214,000 long-term displaced people to consider who may now also wish to return to their home areas. It is important that the Government of Sri Lanka addresses the needs of all IDPs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="91124m0010.htm_para6"><a name="09112456000294">Our other priority since the end of the conflict has been to urge the Government to make a concerted effort to secure lasting peace by working for genuine reconciliation between Sri Lanka's communities. Our view remains that this can only be achieved through a fully inclusive political settlement that addresses the legitimate grievance and aspirations of all communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="91124m0010.htm_para7"><a name="09112456000295">The British Government continue to engage fully with the Government of Sri Lanka as well as international and multilateral partners. The Foreign Secretary discussed these issues with the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister when they last spoke on 4 November. Our High Commissioner to Sri Lanka regularly raises our concerns with senior members of the Sri Lankan Government. The UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Sir John Holmes, visited Sri Lanka on 17 and 19 November and concluded that returns must be both voluntary and informed. He also welcomed the Government of Sri Lanka's assurance regarding their commitment to ensuring full freedom of movement for IDPs. I spoke to Sir John Holmes yesterday about the humanitarian situation going forwards and the international response, and reiterated the UK priority of freedom of movement for the IDP population. I also welcomed the progress that has been made to date by the Government of Sri Lanka in returning the IDPs from the camps to their homes.</p>

However, abolition of the Edited Register could have an impact on those businesses, charities and others that currently use it.
