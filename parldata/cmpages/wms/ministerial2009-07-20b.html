 My noble Friend, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (Lord Mandelson) has made the following statement:</p>
<a name="90720m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="09072018000260"><ul><p class="tabletext">This Government are committed to expanding higher education.</p>
</ul><a name="90720m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="09072018000261"><ul><p class="tabletext">There are currently record numbers of students in higher education with 300,000 additional students in the system since 1997. Government spending on higher education is over 25 per cent. higher in real terms than in 1997. By contrast, funding fell by 36 per cent. under the previous Government.</p>
</ul><a name="90720m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="09072018000262"><ul><p class="tabletext">Our expansion of higher education is more important now than ever before, as we continue to invest in developing a highly skilled work force that is well placed to win the jobs the future economy will offer.</p>
</ul><a name="90720m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="09072018000263"><ul><p class="tabletext">Demand for places this year is unprecedented, demonstrating that people continue to see higher education as a good investment and a valuable route to a good job and rewarding career.</p>
</ul><a name="90720m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="09072018000264"><ul><p class="tabletext">We want to support all those with the aspiration and ability to succeed in higher education. Work with the sector indicates there are institutions able to recruit more students to meet the increased demand without compromising the quality of their offer.</p>
</ul><a name="90720m0001.htm_brev5"><a name="09072018000265"><ul><p class="tabletext">Therefore an extra 10,000 higher education places will be made available to universities this year to support more students in going to higher education this year.</p>
</ul><a name="90720m0001.htm_brev6"><a name="09072018000266"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Government will pay the student support costs for extra places in courses related to the new industry, new jobs agenda such as science, technology, engineering and maths&#151;areas which will equip young people with the skills they need for the jobs of the future.</p>
</ul><a name="90720m0001.htm_brev7"><a name="09072018000267"><ul><p class="tabletext">The package will fund the financial support for these students, which includes, for full-time students the fee loans to cover the cost of the tuition fees charged by institutions.</p>
</ul><a name="90720m0001.htm_brev8"><a name="09072018000268"><ul><p class="tabletext">Institutions wishing to take additional students will be able to charge students on full-time courses in England up to &#163;3,225 in tuition fees in 2009-10, the same as for other students. A tuition fee loan is available to eligible students to cover the full cost of the fee.</p>
</ul><a name="90720m0001.htm_brev9"><a name="09072018000269"><ul><p class="tabletext">No additional teaching grant from HEFCE will accompany these additional students. It is for universities to manage their own admissions and we are confident that many will want to offer high quality places to students on this basis.</p>
</ul><a name="90720m0001.htm_brev10"><a name="09072018000270"><ul><p class="tabletext">This is a fiscally neutral change&#151;the costs of supporting the extra students will be met through reprioritising existing budgets and reducing the optional five year holiday on repayment of student loans to two years.</p>
</ul><a name="90720m0001.htm_brev11"><a name="09072018000271"><ul><p class="tabletext">The repayment holiday on student loans was announced in July 2007. All students starting a higher education course in 2008-09 or later, taking out their first student loan and having a repayment start date of April 2012 or later are entitled to a repayment holiday. The intention is to help borrowers to manage their finances if there are other changes in their lives. Qualifying borrowers will now be offered the choice of putting their student loan repayments on hold for up to two years as opposed to up to five years as announced in July 2007.</p>

 My noble Friend the Minister for Postal Affairs and Employment Relations (Lord Young of Norwood Green) has made the following statement.</p>
<a name="90720m0001.htm_brev16"><a name="09072018000276"><ul><p class="tabletext">I am pleased to announce that the Government will shortly be launching the new compensation scheme for former trawlermen who fished in Icelandic waters.</p>
</ul><a name="90720m0001.htm_brev17"><a name="09072018000277"><ul><p class="tabletext">Under this scheme, we will calculate the aggregate time served by each trawlerman during the last 20 years of their career on vessels that fished in Icelandic waters, and make additional payments whenever the payment due under this calculation exceeds the total already paid to them under the two previous compensation schemes. Claimants will only be eligible for payments where they can meet a qualifying test which requires two years&#146; aggregate service on vessels that fished in Icelandic waters during the four years of the cod wars, or the last four years of a trawlerman&#146;s career if he left the industry before 31 December 1976.</p>
</ul><a name="90720m0001.htm_brev18"><a name="09072018000278"><ul><p class="tabletext">This approach will direct additional payments to those people who were disadvantaged under the previous scheme, because they had long Icelandic careers, but received reduced payments or no payments at all as a consequence of the breaks rule, which the parliamentary ombudsman criticised in her 2007 report.</p>
</ul><a name="90720m0001.htm_brev19"><a name="09072018000279"><ul><p class="tabletext">We will consider claims from anyone that applied under the previous schemes, or from anyone that has not applied previously where they can submit good and reliable documentary evidence supporting their claim. We have agreed to add an extra vessel to the original list of Icelandic vessels and will consider the case for adding further vessels, assessing any evidence submitted against criteria based on that used under the previous scheme.</p>
</ul><a name="90720m0001.htm_brev20"><a name="09072018000280"><ul><p class="tabletext">We plan to formally launch the scheme on 31 July. At launch, we will announce the scheme through local newspapers in each of the ports concerned; establish a helpline to deal with queries and issue copies of the application forms and scheme rules; and place this information on the BIS website: www.bis.gov.uk. We will also write to everyone that replied to the recent consultation paper. We will allow nine months from launch for people to submit claims. However, no payments will be made until the vessels list has been finalised.</p>
</ul><a name="90720m0001.htm_brev21"><a name="09072018000281"><ul><p class="tabletext">We believe this scheme represents a fair and equitable way forward. It has been designed to meet the concerns raised by the parliamentary ombudsman in connection with the previous scheme, and will enable an estimated 1,000 former trawlermen to receive additional payments totalling around &#163;5 million to &#163;10 million.</p>

 I am today laying before Parliament, the annual European Community Finances White Paper &#147;Statement on the 2009 EC budget and measures to combat fraud and financial mismanagement&#148; (Cm 7640). This White Paper is the 29th in the series. It gives details of revenue and expenditure in the 2009 EC budget and covers recent developments in EC financial management and measures to counter fraud against the EC budget. It also includes updated details on the own resources decision, the UK consolidated statement on the use of EU funds in the UK, and new text on the European economic recovery plan.</p>

 Tax credits are delivering guaranteed minimum incomes for working families and families with children, reducing child poverty, and improving work incentives. In these tough economic times they provide support to 20 million people including around 6 million families and 10 million children. Take-up is now higher than for any previous system of income-related financial support for in-work families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="90720m0001.htm_para4"><a name="09072018000051">Against this backdrop HM Revenue and Customs has today published its estimate of error and fraud in tax credits for 2007-08. The collection, analysis and publication of this data help inform efforts to strengthen the administration of the programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="90720m0001.htm_para5"><a name="09072018000052">The analysis&#151;based on a sample of 4,100 cases&#151;estimates error and fraud at 8.6 per cent. of finalised tax credit entitlements for 2007-08. This comprises error favouring the claimant at 7.8 per cent. of finalised entitlements, and fraud at 0.7 per cent. This compares with the 2006-07 central estimate of error and fraud at 7.8 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="90720m0001.htm_para6"><a name="09072018000053">The Government are determined to reduce the incidence of error and fraud in tax credits. In July of last year, the Government set HM Revenue and Customs a target to reduce the combined levels of error and fraud in tax   <br>


<meta name="Date" content="20 July 2009">

<notus-date day="20" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>20 July 2009 : Column 90WS</b><br>
credits to no more than 5 per cent. of finalised entitlement by the end of March 2011. HMRC is committed to delivering to achieve this target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="90720m0001.htm_para7"><a name="09072018000054">At the same time HMRC also published a new strategy for reducing error and fraud. By using the Department&#146;s improved understanding of risks, and of customer needs, it has already introduced additional checks and interventions tailored to help prevent error entering the system while ensuring those who abuse the system are caught. HMRC has also been embedding this deeper understanding of customer behaviour into its entire compliance programme, deploying resources to areas of greatest risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="90720m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09072018000055">By helping customers to get their claim right from the outset, and to keep their award on track, HMRC is reducing the risk of loss and improving customer service. Through the tax credits transformation programme it is now offering better support to customers&#151;for example, HMRC is helping new customers to make their claim accurately, tailoring the level of extra support to their particular needs. The Department is also contacting large numbers of customers to check that their tax credits award remains up-to-date throughout the year and continues to reflect their current circumstances. Additional assistance is also being provided to some vulnerable customers when they renew their claims. Overall HMRC is contacting over 500,000 customers this year offering additional help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="90720m0001.htm_para9"><a name="09072018000056">HMRC has also introduced additional checks of many new claims, making better use of information it already holds to prevent financial loss from some of the most frequent mistakes. It is also contacting certain customers who have not reported changes of circumstances for some time to offer assistance to make sure their award is up to date and correct. HMRC is also expanding its outreach work through children&#146;s centres by providing advice and support to customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="90720m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09072018000057">On fraud, the Department has implemented a range of measures designed to restrict the opportunity for abuse of the system. These include tighter control on the issue of claim forms, fraud awareness training for staff, and deploying compliance officers in tax credit call centres. Efforts to target organised fraud have successfully reduced the level of identified losses due to organised fraud from the levels in 2005-06. HMRC prevented incorrect tax credits payments due to organised fraud of &#163;66 million in 2007-08.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="90720m0001.htm_para11"><a name="09072018000058">HMRC is also getting tougher on individuals who commit fraud. It is increasing its use of data matching, using information from a wide variety of sources, within Government and beyond, to identify those who attempt to abuse the system. It is also sharing intelligence with other Government agencies and investigating cases jointly with the Department of Work and Pensions. Those who are caught face being charged a penalty and interest in addition to repaying the amount they defrauded, and in the most serious cases, the Department can and does prosecute. This approach is consistent with HMRC&#146;s vision about being passionate in helping those who need it and being relentless in pursuing those who bend or break the rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="90720m0001.htm_para12"><a name="09072018000059">HMRC will use the analysis published today to refine its strategy further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="90720m0001.htm_para13"><a name="09072018000060">A copy of these statistics has been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses and is available on the HMRC website.</p>

Simon Blake, the Chair of Compact Voice, and I, as representatives of the two signatories to the Compact, have asked Sir Bert to begin work engaging both sectors on updating the Compact documents, and in making changes to the Commission.

document, which includes a summary of consultation responses and a sustainability statement. This final, single issue revision to the east of England plan reflects consideration of responses to the consultation on the Secretary of State&#146;s proposed changes, which were made in the light of the recommendations of the independent panel who conducted an examination in public into the draft policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="90720m0001.htm_para18"><a name="09072018000067">This is the completion of an important single issue revision to the east of England plan, which was published in May 2008. It builds on the foundations of the draft policy, which was prepared by the east of England regional assembly and the findings of the independent panel who conducted an examination in public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="90720m0001.htm_para19"><a name="09072018000068">The policies that are published today become part of the East of England plan and provide a framework for local planning authorities to prepare relevant policies in their development plan documents, which must be in general conformity with the East of England plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="90720m0001.htm_para20"><a name="09072018000069">The strategy reflected in the final policies aims to guide development of additional accommodation for Gypsies and Travellers and travelling showpeople in the East of England most immediately to 2011, and in the longer term to 2021.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="90720m0001.htm_para21"><a name="09072018000070">The policies adopt the independent panel&#146;s conclusion that the number of pitches in the region should be slightly increased from the total proposed in the draft policy, in recognition of the pressing need for additional accommodation in the East of England. They also reflect the panel&#146;s conclusions that the revision should make provision for additional transit sites for temporary use by Gypsies and Travellers and more permanent plots for seasonal use by travelling showpeople.

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="90720m0002.htm_para22"><a name="09072018000103">The National Health Service was founded over 60 years ago. Sixty years on this Government remain committed to their founding principles; a national health service for the benefit of the people of the United Kingdom, free at the point of delivery and funded by general taxation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="90720m0002.htm_para23"><a name="09072018000104">However, it is neither feasible to operate the NHS without proper controls over access, nor fair, in an age of mass global travel and movement, to ask the taxpayer to fund unrestricted access to non-UK/EEA nationals. It is the Government&#146;s responsibility to protect NHS resources from exploitation or inappropriate use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="90720m0002.htm_para24"><a name="09072018000105">That is why, in concluding the review, the Government are today announcing measures to support a clearer and fairer system of access to NHS services&#151;a transparent system that will maintain the confidence of the public by preventing inappropriate access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="90720m0002.htm_para25"><a name="09072018000106">The Government have decided to maintain the current system of charging non-residents for most secondary care (hospital) services. Treatment in an accident and emergency department, and treatment for specified infectious diseases that could create a public health risk, will remain free to all. The Government also propose limited extensions to the current range of exemptions from charges for hospital treatment for certain non-residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="90720m0002.htm_para26"><a name="09072018000107">Persons seeking refuge or asylum are already exempted from charges for the duration of their application including the full appeal process. The Government have not been persuaded that this full exemption should be extended to all of those whose application has failed but have not yet left the country. It has however recognised the case for those whose claim has been refused but who are being supported by the UK Border Agency because they would otherwise be destitute, have children and or because it is impossible to return them home through no fault of their own. It is therefore proposed that an exemption from charges is extended to this group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="90720m0002.htm_para27"><a name="09072018000108">The Government also propose to exempt from charges all unaccompanied minors, including those in local authority care, while clarifying the principle that the accompanying parent or guardian of a non-resident minor is responsible for the cost of their NHS treatment. Together with the exemption for victims of human trafficking that was introduced from April this year, these changes reinforce the protection and rights to health care of the most vulnerable groups, regardless of their residential status.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="90720m0002.htm_para28"><a name="09072018000109">While maintaining the principle that other visitors or irregular migrants who are not specifically exempted should be charged for their treatment, and that, in non-urgent circumstances, treatment will be withheld if the costs are not paid, the Government remain firmly committed to the requirement that immediately necessary and other urgent treatment should never be denied or   <br>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="90720m0002.htm_para29"><a name="09072018000110">The principles of providing immediately necessary treatment must always be applied to any maternity care, to ensure that the health of the mother or baby is not put at any risk. Maternity treatment therefore must never be delayed or denied. However, the Government have not been persuaded that charges should be abolished in relation to non-exempt patients for maternity treatment. There is clear case evidence that a small number of visitors enter the United Kingdom specifically to use NHS maternity services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="90720m0002.htm_para30"><a name="09072018000111">In relation to HIV treatment, the Government recognise that clinical evidence on treatment, including their role in prevention, is developing constantly. Moreover, HIV is a major global problem, the control of which creates significant financial as well as human costs. We will therefore undertake further analysis of the latest medical and public health evidence together with consideration of how the current policy on treatment aligns with the Government&#146;s wider international aid strategy for HIV. This analysis will inform a future decision on whether the current treatment policy (that only initial diagnosis and counselling is offered free of charge to non-UK residents or individuals who are not otherwise exempt) should be revised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="90720m0002.htm_para31"><a name="09072018000112">The Government also propose that the period of absence for current residents that can be disregarded for the purpose of determining continued eligibility for free NHS hospital treatment in England is extended from three to up to six months. This proposed change reflects the increasing tendency towards longer periods of travel overseas for some people, and will protect the rights of British citizens who travel abroad while still residing substantively in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="90720m0002.htm_para32"><a name="09072018000113">The Government acknowledge that general practitioners are well placed to take account of the health care needs of their local communities. GPs also play a pivotal role in the provision of public health services (in which they are currently at the forefront of our response to the threat of pandemic swine flu). Since the inception of the NHS GPs have had the responsibility of determining whether a particular individual should become a patient of their practice. This applies to all patients and while the discretion we give to GPs is limited, for example, decisions must not be discriminatory, we do not believe that any specific changes are required in respect of foreign nationals. Where an individual is refused registration, a GP is able to offer routine treatment on a private fee paying basis, but must provide any immediately necessary treatment free of charge.</p>

 I am pleased to be able to provide a schedule of costs, which has been prepared exceptionally for 2008-09, following the merger of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) and the Assets Recovery Agency (ARA) on 1 April 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="90720m0003.htm_para8"><a name="09072018000126">The figures in the schedule show the sum of assets recovered by SOCA in 2008-09 to be in the region of &#163;3.9 million more than the cost of their recovery activities using the powers inherited from ARA. SOCA is tasked with reducing the harm caused to the UK by organised crime, and numbers alone do not tell the full story, but in the first year of SOCA&#146;s use of these new powers it exceeded the Government&#146;s target for civil recovery on its own. The Government believe that SOCA&#146;s performance in this area of activity fully vindicates its decision to merge both agencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="90720m0003.htm_para9"><a name="09072018000127">The figures provide, as far as it is possible to do, an assessment of the costs incurred by the Serious Organised Crime Agency in recovering assets using powers inherited from ARA during the first year following the merger. Assessing the costs associated to a single work stream within SOCA has proved challenging and significantly more complex than the calculations that could be made for ARA, which was focused on a single area of activity. Given that former ARA work is now only part of a larger organisation with much wider aims and objectives and significantly larger and more varied overhead costs, a like-for-like comparison is difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="90720m0003.htm_para10"><a name="09072018000128">SOCA&#146;s remit is to reduce the harm caused to the UK by serious organised crime. To achieve this SOCA deploys a range of tools. These include: criminal justice interventions (arrests and prosecutions); action to deny criminals access to assets through the use of proceeds of crime legislation and other measures; the disruption of criminal markets and organisations; and the use of ancillary orders such as Serious Crime Prevention Orders. The use of these tools is mainstreamed into the operational activity of the agency. Most operations deploy a number of these tools. It is not possible to identify, in a manner which could be audited, the costs associated with the use of specific tools within any given operation. The identification of costs for powers inherited from ARA is less problematic as civil recovery operations were run as a discrete area of the business in 2008-09.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="90720m0003.htm_para11"><a name="09072018000129">The receipts from SOCA&#146;s asset recovery work are not intended to cover the operating costs of SOCA as a whole.</p>

1<i>. Overview</i>&#151;This statement compares costs in SOCA of taking forward proceeds of crime activities previously undertaken by ARA. It includes an accumulated cost at the request of NAO as the original remit for ARA was that this work would in the longer-term be self-funding. The 2008-09 outturn shows a surplus for the first time, mainly because overhead costs in SOCA are much lower than those in ARA.<br>
2. <i>Centre of Excellence Overheads</i> for 2003-04 to 2005-06 are calculated at 84 per cent. of direct costs based on the average of the 2006-07 and 2007-08 actual costs reported by ARA.<br>
3. <i>Overhead costs in SOCA</i> are c 40 per cent.based on full recovery of all SOCA&#146;s infrastructure costs (that is, accommodation; security; IT systems etc) across operational activity areas including former ARA services.<br>
4. <i>The overhead savings are represented in pract</i><i>ice</i> by the fact that SOCA has been able to reduce accommodation costs in London and also by the ability to release c 50 FTE staff into other SOCA operational activities following the merger.<br>
 5. <i>SOCA costs include VAT</i> which ARA was able to recover&#151;VAT is cost neutral in total public purse terms and deducted from SOCA costs to facilitate direct comparison with ARA costs. Even without this adjustment, a surplus would be shown in 2008-09.<br>

This new facility, developed jointly with Spain, Norway and the Netherlands, will fund UN-led development work in countries where UN agencies have agreed one programme, one budget, shared back-office services and one strong leader. Experience over recent years indicates that this approach leads to a stronger, more effective and efficient UN at country level, better able to support developing countries&#146; national programmes to meet the MDGs.

or reforms are needed and setting out the case for change. The report has been carefully considered and the Government have concluded that collective actions would be best taken forward on a sector by sector basis. We do not believe that the creation of a generic right to collective action would be appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="90720m0003.htm_para16"><a name="09072018000202">There are a number of reasons why we have reached these conclusions. A generic right would introduce the possibility of collective actions for any and all types of civil claim in every sector of society and the economy. It would be very difficult to assess impacts across the entire economy and if the overall benefit was positive that might fail to highlight individual areas where the impact might be adverse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="90720m0003.htm_para17"><a name="09072018000203">In addition there may be substantive law issues relating to damages. The potential for a shortfall or surplus cuts across the compensatory principle underpinning (most) civil damages and the appropriate approach may vary according to the type of claim involved and in particular the type of representative body bringing the action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="90720m0003.htm_para18"><a name="09072018000204">Nevertheless, collective actions are potentially a useful way to manage mass legal claims in a number of areas where a large number of people are likely to have related grievances. However, there may be strong arguments both for and against the introduction of collective action in any particular sector and the Government do not think it would make sense to impose a one size fits all policy across the whole economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="90720m0003.htm_para19"><a name="09072018000205">Each sector will be responsible for deciding whether to introduce a right of action and for developing the required legislation, where there is evidence of need and following an assessment of economic and other impacts. For example, if the consumer sector, having considered alternative approaches and taken account of stakeholder views and economic impacts into account, decided that collective court actions offered a way forward then they would be able to ask Parliament to give representative bodies the right to bring actions on behalf of consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="90720m0003.htm_para20"><a name="09072018000206">The Government will work to develop a framework document which will in essence consist of a &#147;toolkit&#148; for legislators. It will identify the key features that legislation granting new rights of action will need to contain. In conjunction with this the Ministry of Justice will develop rules of court. These will be designed to interface with new rights of action and will be sufficiently flexible to deal with any different approaches taken by sectors in respect of such issues as authorisation of bodies, allocation of damages and whether claims are to be brought on an opt-in or an opt-out basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="90720m0003.htm_para21"><a name="09072018000207">Subject to any sector-specific exceptions, the rules will also include provisions for mandatory use of alternative dispute procedures, certification, security for costs, case management and fairness hearings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="90720m0004.htm_para18"><a name="09072018000230">The Government are very grateful indeed for the work of these Committees, and are publishing, today, their response to these reports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="90720m0004.htm_para19"><a name="09072018000231">On 3 July 2007, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made a major statement on the case for constitutional reform. Alongside this, more detail was given in the governance of Britain Green Paper. A number of subsequent separate consultation papers were published, including on the role of the Attorney-General (CM 7192), judicial appointments (CM 7210), war powers and treaties (CM7239) and protest around Parliament (CM 7235). The draft Constitutional Renewal Bill was published on 25 March 2008 (CM 73423-2) and a Joint Committee of both Houses set up to consider the draft Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="90720m0004.htm_para20"><a name="09072018000232">The Government have taken full account of the responses to the consultation and the reports of the Select Committees in finalising the proposals in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="90720m0004.htm_para21"><a name="09072018000233">A fundamental aim of the governance of Britain agenda has been to reduce the power of the executive, including by ending the use of relevant royal prerogative powers, and to enhance the role of Parliament. The provisions in respect of the civil service and treaties mark a major move in that direction. The Government have already announced that it would ensure that the Commons will have a pivotal position in determining whether the United Kingdom goes to war, by means of a war powers resolution. Drafts of this have already been published and will go before Parliament in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="90720m0004.htm_para22"><a name="09072018000234"><i>House of Lords</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="90720m0004.htm_para23"><a name="09072018000235">Detailed work on the reform of the Lords had been undertaken in parallel with the governance of Britain agenda. A White Paper was published last July (2008, CM) building on the decisions of the Commons in February 2007 in favour of an 80 per cent. or 100 per cent. elected House of Lords. No proposals in respect of the Lords were therefore included in the draft Constitutional Renewal Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="90720m0004.htm_para24"><a name="09072018000236">However, in view of recent events and increased interest in the Lords&#146; reform agenda, the Government have decided to include in the Bill reforms to:</p>
<a name="90720m0004.htm_brev3"><a name="09072018000313"><ul><p class="tabletext">a) end the hereditary peers by-elections, thus phasing out the hereditary principle, and</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="90720m0004.htm_para25"><a name="09072018000237">The Government are fully committed to comprehensive reform of the Lords, based on four principles, all of which were endorsed by the cross-party group (see White Paper, An Elected Second Chamber, July 2008, Cm 7438):</p>
<a name="90720m0004.htm_brev5"><a name="09072018000315"><ul><p class="tabletext">The primacy of the House of Commons, enshrined in the Parliament Acts, and in rules and convention;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="90720m0004.htm_para26"><a name="09072018000238">There remain outstanding questions, which the Government will seek to answer in final proposals after the summer, with draft legislation for pre-legislative  <br>

scrutiny as soon as possible. The two key issues are the electoral system and the size of the elected element (80 per cent. or 100 per cent.). The Government are giving careful and active consideration to resolving these questions in such a way as to make best use of a transitional period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="90720m0004.htm_para28"><a name="09072018000240">The Draft Constitutional Renewal Bill contained provisions in respect of the office of Attorney-General, following the governance of Britain Green Paper, which set out the Government&#146;s commitment to enhancing public confidence and trust in the office, and the Government said that they would listen to the views of all those with an interest. A consultation paper was subsequently published on 25 July 2007. Of all the matters covered in the draft Bill, this was been the subject of most extensive comment, with bespoke reports from the Justice Committee and the Select Committee on the Constitution and extensive treatment&#151;including minority views, with support from across all three main political parties&#151;from the Joint Committee on the draft Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="90720m0004.htm_para29"><a name="09072018000241">Those reports disclosed a wide range of views on the direction that reform of the office might take. For example, the Justice Committee favoured separating the Attorney&#146;s legal and political functions; a majority of the Joint Committee disagreed; and the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution noted that &#145;there are a number of different ways in which the post of Attorney might evolve&#146;, providing an overview of the different options and arguments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="90720m0004.htm_para30"><a name="09072018000242">In the event, the significant, necessary reforms to the role of Attorney-General are being achieved without the need for legislation. For example, the Attorney has reached a new settlement with the Directors of Public Prosecutions, the Serious Fraud Office and Revenue and Customs Prosecutions to improve relationships, guarantee prosecutorial independence while ensuring an appropriate degree of accountability and to improve transparency about the relationship, as reflected in the new protocol setting out the respective responsibilities of the Attorney and the Directors. This builds on the Prime Minister&#146;s statement in July 2007, that the Attorney-General has herself decided, except if the law or national security requires it, not to make key prosecution decisions in individual criminal cases. Furthermore, the new protocol makes it clear that the Attorney General will not be consulted in any case which concerns an MP or peer or where there is a personal or professional conflict of interest, other than where her decision is required by law. This protocol will be published by the Attorney very shortly. Furthermore, the Attorney-General now only attends Cabinet when matters affecting her responsibilities are on the agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="90720m0004.htm_para31"><a name="09072018000243">Given that it has been possible to make these reforms to the office of Attorney-General without legislation, the Government have concluded that it is not necessary to include legislative changes in respect of the Attorney-General.</p>

However, BVT offers the potential to secure the long-term sustainability of criminal defence work by enabling legal aid providers to offer their services at a sustainable price that reflects the costs of provision in their local area. The proposals have been designed to secure best value for taxpayers&#146; money and provide opportunities for practitioners to undertake more work where they have the capacity to do so.</p>
</ul><a name="90720m0004.htm_brev21"><a name="09072018000331"><ul><p class="tabletext">The LSC intends to go ahead with the BVT pilot as planned, with the tender process beginning in October 2009. However, the LSC has listened carefully to concerns raised by those responding to the consultation and has been persuaded that there is a strong case for delaying the wider implementation of BVT until at least 2013 to enable a full evaluation of the impact in the two pilot areas.</p>
</ul><a name="90720m0004.htm_brev22"><a name="09072018000332"><ul><p class="tabletext">The consultation response also details the final BVT model to be implemented in the pilot areas including the adjustments that have been made as a result of the consultation. In particular, the LSC intends to implement a more flexible, localised approach to maximum market share in response to concerns raised by respondents. It also intends to allow firms to undertake a small amount of police station work outside the area in which they have won a contract so that they can continue relationships with established clients.</p>

Paralympic Games Quarterly Economic Report July 2009&#148;. This report explains the latest budget position as at 30 June 2009, and outlines some of the many wider economic benefits to the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="90720m0004.htm_para34"><a name="09072018000251">The Olympic project remains on time and within budget. The overall &#163;9.325 billion public sector funding package for the London 2012 games remains unchanged and the anticipated final cost of the Olympic Delivery Authority&#146;s (ODA) programme is the same as it was at the end of March 2009 at &#163;7.234 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="90720m0004.htm_para35"><a name="09072018000252">On the eve of our three years to go celebrations, the ODA continue to make good progress on the Olympic park, recently announcing that they had hit all of their ten milestones. Good progress is being made on all of the principal venues and on 16 July the ODA announced that the outer shell roof structure of the Olympic stadium had been completed just 14 months after construction started.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="90720m0004.htm_para36"><a name="09072018000253">The report also confirms that the London 2012 games are providing business and employment opportunities around the UK in challenging times. There are now over 4,000 workers on site. Of these, 10 per cent. were previously unemployed. To date &#163;3.5 billion worth of contracts have been directly awarded by the ODA, 98 per cent. of these to UK companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="90720m0004.htm_para37"><a name="09072018000254">I would like to commend this report to the members of both Houses and thank them for their continued interest and support of the London 2012 games.</p>
