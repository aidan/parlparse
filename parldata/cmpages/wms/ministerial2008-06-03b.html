 A month has passed since cyclone Nargis hit Burma on 2 May. While access has improved, the situation remains extremely grave. The UN continues to estimate that 2.4 million people have been directly affected by the cyclone and only 1 million of those have so far received any form of relief. Most of those who have been reached are in the most accessible and least badly affected regions. The official Burmese death toll is 78,000 and 56,000 missing. The threat of further deaths from infectious diseases and malaria is significant. Priority needs are food, shelter, clean drinking water and medical supplies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="80603m0002.htm_para27"><a name="08060381000148">The delivery of relief goods is increasing. The UN air-bridge between Bangkok and Rangoon is operating. We estimate a total of 237 flights have arrived since the cyclone struck. The first of nine World Food Programme helicopters is now delivering aid supplies to the Delta region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="80603m0002.htm_para28"><a name="08060381000149">The UK Government&#146;s priority has been, and remains, to ensure that relief reaches those who need it most. To this end, I attended the UN/ASEAN conference in Rangoon on 25 May at the personal invitation of the UN Secretary-General. The conference confirmed the importance of international aid workers being given necessary access to affected areas and the key role to be played by the ASEAN nations in facilitating the international relief effort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_378"><a name="80603m0002.htm_para29"><a name="08060381000150">Since the conference there has been some improvement in access. No visas have been refused to UN or international NGO personnel in the last seven days. The Myanmar Red Cross has been able to scale up its operations substantially in the Delta. Five international medical teams from countries in the region are now providing support to national health care staff in the Delta. A DFID team managed to travel to the Irrawaddy Delta on 29 May.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"><a name="80603m0002.htm_para30"><a name="08060381000151">However, significant concerns remain. Visa extensions are being granted for only one or two weeks at a time; there have been restrictions on dates of travel and requirements that Government liaison officers accompany relief staff. There are still too few relief workers based in the Delta.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_380"><a name="80603m0002.htm_para31"><a name="08060381000152">The UK remains the largest single donor to the relief effort. We have contributed &#163;7 million to the UN Flash Appeal; we have also channelled &#163;6.7 million through international NGOs, including Merlin, MSF Holland and Save the Children. Our humanitarian team, which has been operating in Rangoon for three weeks, continues to play a crucial role in helping coordinate the overall aid operation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_381"><a name="80603m0002.htm_para32"><a name="08060381000153">A total of 20 DFID-funded aid flights have now arrived in Rangoon, delivering plastic sheeting and blankets for 250,000 people, hygiene kits and flat-bottomed boats for use in the Delta. All these items  <br>

It is an indictment of the Burmese regime that they proceeded with their constitutional referendum in the immediate aftermath of this natural disaster. The official results lack all credibility.

To do so, the regime&#146;s promises to the UN Secretary-General must be turned into action. Together with the UN, ASEAN and NGOs, the UK Government will be monitoring the situation closely in the days and  weeks ahead.</p>

 The Transport Research Laboratory has today published a report, commissioned by my Department, on the subject of longer and heavier goods vehicles (LHVs). The report highlights a number of issues that make the implementation of large 25.25 metre LHVs&#151;sometimes referred to as &#147;super-lorries&#148;&#151;impractical either on a permanent or trial basis. I will therefore not be allowing them on UK roads for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"><a name="80603m0003.htm_para0"><a name="08060381000158">The following issues highlighted in the report have been influential in arriving at my decision:</p>
<a name="80603m0003.htm_brev0"><a name="08060381000159"><ul><p class="tabletext">There is a risk (substantial in the case of 60 tonne super-lorries) of increased CO2 emissions and other environmental drawbacks due to modal shift from rail to road if these vehicles were to be permitted, which would also impact on the viability of existing rail freight services and the potential for future growth.</p>
</ul><a name="80603m0003.htm_brev1"><a name="08060381000160"><ul><p class="tabletext">There are serious implications for the management of the road network, as such vehicles would be unsuitable for many roads and junctions.</p>
</ul><a name="80603m0003.htm_brev2"><a name="08060381000161"><ul><p class="tabletext">Substantial investment&#151;in the order of several billion pounds&#151;would be needed to provide for junction improvements, the protection of bridge supports, and the provision of parking infrastructure for statutory rest periods, particularly if a new nationwide network of dedicated facilities is required.</p>
</ul><a name="80603m0003.htm_brev3"><a name="08060381000162"><ul><p class="tabletext">There is uncertainty about how efficiently such vehicles could be used, particularly when sourcing loads of sufficient size to make return journeys sustainable.</p>
</ul><a name="80603m0003.htm_brev4"><a name="08060381000163"><ul><p class="tabletext">Such vehicles would introduce new safety risks.</p>

of the Railway Heritage Committee. The public consultation, which will run until 5 September 2008, identifies three options to enable the Committee to extend its scope to railway related bodies that were overlooked or not in existence at the time of the original legislation. These options are:</p>
<a name="80603m0003.htm_brev6"><a name="08060381000169"><ul><p class="tabletext">for legislation to remain the same;</p>
</ul><a name="80603m0003.htm_brev7"><a name="08060381000170"><ul><p class="tabletext">for railway related bodies to voluntarily agree to allow the Committee to designate their records and artefacts; or</p>
</ul><a name="80603m0003.htm_brev8"><a name="08060381000171"><ul><p class="tabletext">to add further organisations to the original list of bodies covered by the 1996 Railway Heritage Act.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_389"><a name="80603m0003.htm_para4"><a name="08060381000172">From previous discussions between the Committee and railway bodies, and a response to an informal questionnaire in March, there is a need for such bodies to be brought into the scope of the Committee to enable it to fully meet its statutory obligations.</p>
