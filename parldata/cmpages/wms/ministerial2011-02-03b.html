 My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Baroness Hanham, has made the following written ministerial statement:</p>
<a name="110203m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="11020324000126"><ul><p class="tabletext">I am today announcing a series of changes I will be making to the operation and delivery of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in England.</p>
</ul><a name="110203m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="11020324000127"><ul><p class="tabletext">ERDF is a key driver for economic growth and the sub-national agenda and I have seen for myself some of the benefits it has brought to local communities. The operation of ERDF is governed by complex European regulations and comes with stringent penalties if those are not met. As the Secretary of State outlined in a departmental press notice of 7 July 2010, the new Government inherited up to Â£150 million of potential liabilities from the previous Government due to financial and administrative irregularities. It is vital that taxpayers have confidence that their money is not being wasted.</p>
</ul><a name="110203m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="11020324000128"><ul><p class="tabletext">ERDF is currently delivered by teams in the regional development agencies. Following our decision to abolish these agencies and encourage local communities to come together to form economic partnerships that make sense for them, I have concluded that in order to maintain compliance with the regulations and spending momentum, we should transfer the existing ERDF staff and functions into my Department by the beginning of July.</p>
</ul><a name="110203m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="11020324000129"><ul><p class="tabletext">In London, the Greater London Authority is establishing a housing and regeneration division from parts of the London Development Agency and the London elements of the Homes and Communities Agency. So I have concluded that, in line with the steps we are taking in the Localism Bill to transfer power and functions to the Mayor of London, the Greater London Authority is well placed to continue to operate ERDF in the capital.</p>
</ul><a name="110203m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="11020324000130"><ul><p class="tabletext">We want to encourage local communities to make use of ERDF. This is more likely to happen if ERDF teams continue to be located close to the places they serve so they are on hand to offer support and advice to projects. So I have decided that we must aim to locate the ERDF teams as far as possible in their existing towns or cities.</p>
</ul><a name="110203m0001.htm_brev5"><a name="11020324000131"><ul><p class="tabletext">We are committed to giving localities and communities greater control and greater influence over the programmes and services delivered in their areas. To help achieve this, I have decided that we should restructure existing Programme Monitoring Committees as Local Management Committees which can ensure that, within the parameters already agreed with the EU, local people and businesses can influence the shape of the programme. These Committees give strategic direction to the operational programmes and ensure that they are delivered compliantly and that outputs are delivered. I will be looking to ensure that the local representatives from across the public, private, voluntary and community and local authority sectors are represented on the Local Management Committees.</p>

our commitment to localism, I have also decided that a significant figure from the local community should be appointed as a deputy chair of the Local Management Committee, to ensure that the ERDF programmes are overseen and shaped by local people. We will work with local communities to determine who should occupy this role.</p>
</ul><a name="110203m0001.htm_brev7"><a name="11020324000133"><ul><p class="tabletext">We will be working closely with the existing membership of the Programme Monitoring Committees and other local representatives to determine the practical details of the changes I want to make. That will include the role of the Local Management Committees, how the deputy chair and membership will be selected and what underpinning arrangements they will need.</p>
</ul><a name="110203m0001.htm_brev8"><a name="11020324000134"><ul><p class="tabletext">Finally, as we said in the "Local Growth" White Paper, we want to make it easier for local communities to access all elements of regeneration funding, so my Department is working with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to determine the scope to align the application processes for ERDF and the regional growth fund.

 Section 141 of the Mental Health Act 1983 sets out a process by which MPs are to vacate their seats if they have a mental health condition and are authorised to be detained under mental health legislation for a period of six months or more. The process involves the Speaker of the House of Commons receiving reports from registered medical practitioners. If the Speaker receives two such reports, six months apart, that the MP is in such detention, the Speaker lays both reports before the House of Commons and the MP's seat automatically becomes vacant. Section 141 also applies in relation to the devolved assemblies with the presiding officer of each assembly performing the functions of the Speaker.</p>

It treats mental ill health differently from physical ill health. It sends out the message that if you have a mental health condition, your contribution is not welcome in public life. That is a message this Government wish to change.</p>

 On 19 January, following a number of successful cyber attacks on EU member states' emissions trading system (EU ETS) registries, the European Commission suspended all internal and international transactions within all the EU ETS registries. These registries are the repositories for EU emission allowances and an important part of carbon market trading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="110203m0001.htm_para12"><a name="11020324000049">The UK agreed with the European Commission that EU member states should not be able to reopen registries until they had provided sufficient evidence to the European Commission that their registries meet a number of minimum security requirements. The UK registry is widely seen as one of the most secure registries in Europe with at least one market participant recommending this week its clients should use the UK registry. The UK's registry administrator, the Environment Agency, earlier this week submitted the required evidence to the Commission. We have received confirmation this morning that the UK registry will reopen on Friday 4 February at 7 am.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="110203m0001.htm_para13"><a name="11020324000050">While it is important to ensure a minimum level of security now to ensure the reopening of the registries, the UK will continue to press the European Commission to ensure that registry security across Europe is raised above this level. This is vital to ensure continued confidence in this growing market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="110203m0001.htm_para14"><a name="11020324000051">The temporary suspension of registry transfers has had an impact on the carbon market, though this has been concentrated in spot trading, (which allows for instant delivery of allowances bought on the secondary market), which represents only 10% of trading on the carbon market. The futures market, which is predominately based in the UK and accounts for the remaining 90% of the carbon market, has shown only a limited level of disruption. Trading here has continued at broadly the same volumes as before the registries were closed and the impact on the EU emission allowance price has been limited.</p>

However, because the UK's fiscal year is different, and because the Government were determined to respect section 5 of the 1972 European Communities Act which states that the UK will only submit fiscal data to the Commission if it has already been presented to Parliament first, the Government secured in June 2010 a provision in the stability and growth pact code of conduct to say that we will present our final budget, not our draft budgetary plans, to the EU.

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="110203m0001.htm_para66"><a name="11020324000109">The current driver licensing rules in the UK are based on the second European Council directive on driving licences (91/439/EEC). The minimum medical standards for the issue of driving licences are detailed in annex III of the second directive and the forthcoming third European directive on driving licences. Officials and medical experts from across the European Union reviewed the standards for eyesight, diabetes and epilepsy. Following receipt of their reports to the European Commission, amendments to the standards were adopted in 2009 in directives 2009/112/EC and 2009/113/EC, and came into force  15 September 2010.</p>

For the most part the medical directives relax, or more precisely define, existing EU minimum medical standards. While UK standards must be at least at the level of a minimum standard we are not required by EU law to relax existing domestic standards where these are higher than the EU standards. However, where the panel has advised that a relaxation is consistent with road safety we are recommending that this is adopted. The implementation of these revised standards is the basis of the consultation.</p>

<p><a name="st_143"><a name="11020324000112"><a name="110203m0001.htm_spmin12"><a name="11020324000160"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Transport (Mrs Theresa Villiers):</b>
 I am today announcing the Government's "in principle" decision to reform the air travel organisers' licensing (ATOL) scheme to improve clarity for consumers about its coverage and also to put the scheme's finances back on a sustainable basis. There will be a full consultation on the details of the proposed reforms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="110203m0001.htm_para69"><a name="11020324000113">The ATOL scheme, operated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), was introduced in the 1970s to provide financial protection for the purchase of package holidays in the event of travel company insolvency. Affected passengers are entitled to a full refund if they are yet to travel, or repatriation after completing their holiday if they have already reached their destination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="110203m0001.htm_para70"><a name="11020324000114">However, as a result of new ways of selling holidays and a recent Court ruling, the scheme no longer completely fulfils its intended purpose: the proportion of holidays with ATOL protection has fallen, and it can be difficult for consumers and the travel industry to know which holidays are protected and which are not. The proposed reforms will make it easier for everyone to understand which holidays are covered, and will restore protection to what looks like a package holiday but now falls outside the legal definition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="110203m0001.htm_para71"><a name="11020324000115">The Air Travel Trust Fund (the fund) provides the money for refunds and repatriation costs when a travel company becomes insolvent. For historic reasons the fund had no income for a number of years. As a result of this legacy, combined with travel company failures in 2008 and 2010, the fund's deficit has increased significantly. Until it is back in surplus, it can only meet its obligations because of a Government guarantee, currently Â£42 million, in support of commercial borrowing facilities. Reform is needed to secure the sustainability of the fund so it can continue to provide financial protection for consumers, while reducing and eventually eliminating the exposure to taxpayers. It is envisaged that the ATOL protection contribution (APC) paid into the fund will remain at Â£2.50 per holiday sale until the fund is restored to health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="110203m0001.htm_para72"><a name="11020324000116">The last Government consulted on reforming the ATOL scheme in December 2009, and the coalition has continued work on developing these important reforms. In outline the proposed reforms would:</p>
<a name="11020324000145"><ul><p class="tabletext">Create a new category of "flight plus" holiday in ATOL. This would cover holidays including a flight where the various elements were purchased within a specified short time period, and so look similar to package holidays, but are not packages as currently legally defined in the UK. New secondary legislation would be required to do this.</p>
</ul><a name="11020324000146"><ul><p class="tabletext">Ensure that where businesses sell holidays that look like packages, but where the travel agent has arranged matters so they are acting as an "agent for the customer" and so remain outside of ATOL, consumers are made fully aware of this, so that they can make an informed decision about their purchase. We are looking at using the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 to enforce this measure.</p>
</ul><a name="11020324000147"><ul><p class="tabletext">Replace the current arrangements with clearer, standardised information for consumers that their holiday or flight is ATOL protected. The CAA has already begun discussions  <br>

with the industry about a recognised document, the ATOL certificate, that would be both proportionate and fit for purpose. This can be done by CAA using its existing powers.</p>
