As the National Audit Office recognised in its report on the programme published last year, all the pathfinders have succeeded in closing the gaps in prices with their regions, and housing markets in local authorities chosen for intervention have, on the whole, performed better than in other local authorities not chosen for intervention which had the most similar problems of low demand.</p>

There will also be a policy debate on the Commission&#146;s proposal for setting emissions performance standards to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.

 On 16 April 2007, my right hon. Friend the former Secretary of State for Health, the Member for Kingston upon Hall, West and Hessle (Alan Johnson) announced an independent review to examine the processes underlying modernising medical careers and make recommendations to ensure that any necessary improvements could be implemented for 2008 and the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="80228m0001.htm_para8"><a name="08022865000089">The review was chaired by Sir John Tooke, dean of the Peninsula medical school, chair of the Council of Heads of Medical Schools and chair of the UK Health Education Advisory Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="80228m0001.htm_para9"><a name="08022865000091">Today, the Department publishes its response to Sir John&#146;s interim and final reports. The response has been placed in the Library and copies are available to hon. Members from the Vote Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="80228m0001.htm_para10"><a name="08022865000093">The review which he chaired was conducted independently of the four Health Departments and had its own independent secretariat. Its interim report was published on 8 October 2007. Following consultation with the medical profession and others involved, the final report of the review was published on 8 January this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="80228m0001.htm_para11"><a name="08022865000095">Sir John and his colleagues have produced an excellent, wide-ranging review of the serious problems that arose within specialty training in 2007, the causes of those problems, and what needs to change as a result of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="80228m0001.htm_para12"><a name="08022865000097">I would like to thank Sir John, his colleagues on the review, and all organisations and individuals who have given evidence to it and responded to its interim report. The Tooke review marks a significant step forward in ensuring excellence and high achievement remain at the heart of medical education and training in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="80228m0001.htm_para13"><a name="08022865000099">Progress has already been made. For example, one of the key lessons of 2007 was the need to develop policy and process in consultation with the medical profession, the NHS and others involved. That is why we have established the MMC programme board. Over half of the board&#146;s members are drawn from the medical profession. I have accepted all of the programme board&#146;s recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="80228m0001.htm_para14"><a name="08022865000100">The complexity of this area of policy means that there are 47 separate sets of recommendations to consider within Sir John&#146;s interim and final reports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="80228m0001.htm_para15"><a name="08022865000101">While not all of them are the direct responsibility of the Department, we accept the overwhelming majority of Sir John&#146;s recommendations. For example, we accept Sir John&#146;s recommendation that the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board (PMETB) and the General Medical Council (GMC) should merge to establish a single organisation for standards in medical education and training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="80228m0001.htm_para26"><a name="08022865000120">The UK is sponsoring this initiative of the Slovenian presidency because we believe reform is needed to improve the delivery of justice in these cross-border cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="80228m0001.htm_para27"><a name="08022865000121">The purpose of the proposal is to tighten up the regime applicable in cases of trials in absence in the main EU mutual recognition instruments, enhancing the procedural rights of defendants. Trials in absence will not increase as a result of the proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="80228m0001.htm_para28"><a name="08022865000122">The Slovenian presidency hopes to reach agreement on the proposal very quickly. We are therefore asking for responses to our consultation within six weeks.</p>

 We have made clear progress over the past decade in tackling poverty and promoting social justice, but we need to do more. We are determined that we will continue to tackle child poverty and to drive for an 80 per cent. employment rate. We have become more ambitious about who we believe can work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="80228m0002.htm_para0"><a name="08022865000125">We will be focusing efforts on helping people on employment and support allowance to look at what they can do, not what they cannot. We will also be expecting single parents to look for work when their youngest child is seven rather than 16. Achieving fair life chances for all will mean opening up second chances, through opportunities to learn, develop new skills, enter employment and make progress at work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="80228m0002.htm_para1"><a name="08022865000126">The employability market is large and diverse. Every year, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) spends nearly &#163;1 billion on partnerships with the private, public and voluntary sectors. In England, the European Social Fund (ESF) finances further provision commissioned by DWP. We need to spend that money cost-effectively to get the best result for every customer, to increase the number of people going into sustained work. To achieve this, we need to achieve a step change in the performance of employment provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="80228m0002.htm_para2"><a name="08022865000127">That is why I am pleased, therefore, to announce to the House the publication today of a Command Paper entitled &#147;DWP Commissioning Strategy&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="80228m0002.htm_para3"><a name="08022865000128">The commissioning strategy&#146;s new approach to sourcing, procuring and managing employability provision will harness the innovation and expertise of the private, third and public sectors to support people into work. This strategy implements a key part of the radical vision outlined by David Freud in his report, &#147;Reducing Dependency, Increasing Opportunity&#148;, published in March 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="80228m0002.htm_para4"><a name="08022865000129">The commissioning strategy is a major milestone in our welfare reform programme and provides a comprehensive and compelling vision of the way we will work with providers. It aligns clearly with the ambitions of other developments, such as: the Leitch review of skills; the report of the National Employment Panel&#146;s Business Commission on Race Equality in the Workplace; and the joint Communities and Local Government/Department for Work and Pensions paper on area-based strategies to reduce worklessness in England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="80228m0002.htm_para5"><a name="08022865000130">We are creating a market for the long-term&#151;we are committed to this and want to help develop a critical mass of providers who will work with us in delivering personalised services for each individual that focus on work or work related activity for those clients who will benefit. The strategy takes us away from a mindset of top-down control and devolves initiative and innovation to the front-line. Furthermore, it sets out the high value we place on developing long-term relationships with partners who demonstrate they share our commitment, including those commitments in the public sector statutory duties, to promote equality through all we do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="80228m0002.htm_para6"><a name="08022865000131">We have consulted extensively with existing and potential providers, with other parts of Government, with representative groups, employer organisations and other stakeholders, as well as reviewing the responses to the consultation exercise. We have also sought to learn from best practice internationally: from the United States, Australia and the Netherlands. However, our ambition is to make our employability provision even more advanced and effective in its conception and delivery. We want our welfare provision to be a world leader in increasing skills and in tackling worklessness.</p>
