 On 18 January I asked Sir Roger Singleton, the Government's independent chief adviser on the safety of children, to review the use of the defence of reasonable punishment in certain part-time educational and learning settings to establish the key issues and whether it was an area where we needed to consider a change in the interests of strengthening safeguards for children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="100330m0001.htm_para5"><a name="10033047000044">Sir Roger's main recommendation is that the current ban on physical punishment in schools and other children's settings should be extended to include any form of advice, guidance, teaching, training, instruction, worship, treatment or therapy and to any form of care or supervision which is carried out other than by a parent or member of the child's own family or household. This will resolve the discrepancy whereby a teacher is banned from smacking a child in a school, but the same teacher could administer physical punishment in an out-of-school setting. I believe this is a sensible and proportionate solution to removing this inconsistency.</p>

 I am announcing today the implementation of the duty for local authorities to respond to petitions, giving real power to local people to raise the issues they care about with their council and ensuring they receive a meaningful response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="100330m0001.htm_para24"><a name="10033047000065">The petitions duty is provided for by chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009.

The requirements relating to electronic petitions will come into force on 15 December, reflecting the additional time needed for local authorities to procure, install and test software and to train staff.</p>

As the review acknowledged, considerable detailed work is required to translate the review's high-level recommendations into legislation. An important first step is the formation of the proposed independent medical expert group, which I am establishing on an interim basis today in order to meet the time scales envisaged by the review. The terms of reference, structure and membership of this interim medical expert group, which will advise on armed forces compensation, is set out below:</p>

<p><a name="st_114"><a name="10033047000214"><a name="100330m0003.htm_spmin3"><a name="10033047000309"><b>The Minister for Europe (Chris Bryant):</b>
 The Western European Union (WEU) has played a valuable role in discussion on European security. It embedded the principle of mutual defence in post-war Europe, promoted consultation and co-operation on defence and security matters in Western Europe and has conducted operations in a number of vital theatres, including the Persian Gulf and the Adriatic. Members from both Houses, past and present, have played a valuable role in pursuing the UK's interests within the WEU and I would like to take this opportunity to pay warm tribute to their efforts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_421"><a name="100330m0003.htm_para62"><a name="10033047000215">But the WEU's mutual defence role was essentially symbolic as soon as NATO was established and successive UK Governments have made clear, as the Lisbon treaty does, that NATO is the forum and the foundation for collective defence of the allies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_422"><a name="100330m0003.htm_para63"><a name="10033047000216">Moreover, the operational role of the WEU has been succeeded by the EU, following the UK/French initiative to create security and defence policy capacity in the EU. With this development, which NATO and the US specifically have welcomed, it is clear that the Western European Union is no longer relevant to today's European security architecture. While the UK recognises the role the WEU Assembly has played in engaging the views of national parliamentarians from across Europe on European defence, we do not believe this justifies the cost of over €2 million a year to the UK alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_423"><a name="100330m0003.htm_para64"><a name="10033047000217">For that reason, the UK intends to withdraw from the Western European Union. In accordance with the modified Brussels treaty, we will formally inform the Belgian Government of our decision in April 2010. A 12-month notice period will then follow, during which the UK will remain a member of the WEU, giving an opportunity for discussion on how to develop cross-European parliamentary scrutiny of European defence issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_424"><a name="100330m0003.htm_para65"><a name="10033047000218">Given the inter-governmental nature of the EU's common security and defence policy, we believe that this remains entirely a matter for national Parliaments and co-ordination between them. There is no reason and no case for the European Parliament to expand its competence in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_425"><a name="100330m0003.htm_para66"><a name="10033047000219">We are in discussion with other WEU member states on this issue. Many of them also believe that the time has come to radically reform or close the organisation. Following this announcement, we will continue to engage our European partners on this issue and on future cross- European parliamentary scrutiny of European defence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_426"><a name="100330m0003.htm_para67"><a name="10033047000220">We will also seek to use this opportunity to improve the exchange of information and engagement between the EU and NATO, including the involvement of non-EU NATO European allies in European defence.</p>

 Today the Government are laying before Parliament the White Paper, "Building the National Care Service" (Cm 7854).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_427"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para0"><a name="10033047000222">We have listened to the views of the public and stakeholders through the 2008 engagement process and the 2009 Big Care Debate. The Big Care Debate received over 28,000 direct responses, with more than 40,000 people contributing to the debate through further research or events organised by stakeholders. The consultation showed that there was strong support for our vision of a National Care Service and while there was no clear consensus on funding, the comprehensive option was the most preferred. Today we have published an independent summary of the consultation alongside the White Paper and placed a copy in the Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_428"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para1"><a name="10033047000223">We also held a Care and Support Conference last month with the Care and Support Alliance and other key stakeholders. They urged us to push forward with reform and favoured the comprehensive option.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_429"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para2"><a name="10033047000224">We believe the time has come to build a comprehensive National Care Service. This will be for all adults in England with an eligible care need, providing free care when they need it-whoever they are, wherever they live in England, and whatever condition leads them to need care. It will give everyone the peace of mind that they and their families will be cared for should the need arise, and it will mean that no one need live in fear of losing their home or their savings to pay for care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_430"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para3"><a name="10033047000225">The Government's vision is for a National Care Service that gives people choice and control, and is focused on keeping people well and independent. It will ensure that different parts of the system work better together, with a new duty for NHS bodies and local authorities to deliver integrated care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_431"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para4"><a name="10033047000226">Millions of people care for a family member or friend. This is the hallmark of a civilised society. But we must do more to give support to those who provide such care. Building on the carers' strategy, the National Care Service will support those caring for others by improving the quality of formal care, and working with employers and Job Centre Plus, to help carers to live the life they want to live.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_432"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para5"><a name="10033047000227">We recognise that building the new National Care Service will be one of the biggest changes to the welfare state since the creation of the NHS. We are also creating it during a period of fiscal consolidation. Reform to social care must be consistent with our plans for fiscal consolidation and reflect the tough decisions that will need to be made in the next spending review. This means we need to build the new service in stages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_433"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para6"><a name="10033047000228">The first stage is to create a step change in the provision of services in the home and in our communities. These services are essential if we are to ensure that more people are supported in their homes. Central to this is the Personal Care at Home Bill, to be implemented in 2011, enabling us to provide free personal care for people in their own home for those with the highest needs. The first stage of reform will also see reablement services available in every community, ensuring that  <br>

there is a service by which people are supported to regain their independence and confidence when they need home care for the first time. As part of the first stage we will push forward with existing reforms that are already delivering real benefits for people such as the dementia strategy, the carers' strategy and Putting People First.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_434"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para7"><a name="10033047000229">The second stage of reform, during the next Parliament, will be to put in place the building blocks of a national system of care and support, in particular the establishment of clear, national standards and entitlements. We will introduce a National Care Service Bill early in the next Parliament as a major step forward. From 2014, care entitlements will be extended meaning that anyone staying in residential care for more than two years will receive free care after the second year. The first and second stages together will mean that the most vulnerable in our society, those with the highest needs, will be protected from very high care costs and that many more people will be supported in their own homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_435"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para8"><a name="10033047000230">During the next Parliament, we will take further steps towards the full reform of the system-moving towards the third stage in which the comprehensive National Care Service becomes a reality, with care free when people need it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_436"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para9"><a name="10033047000231">To do this will require everyone to contribute through a fair care contribution. So at the start of the next Parliament, we will establish a Commission to help to reach consensus on the right way of funding the system. The Commission will determine the fairest and most sustainable way for people to contribute. It will make recommendations to Ministers which, if accepted, will be implemented in the Parliament after next. The Commission will determine the options that should be open to people so that they have choice and flexibility about how to pay their care contribution. Our expectation is that the Commission will consider all the various options for payment put forward by stakeholders and the public as part of the Big Care Debate and at the Care and Support Conference.</p>

 The Police Pensions Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVC) Scheme, which was introduced in 1990, has served as a useful means by which police officers can top up their retirement pension. However, the opportunities now open to those who want to save for a personal pension reduce the need for an in-house AVC scheme. After consulting the Police Negotiating Board we have decided to close the police AVC scheme to new business from 1 October 2010, subject to parliamentary approval of the necessary changes to the relevant regulations.</p>

The introduction of Added Pension would be accompanied by the closure to new contracts of the current facility of buying added years. The aim is for this change to be made at the same time as the closure of the AVC scheme to new business but this is subject to confirmation.</p>

<p><a name="st_117"><a name="10033047000236"><a name="100330m0004.htm_spmin2"><a name="10033047000312"><b>The Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism (Mr. David Hanson):</b>
 This week marks the end of phase 2 of the tackling knives and serious youth violence action programme (TKAP). Over the past 12 months, we have targeted nearly £7 million of funding on 15 high priority areas and the British Transport Police in order to reduce serious youth violence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_440"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para13"><a name="10033047000237">Last week's deaths of two young people in London was a stark reminder, if one were needed, of the need for our continued action in this area. We are committed to reducing serious youth violence to make sure that no families face the devastation that these young people's families are suffering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_441"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para14"><a name="10033047000238">We are focused on tougher enforcement, tougher sentences and new legislation to tackle violent crime and gangs. We increased the starting tariff for a life sentence for adults committing murder using a knife or other weapon taken to the scene to a minimum 25 years in prison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_442"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para15"><a name="10033047000239">We will publish detailed results from the programme in the summer, but across England and Wales as a whole the picture is encouraging. Recorded crime statistics show that in the period April to September 2009 covering the first six months of phase 2 of TKAP, there was a 7 per cent. fall in recorded knife crime, compared with the same period the previous year, including a 34 per cent. fall in homicide with a knife/sharp instrument -100 homicides involving a knife/sharp instrument  in April to September 2009 and 152 in April to September 2008. These statistics build on annual figures for 2008-09 which saw a 7 per cent. drop in knife/sharp instrument homicides, compared with 2007-08.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_443"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para16"><a name="10033047000240">Over 100 hospitals are now sharing A&amp;E data with local police and community safety partnerships in England and Wales, to enable targeted local enforcement and other activities to reduce violence. The Home Office has provided £300,000 to eight TKAP police forces for nine Portcullis Operations, an intensive enforcement and prevention tactic. Increased police activity has led to 736 arrests, 23 knives and one shotgun being recovered, and over 20,000 people passing through knife arches. In addition, street based teams have worked with over 1,500 young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_444"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para17"><a name="10033047000241">But preventing serious violence is about more than tough enforcement; it is also about prevention. There have been over 22,000 after-school patrols in TKAP areas over the same period, engaging with over 67,000 young people and signposting over 13,000 young people to positive activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_445"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para18"><a name="10033047000242">Where young people have been involved in knife crime, we have worked hard to ensure that they receive appropriate education and rehabilitation to teach them about the dangers of knives. The Youth Justice Board rolled out the knife crime prevention programme to all 97 youth offending teams in the 15 TKAP areas with the aim of reaching 2,000 young people cautioned or convicted of knife crime in the TKAP areas by the end of 2010, to bring home to them the consequences of carrying a knife.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_446"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para19"><a name="10033047000243">All of this activity to tackle serious youth violence will not stop at the end of TKAP 2. A third phase of TKAP begins on 1 April 2010 aiming to continue our work to keep young people safe. TKAP 3 will make £5.5 million of Government funding available to local TKAP areas: £4 million to local community safety partnerships, on top of £1.5 million already announced for 150 local voluntary organisations receiving help from the Home Office community fund. In 2010-11, we will focus the TKAP programme on 52 community safety partnerships within 21 police forces. The British Transport Police will receive also TKAP funding and support. Agencies in these local areas know that serious youth violence matters to their communities and they want to do all they can to prevent and  reduce it.</p>

It is responsible for a significant amount of social and economic harm, both financially and through threats to children; and is a threat to confidence both in the provision of services through the internet generally, and in the move of Government services online.

 Today my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and I are announcing the final stage of the UK's first global review of visa regimes in relation to the seven countries of the Eastern Caribbean-Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis,  St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_450"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para23"><a name="10033090000033">A visa regime is a very effective immigration, crime and security control measure. As part of our overseas defences our visa waiver test helps us determine whether our visa regimes are in the right places. Travellers from every country beyond the European economic area and Switzerland were measured against a range of criteria including illegal immigration, crime and security concerns. The test has been taken forward in close collaboration with other Departments across Whitehall. New full visa regimes were introduced on Bolivia, Lesotho, South Africa and Swaziland, along with a partial regime on Venezuela, in 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_451"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para24"><a name="10033090000034">Having initially considered the Eastern Caribbean states on a regional basis, we decided to examine them individually to ensure any potential regimes would be aligned correctly.

<p><a name="stpa_452"><a name="100330m0004.htm_para25"><a name="10033090000035">We recognise that we have close historic, economic and political ties with Dominica and St. Lucia and are aware that the introduction of a visa regime would be a significant step. It is a decision we do not take lightly. As a result we will now enter a six-month period of detailed dialogue with the Governments concerned to examine what actions will be taken to address our concerns and mitigate the need for a visa regime to be introduced. During this period, Dominica and St. Lucia will need to demonstrate a genuine commitment to put into effect credible and realistic plans, with clear timetables, to reduce the risks to the UK, and begin implementing these plans by the end of the dialogue period.</p>

Transforming harmful gender norms and stopping violence against women is central to achieving universal access. The group recognised the need for health systems that effectively deliver both maternal, newborn and child health services and services for women, men and children who are vulnerable to and living with HIV.

<notus-date day="30" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>30 Mar 2010 : Column 111WS</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_468"><a name="100330m0005.htm_para4"><a name="10033090000054">Since this Government introduced the Act in 2005, it has given the public access to information held by over 100,000 public authorities. Section 5 of the Act gives the Secretary of State the power to make an order designating new bodies as public authorities for the purposes of the Act where those bodies appear to him to perform functions of a public nature. In accordance with our continuing commitment to openness and accountability in public life, I wish to announce to the House today the decision to extend the Act to all of the bodies consulted, insofar as they perform public functions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_469"><a name="100330m0005.htm_para5"><a name="10033090000055">Having carefully considered all the evidence it is clear that all of the bodies listed above perform functions of a public nature. I have written to each of the bodies to explain the decision in detail, and to identify the functions to which the Act will apply. However the reasons in brief are as follows:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_470"><a name="100330m0005.htm_para6"><a name="10033090000056">ACPO's functions are concerned with providing leadership for the police force, improving policing, acting as a voice for the force, encouraging high standards of performance and development, providing the strategic police response in times of national need and other ancillary and related functions. Policing is clearly recognised as a function of a public nature. For these reasons it is appropriate to include ACPO in a section 5 order for all of its functions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_471"><a name="100330m0005.htm_para7"><a name="10033090000057">The Financial Ombudsman Service resolves disputes between consumers and providers of financial services. It was established under a statutory scheme in order to provide consumers with a quick and informal alternative to the courts. We consider that the functions of FOS appear to be functions of a public nature and that it would be appropriate to include its in a section 5 order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_472"><a name="100330m0005.htm_para8"><a name="10033090000058">UCAS provides its member university and colleges with admissions services. Without such services, those institutions-which are bodies listed as public authorities in either the Freedom of Information Act or the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act-would need to perform these functions for themselves, and the information would be captured by those Acts. As UCAS provides these services on behalf of its members, it is clear that UCAS does perform a function of a public nature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_473"><a name="100330m0005.htm_para9"><a name="10033090000059">Finally, although independent of local authority control, academies are publicly funded schools and a part of the state education system. Provision of state education is clearly a public function and parents and local residents should be able to access the same kind of information about academy schools as for any other state-funded school. The Academy Trust, is the body responsible for the running of the academy school. In our view, the public functions of academies are those set out in the funding agreement signed between the Academy Trust and the Department for Children, Schools and Families: in short, the establishment, maintenance and carrying on of an academy. We propose to include Academy Trusts in a section 5 order for these purposes from the point at which they enter into funding agreements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_474"><a name="100330m0005.htm_para10"><a name="10033090000060">The order will be laid and debated at the earliest possible opportunity in the next parliamentary session, with the intention that it will commence in October 2011.</p>

opportunity to debate issues in a balanced way, exposing them to views from across the political spectrum to inform their deliberations; and providing a space to enable views to influence policy. As the independent analysis says:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_533"><a name="100330m0007.htm_para3"><a name="10033090000216">The UK is rightly regarded as having one of the best health and safety records in the world. Since 1997-98 the rate of fatal injuries to workers has fallen by 40 per cent., including in the construction sector, reflecting the significant focus on improving safety by the Health and Safety Executive, local authorities, businesses and trades unions. While this is very welcome, every death is one too many and a tragedy to those involved and their families. The Government believe that more must be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_534"><a name="100330m0007.htm_para4"><a name="10033090000217">The number of deaths in the construction industry has been a particular cause of concern, with the rate of fatal accidents four times that of other industries. While there have been important improvements, 53 construction workers were still killed in 2008-09, for example. We therefore asked Rita Donaghy to carry out a review into the causes of construction fatalities</p>

<p><a name="stpa_535"><a name="100330m0007.htm_para5"><a name="10033090000218">On the 8 July 2009 I announced the publication of Rita Donaghy's report. The report contained 28 far-reaching recommendations for improving safety in the construction industry, extending across safety representatives, building control, the legal system, training and competence, and public procurement. I would again like to thank Rita Donaghy and her team for their excellent work in undertaking the inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_536"><a name="100330m0007.htm_para6"><a name="10033090000219">We are publishing now our response which builds on the issues and analysis within Rita Donaghy's report to provide a framework for delivery of improvements in these areas. Our response reflects widespread consultation across Government and with stakeholders. The Government fully accept 23 of the 28 recommendations including support of common minimum standards throughout publicly funded construction projects; mutual recognition between pre-qualification schemes; and support for greater worker participation. Two further recommendations related to the extension of gangmaster licensing regulations and the introduction of positive duties on directors raise important issues and warrant further consideration. Additional work is required to explore fully the relative options and understand the potential impact of introducing such measures. The reasons for these decisions are detailed within the response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_537"><a name="100330m0007.htm_para7"><a name="10033090000220">I hope that the action set out in the response improves further the safety record in the construction sector and provides some comfort to the families of those who have been killed by construction-related accidents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_538"><a name="100330m0007.htm_para8"><a name="10033090000221">This response is not an end in itself though, and we must continue to work together-Government, business, unions and workers-if we are to ensure that jobs in construction are as safe as any other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_539"><a name="100330m0007.htm_para9"><a name="10033090000222">The Government's response (Cm 7828) has been laid before Parliament and will be published later today.
