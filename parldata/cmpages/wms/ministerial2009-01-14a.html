 With the expiry of the call-out order made last January, I am reporting that a new order was made under section 54 of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 so that reservists may continue to be called out into service to support operations in Iraq. The new order is valid for 12 months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="90114m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09011443000017">Some 310 reservists are currently mobilised and deployed in support of operations in Iraq compared with 270 for the same period last year and 640 in December 2006. With the forthcoming drawdown in Iraq, the overall number of reservists deployed to theatre is expected to reduce during the course of this year but nevertheless there is a continued need to call out reservists, particularly to assist with the logistics and service support elements of the operation both in the UK and overseas.</p>

 My hon. Friend the then Minister for Marine Landscape and Rural Affairs (Jonathan Shaw) announced on 26 March 2008 the creation of a new DEFRA executive agency to be vested on 1 April 2009. The agency will be formed from merging the Central Science Laboratory (CSL), the Plant Health Division (PHD)/ Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate (PHSI) and the Plant Variety Rights Office and Seeds Division (PVS).

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="90114m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09011443000021">I have also published today two additional documents which relate to the coroner provisions in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="90114m0001.htm_para4"><a name="09011443000022">The first of these documents is a revised draft Charter for bereaved people who come into contact with a reformed coroner system. This follows our most recent discussion paper on the draft Charter which was issued for comment between June and September last year. The draft illustrates what a Charter for bereaved people under a reformed service might look like. The final version of the Charter would be issued by the Lord Chancellor, following discussion with the new Chief Coroner, when the coroners&#146; provisions in the Bill are implemented. The Charter is intended as an illustration of the key benefits which a reformed coroner system will deliver for bereaved families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="90114m0001.htm_para5"><a name="09011443000023">The second document is &#147;Sensitive reporting in coroners&#146; courts&#151;response to comments 2006-08&#148;. The Government have carried out extensive consultation on the reporting of inquests, since the draft Coroners Bill was published in 2006, and this document summarises our position as a result of this process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="90114m0001.htm_para6"><a name="09011443000024">The draft Coroners Bill originally contained new powers for coroners to impose anonymity of reporting in any case where the coroner believed there to be no public interest in the names of families being made public. In October 2007 I announced that, following our first consultation, we had agreed to remove the provision on reporting restrictions from the Bill&#151;<i>Official Report</i>, 25 October, column 20WS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="90114m0001.htm_para7"><a name="09011443000025">On 27 March 2008 we sought views again on alternative approaches&#151;<i>Official Report</i>, 27 March 2008, column 17WS and have concluded that it would be more appropriate to work with the Press Complaints Commission on how their existing code of practice, insofar as it refers to the reporting of inquests, can be brought better to the attention of bereaved families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="90114m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09011443000026">Today I have deposited copies of both documents in the Libraries of both Houses.
