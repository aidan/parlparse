 In July 2005, the Government announced that a second Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) would be undertaken, reporting in 2007. Ten years after the first CSR, the Government have shown that a strong economy and sound public finances can be delivered at the same time as sustained and substantial growth in investment in public services. Looking forward, there are new challenges Britain will need to address in order to lock in these benefits for the decade to come, including:</p>

or derelict properties. Some 300,000 private sector homes in Britain have been empty for more than six months and many lie empty and abandoned for years at a time, causing considerable distress for neighbours and local communities. Empty Dwelling Management Orders can only be granted where there is no reasonable prospect of it being occupied and where other routes have been tried, to work with the property owner to bring it back into use. Exceptions are in place to protect owners who have good reason to keep their dwelling unoccupied, for example temporary absence, second homes, properties on the market and inherited properties, which are exempt for a further six months after grant of representation (probate) is obtained. The tribunal must also consider the effect the order would have on the rights of the property owner and take into account the interests of the community.</p>

 I am pleased to inform the House that I have carefully considered the responses to the public consultation which took place between 9 August and 5 October 2005 about the temporary event notice regulations made under the Licensing Act 2003. I have also taken into account the second stage research paper on village halls and licensing published on 28 June by action with communities in rural England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="60705m0001.htm_para10"><a name="06070587000046">I have concluded that there is no consensus in favour of a further increase of the temporary event notice limits in respect of village halls or similar community premises. In particular, I have noted that residents' associations and local authorities are generally opposed to any further relaxation of these arrangements. The Secretary of State does not therefore plan to change the relevant regulations in the immediate future.

Removing the requirement to specify a designated premises supervisor would require changes to primary legislation.

On dates, the UK was successful in obtaining longer (until 22 December 2010) for the completion of existing work that will be used to satisfy the requirements of the directive on a transitional basis.

(2019). Flood management measures that have a &#145;significant&#146; effect on flood risk in neighbouring states will be subject to prior agreement between the member states concerned. Most member states endorsed the scope proposed by the European Commission, namely coverage of all rivers and coastal zones within the EU; a matter on which the UK has expressed misgivings at each stage of the negotiation on grounds of proportionality and subsidiarity. Given that the final text provides much greater flexibility for member states than the original Commission proposal, and that the burdens are consequently much lighter, the UK was on balance able to support the agreement reached in Council, along with all other member states.</p>

Two major outstanding issues were the focus of debate at the Council; the new standards for fine particles and the extra flexibility that may be allowed for compliance with existing limit values. The general approach includes a new two-part approach to regulating fine particles, combining a non-binding exposure reduction target with a binding limit value. It also gives limited extra time for member states to comply with existing limit values for larger particles. The UK supported the general approach.</p>

Those rules allow for 4 per cent. of value payments made before the end of the window to be made after it with full EU funding. After that, a sliding scale of reductions applies, depending on timing, to payments after the 4 per cent. threshold has been exhausted. The indications are that the UK is likely to have paid between 95 per cent. and 96 per cent. of payments by 30 June.

In addition to the IMF debt stock cancellation, 100 per cent. of debt stock, debt owed by 19 countries at the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank, has been cancelled.

Overall, US$ 36 billion (approximately &#163;20 billion) will then have been cancelled. Up to 24 other countries will also receive debt stock cancellation when they reach the required standards, bringing the total value of cancellations under the MDRI to over US$50 billion. Around $1 billion a year will be freed up for spending on poverty reduction in 2007, rising to $1.7 billion by 2010. All poor countries borrowing from IDA and the AfDF will benefit from the increased donor resources provided to IDA and AfDF under the MDRI to compensate for the foregone debt flows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"><a name="60705m0002.htm_para1"><a name="06070587000070">In addition to MDRI, steady progress has also been made in implementing the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, with eligibility extended to more countries this year. Cameroon completed the Initiative in May, becoming the 19th country to receive irrevocable debt relief, and the Republic of Congo has begun to receive interim relief. A further 10 countries also currently receive interim relief and 14 others remain eligible for debt relief when they reach the required standards. The UK continues to meet and  <br>

exceed our commitments under HIPC, offering 100 per cent. cancellation of bilateral debts to countries at HIPC Completion Point. Over &#163;100 million worth of UK Export Credit Guarantee Department and CDC debts held by Cameroon have now been cancelled. Other Paris Club (government creditors) members have also agreed extensive debt stock cancellation for Cameroon. Three other countries (Malawi, Sao Tome and Principe and Sierra Leone) are on course to complete the HIPC process by the end of the year. The UK remains the second largest bilateral contributor to the HIPC Trust Fund, which helps multilateral organisations deliver their HIPC assistance in a timely manner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"><a name="60705m0002.htm_para2"><a name="06070587000071">The largest ever debt relief deal by the Paris Club for an African country, Nigeria, has now been concluded. The deal resolved 100 per cent. of Nigeria's debts to Paris Club government creditors, with US$ 18 billion of debt written off. Nigeria used US$ 12.4 billion of its oil windfall to buy back the remaining debt. The UK cancelled debts worth US$ 2.85 billion as part of the deal. We have also worked hard to ensure savings will be used to reduce poverty -the deal will free up US$ 1 billion a year for Nigeria to spend on employing an extra 120,000 teachers, putting 3.5 million children into school, and other health, education and social investments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"><a name="60705m0002.htm_para3"><a name="06070587000072">The UK also supports debt relief for all poor countries&#151;not just those currently classed as HIPCs&#151;that can use the debt service savings to make progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. We therefore continue to offer debt relief (reimbursements of 10 per cent. of debt service to IDA and the AfDF) to other qualifying countries under the UK Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. Two new countries (Cape Verde and Georgia) recently qualified for this assistance, bringing the total number of recipients to six (Armenia, Cape Verde, Georgia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Vietnam).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_386"><a name="60705m0002.htm_para4"><a name="06070587000073">Additional debt relief has also been granted to the Government of Jamaica for a further year under the Commonwealth Debt Initiative (GDI). This will mean that Jamaica will not repay &#163;5.63 million worth of official debt to the UK (representing payments that were due in the financial year 2006-07). Each year, we also look at providing relief under GDI for Belize. In February this year a further &#163;1.21 million of debt relief for Belize was granted to use on reform programmes for poverty alleviation.</p>
