 I have placed in the Libraries of both Houses a copy of DFID&#146;s &#147;Research Strategy 2008-13&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="80422m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08042262000012">This strategy sets out DFID&#146;s priorities for spending up to &#163;1 billion on research for development. It is DFID&#146;s first five-year strategy for research, replacing the Research Funding Framework 2005-07. The strategy is the product of extensive consultation with research providers and users in developing countries, in the UK and internationally, including other funders of development research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="80422m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08042262000013">The strategy describes why research for development is needed and DFID&#146;s unique role in the global development research effort. It identifies four inter-dependent areas where DFID will ensure its research investment achieves results. In addition it describes six thematic areas that DFID research will cover: growth; sustainable agriculture; climate change; health; governance in challenging environments and future challenges and opportunities (i.e. anticipatory research). It describes in broad terms how funding for each of these areas is likely to evolve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="80422m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08042262000014">The document summaries the research management structures and funding mechanisms that DFID will use to implement the strategy, as well as the type of research partnerships DFID will build.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="80422m0001.htm_para3"><a name="08042262000015">Finally, it sets out thirteen key areas where DFID will monitor and measure the outputs of its research and report on these publicly.</p>

 Food prices have risen sharply around the world in recent months, causing serious social unrest and balance of payments problems for some countries and major funding gaps for humanitarian programmes. Most importantly, poor and vulnerable families across the world are struggling to buy enough food to meet the most basic needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="80422m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08042262000017">The UK Government are calling for a co-ordinated international response to this crisis. It must deal with both immediate needs and underlying causes. Such a response has to address a range of issues including trade reform; more and better support for agricultural and rural development in poorer countries; review of the wider economic and environmental impacts of biofuel production; social protection programmes which take people out of long-term dependency on food aid; and  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="80422m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08042262000018">The UK is already doing much to tackle this agenda. We will advance the payment of budgetary support to countries badly affected by high food prices, where appropriate, and will consider the need for additional payments. We have made substantial new allocations of humanitarian assistance in recent months, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Afghanistan and Yemen. Today the UK is pledging an additional &#163;30 million to support the World Food Programme&#146;s work in some of the countries most affected by food price inflation, including Zimbabwe, Somalia and Kenya in response to recent appeals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="80422m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08042262000019">The UK is already spending some &#163;50 million per year on social protection and safety net programmes in Africa alone. DFID is now willing to commit an additional &#163;25 million to Ethiopia as part of our aid framework once the future structure of the programme is agreed. This will fund the national safety net programme which reaches 7.2 million of the most vulnerable people, providing a combination of cash and food transfers that provide food and livelihood security. Additionally, DFID is ring-fencing &#163;4 million for nutritional monitoring across Africa to ensure early identification of problems, allowing prompt and effective response where need arises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="80422m0001.htm_para7"><a name="08042262000020">The announcement today of &#163;1 billion of new funding for international research includes &#163;400 million of new funds being made available over the next five years for agricultural research. This will help to make crops more climate-resilient; tackle the pests and diseases that blight tropical agriculture, forestry, fisheries and livestock production; and find ways of reducing the post-harvest losses that can destroy up to 40 per cent. of a poor farmer&#146;s produce.</p>

 I am today announcing a review of the economic regulation of the UK airport system, supported by a panel of experts. This recognises the points made by the Competition Commission in their interim report this morning, together with those of the aviation industry and other key stakeholders, about the potential shortcomings of the current regulatory system. If legislation is required as a result of this work, it would be taken forward in a future legislative session. Therefore we will not make changes to the basis on which the current price  caps at Heathrow and Gatwick airports are set. This also applies to the cap which will take effect at Stansted from 1 April 2009.</p>

200,000 jobs. The industry has seen significant change in recent years with our more global economy increasing the need for international movement of people and goods; and greater airspace liberalisation allowing passengers to benefit from more choice of flight destinations at lower prices, which has opened up opportunities that for many simply did not exist before. But this progress does not come without challenges, not least the economic constraints created by a lack of airport capacity in the UK and the global impacts of climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="80422m0001.htm_para10"><a name="08042262000024">In 2003, the Government set out a sustainable framework for the development of airport capacity over the next 30 years in the &#147;Future of Air Transport&#148; White Paper. This recognised the need for some expansion of airport capacity, which is why my Department recently consulted on &#147;Adding Capacity at Heathrow Airport&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="80422m0001.htm_para11"><a name="08042262000025">Economic regulation can play an important role in maximising the effectiveness of scarce capacity at airports in the south-east, for example by providing the right incentives to deliver necessary investment and ensure that the owners of UK airports are able to finance that investment. I welcome the Competition Commission&#146;s views, among others, that the current system needs to be reviewed to ensure it is effective for the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="80422m0001.htm_para12"><a name="08042262000026">It has been over 20 years since the Airports Act 1986 put in place the current regime of economic regulation and as such it is one of the oldest economic regulatory systems in the country. Much has changed since then, and there is an urgent need to consider how the framework needs to be updated to reflect today&#146;s realities. In particular, this work will look at how best to provide incentives to:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="80422m0001.htm_para13"><a name="08042262000030">In taking this work forward, I am keen that we identify and learn from best practice from the regulatory frameworks in other industries and the Government&#146;s better regulation strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="80422m0001.htm_para14"><a name="08042262000031">We have already said in the Government&#146;s response to the House of Lords Select Committee enquiry on Economic Regulation that, if particular issues were identified as part of the Competition Commission&#146;s inquiry, we would consult at the appropriate time on the wider economic regulatory role of the CAA including the way in which airport regulation operates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="80422m0001.htm_para15"><a name="08042262000032">The work I am announcing today will be taken forward to complement the independent inquiry of the Competition Commission on its market review of BAA and the independent strategic review of the CAA being undertaken by Sir Joseph Pilling. It will allow me to provide well-informed evidence to the Competition Commission for their inquiry, and allow me to respond  <br>
