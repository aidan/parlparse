report 2005-06 of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has today been
laid before Parliament. Copies are available in the Libraries of both
Houses.</p><p><a name="06062728000013">The

Act 2000 (FSMA), and assesses the performance of the Financial Services

Minister of State, Ministry of Defence(Mr. Adam
Ingram):</b> The Ministry of Defence has today awarded a
contract for the supply of food to the armed forces to Purple
Foodservice Solutions (PFS). The contract, worth in excess of
&#163;300 million, will commence on 1 October 2006 and will mainly
cover the provision of food services to personnel on operations. The
new contract is likely to save the Department more than &#163;14
million over the next five years.</p><h4 align="center"><a name="06062728000009">Last First World War Veteran
(Commemoration)</h4><p><a name="06062728000018"><b><a name="06062728000059">The
Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne):</b> There remains
a small number of UK veterans who served this country in the Armed
Forces during World War I (WWI) to whom the nation owes a particular
debt of respect and gratitude. In recent months, the death of a number
of WWI veterans has raised the question of how the passing of the final
veteran should be
marked.</p><p><a name="06062728000020">I
would like to take the chance to pay tribute to the right hon. Member
for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr.Ian Duncan Smith) who has spent a
considerable amount of time and effort campaigning for the occasion to
be marked in an appropriate
manner.</p><p><a name="06062728000022">For
the present, our priority is to celebrate these remarkable people
during the time that they remain with us. However, the death of the
final known WWI veteran will be a major milestone in our nation's
history and should be marked as so. Her Majesty the 
<br><notus-date day="27" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>27 Jun 2006 : Column 6WS</b><br>Queen and the Prime Minister therefore support plans to hold a National
Memorial Service in Westminster Abbey within two to three months of the
death of the last known WWI veteran. This will commemorate not the
death of the one individual, we sense from a number of the surviving
veterans that this might be an intrusion into private grief, but the
passing of them
all.</p><p><a name="06062728000024">While
that generation included those associated most directly with the
horrors of that war, those who fought in the trenches of the Western
Front, it also includes those who carried out their duties in other
theatres, at sea and in the air and those engaged in vital support
roles back home. We also owe a debt to those from other parts of the
British Empire who played their
part.</p><p><a name="06062728000026">We
plan that the events of the day should reflect the laying to rest of
the Unknown Warrior and the unveiling of the Cenotaph in 1920. The
service will be preceded by a sombre procession. The overall aim will
be for a reverential national event that is both commemorative and
educational.</p><p><a name="06062728000028">To
ensure that as many people as possible have the opportunity to be a
part of this significant event we will be producing an educational
resource pack. This will be distributed to primary and secondary
schools to help their pupils appreciate the significance of the
day.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06062728000004">Cabinet

Minister for the Cabinet Office (Hilary Armstrong):</b> A

Innovation Fund
(Productivity)</h4><p><a name="06062728000032"><b><a name="06062728000061">The
Secretary of State for Transport (Mr. Douglas
Alexander):</b></p><p><a name="06062728000033">My
predecessor published guidance on 26 January on the operation of the
Transport Innovation Fund (TIF). The guidance explained that TIF would
enable us to direct resources towards the achievement of two key
objectives&#151;tackling congestion (Congestion TIF) and improving
national productivity (Productivity TIF). I can now provide an update
on Productivity TIF.</p><p><a name="06062728000035">We have been looking to
identify a limited number of transport schemes which could be taken
forward quickly for an initial allocation of Productivity TIF, and
invited the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) to submit their views
on potential candidates. I 
<br><notus-date day="27" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>27 Jun 2006 : Column 7WS</b><br>am grateful for the constructive way in which the RDAs responded to this
request.</p><p><a name="06062728000036">In our
discussions with the RDAs, we proposed two priority themes which might
offer both a strong strategic fit at the national level with the
objective of supporting national productivity, and scope for schemes to
be delivered quickly, with implementation able to start during the
first two years when TIF becomes available&#151;2008-09 and 2009-10.
These themes were:</p><a name="06062728000037"><ul><p class="tabletext">measures
to improve the capacity and resilience of the strategic national
freight distribution networks, hence supporting international trade and
competitiveness</p></ul><a name="06062728000038"><ul><p class="tabletext">measures to make the
most of capacity at key pressure points on the strategic networks, thus
improving mobility for business and freight
users</p></ul><p><a name="06062728000039">Among the range
of suggestions offered by the RDAs, there was substantial support for
schemes reflecting these suggested themes, and I have concluded that
for this initial round of Productivity TIF we should broadly follow
them.</p><p><a name="06062728000040">We are also
keeping open the possibility of a contribution to the costs of taking
forward Crossrail, although funding decisions on Crossrail will not be
taken until after the conclusion of Sir Michael Lyons' review of local
government finances.</p><p><a name="06062728000041">Accordingly, in addition to
Crossrail, the schemes which will now be taken forward for business
case development and appraisal are as
follows:</p><table border="1"><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext"><i>Scheme

funding available in the opening years of the TIF is limited, and some
will be needed for Congestion TIF, so it will only be possible for the
TIF to support a small number of Productivity schemes in this initial
allocation round. Only a limited proportion of the schemes
above&#151;particularly in the case of the larger, more costly road
schemes - are likely to receive TIF funding.</p><p><a name="06062728000054">Since the TIF is intended to
supplement rather than supplant existing sources of funding, the
availability of TIF funding for individual schemes will depend on other
funding contributions, as well as value for money to the
taxpayer.</p><p><a name="06062728000055">The
inclusion of a scheme in this list should not be taken to give any
indication as to whether or not any statutory consents or other
decisions that may be required for that scheme to proceed (for example,
planning consents and decisions in relation to TWA
Orders or Harbour Orders) will be given in favour of the
scheme.</p><p><a name="06062728000056">The Department
will now be discussing with the appropriate delivery agents and other
key stakeholders the work necessary to deliver the business cases by
the end of July. I hope to announce decisions on first round
allocations of Productivity TIF, and the approach to handling future
allocations from the TIF, by the end of this
year.</p>
