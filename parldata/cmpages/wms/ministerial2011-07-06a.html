 The coalition is committed to closing the regional development agencies (RDAs) and facilitating the delivery of economic development at the local level through supporting the establishment of local enterprise partnerships (LEPs) and the existing role of local authorities in fostering and sustaining growth.</p>

However, this model is no longer affordable in the current economic climate and we need to agree a future for these assets that is affordable while enabling them to be developed in a way that is responsive to local needs.</p>

The National Transition Board, chaired by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and involving the RDAs, the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), HM Treasury and others, has considered these plans. In relation to land and property assets, on 14 April I confirmed my agreement to:</p>

               <a name="11070675000018"> I am confirming today the Government’s intention to transfer the majority of the RDA land and property portfolio, into a “stewardship” arrangement through which local partners, including local authorities, businesses, LEPs and others, will be able to influence their development and ensure they are developed in a way which maximises economic outcomes for the area. Most of these sites are not ready for market sale and in the majority of cases require further investment to deliver economic benefits. To achieve delivery of this we intend to transfer title to these assets to the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA), which will be responsible and accountable for managing the portfolio. Subject to completion of the necessary detailed work and arrangements the transfer is currently planned to take place on 19 September 2011.</p>

Under HCA supervision of the stewardship arrangement HCA will establish local committees to allow local partners such as local authorities, businesses, LEPs and others to influence development of the portfolio. National policy interests will be managed through BIS and DCLG representation on a newly constituted Land and Property Board, and with BIS local membership of the local stewardship committees.</p>

The detail of these transfers is still being agreed. The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government will approve  the final list of assets to be transferred. Details of the transfer order will appear on the DCLG and BIS websites once it has been made. We will set out detail of the assets being put into the stewardship arrangement by LEP area at that point. There will be a transfer of staff from the RDAs to the HCA in accordance with TUPE regulations.</p>

HCA will manage these in order to continue the development of these land assets which will maximise their impact on economic growth. These sites have been identified as assets of national importance to be retained under the ownership of central Government in order to be developed further to support investments in innovation and technology. Four facilities based on these sites form part of the recently established High Value Manufacturing Technology and Innovation Centre funded by the Technology Strategy Board.</p>

I will provide an opportunity for Members of the House to discuss these transfers at a meeting early in the autumn, once the local details of the transfers have been established.</p>

               <a name="11070675000040"> In the long term, people in the horn of Africa desperately need food security. The UK is a world leader in supporting countries to become more resilient to drought and famine, and has been working in the region for many years. Thanks to UK support, 7.8 million people in Ethiopia have access to cash and food in exchange for work through the productive safety net programme. DFID funding is also helping create 60,000 new jobs that are not dependant on rain-fed agriculture. A further 60,000 people are assisted through a “safety net” programme for the poorest households in Kenya.</p>

            <p>malnourished, so tens of millions more Ethiopians are able to feed themselves throughout the year. Those benefiting from UK-supported programmes have proved less vulnerable to the current drought. But long-term resilience takes many years to build up, and emergency relief is needed now to respond to the crisis before our eyes, and to make sure that the significant development gains of recent years are not eroded.</p>

               <a name="11070675000042"> On 3 July the UK Government announced significant funding for the World Food Programme to help feed  1.3 million Ethiopians for three months and to help 329,000 malnourished children and pregnant women. Our commitment will allow the WFP to access food from the Government of Ethiopia’s emergency food reserve now, while also starting procurement to replenish the reserve in time to meet shortfalls expected during the peak period of need (September to November).</p>

               <a name="11070675000046"> As the Prime Minister said in announcing the detainee inquiry on 6 July 2010, the purpose of this inquiry is to examine whether, and if so to what extent, the UK Government and their intelligence agencies were involved in improper treatment, or rendition, of detainees held by other countries in counter-terrorism operations overseas, or were aware of improper treatment, or rendition, of detainees held by other countries in counter-terrorism operations in which the UK was involved. The primary focus is the aftermath of the attacks of 11 September 2001 and particularly cases involving the detention at Guantanamo Bay of UK nationals and former lawful UK residents.</p>

               <a name="11070675000047"> The inquiry will also consider the evolution of the Government’s response to developing knowledge of the changing practices of other countries towards detainees in counter-terrorism operations in this period. This will include how the response was implemented in Departments and the security and intelligence agencies. The Prime Minister has asked the inquiry to report to him within one year of commencing. The inquiry will identify any lessons to be learned and make recommendations for the future, to which the Government have undertaken to publish a formal response.</p>

               <a name="11070675000048"> The Government hope that the inquiry will be able to start as soon as it is possible to do so. However, as the Prime Minister made clear in his public letter of 6 July 2010 to the right hon. Sir Peter Gibson, the inquiry chair, this depends on the end of related criminal processes, the timing of which is a matter for the police and the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>

               <a name="11070675000049"> The Government are grateful to the inquiry for the important preparatory work it has done to date and which it will continue to do. The inquiry is a vital part of the set of measures announced by the Prime Minister that aim to draw a firm line under the serious questions that have been raised about the United Kingdom’s actions. We want to understand properly what happened and to learn any necessary lessons. We look forward to the detainee inquiry being able to get under way formally in due course and will make a further statement to the House when in a position to do so.</p>
