<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="90205m0001.htm_para5"><a name="09020544000019">The White Paper &#147;A New Deal for Transport: Better for Everyone&#148; and the report &#147;A New Deal for Trunk Roads in England&#148;&#151;both published in July 1998&#151;identified a core network of existing trunk roads which serve a strategic national purpose and should remain the responsibility of the Secretary of State. It was proposed that those non-core routes which served only regional or local purposes should be transferred to local highway authority management. This transfer of management, known as de-trunking, allows the Highways Agency to concentrate on the operation of the strategic trunk road network, while enabling local authorities to consider their own priorities for the improvement of non-core routes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="90205m0001.htm_para6"><a name="09020544000020">The Government provide funding to local authorities for the maintenance of the roads transferred. Revenue support is provided in addition to the general revenue support grant (RSG) provided to local authorities. Like the RSG the de-trunking revenue support is paid through area-based grants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="90205m0001.htm_para7"><a name="09020544000021">We also provide capital funding for individual maintenance projects authorities wish to carry out in addition to their routine maintenance programme.

 Local authorities and passenger transport authorities have a duty to promote effective public transport for their area. From time to time they wish to bring forward proposals for new or enhanced rail services. They have the required powers to secure the provision of such services but they are sometimes inhibited by the risk that significant funding may need to be committed over the long term. I am keen to encourage the best solutions for identified local needs, and have therefore considered how to make it easier for authorities to develop rail options.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="90205m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09020544000023">I would therefore like to announce to the House the Government&#146;s intention to fund in control period 5 (2014-19) the provision of new or enhanced services promoted by authorities which have rail industry support and can be funded from a budget which would be set for this purpose in 2012.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="90205m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09020544000025">Schemes which the Department would consider funding in this way would be subject to a number of conditions, details of which have been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses and will be made available on the Department for Transport&#146;s website.</p>
