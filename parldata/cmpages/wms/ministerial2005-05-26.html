<p><a name="50526m01.html_spmin1"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Harriet Harman): </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, has made the following written ministerial statement in the other place today, 26 May 2005.
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;On 25 May my Department published a policy paper on electoral administration which seeks views on a number of issues relating to the way elections are run. My hon. Friend, the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs, Ms Harriet Harman has also written to all hon. Members enclosing a copy of the paper and inviting them to respond as part of the consultation process. Copies of the paper have also been placed in the Libraries of both Houses</p>

<p class="tabletext">The paper seeks views on our proposals for changes to the administrative arrangements for elections, in particular on those which relate to postal voting and registration.

<p><a name="50526m01.html_spmin2"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport  (James Purnell): </b> 
 I am pleased to inform the House that the UK Film Council has today announced the 209 cinemas that will be part of its &#163;11.7 million lottery funded digital screen network.






<br>&nbsp;<br>26 May 2005 : Column 22WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50526m01.html_para2">This digital screen network is a world first that puts the UK at the forefront of digital cinema technology. In return for digital projection equipment, cinemas have committed to the showing of more specialised, non-mainstream, films. The result will be an additional 75,000 specialised film screenings in the first full year of the initiative, rising to 165,000 in year four. The digital screen network will ensure that people right across the UK, and not just those in the major cities, will be able to access a broader range of films.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526m01.html_para3">This initiative is in addition to the UK Film Council funding of &#163;2 million a year to support the distribution of specialised films and the &#163;1 million already spent to ensure that more cinemas are able to show films in formats accessible to cinemagoers with sensory disabilities.

<a name="50526m01.html_dpthd3"><h3 align=center>TREASURY</h3>



<a name="50526m01.html_sbhd3"><h4 align=center>Tax Credit Over-Payments</h4>





<p><a name="50526m01.html_spmin3"><b>The Paymaster General  (Dawn Primarolo): </b> 
 Today over 6 million families and 10 million children are benefiting from tax credits. The tax credits introduced in April 2003 are more generous and more inclusive than any previous system of income-based financial support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526m01.html_para4">The introduction of a system of tax credits has been a huge undertaking. For the vast majority of families the new system is working well, providing important advantages over previous systems of support. In particular, the new system is more responsive than previous &quot;snapshot&quot; systems: it allows awards to be adjusted in-year when a family&#039;s income or other circumstances change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526m01.html_para5">I am determined that the tax credit system will do the job it was designed for&#151;to deliver to all families the financial support they are entitled to, providing the right amount of support at the right time. However, at the point when the new tax credits were introduced, problems arose affecting a small proportion of families. Many Members have raised specific cases with me and there has been much discussion and debate in the House, most recently in the Westminster Hall debate that I was unfortunately unable to attend due to illness. I am, therefore, taking this opportunity to provide the House with an update on the steps that HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is taking to address these problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526m01.html_para6">It is now well known that in the early months of 2003&#150;04 the Inland Revenue encountered serious problems with the new IT system, resulting in over-payments and other difficulties. Some families have also found the information provided to them on the status of their awards unclear, which has made the process more difficult.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526m01.html_para7">In response to these challenges I have agreed with David Varney, the chairman of HMRC, that HMRC will take a series of important steps to improve the administration of tax credits. The Department has been working hard with its new IT contractor to improve the performance of the tax credits IT system. The accuracy with which tax credits information is processed is improving. Officials have been working closely with representative bodies, for example, to improve the clarity of the information provided to families on their 





<br>&nbsp;<br>26 May 2005 : Column 23WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

tax credit awards. Further, new streamlined procedures have been introduced to decide cases where the recovery of an over-payment is disputed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526m01.html_para8">These are all important steps forward but there remain key challenges for the Department in delivering tax credits. I am therefore setting out six measures to improve significantly the tax credits system, with particular regard to how the Department communicates with families about their tax credit award; reducing the risk of errors adding to the number of over-payments; improving procedures for recovering over-payments.
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">1. Building on the work already undertaken to improve the clarity of the tax credit award notice and in consultation with the voluntary sector, HMRC will review the effectiveness of information provided to claimants, to support them in understanding the responsive nature of the tax credit system and the risk of over-payments. In particular the Department will develop solutions to reduce the number of cases where people receive unnecessary duplication of award notices.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">2. HMRC will test out new methods of reminding tax credit claimants of the importance of providing up to date information in year on changes in their income and circumstances. The Department will consider options to identify families most at risk of an over-payment and support them through better targeted contacts to ensure their stated circumstances and income are up to date.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">3. HMRC will develop options to improve the quality of service on the helpline, in particular to ensure that helpline operators can track the progress of individual cases in the system, reducing the need for families to contact the helpline on multiple occasions.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">4. HMRC will improve the speed with which it identifies IT system problems and processing errors so that they can be resolved more quickly.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">5. Tax credits are working well for millions of families but the system is new and requires active engagement from claimants. The role of the voluntary sector in providing advice to families receiving tax credits is crucial. I have asked HMRC to develop innovative ways of working with the sector to target more active support on vulnerable families.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">6. HMRC will review the operation of the code of practice on over-payments. Meeting the commitment made by HMRC&#039;s chairman to the Public Accounts Committee in January 2005, the Department will ensure that in cases of genuine hardship where the recovery of an over-payment is disputed, recovery can be suspended while the dispute is resolved.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p><a name="50526m01.html_spmin4"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 Europe must adapt to the changing balance of global economic activity and the rise of fast-growing emerging economies.

 The Government are today announcing plans for a new national, high-quality spatial address infrastructure building on the work already undertaken by Ordnance Survey and local government.

This will be developed and operated by Ordnance Survey in partnership with local and central government. The joint prospectus launched today is available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s website describes the proposal in more detail.

The report is available at: www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/wp18.pdf.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526m03.html_para2">The evidence confirms earlier indications that the Government&#039;s decision to allow individuals from the new member states to work in the UK has been largely beneficial to the UK economy. We estimate that workers from the new EU member states contributed approximately &#163;500 million to UK GDP between May 2004 and March 2005. New EU citizens continue to register employment throughout the UK, easing employer recruitment difficulties and helping to address labour shortages in key sectors. The number of people from the new member states seeking benefits remains exceptionally low. There appears to have been a significant reduction in illegal working amongst accession nationals, and an increase in employment and output in the sectors in which these workers are located, with minimal impact on resident workers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526m03.html_para3">In total 176,000 workers from the new member states applied to the worker registration scheme between 1 May and 31 March 2005, of who up to a third (59,000) were already in the UK before 1 May 2004. The level of applications has fallen since the peak in June and July 2004. Many workers only remain for short periods of time. A recent survey commissioned by the recruitment firm manpower found that of employers who had taken on workers from the new member states half had workers who had subsequently left their employment. 





<br>&nbsp;<br>26 May 2005 : Column 29WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

On average, workers who had left were employed for between three and four months. In future the e-borders programme will allow us to monitor people leaving and entering the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526m03.html_para4">The accession monitoring report shows that workers from the new members states are continuing to find jobs in sectors where there are a high number of vacancies. For example, 8 per cent. of workers registered in the manufacturing sector, which according to the latest ONS vacancy survey had over 628,900 vacancies in the quarter ending April 2005. Significantly, there is evidence from the most recent labour force survey that demand for labour is still outstripping supply in certain sectors, despite the fact that high percentages of new EU nationals are registered as working in these industries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526m03.html_para5">Since enlargement of the European Union on 1 May 2004, macroeconomic conditions in the UK remain robust and the UK labour market continues to perform well. Individuals from the new member states make up just over 0.4 per cent. of the total working age population, and there is little evidence of widespread impacts on employment, unemployment or wages. UK employment currently stands at 74.9 per cent., unchanged from 12 months ago. In March 2005 the average earnings index, excluding bonuses, was up 4.6 per cent. on the year, unchanged from May 2004.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526m03.html_para6">The early evidence from the &quot;Impact of the Free Movement of Workers&quot; study suggests that overall the effect of EU enlargement on the UK labour market has been broadly positive, reflecting the flexibility and speed of adjustment of the UK labour market. The employment rate of individuals from the eight new member states has increased substantially&#151;from under 60 per cent. in 2003 to over 75 per cent. by the end of 2004&#151;while employment has continued to rise to record levels for both the domestic population and other foreign born nationals. In particular, employment has grown significantly in the agriculture and fishing sector. There is some early, mixed evidence that wage inflation in this sector has been lower than in the rest of the economy; further analysis will be necessary to confirm this finding. There are some early suggestions from the analysis that employment of workers from the new member states has led to small localised increases in the claimant unemployment count. However these are preliminary findings, of small magnitude and are expected to be a short term effect. Further analysis will be undertaken to test these findings the effects will continue to be monitored closely over the coming months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50526m03.html_para7">All the evidence from the accession monitoring report continues to reinforce earlier suggestions that individuals from the new member states are coming to the UK for the opportunity to work, not to claim benefits. Over 98 per cent. of applications for national insurance numbers made by individuals from the new member states between 1 May 2004 and 31 March 2005 were for employment purposes. Very few are receiving out of work support or housing and homelessness assistance. For example, between May 2004 and March 2005 there were 1,191 applications for income support, jobseeker&#039;s allowance and state pension credit, and of these fewer than 40 were allowed to go forward for further consideration. Over the same period there have 





<br>&nbsp;<br>26 May 2005 : Column 30WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

been just 43 local authority lettings to tenants from the eight new member states and only 216 people were accepted for assistance under the homelessness legislation. The vast majority of recipients (70 per cent. and 80 per cent. respectively) were in the UK before 1 May 2004. Registered workers continue to be young (82 per cent. were aged 18 to 34) and only 2 per cent. of registered workers had dependants under the age of 17 living with them in the UK. This profile reinforces earlier evidence that the usage of hospital and education services by accession nationals is low.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

Wales, my predecessor my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar), commissioned a public consultation exercise on similar reforms in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland legislation on fraud generally mirrors the legislation in England and Wales and Government took the view that there would be considerable benefit in maintaining a consistent approach across both jurisdictions. The consultations in both jurisdictions produced broadly similar responses.

<a name="50526m03.html_para10">Today, I am pleased to announce the publication of the Government&#039;s response to consultation in Northern Ireland on the reform of the law on fraud.

<a name="50526m03.html_para11">The Government&#039;s proposals reflect the widespread public support for the proposed draft legislation across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The reforms proposed in the draft Bill will make the law more relevant and effective in tackling the wide range of fraudulent activity.
