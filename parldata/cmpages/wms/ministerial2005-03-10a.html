<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50310m01.html_spmin4"><b>The Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon): </b> 
 Since May 2004 Ministers have made statements in both Houses of Parliament and in written answers to the effect that the use of hooding in Iraq by the British Armed Forces ceased at the end of September 2003. These answers referred to conventional forces and remain true with respect to them. It has been drawn to Ministers&#039; attention, however, that UK Special Forces from time to time used hooding as a temporary measure for the safe arrest and transit of detained persons until May 2004. For the sake of completeness the Parliamentary record should be corrected to reflect this.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310m01.html_para10"><a name="stpa_9">Most of the criticism about the use of hooding has related to the obscuring of vision during interrogation. This practice is contrary to the instructions given by the then Prime Minister in 1972 and was ceased by UK military interrogators thereafter. UK military interrogators are made fully aware of this as part of their training and there have been no reported incidents where UK military interrogators have interrogated individuals while they have been hooded.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310m01.html_para11"><a name="stpa_10">Our legal advice remains that the practice of temporarily obscuring the vision of a detained person, for the purposes of initial detention and transit, by the use of a hood is not contrary to the law. In Iraq the initial circumstances on the ground were such that it was judged by certain military commanders that its use was appropriate given the numbers of detainees and in some cases the need to obscure the identities of particular detainees for their own protection.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50310m01.html_spmin5"><b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence  (Mr. Adam Ingram):  </b> 
On 1 November 2004, I informed the House that there would be a series of announcements relating to the Defence Logistics Transformation Programme. On 25 November 2004, following a period of trades union consultation, I announced the implementation of changes arising from the recommendations of the end-to-end review of the logistics process for military aircraft support. I indicated that, in addition to changes arising from air depth support, the application of end-to-end logistic principles would result in a reduction of around 1,500 RAF uniformed personnel and some reductions in MOD civilian posts at some RAF stations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310m01.html_para13"><a name="stpa_11">As part of this continuing process, I am announcing today how the overall reductions in both RAF uniformed personnel and MOD civilians as a result of the application of the end-to-end logistic principles are expected to affect individual RAF stations. The civilian reductions will be subject to TU consultation. These efficiency reductions, together with the increase to the defence budget, will ensure that the Department can modernise its armed forces to meet tomorrow&#039;s challenges.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310m01.html_para14"><a name="stpa_12">Further work to identify efficiencies has now estimated that the reduction in the number of RAF uniformed personnel posts will be in the region of 2,000. With regard to MOD civilian posts, I anticipate that a net additional 70 posts will no longer be required. These changes will form part of the service and civilian manpower reductions of 7,500 and 10,000 respectively that were announced on 21 July last year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310m01.html_para15"><a name="stpa_13">The effect on individual stations of these efficiencies are detailed in the table below. I expect the changes to be implemented by April 2008.

In addition, as part of the SEA new information was collected for example on selected seabed features through seafloor mapping, sampling and photography, and on the offshore behaviour of seals by means of satellite tagging. The draft plan for the 23rd licensing round included offering blocks within the area to the east of Scotland, and also in those areas that had been subject to earlier DTI SEAs (SEAs 1, 2, 3, and 4) which covered the remaining parts of the UK North Sea Exclusive Economic Zone and the UK EEZ to the north and west of Orkney and Shetland.

It also aims to enhance standardised creditor protection for reductions of capital and introduces &quot;squeeze-out&quot; and &quot;sell-out&quot; rights of majority and minority shareholders respectively.

Cycling England will have a budget of &#163;5 million per annum for the next three years to allocate to cycling programmes. It will comprise experts in transport policy, engineering, public health, the cycle industry, local government, cycle sport, cycle training and education. Cycling England will not be a separate spending body in itself, but there will be a presumption that Government will invest the &#163;5 million budget earmarked in cycling in accordance with its advice. Cycling England will monitor programmes and be accountable to the Government group and Ministers for the value for money and effectiveness of its programmes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310m04.html_para3"><a name="stpa_72">We expect Cycling England to extend our co-operation with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in cycling. NGOs in this field bring huge energy, experience and commitment and have been very effective in their own areas of work. We anticipate making better use of those attributes to supplement the work of local authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310m04.html_para4"><a name="stpa_73">It will be for Cycling England to determine its priorities, but we expect its programmes to fall into three broad categories:

<a name="50310m04.html_para5"><a name="stpa_74">Mott Parsons Gibb (MPG), the Department&#039;s technical advisers for the channel tunnel rail link (CTRL) project, subsequently undertook a thorough review of the case for the phase 2 London underground works, in consultation with key stakeholders who might be affected by a change from the original plans for implementing these works. I have placed copies of MPG&#039;s final report to Ministers in the House Library. Copies are also available on the Department&#039;s website.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310m04.html_para6"><a name="stpa_75">The report examined a range of options for the works, and their practical, operational, and financial implications. The main conclusions were as follows:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44">significant growth in demand is expected at King&#039;s Cross interchange, arising not only from general traffic growth, but also from passengers using the CTRL once it is open to traffic, and demand from major redevelopment schemes in the King&#039;s Cross area;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45">without the phase 2 LUL works (the northern ticket hall and associated tunnels to the deep tube lines), passenger demand at the King&#039;s Cross interchange would exceed safe operational levels by about 2011, resulting in the need for temporary closures at peak times;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">there are close physical and programme inter-relationships between LUL&#039;s proposed works, Network Rail&#039;s plans for a new western concourse and the King&#039;s Cross central development, with significant benefits from delivery of them together in an integrated way;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47">of the options for the LUL Phase 2 works, the cheapest would be outright cancellation, but this would have severe implications for the future ability of the interchange to cope with demand;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48">delivery of the Phase 2 works by 2011 would avoid this problem: were a decision taken to proceed, it would be most cost-effective to do so with the minimum delay.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50310m04.html_para7"><a name="stpa_76">On this basis, the Government have concluded that the phase 2 works, including the northern ticket hall, should proceed without further delay, and that these should be co-ordinated with development of plans for the NR western concourse in order to ensure an integrated overall design and programme which should deliver the combined scheme as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible. The Department is now taking this forward with London Underground, Network Rail and other key stakeholders.

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="50310m04.html_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Transport  (Mr. Alistair Darling): </b> 
 Following the Madrid rail attacks in March 2004, the Government undertook a comprehensive review to examine rail security measures already in place in the UK and investigate new ideas and ways of improving current measures. It was undertaken in conjunction with the British Transport Police (BTP), industry and other Government Departments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310m04.html_para8"><a name="stpa_77">Rail and underground security in the UK already has strong foundations in place which have been developed over time to deter the Irish terrorist threat. The review built on lessons learnt from this threat but also focused on the different methods used increasingly by international terrorists. It also took account of the obvious constraints and practical difficulties in trying to secure the open, mass-transit system that characterises the rail network today.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50310m04.html_para9">What the review did was to identify a package of short, medium and long-term measures to enhance rail counter-terrorist security. A key feature of the review was to ensure that the measures were proportionate, pragmatic, sustainable and did not place an undue burden on industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310m04.html_para10"><a name="stpa_78">The resulting measures are producing incremental enhancements in the security of the rail network, without requiring a significant shift in the open nature of the rail system. Each of the measures seeks to address the vulnerabilities of the existing security regime and goes some way in deterring potential terrorist activity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310m04.html_para11"><a name="stpa_79">Significant progress has been achieved with the industry so far in translating these recommendations into real changes on the ground. Some examples include:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49">More frequent and varied security announcements on trains and at stations to increase passenger awareness</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54">Work to bring the Glasgow Subway and Docklands Light Railway under formal security regulation is at an advanced stage</p>

<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56">Agreement with Network Rail to deploy a range of additional security measures to monitor rail infrastructure security</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50310m04.html_para12"><a name="stpa_80">A vital element in maintaining the security of the railways and deterring potential terrorist activity rests with the BTP, who acts as the first line of defence in combating the threat posed by terrorism on the railways. It has security capabilities unavailable to railway operators which include:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57">high-profile policing</p>

<p>


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58">increased use of explosive sniffer dogs</p>

<p>
<a name="50310m04.html_para13"><a name="stpa_81">Working in partnership with the Department and the industry, the BTP supplements the operators&#039; protective security procedures. In addition, agreement has been reached with the Association of Chief Police Officers to enhance the BTP&#039;s policing presence in the event of a heightened threat level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310m04.html_para14"><a name="stpa_82">In response to the changing security environment, the Government has taken concrete steps to position the rail industry and the travelling public against the new threats faced today from international terrorism.






<br>&nbsp;<br>10 Mar 2005 : Column 132WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50310m04.html_para15">The outcomes from the review and the enhanced policing operations make a genuine difference to the security measures in place prior to the terrorist attacks in Madrid. Combined, the measures are improving the way security is administered by industry and the BTP, and perceived by the public.

<p><a name="st_15"><a name="50310m05.html_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Mr. Chris Pond): </b> 
 A consultation exercise has been launched today on the Government&#039;s proposals to extend the range of benefit fraud offences that local authorities in Great Britain are able to investigate. At present, legislation allows local authorities to investigate fraud against local benefits, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. However, legal opinion has suggested that it does not allow them to investigate fraud against the national benefits administered by the Department for Work and Pensions even though they have traditionally investigated such fraud in the past. This limits the powers of local authorities: it is harder for them to tackle fraud against a local benefit which also involves fraud against a national benefit even where the offence involves the same or similar facts. We estimate that around 70 per cent. of fraud against a local benefit also involves fraud against a national benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310m05.html_para0"><a name="stpa_83">Most cases of benefit fraud will continue to be investigated by the DWP. However the proposed changes will give local authorities clear powers, once more, to investigate and prosecute offences against national benefits. This will be permitted in cases where their abilities to investigate and prosecute offences against local benefits will be hampered if the national benefit offence is not also investigated. While it is proposed that Scottish local authorities be allowed to investigate offences against national benefit the power to prosecute will not apply in Scotland where the Procurator Fiscal is responsible for the prosecution of all criminal offences. The Government proposes to make the changes by a Regulatory Reform Order.
