 In September last year I announced Government&#146;s commitment to study the feasibility of generating electricity from the tidal range of the Severn estuary, which&#151;as the recent report of the Sustainable Development Commission confirmed&#151;has the potential to generate some 5 per cent. of UK electricity from a renewable indigenous resource. I am publishing today the terms of reference for the study. These are:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="80122m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08012266000017">The work will be carried out by a cross-Whitehall team led from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, including representatives of the Welsh Assembly Government and the South West Regional Development Agency, taking external advice as necessary and engaging stakeholders and the wider public. The study is expected to last roughly two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="80122m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08012266000018">The study will look at the range of options for power generation from the Severn estuary tidal range, including barrages, lagoons and other technologies. It will include a strategic environmental assessment of plans for generating electricity from the Severn estuary tidal range to ensure a detailed understanding of its environmental resource, recognising the nature conservation significance of the estuary.</p>

 I represented the United Kingdom at the December 2007 Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels. The Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and Environment, Richard Lochhead, and the Northern Irish Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Michelle Gildernew, also attended.</p>

I voted in favour as the reform satisfied our main negotiating objectives, in particular the phasing out of restrictions on vineyard planting, including a derogation that will allow the continued development of the small UK wine production sector; the phasing out of EU schemes for disposing of surplus wine and wine products; satisfactory rules on wine making practices, in particular on enrichment; and provision for clearer, simpler labelling of EU wines. In addition it was important that the reform package did not result in an increase in the recent level of expenditure on wine.</p>

Significant rainfall in recent days, on already saturated catchments and flood plains, has caused river levels to rise sharply, including on the River Severn, the Rivers Yarrow and Darwen in Lancashire and the Rivers Colne, Calder and Aire in West Yorkshire. Reports are still coming in of the number of properties flooded from rivers and surface water but current indications are that this is of the order of 500. Some businesses have been  <br>

affected and there have been a number of school closures, often because of transport problems rather than flooding of the school itself. Roads (including some motorways and trunk roads) and railways have been hit in the affected areas leading to delays. Before travelling, people are encouraged to check the weather forecast and travel information provided by local and national media, and if planning to use public transport, to check with the relevant transport operator. There have been no significant problems so far for essential services including water and power supplies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="80122m0001.htm_para21"><a name="08012266000040">The severe flood warning that remains is on the River Severn around Bewdley. However, with further heavy rain forecast for the north-west tomorrow, and as rivers continue to react to recent rainfall, further severe flood warnings cannot be ruled out. However, forecast rainfall totals in the days thereafter are less than over the past week and the overall situation is likely to ease. However, the Environment Agency continues to work closely with local authorities, fire and rescue services, the police and others, and all remain on high alert in at-risk areas. The House should be aware that catchments are saturated and floodplain storage is full in many areas making rivers very sensitive to further rainfall. The risk of further flooding therefore remains high in some areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="80122m0001.htm_para22"><a name="08012266000041">The House will sympathise greatly with all those people whose homes have been flooded and will understand the anxiety of people who may be affected, especially those who were flooded last summer. For the country as a whole, the flooding we have seen in the past week equates approximately to the type of event we would expect to see every three to four years. While river levels have been very high in some areas, overall the flooding so far has been much less than last summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="80122m0001.htm_para23"><a name="08012266000042">We urge people to remain vigilant and to keep away from flood waters, for their own safety. People should also have their electrics checked when returning to flooded homes. We also ask everyone to be good neighbours, especially where elderly or vulnerable people live nearby. Anyone concerned about flooding should call the Environment Agency&#146;s floodline on: 0845 988 1188, or look at their website: www.environment-agency.gov.uk which gives the most up to date information and also offers advice on how to prepare for the possibility of floods.</p>
