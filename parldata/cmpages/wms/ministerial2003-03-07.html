<a name="30307m01.html_spmin0"><B>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry:</B> 
 The current British Energy ("BE") Credit Facility Agreement (CFA) came into effect in September 2002 and expires on 9 March 2003.
<P>

<a name="30307m01.html_para0">In my statement to the House on 24 February, I confirmed that the Government would be prepared to continue to fund BE's operations while its restructuring plan was agreed and implemented, and that I was willing to extend the credit facility at a reduced level for a period after 9 March. In that statement, I also confirmed that I intended to apply for state aids approval from the European Commission for this continued financing as Restructuring Aid. This application is being sent to the Commission today.
<P>

<a name="30307m01.html_para1">Sufficient proceeds have been received from the sale of BE's stake in Bruce Power to enable BE to repay all outstanding amounts under the credit facility (amounting to about &#163;215 million including interest and commission) to my Department today. On a contingency basis, I have decided with BE's agreement, to continue the credit facility, with the maximum amount available being reduced from &#163;650 million to &#163;200 million.
<P>

<a name="30307m01.html_para2">The credit facility will be extended to the earlier of 30 September 2004 or the date on which the restructuring plan becomes effective. The controls governing any drawings proposed by BE will remain in place. The credit facility will become repayable if certain milestones in the restructuring process are not achieved. We shall therefore continue to be ready with contingency plans for the administration of BE to ensure safety and security of supply.

<a name="30307m01.html_spmin1"><B>The Minister for Energy and Construction   (Mr. Brian Wilson): </B> 
 As announced in the recently published Energy White Paper (Cm 5761) we propose to establish a Sustainable Energy Policy Advisory Board. Against this background we have reviewed the position of the Energy Advisory Panel.
<P>

<a name="30307m01.html_para3">The Panel has provided very valuable assistance in our analysis of energy policy issues since it was established in 1993. This assistance has included advising Ministers direct as well as Departments. I am 



<P>
<P>7 Mar 2003 : Column 90WS<P>
particularly grateful for its recent expert help in advising us in relation to the analysis underlying the Energy White Paper.
<P>

<a name="30307m01.html_para4">The Sustainable Energy Policy Advisory Board will advise the new Ministerial Group which will oversee the delivery of the commitments in the White Paper. The Advisory Board will be made up of senior, independent experts. It will provide the Ministerial group with a source of well-informed, independent advice on the approach and work of the network of departmental policy units involved in delivering the white paper. We shall be appointing members to the Advisory Board in due course.
<P>

<a name="30307m01.html_para5">We therefore propose to wind up the existing Energy Advisory Panel and I am writing to the Panel members thanking them for their service.

<a name="30307m01.html_spmin3"><B>The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration   (Beverley Hughes): </B> 
 I have previously announced an independent review of the operations of the National Asylum Support Service (NASS). The independent Review has now been established with the following terms of reference:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To review the organisation, management and staffing and expertise within NASS to identify changes necessary in the short to medium term to enable it consistently to achieve the appropriate standards of operational and administrative performance. Consideration of the staffing arrangements should include the balance between permanent, consultant and agency staff and the match between the skills of the staff and the job to be done, including the handling of complex and publicly sensitive projects and business. Consideration of the organisational arrangements should extend to relations with the remainder of IND, including whether tasks such as procurement should be centralised within IND and the linkage necessary between procurement and project terms.
<P>
<BR>
To submit a report, with recommendations, to the Minister of State responsible for immigration matters through the Director General of IND by the end of May 2003.
<P>
