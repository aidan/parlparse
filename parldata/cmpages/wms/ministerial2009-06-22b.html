 I would like to inform the House that the Defra policy statement: &#147;Appraisal of Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management&#148; was published on Friday. Copies will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="90622m0001.htm_para25"><a name="0906224000046">This policy statement sets out guiding principles for the appraisal of plans and projects to manage flood and coastal erosion in England. It promotes a strategic, risk-based approach to assessing the costs and benefits of investment. The policy applies to operating authorities in England (the Environment Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards) when considering investing public money in flood and coastal erosion risk management.  <br>

The Environment Agency will publish more detailed best practice guidance in support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="90622m0001.htm_para26"><a name="0906224000048">The intended benefits of the new policy statement include:</p>
<a name="90622m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="0906224000117"><ul><p class="tabletext">A greater focus on early involvement with the community and social factors; including better assessment of impacts on health, community well-being and social justice. It seeks to support the development of options that attract other sources of funding, to leverage Government investment and increase local and regional benefit.</p>
</ul><a name="90622m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="0906224000118"><ul><p class="tabletext">A more thorough appraisal of a wider range of possible approaches including adaptation where it is not feasible to reduce the probability of flooding and coastal erosion from occurring.</p>
</ul><a name="90622m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="0906224000119"><ul><p class="tabletext">A transparent framework for decision making to ensure that public investment represents good value for money.</p>
</ul><a name="90622m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="0906224000120"><ul><p class="tabletext">A greater emphasis on flexibility in future, such as being able to adapt solutions over time as the climate changes. This supports Defra's coastal change policy which is currently being consulted on.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="90622m0001.htm_para27"><a name="0906224000049">The statement follows on from the public consultation held in summer 2008. The draft statement received broad support and the final document published takes account of the main issues raised during the consultation. To build on this, I will review ahead of the next spending review what we want to achieve from Government investment, including whether there is a case for establishing outcome measures for agricultural land and commercial property, to broaden the existing focus beyond households, deprived areas, the economy, and the environment if the benefits justify the additional costs. I will also review the local government national indicator 189, to ensure that it encourages a partnership in tackling flood and coastal erosion through local and multi-area agreements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="90622m0001.htm_para28"><a name="0906224000050">The Environment Agency has also published &#147;Investing for the future: a long term investment strategy&#148; (a key recommendation of Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s review and from the EFRA Select Committee), a new external contributions policy, and &#147;Flooding in England&#148;, a national assessment of flood risks as they currently stand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="90622m0001.htm_para29"><a name="0906224000051">Sir Michael Pitt concluded that long-term approaches to flood and coastal erosion risk management should not assume all costs should be met centrally, and recommended that local areas be encouraged to invest more in their own protection given the private as well as public benefits involved. I hope these publications, taken together with the new UK climate projections, will inform a public debate on what long-term goals society should seek in managing the risk of flooding and coastal erosion given climate change, and how investment needs should be met. This will enable us to face up to the choices ahead, to take appropriate decisions based on the best evidence available, and to deliver sustainable flood and coastal risk management now and into the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="90622m0001.htm_para33"><a name="0906224000058">The GAERC discussed the presidency&#146;s agenda for the June European Council. The European Council will focus on EU institutional issues; financial supervision and regulation; climate change funding mechanisms; employment; illegal migration across the Mediterranean; and external relations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="90622m0001.htm_para34"><a name="0906224000059">On institutional issues, there was widespread support for a positive outcome from the June European Council on Irish legal guarantees, with a view to securing the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="90622m0001.htm_para35"><a name="0906224000060">On financial supervision and regulation, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary agreed the system for micro-prudential supervision needed to be reformed; however, the new supervisory authorities should not have the power to impose decisions on national supervisors or firms, where those decisions would require member states to take fiscal action. On macro-prudential supervision, he agreed with the establishment of a European systemic risk board, but made clear that its chairmanship should be representative of the EU as a whole, not only the eurozone. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary also noted the importance of G20 summit follow-up and preparation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="90622m0001.htm_para36"><a name="0906224000061">On employment, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary made clear that any accelerated mobilisation of the social fund should remain within the existing financial perspective ceilings. He also suggested that June European Council conclusions should call for increased EIB lending, particularly to business and critical infrastructure projects, in order to accelerate economic recovery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="90622m0001.htm_para38"><a name="0906224000063">On illegal migration, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Malta emphasised the scale of the problem in the Mediterranean and its disproportionate impact upon them; they were looking for other member states to help share the burden. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary agreed with the need to address the issue at its roots &#151; it was not enough just to deal with migrants when they arrived, we needed to take a more long-term approach, which prevents the migrants from travelling to the EU in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="90622m0001.htm_para39"><a name="0906224000064">On external relations, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary welcomed the inclusion of an Afghanistan/Pakistan declaration in the European Council conclusions, and looked forward to the Pakistan summit on 17 June. He also noted that Aung Sung Suu Kyi&#146;s birthday would coincide with the European Council; even before a verdict in her trial, it would be appropriate for EU heads to send a message of support from the Council to her, and to demonstrate commitment to democracy in   <br>

There was widespread agreement on the importance of further EU-US co-operation, addressing settlements, securing access to Gaza, and supporting a comprehensive, regional approach. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary agreed and urged the EU to encourage support for the Arab peace initiative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="90622m0001.htm_para47"><a name="0906224000074">Ministers agreed conclusions on the MEPP, welcoming the US Administration&#146;s commitment to pursuing a two-state solution and a comprehensive peace. They also confirmed the EU&#146;s readiness to work actively with the US and other Quartet members to achieve this goal and contribute substantially to post-conflict arrangements aimed at ensuring the sustainability of peace agreements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="90622m0001.htm_para48"><a name="0906224000075">Following the outcome of the elections in Iran, Ministers agreed conclusions without discussion, based on a UK text, setting out the EU&#146;s concerns about the post-election situation, focusing on the need to respect freedom of expression and, while underlining the EU&#146;s willingness to engage with Iran, stressing the need for Iran to meet its own responsibilities.</p>

The Council undertook to review these in June 2010, based on an assessment of progress on issues raised in the conclusions, in particular human rights and political reforms. The conclusions called for the Cuban Government to allow unimpeded contacts with civil society in the margin of high level EU visits. The presidency commented that practically no progress had been made by Cuba on human rights and civil liberties, however the EU would continue its two-track approach and keep open the door for continued dialogue. Developments would be closely monitored with a view to reporting back to the Council by the end of 2009.</p>

 Today the Department of Health is publishing Professor Jimmy Steele&#146;s report on the future of NHS dental services. The report sets out a clear vision for the future of NHS dental services which are accessible to all, provided to a high quality and focused on prevention and improving oral health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="90622m0002.htm_para3"><a name="0906224000099">The report highlights many of the complexities in NHS dentistry and therefore recommends that all proposed changes to dentists&#146; contracts should be piloted thoroughly, and that the recommended changes to the pathway of the dental patient through care should be evaluated carefully. It also recommends much more effective collection and use of information to help monitor and develop the quality and effectiveness of the care patients receive. The Government accept the recommendations in principle, subject to working through the detail of their financial implications. The report recognises the more difficult future fiscal environment, and rightly puts an emphasis on piloting, cost containment and more efficient ways of working. With that in mind, we will begin work immediately to set up the pilots and develop plans for further implementation, working closely with the profession as we do so.</p>
