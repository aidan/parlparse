 It was announced in the Nuclear White Paper 2008 that, in parallel with the energy Bill, the Government will publish for public consultation two sets of draft guidance on what an approvable funded decommissioning programme should contain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="80222m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08022281000012">I have today issued a consultation document which contains both sets of draft guidance. We want to hear from members of the public, industry, financial and other institutions that may be involved in the financing of new nuclear power stations, non-governmental organisations and any other organisation or body with an interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="80222m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08022281000013">The consultation will close on Friday 16 May 2008. Copies of the draft guidance will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

 I am pleased to tell the House that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs will shortly publish a draft of the tax law rewrite project&#146;s fifth Bill, the corporation tax Bill, which is the first of two Bills which will rewrite substantially the whole of the primary legislation relating to corporation tax. This Bill will cover the basic provisions relating to the charge to corporation tax and includes the main provisions used by companies in computing their income. It is planned to introduce the Bill in Parliament by the end of 2008. The project&#146;s four previous Bills were enacted as the Capital Allowances Act 2001, the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 and the Income Tax Act 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="80222m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08022281000015">The scope of this new Bill and the timing of consultation were agreed with the project&#146;s consultative and steering committees which together include the main representative bodies and other users. It benefits from a style and structure that has been developed as a result of consultation over the previous rewrite Bills. Earlier versions of the legislation in this new Bill have been revised in the light of comments and suggestions from tax professionals and others who engaged in the consultation process. There has been extensive dialogue on them between the project team and business interests, tax practitioners, the legal profession and HMRC specialists.</p>

 Over the next year, the Government will deliver the biggest shake up of the immigration system for over 45 years. At the beginning of the year I said reform would include new measures to attack the cause of illegal immigration&#151;illegal working.</p>

Employers who employ illegal migrants as a result of poor recruitment and employment practices from 29 February will face civil financial penalties of up to &#163;10,000 per worker. Those who knowingly employ illegal migrants will face an unlimited fine and/or a maximum two year prison sentence.</p>

We will begin accepting applications for these licences from 29 February. To earn and hold a licence businesses must satisfy us that they are trustworthy, and must agree to fulfil certain duties. We published a statement of intent setting out our detailed policy last November. We have carefully studied and taken account of responses to that statement in finalising the sponsorship rules, which I am publishing today. We are also publishing an assessment of the impact of sponsorship on employers and others affected. Copies of both documents have been placed in the Library of the House. Other prospective sponsors, including educational institutions, will be able to apply for a licence from the summer.</p>
