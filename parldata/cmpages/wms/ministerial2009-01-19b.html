They also committed to reviewing all options to enable the IMF to have adequate resources to continue playing a stabilising role in the financial system. In order to detect macro-economic and financial risks within the global financial system, ECOFIN mandated their experts to identify means to evaluate more effectively the full extent of risks and strengthen collaboration between the IMF and the FSF.</p>

 I am today announcing the decapitalisation rates to be used in the &#147;contractor&#146;s method of valuation&#148; in non-domestic rating valuations in England for the 2010 revaluation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="90119m0001.htm_para13"><a name="0901196000032">Rateable values are assessed independently by the Valuation Office Agency and are generally based on annual rental values. Most are assessed having regard to actual rents but such evidence is not always available. In about 11 per cent. of cases, rateable value is based on capital values, established from the cost of construction and land values, which is then &#147;decapitalised&#148; to give an annual value representing the rateable value. This is called the &#147;contractor&#146;s method of valuation&#148;. The decapitalisation rates used in the valuation are prescribed by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="90119m0001.htm_para14"><a name="0901196000033">Following consultation in the summer, I have decided:</p>
<a name="90119m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="0901196000052"><ul><p class="tabletext">to continue to prescribe the decapitalisation rates for the 2010 revaluation;</p>

Those factors suggest that the range of possible outcomes for the decapitalisation rates remains very wide and that the existing rates are broadly in the middle of that range.</p>
