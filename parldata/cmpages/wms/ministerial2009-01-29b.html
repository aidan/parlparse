 In my response to Lord Sutherland&#146;s report into the delivery of National Curriculum tests for 2008. I gave a commitment to provide the Government&#146;s response to his report by the end of January.

 The Secretary of State for Health, and I are today announcing a 12-week consultation on proposed guidance, advice and information on alcohol consumption by children and young people. This consultation is on two documents that are aimed at reaching all parents, children and young people under 18 as well as health, education and children&#146;s services professionals: the first is new guidance by the chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, on the consumption of alcohol by children and young people; the second contains the Government&#146;s initial ideas for the supporting advice and information for parents and young people in the light of the independent medical guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="90129m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09012990000024">The number of young people who drink is decreasing, but those who do drink are drinking more, more often and at a younger age. Young people who drink regularly are more likely to put their health at risk and get into trouble by getting involved in anti-social behaviour or dropping out of school. We also know that there is a strong link between young people&#146;s drinking and unprotected sex, which can lead to unplanned pregnancies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="90129m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09012990000025">We want to reduce the damage that young people, families and the community experience as a result of youth drinking. That is why we launched the Youth Alcohol Action Plan in June 2008 containing firm proposals to tackle the problems of young people drinking in public places and to work in partnership with the alcohol retail industry to continue to tackle instances of underage sales. In the Youth Alcohol Action Plan, we said that we would ask the chief medical officer to produce clear health guidance in order to help young people to make sensible decision, about drinking, and to support parents to protect their children from the harms associated with early alcohol use. This work has  <br>

The outcome of this review was that it would. Therefore from 1 February 2009 the SDC will be established as an executive NDPB, as a company limited by guarantee, with Jonathon Porritt as chairman (until the end of his term of office in July 2009) and Andrew Lee, previously director of the SDC, as chief executive.

 Patient choice and contestability are potentially powerful drivers of improved quality and efficiency in the provision of National Health Service services. Involving individuals in decisions about their care and offering people a choice of provider, type of treatment, or the time and location of that treatment, are all characteristics of a high-quality, patient-centred health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="90129m0001.htm_para7"><a name="09012990000034">We must ensure that choice, co-operation and competition within the NHS operate in the interests of patients and taxpayers, and that quality is the organising principle. Achieving these aims depends on having a rules-based approach, clear roles and responsibilities for oversight of the system and effective mechanisms for redress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="90129m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09012990000035">The Co-operation and Competition panel was established to ensure that NHS-funded services support the delivery of high quality care for patients and value for money for taxpayers. After announcing on 11 September 2008 that Lord Carter of Coles will take up the post of Chair, I am pleased to confirm that the Co-operation and Competition Panel will open for referrals from 30 January 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="90129m0001.htm_para9"><a name="09012990000036">In carrying out its responsibilities, the Co-operation and Competition panel will work with all parts of the NHS, the independent sector and others to promote best practice, drive improvements in the delivery of healthcare and protect the interests of patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="90129m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09012990000037">The role of the Co-operation and Competition panel is to provide independent advice to strategic health authorities and the Department of Health, and Monitor (for compliance issues concerning NHS foundation trusts), on alleged breaches of the principles and rules of Co-operation and Competition published alongside the 2008-09 operating framework. The rules aim to foster patient choice and use competition to drive service improvements.</p>

FTs are delivering high standards of care and good financial performance. The annual health check ratings produced in October 2008 by the Healthcare Commission showed that of the 42 trusts rated &#147;excellent&#148; for both quality of services and use of resources, 38 were FTs.</p>

Since first being authorised in April 2004, the number of FTs has grown steadily. Of the 225 acute and mental health trusts eligible to apply for FT status, 113&#151;just over half&#151;are now FTs. Now is a good time to take stock of their progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="90129m0001.htm_para22"><a name="09012990000050"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="90129m0001.htm_para23"><a name="09012990000051">One of the key strengths of the FT model is the involvement of local people through being members and governors. The FT governance model is a key part of the Government&#146;s drive to move from a centrally managed NHS towards one that is managed locally, and so more responsive to patients. A recent independent review concluded that the FT governance model works well and offers significant benefits, but also noted that there is scope for further benefits to be realised. In the light of the Committee&#146;s concerns that the governance arrangements seem to be slow to deliver benefits, the Government will work with stakeholders to ensure the potential benefits of FT governance are fully realised.</p>

 In September 2008 my predecessor, the right hon. Member for Bolton West, (Ruth Kelly), announced that &#163;25 million had been set aside for a second round of Kickstart bus funding. I am now pleased to confirm that the competition is launched today, and that we are now welcoming bids for funding for new and enhanced bus services from local authorities and their partners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="90129m0002.htm_para0"><a name="09012990000076">Kickstart is targeted at schemes that have the potential to become successful but which initially might be more marginal in commercial terms and require some financial help to start them off, or which are currently marginal schemes that with some extra support could be made more successful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="90129m0002.htm_para1"><a name="09012990000077">Through Kickstart, we are looking to pump-prime bus services which will contribute to the Department&#146;s overall objectives of increasing bus patronage, and in particular developing bus services as an alternative to car use, bringing with it a reduction in congestion and benefits to the environment. It is also about improving accessibility and social inclusion. This round will also focus on schemes which make use of the new bus powers in the Local Transport Act 2008. We hope this will allow us to build up good practice on the use of these powers to promulgate to other local authorities and operators.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="90129m0002.htm_para2"><a name="09012990000078">The application form and guidance are today being placed on the Department&#146;s website and in the House Libraries. We will also email these documents to the key bodies which represent local authorities and bus operators later today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="90129m0002.htm_para3"><a name="09012990000079">Applications for funding will be accepted through to 3 July 2009, and I anticipate that an announcement of the successful schemes will be made in autumn 2009.</p>

For the United Kingdom, I intervened on the job mobility session, supporting the European Union economic recovery plan and the European Union skills review, and described some of the recent United Kingdom initiatives in response to the current economic crisis. The presidency and many member states stressed the undiminished importance of mobility, particularly for those furthest from the labour market. The key role of education and skills to ensure the rapid re-inclusion of workers was highlighted. The presidency concluded that the current financial and economic crisis only highlighted the need for greater workforce mobility.</p>
