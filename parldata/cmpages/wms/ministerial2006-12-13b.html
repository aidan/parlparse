 I am today announcing the publication of environmental measures in new housing as part of a wider package aimed at tackling climate change by moving towards zero-carbon development. These are:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="61213m0001.htm_para1"><a name="06121362000028">As the Stern Review made clear, climate change is a serious and urgent issue, and carbon emissions are the main cause. More than a quarter of the energy used in this country is used by domestic households. So, to meet our goal of reducing carbon emissions by 60 per cent. by 2050, we will need to ensure new as well as existing homes are environmentally sustainable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="61213m0001.htm_para2"><a name="06121362000029">There is also an urgent need to build more homes. Since the early 1980s we have not been building sufficient housing, market or affordable, to meet demand. On 29 November, we published &#147;Planning Policy Statement 3&#151;Housing&#148;, which aims to increase housing supply to help ensure that the growing number of households have access to decent homes at prices they can afford.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="61213m0001.htm_para3"><a name="06121362000030">But we need to make sure that the new homes are truly sustainable for the future; by 2050 these new homes will make up around a third of the stock. That is why we are publishing:</p>
<a name="61213m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="06121362000031"><ul><p class="tabletext">a proposed timetable to progressively improve the energy/carbon standards in Building Regulations, with a target to achieve zero carbon for all new homes by 2016;</p>
</ul><a name="61213m0001.htm_brev5"><a name="06121362000034"><ul><p class="tabletext">a new Planning Policy Statement on climate change for consultation, so that shaping places with lower carbon emissions is at the heart of what Government expects from good planning; and</p>
</ul><a name="61213m0001.htm_brev6"><a name="06121362000037"><ul><p class="tabletext">a new Code for Sustainable Homes, which will provide a set of environmental standards for developers and consumers to meet on a voluntary basis.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="61213m0001.htm_para4"><a name="06121362000039">These measures will also promote an emerging market in environmental technologies, pushing innovation and driving costs down. A diverse energy market will mean consumers gain through lower fuel bills and warmer homes.</p>

It sets out the three elements: a consultation on a timetable for progressively improving building regulations to achieve zero carbon homes by 2016; a draft planning policy on climate change (see below) and a Code for Sustainable Homes (see below).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="61213m0001.htm_para7"><a name="06121362000042">The proposed timetable would see the energy/carbon requirements of building regulations revised to be equivalent to the following levels of the Code for Sustainable Homes:</p>

This draft PPS on climate change sets out how planning, in providing for the new homes, jobs and infrastructure needed by communities, should contribute both to the reduction of emissions and delivery of zero-carbon development, and to the shaping of sustainable communities that are resilient to climate change. We are putting tackling climate change at the centre of what we expect from good planning. This is why the new PPS will sit alongside and supplement PPS1, where we set out our core objectives for the planning system</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="61213m0001.htm_para11"><a name="06121362000049">The draft PPS sets out where and how planning can contribute most effectively. We expect to see:</p>

They should deliver patterns of urban growth that help secure the fullest possible use of sustainable transport and, overall, reduce the need to travel. New development should be located to optimise its carbon performance. It should make the most of existing and planned opportunities for decentralised, renewable and low-carbon energy supplies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="61213m0001.htm_para13"><a name="06121362000071">We are also publishing the final version of the Code for Sustainable Homes, which sets environmental sustainability standards which can be applied to all homes. A consultation on the Code was published in December 2005 with the Government's response to the Barker Review of Housing Supply. The Code applies only in England, although it will have implications for Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="61213m0001.htm_para14"><a name="06121362000072">The revised Code has six levels. Minimum standards at Code Level 1 are higher than the minimum mandatory standards in Building Regulations. There are set minimum energy/carbon efficiency and water efficiency standards at each level. The Code also rewards other environmental considerations, such as sustainable construction materials, recycling availability, cycle spaces and home offices, with credits towards their Code rating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="61213m0001.htm_para15"><a name="06121362000073">We are proposing that assessment against the Code starts for new homes in April 2007. This will put in place accreditation and assessment arrangements to ensure that new homes can voluntarily receive a Code assessment from that date. We are minded to propose mandatory rating against the Code of all new homes by April 2008, which we believe will encourage take-up of higher environmental standards, and boost demand for environmentally-friendly technologies and construction methods. A further consultation on this will follow in the new year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="61213m0001.htm_para16"><a name="06121362000074"><i>Water efficiency in new buildings</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="61213m0001.htm_para17"><a name="06121362000075">The consultation sets out proposals for setting minimum standards for water efficiency in new homes and new offices and shops. It seeks views on the approaches suggested and on the performance standards that should be set for homes and the workplace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="61213m0001.htm_para18"><a name="06121362000076">These new regulations would provide minimum mandatory standards for water in the building regulations to underpin the minimum standards for water efficiency at level 1 of the Code for Sustainable Homes and will establish best practice in the water efficiency of offices and shops as the norm. The minimum standards would also contribute to the wider package of measures being developed by the DEFRA-led Water Savings Group to reduce consumer demand for water.</p>

sensitive personal information within the meaning attributed to it in section 2 of the Data Protection Act 1998. The 1911 census as a whole will remain closed until 2012, which means that the full census will not be available to order and research until this date. The National Archives views this as an appropriate response to the Commissioner's decision. The Government are concerned to maintain their longstanding commitment to keeping census records closed for 100 years following their creation. This closure period strikes an appropriate balance between the right of census respondents to have information they provide kept confidential, and the access interests of family historians. Therefore, information collected during 1921 and later censuses will be treated in line with this commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="61213m0001.htm_para23"><a name="06121362000087">Lord Triesman along with all members of the CMAG condemned the unconstitutional overthrow of the Fiji Government and agreed with other members of CMAG that such action constitutes a serious violation of the Commonwealth&#146;s fundamental principles as set out in the Harare Commonwealth Declaration. It was therefore decided by the Group, in accordance with the steps set out in the Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme on the Harare Declaration, that Fiji&#146;s military regime should be suspended from the Councils of the Commonwealth with immediate effect awaiting re-establishment of democracy and the rule of law within the country. The implications of suspension mean that Fiji will be unable to participate in Ministerial meetings of the Commonwealth such as CHOGM, and will not receive new technical assistance under the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation. Nor can they receive contacts with the Commonwealth Secretariat, other than those of a mediatory nature in pursuit of the return of democracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="61213m0001.htm_para24"><a name="06121362000089">The Group has urged both bilateral and multilateral actions from Commonwealth member countries to encourage a speedy return to democratic governance within Fiji. CMAG recognised that these actions should be directed to the fullest extent possible at the military regime and were not primarily intended to impact on the population. The CMAG recognised the importance of ensuring that the Fiji people should have the right to select a government of their choice through democratic means. CMAG agreed to send a mission to Fiji to mediate with all parties and to encourage a swift return to democracy. Such a mission may be carried out in conjunction with the UN and/or the Pacific Islands Forum and is likely to take place in the new year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"><a name="61213m0001.htm_para25"><a name="06121362000090">CMAG hopes that the restrictions imposed on Fiji, including the suspension of the military regime from the Council of Europe, will urge a swift return to a democratic and lawful society.

The funding will be used to ensure pupils have more time at school, graduates are trained to find jobs quicker and small businesses have access to microfinance.

need it the most. The funding is linked to a performance framework, developed with UNRWA and the European Community. This will enable the release of additional DFID funding as UNRWA improves its efficiency in management and service delivery. Other donors are considering a similar approach and we will continue to work with them and with UNRWA to improve the situation for Palestinian refugees in the middle east.</p>

 I am today announcing the reinstatement of a franchise agreement with Virgin Rail Group to operate Intercity services on the west coast main line. The train-operating company running services on the route will continue to be Virgin West Coast.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="61213m0002.htm_para4"><a name="06121362000111">The original franchise agreement with Virgin Rail Group provided for the operation of services between Scotland, the North-West, the Midlands and London Euston between 1997 and 2012.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="61213m0002.htm_para5"><a name="06121362000112">The agreement was predicated on the assumption that Railtrack would deliver their contractual commitments outlined in the west coast main line route modernisation programme by 2005. In response to Railtrack&#146;s failure to deliver the agreed terms of the modernisation programme a &#145;letter agreement&#146; was put into place with Virgin West Coast in 2002.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_378"><a name="61213m0002.htm_para6"><a name="06121362000113">The letter agreement provided for the unique circumstances that prevented the franchise agreement from being implemented. It allowed the Government to secure continued passenger services whilst the modernisation project could be rescued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"><a name="61213m0002.htm_para7"><a name="06121362000114">The reinstatement of the franchise agreement is the last stage in the overall programme of modernisation of the west coast main line. It puts our agreement with Virgin West Coast back on a secure contractual footing and has allowed my Department to secure additional public value. It incentivises the operator to reduce costs and has provided a good deal for the taxpayer and the fare-payer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_380"><a name="61213m0002.htm_para8"><a name="06121362000115">The franchise agreement contractualises services improvements outlined in the west coast main line progress report published in May 2006. At the introduction of a new timetable in December 2008 there will be a significant increase in rail services between major cities and faster journeys. Services between London and Manchester and London and Birmingham will operate at 20 minute intervals all day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_381"><a name="61213m0002.htm_para9"><a name="06121362000116">London-Scotland journey times will be farther reduced by 30 minutes, so that by 2008 the journey between London and Glasgow will take four and a half hours. There will be hourly services all day between London and Liverpool, London and Preston and London and Chester.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"><a name="61213m0002.htm_para10"><a name="06121362000117">The agreement also transfers services between Birmingham and Scotland, currently operated by Virgin Cross Country, to Virgin West Coast from 11 November 2007. From December 2008 additional and faster services will be put in place. The journey time will be further reduced by up to 30 minutes, giving an overall journey time of four hours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"><a name="61213m0002.htm_para11"><a name="06121362000118">Further capacity enhancements are being examined across the rail network. My Department is actively examining the needs of the passenger, the economy and the environment and will publish a high-level output specification and longer-term framework for the railways next summer.</p>
