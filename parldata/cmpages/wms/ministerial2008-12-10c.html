 Fun and exciting opportunities to play are at the heart of a happy, healthy and enjoyable childhood. Better outdoor play opportunities are good for children, good for families and good for communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="81210m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08121029000022">Time and space to play safely is integral to delivering our children&#146;s plan ambition to make England the best country in the world for children and young people to grow up in&#151;it is vital to children&#146;s physical, emotional, social and educational development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="81210m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08121029000023">Today, with the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, I am delighted to publish the first national play strategy for England, backed by the children&#146;s plan investment of &#163;235 million. This investment will mean that every residential area has a variety of high-quality places for all children to play safely, and free of  charge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="81210m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08121029000024">An accelerated roll-out of our new investment will mean that children across the country will be able to benefit sooner from improved play sites, and &#163;30 million due to be spent in 2010-11 will now be brought forward to 2009-10 as part of Government action to support the country during the economic downturn. This means that every local authority will have been offered at least &#163;l million capital funding by April 2009, which they can begin spending in line with local plans and supported by our national delivery partner, Play England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="81210m0001.htm_para3"><a name="08121029000025">The strategy sets out in more detail how we will deliver our capital investment programme from 2008 to 2011 so that up to 3,500 new and refurbished play sites and 30 large staffed adventure playgrounds will be built to reflect the needs of children, parents and the local community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="81210m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08121029000026">The Government&#146;s action is a direct response to demands from children, young people and their families for better play facilities in every area. In April, our &#147;Fair Play&#148; consultation set out an ambitious range of proposals to make a reality of our vision for world-class play opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="81210m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08121029000027">This consultation attracted an overwhelming response, with 9,400 children and young people letting us know how they would like Government to support their play&#151;12 per cent. of these responses came from disabled children, reinforcing the need to do even more to make sure that we make play accessible for all children, regardless of their circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="81210m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08121029000028">The enthusiastic support for our proposals in the &#147;Fair Play&#148; consultation underpins the play strategy. The play strategy sets out Government&#146;s commitment to:</p>

The Disabled Facilities Grant programme helps around 37,000 disabled and older people each year to live as comfortably and independently as possible in their own homes through the provision of adaptations. The Disabled Facilities Grant programme provides mandatory grants for housing adaptations including improving access to a home and to the basic facilities within a home such as the provision of ramps, door widening, stair lifts and level access showers.</p>

 In July of this year, I published a discussion paper entitled &#147;Ensuring UK Food Security in a Changing World&#148;. I wanted to start   <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 Dec 2008">

<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2008" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>10 Dec 2008 : Column 54WS</b><br>
a debate on the long-term challenges to our food security such as climate change, increased demand&#151;particularly for some foods&#151;and the energy dependence of our food supply. I also wanted to assess the impact of shorter term issues, including export bans and rises in commodity prices, that are in part a consequence of these same challenges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="81210m0001.htm_para17"><a name="08121029000042">Annual food price inflation has now decreased from a peak of 14.5 per cent. in August 2008 to 11.2 per cent. in November. We expect it to continue to decline over the coming months, reflecting the falls we have seen in oil and commodity prices. The UK feed wheat price currently stands at &#163;88 per tonne, less than half the peak of &#163;185 back in March. Pig prices have edged down over recent weeks, where the change in the value of sterling continues to offset the impact of declining wider EU market prices, whilst cattle and sheep prices have remained relatively level. The average farm gate milk price in September&#151;the latest month for which figures are available&#151;was 27 per litre, 17 per cent. higher than a year earlier, but we have seen price falls in many dairy commodity markets over recent months. The proportion of income spent on food by the UK&#146;s poorest 20 per cent. went up from 15.5 per cent. to 16.5 per cent. at the peak of food price inflation and is not likely to have changed substantially since July. We are doing further work to see what this has meant for food purchasing decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="81210m0001.htm_para18"><a name="08121029000043">We received over 100 written responses to July&#146;s paper and held three workshops. It was clear that many people, from producers to retailers and consumers, feel strongly about agriculture and food. A wide range of views were expressed ranging from support for intensive farming to calls for a radical rethinking about the relationship between traditional agricultural inputs and the food we produce. Issues raised included landscapes, water, food distribution, agricultural research, nutrition, and skills in farming and food sciences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="81210m0001.htm_para19"><a name="08121029000044">Many of those responding agreed that we should not base our food security policy on the pursuit of self-sufficiency, and the debate has shifted to a broader discussion of the complex factors that contribute to our food security. Twenty six countries&#151;including our own&#151;provide 90 per cent. of our food consumption, with the majority coming from other EU countries. In addition, inputs to food production such as oil, fertiliser and feed, are globally traded commodities. Trade with developing countries is also important, and respondents agreed that the Government needed to continue to pursue both radical CAP reform, and an agreement from the current Doha trade round. Nonetheless, UK production does&#151;and will in the future&#151;provide an important contribution to our food supply, which varies widely across sectors, from 10 per cent. in fruit, to over 100 per cent. in cereals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="81210m0001.htm_para20"><a name="08121029000045">As a result of all the comments we have had on our discussion paper, it seems clear that food security is most usefully looked at in terms of the resilience of our food supply chains, access to safe, nutritious, affordable and diverse foods, and ensuring the long-term environmental sustainability of the food and farming sector. Our agri-food sector, from farm gate to retail is hugely important. It is worth &#163;79 billion and employs 3.7 million people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="81210m0001.htm_para24"><a name="08121029000049">The UK&#146;s food security is strongly linked to global food security.

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="81210m0001.htm_para25"><a name="08121029000050">Part of the answer lies in promoting environmentally sustainable agriculture throughout the world.

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="81210m0001.htm_para26"><a name="08121029000051">In addition, the Government will continue to press for the establishment of a Global Partnership For Agriculture And Food Security (GPAFS).

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="81210m0001.htm_para27"><a name="08121029000052">I also welcome the EFRA Select Committee&#146;s announcement that they will be holding an inquiry into the strengths and weaknesses of the UK food system, and the opportunities and challenges the country faces in responding to the global demand for increased food production. DEFRA looks forward to submitting evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="81210m0001.htm_para28"><a name="08121029000053">The Government are committed to ensuring sustainable food security in the face of climate change and a rapidly increasing global population. To do so will require leadership in the UK, co-operation with other countries and a transformation in our international institutions. I will update the House as this work develops.</p>

<a name="subhd_12"><a name="81210m0002.htm_sbhd1"><a name="08121029000017"><h4 align="center">Persistent Young Offenders</h4>

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="08121029000071"><a name="81210m0002.htm_spmin1"><a name="08121029000131"><b>The Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor (Mr. Jack Straw):</b>
 The PYO pledge was one of the Government&#146;s key manifesto commitments in 1997. Not only has it succeeded in demonstrating to persistent young offenders that their behaviour has consequences and those consequences follow quickly, but it has also improved the effectiveness and efficiency of criminal justice agencies in working together to tackle young offenders. In 1997 the average time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders was 142 days. We have bettered our pledge to halve the average time from arrest to sentence to 71 days and in 2007 we achieved 65 days, the lowest annual figure since the pledge was introduced in 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="81210m0002.htm_para7"><a name="08121029000072">The pledge was the first cross-criminal justice system target, and has been an excellent catalyst in bringing criminal justice agencies together to ensure that PYOs are dealt with expeditiously. Alongside the pledge, the criminal justice system is now delivering on a wide range of performance indicators and public service agreement commitments, such as increasing the proportion of serious offences brought to justice and improving public confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="81210m0002.htm_para8"><a name="08121029000073">We now want to build on the success of the pledge by concentrating on the most high-risk youth offenders. The PYO pledge focused on young, prolific offenders, but only after they had been convicted three times. We do not want to wait until a young offender receives multiple convictions before deciding that they are a priority for the attention of criminal justice agencies. We made clear in the &#147;Youth Crime Action Plan&#148; published earlier this year that the priority for the criminal justice system is to target those young people most at risk of offending. The success of the PYO pledge means that we will start from a strong position that should ensure that the benefits gained in terms of speed through the system and cross-agency working will not be lost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="81210m0002.htm_para9"><a name="08121029000074">From next year, we will be asking criminal justice agencies to focus their efforts on a single priority group of young offenders deemed to pose the highest risk. The group will be identified locally by youth offending teams who will determine who should be targeted under the area&#146;s prolific and priority offender programme. These offenders will be prioritised through the criminal justice process, with the application of a premium service by the agencies, and in terms of sentencing interventions. This new approach to addressing youth offending behaviour will be supported by performance measures focused on reducing the reoffending of this group, and on improving their timeliness through the criminal justice system. The reoffending measure will enable us to monitor performance on reducing the rate of reoffending (by comparing rates  <br>

of reoffending as measured by recorded convictions). The timeliness measure will enable monitoring, of the time through the system from arrest to conclusion (whether in the youth court or the Crown court). To supplement these performance measures, we will also use the Ministry of Justice&#146;s time intervals survey to monitor expected improvements in timeliness of all youth cases through youth courts, as a result of the recent introduction of the criminal justice simple, speedy, summary initiative in youth courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="81210m0002.htm_para10"><a name="08121029000075">This new approach means that for the first time, we will be targeting the combined efforts of the criminal justice agencies in a more holistic way on managing the offending of a common group of priority young offenders with an explicit focus on reducing their reoffending. The new approach will ensure the engagement of a wider partnership of agencies, both within and outside the criminal justice system, in working with and prioritising these young people, the continuation of interventions beyond the end of their time in the youth justice system, and a managed transition to adult services as they turn 18.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="81210m0002.htm_para11"><a name="08121029000076">The Office for Criminal Justice Reform will monitor and report on performance both in terms of reoffending and timeliness, and will support and challenge the 42 local criminal justice boards which have responsibility for delivering the new approach. It will agree local levels of ambition with them, consistent with the performance management approach adopted across the wider &#147;Justice for All&#148; public service agreement 24 target as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="81210m0002.htm_para12"><a name="08121029000077">I am therefore, today, announcing the conclusion of the Persistent Young Offenders (PYO) Pledge from the end of December 2008, and the plans we have to continue to deal with those young offenders whose behaviour causes the greatest damage and distress to law-abiding citizens.</p>

response and the wider work we are undertaking to take this agenda further forward beyond the Corston commitments:</p>
<a name="81210m0002.htm_brev4"><a name="08121029000118"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Ministry of Justice is committed to providing additional resourcing in the new year to divert vulnerable women who are not serious or dangerous offenders from custody. We plan to reduce the number of women in prison and to provide additional services in the community for women offenders and women at risk of offending. The resources will be used to build capacity of one-stop shop services and to develop further bail support services better to meet the needs of women. Baroness Corston was convinced that one-stop shop services delivered through women&#146;s centres provide the radical new women-centred approach her review called for. The Ministry of Justice has been working with regional offender managers&#151;and directors of offender management&#151;as well as the Griffins Society to map existing provision and develop a picture of where there is potential to develop capacity. It is proposed to invest in existing third sector providers to enable them to work with courts, police, probation and other statutory agencies to provide support and services to vulnerable women in the criminal justice system.</p>

The pilots are running in Leeds, Bradford, Keighley and Liverpool for a period of six months and early indications are positive. The condition attached to the caution commits the woman to attend a &#147;Together Women&#148; centre for a full needs assessment, providing them with an opportunity to address the causes of their offending.</p>

The new arrangements do not require the removal of underwear unless there is intelligence or suspicion at any stage that an item is concealed. To date this has taken place at HMP Downview, HMP Send, HMP Morton Hall, HMP Styal, HMP East Sutton Park, HMP Peterborough, HMP Bronzefield and HMP New Hall. All women&#146;s prisons will be on stream by 1 April 2009.</p>

This encourages greater use of capacity in female premises by introducing flexibility into the admissions criteria to include women who may not necessarily present a high risk of harm to others. Such women could also benefit from the supervised, structured and supportive environment available. We are expecting to see an increase in numbers of women accessing them in the near future.</p>

The consultation paper contains an important discussion of the principles of sentencing of women offenders.
