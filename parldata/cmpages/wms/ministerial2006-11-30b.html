<notus-date day="30" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>30 Nov 2006 : Column 117WS</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="61130m0001.htm_para30"><a name="06113090000060">The urgent need in this situation was and is to find a means by which some measure of practical assistance can be delivered, in time for Christmas, to those who have lost so much in this collapse. When I heard of the Farepak administration, I immediately contacted the administrators, BDO Stoy Hayward and the British Retail Consortium to assess the level of the problem caused by the company going into administration, and to seek a way forward I had talks with them on Saturday 21 October, both were very helpful and the BRC expressed their willingness to consider&#151;given the exceptional circumstances&#151;putting together a goodwill gesture made up from donations of its member businesses. However they subsequently came to the view that there were serious practical difficulties in the way of their organizing a workable and timely form of assistance. But the consortium, and individual retailers, indicated their willingness to support any workable alternative means of delivering assistance that I could be mobilised in time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="61130m0001.htm_para31"><a name="06113090000061">I therefore took the responsibility of finding a way through the practical difficulties. In the course of the Westminster Hall debate on 7 November, I was able to inform the House that after talks with the family fund, a registered charity with thirty years of experience in helping disadvantaged families, it was setting up a dedicated voucher fund, the Farepak response fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="61130m0001.htm_para32"><a name="06113090000062">To be clear to the House the response fund is not a compensation scheme, it is an attempt to make things a little easier for these families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="61130m0001.htm_para33"><a name="06113090000063">In the last three weeks the family fund and my office have worked tirelessly to establish a fund, sort out a legal basis for the charity and for the data transfer, establish a call centre, website, and media operation, they also contacted businesses and other organisations to seek support in cash or in kind and work with the administrators and other to establish the details of agents. This has been huge logistical task.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="61130m0001.htm_para34"><a name="06113090000064">The fund has been accepting donations from all quarters since then, with the intention of sending as much as can be raised, as a goodwill gesture, to help those affected. It was of course necessary to set a deadline for receipt of donations, in order that the goodwill gesture can be distributed in time for Christmas That deadline was 6pm yesterday I am pleased to be able to announce that the fund has received donations amounting to over &#163;6.3 million, this could increase further as some banking transactions are still being processed. Of this total, some &#163;340,000 represents individual donations a substantial number were also providing gift aid That so much has been raised in a very short time, and for an unprecedented need, is very impressive. I am most grateful to the individuals, firms and other organisations who have responded so generously&#151;and equally to the family fund, for providing the skills, experience and dedication to make this possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="61130m0001.htm_para35"><a name="06113090000065"><i>Government -Gift Aid</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="61130m0001.htm_para36"><a name="06113090000066">The value of the individual donations to the fund has been supplemented by the Government, through Gift Aid this will be in excess of &#163;30,000. The Government will also meet Farepak employees' entitlement to statutory redundancy pay, and any arrears of pay, holiday pay and money in lieu of notice, within the statutory limits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="61130m0001.htm_para37"><a name="06113090000067">The House will recognise that the donations made by the many individuals and companies who have contributed are indeed a goodwill gesture, and in no way a recompense for the losses which have been suffered by so many people. But the generosity which has been shown will at least ensure that those who might otherwise have missed out completely at Christmas will have something to help them through the festive season.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="61130m0001.htm_para38"><a name="06113090000068">In addition to money given to the response fund some money has already been returned and continues to be returned to agents and customers of Farepak by the administrators and under the Consumer Credit Act&#151;by the banks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="61130m0001.htm_para40"><a name="06113090000070">We have agreed in principle with the administrator to secure a large number of hampers with a substantial market value but we need help to get this distributed, we are speaking to some logistical companies about this but any offers of help would be welcome. We hope, therefore, that most people who ordered a hamper will receive a a hamper. However this can only happen if we get help with distribution as the costs involved in using couriers is prohibitive.</p>

The company worked through a network of agents, and money received from the company's agents since that date will be returned by the administrators&#151;some has already been returned. The administrators are hoping to return this before Christmas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="61130m0001.htm_para43"><a name="06113090000073"><i>Consumer Credit Act</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="61130m0001.htm_para44"><a name="06113090000074">Following discussions with the banks agents and customers who had paid by credit card, have been able to reclaim their payment from the card issuer under the provisions of Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. 1974. In addition agents and customers who paid by visa debit card have been able to obtain refunds for payments made on debit cards, though this is not a legal entitlement. From the information currently available, the administrators and HSBC, the bank which handled Farepak's credit card transactions estimate that these repayments may amount to around &#163;4 million of which over &#163;2 million has already been refunded to over 1,500 agents and customers with more to come</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="61130m0001.htm_para45"><a name="06113090000075"><i>Help in kind</i></p>

Help in kind such as the assistance the Park Group and Findel Plc have provided with logistical and data facilities to support the distribution of vouchers.

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="61130m0002.htm_para5"><a name="06113090000085">The Farepak response fund will now put in hand the distribution of the goodwill gesture, in the form of vouchers. As Farepak worked through agents, it did not hold any reliable or comprehensive information on its customers. As a result, the fund will necessarily send the vouchers to the agents. They will send each agent a package of vouchers, broadly speaking in proportion to the total paid this will be in the region of 15 per cent. of the amount they lost. To be clear this is in addition to any money they may receive from the administration. We are asking agents to distribute the vouchers in broad proportion to the payments that the agent knows to have been made by each customer. So far as the fund is able to establish which agents have been fortunate enough to receive a refund for a credit or debit card payment, they will of course not include them in the distribution of vouchers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="61130m0002.htm_para6"><a name="06113090000087">The fund will be putting its instruction file in the hands of the distributors, Park Group, within the next few days. Park Group will start to post the vouchers to the agents early next week. It is of course their intention that the distribution should be completed as soon as possible, and in any case by 18 December. There is no need for agents or customers to contact the fund. However, agents should be aware that the administrators have written this week to all agents recorded in Farepak's database, asking for information on their customers. Anyone who had acted as an agent of Farepak and had sent them any payment in 2006, but has not received this letter by Monday 4 December, should contact the administrators as soon as possible, via the website, www.farepak.co.uk</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="61130m0002.htm_para9"><a name="06113090000090">On the process of the administration, the administrators have, as I have noted, recently written to all those appearing in Farepak's database as agents. The reason for this is that they believe that not all customers have yet registered a claim, and they are accordingly asking all agents to confirm who their customers are, to fill in the gaps in their information. It is of course important that all those who were customers, and the extent of their claim, should be registered with the administrators. I would encourage all agents to respond promptly to this letter; and I would encourage all customers who have not yet registered a claim to do so.</p>

possible, so that as much as possible can be returned to creditors. But as I indicated on 7 November, this can at best be only a small return. The administrators' current estimate is that customers could expect to receive just four pence in the pound.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="61130m0002.htm_para11"><a name="06113090000092">In the circumstances of an administration where there are an unusually large number of creditors, the court has agreed that the administrators should put their proposals for the administration to the creditors by post. This is to be done by 19 January 2007, arid the creditors will have until 16 February 2007 to respond. I repeat that all customers who have not yet registered a claim with the administrators should do so as soon as possible so that they can be included in this process.</p>

While it would be impractical to name them all, I would particularly like to thank the hon. Member for South Swindon for doing so much to put the issue in the public eye. I would like to thank the media, which has helpfully brought out the personal dimension by showing how this collapse is impacting on individuals and particular families; and for publicising the response fund and contact information to help their readers, listeners and viewers to make donations. Above all I should like to thank all those who have contributed so generously to the fund; I should like to thank my private office for all their hard work, the Administrators, Shagun Dubey and Martha Thomson of BDO Stoy Haywood for their invaluable help . The Park Group and Findel Plc both for contributing tothe fund and for providing their facilities to support the distribution of vouchers; and of course I should like to thank the family fund for organising it all and ensuring that the Farepak families who a few weeks ago looked to have lost everything will now at least have a little something.</p>
