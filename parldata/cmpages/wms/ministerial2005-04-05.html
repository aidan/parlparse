<p>
<a name="50405m01.html_para11">The potential benefits of an effective microbicide are very significant. Research has shown that an effective microbicide could prevent up to 2.5 million infections worldwide over three years.

<p><a name="50405m01.html_spmin8"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Mr. Ian Pearson): </b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>

effective; proportionate; compliant with human rights and other statutory requirements; and in line with UK-wide best practice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50405m01.html_para13">The review, which has involved representatives from Government Departments, the police and security agencies, and Government legal services, has now completed its detailed work. I have accepted its recommendations, which have improved security vetting procedures through the following significant changes:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">a range of enhancements to protective security in the areas of personnel, physical and IT security;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">an increased focus on risks and improved safeguards in vulnerable areas, enabling a major reduction in the number of posts requiring vetting on grounds of national security across government while improving, through better use of resources, the protective security of key areas; and</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">the introduction, now underway, of internal appeal processes for existing employees against the refusal or withdrawal of national security vetting clearances, to provide better transparency and fairness.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50405m01.html_para14">I believe that these are positive steps which will both promote confidence in the equality of opportunity afforded by Government employment, and improve the protections for and integrity of important Government activities and public services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50405m01.html_para15">The Government attach particular importance to addressing all aspects of protective security. Work to drive the changes forward will continue. It is essential that in Northern Ireland, as in the UK as a whole, sound protective security regimes are in place to protect vulnerable and critically important public functions and activities from the whole range of threats, including domestic and international terrorism.

 On 3 February 2004 I received a report from the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC). The IMC concluded that the Northern Bank robbery was planned and undertaken by the Provisional IRA. The commission also concluded that PIRA was responsible for a number of other robberies that are referred to in the report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50405m02.html_para0">The commission concluded that Sinn Fein must bear its share of responsibility and recommended that I should consider exercising the powers I have in the absence of the Assembly to implement the measures which are presently applicable, namely the financial ones.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50405m02.html_para1">I announced in Parliament on 22 February that I was minded to remove for a period Sinn Fein&#039;s entitlement to financial assistance payable to political parties in Northern Ireland. Yesterday, having provided Sinn Fein with an opportunity to make representations to me, I laid in Parliament a direction to remove Sinn Fein&#039;s entitlement to financial assistance for 12 months from 29 April 2005, the maximum period permitted under the relevant legislation.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">1. In at least 96 per cent. of incidents, within five minutes of being alerted, take a decision on the appropriate search and rescue response and initiate action if necessary;</p>

The inspection found that since then the situation has improved and the counter-fraud service is now performing to a reasonable standard. It is clear that the council is now committed to improving its counter-fraud service and this was shown by the prompt and positive reaction from members, senior managers and staff to BFI&#039;s findings and recommendations.

The council had cleared these by June 2004 but in doing so training and the development of effective management information were neglected. By October 2004 Flintshire county council was processing new claims in 70 days, a useful improvement but still almost twice the standard time. Significant problems remain with the IT system and these must be addressed urgently. While the benefits service is integral to the council&#039;s corporate aims, objectives and targets for it were not prioritised, job descriptions did not reflect staff duties and lines of responsibility for benefits staff were not clear.
