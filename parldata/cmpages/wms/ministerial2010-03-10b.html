 The EU Competitiveness Council took place in Brussels on 1 and 2 March 2010 and the following is a summary of those discussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="100310m0001.htm_para0"><a name="10031062000026">The main Internal Market/Industry Council items discussed on 1 March were on industry policy, intellectual property rights enforcement and the Europe 2020 new long-term EU economic strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="100310m0001.htm_para1"><a name="10031062000027">Council conclusions on EU industrial policy were adopted after a debate involving divergent opinions between member states, particularly on how much focus there should be on electric cars. The UK (with support from a number of other member states) successfully argued for the importance of a technology neutral approach to EU support for low-carbon vehicle technologies. The UK also emphasised the need for open and competitive markets and for a horizontal rather than sector specific approach to EU industry policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="100310m0001.htm_para2"><a name="10031062000028">A Council resolution on enforcement of intellectual property rights in the EU internal market, which the UK supported, was also adopted. The UK and others called for more transparency in the international anti-counterfeiting trade agreement negotiations. The Commission agreed to raise these transparency issues with the EU Trade Commissioner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="100310m0001.htm_para3"><a name="10031062000029">In the exchange of views on Europe 2020, the Commission outlined its main themes as being innovation, green growth and social inclusion. There was broad support for the Commission's priorities, with emphasis on support for SMEs, better regulation, energy, infrastructure, internal market and competition. The UK stressed the need for increased EU venture capital (particularly for high technology investment) and the importance of the digital economy to the EU. There was general support for the Commission's proposals on governance and for a more social dimension. The presidency undertook to report the Council's discussion to the General Affairs Council ahead of the forthcoming European Council debate on Europe 2020.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="100310m0001.htm_para4"><a name="10031062000030">At a ministerial lunchtime discussion, Professor Mario Monti discussed his preliminary views in advance of his forthcoming report for the Commission on re-launching the EU internal market. He wanted to promote to business and citizens better enforcement, free movement of services, implementing the digital agenda and real economy measures with acceptable regional, social and tax co-ordination policies. The Commission said it planned to follow up the Monti report with a Commission Communication in June 2010. The UK stressed the need to engage with business, to focus on growth and jobs and also the importance of services directive implementation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="100310m0001.htm_para6"><a name="10031062000032">The main Research Council items discussed on 2 March were the research and innovation aspects of Europe 2020, the Global Monitoring for the Environment and Security ("GMES") programme, a Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme ("BONUS") and the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ("ITER") nuclear fusion research project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="100310m0001.htm_para7"><a name="10031062000033">The Commission advised that research and innovation would be a central theme for the new Europe 2020 strategy. The UK said that the framework conditions for investment in research and innovation (R&amp;I) should be improved and suggested using the European Investment Fund to raise a further EUR3 billion from the private sector for venture capital. The UK also called for a greater proportion of the EU budget to be spent on these activities. The Commission said a detailed EU research and innovation plan would be launched in autumn 2010 which would focus on tackling "grand challenges" such as climate change, energy, food security, health and an ageing population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="100310m0001.htm_para8"><a name="10031062000034">At the discussion of GMES, the Commission stressed that it would have a prominent role within a new European space policy, the requirement for an effective governance structure and the need to identify further funding. A progress report was given on BONUS, with the Commission saying it would be a pilot initiative for research initiatives in other European marine regions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="100310m0001.htm_para9"><a name="10031062000035">The Commission also gave an update on ITER, saying it was vital that the project was delivered at a reasonable cost and within acceptable levels of risk. The Commission said that a range of funding options for ITER would be put to the Council working group prior to further discussion at the May Competitiveness Council. The Research Council also adopted conclusions on the European Research Council and on European researchers mobility and careers.</p>

In addition, the rates of specialist pay (including flying pay, submarine pay and diving pay) will also increase by 2 per cent. The Government have also accepted the AFPRB recommendations on a number of targeted measures, including the introduction of financial retention incentives to retain personnel essential to delivering key operational capability and a widening of the eligibility for longer separation allowance.

With regard to general dental practitioners (GDPs), the DDRB has recommended a 1.44 per cent. increase in contract values which the DDRB intend to result in no increase in GDPs' net income after allowing for movement in expenses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="100310m0001.htm_para24"><a name="10031062000055">In making these recommendations the DDRB has indicated that it considers efficiency savings made by GP and dental practices should only be taken into account retrospectively, after the scale of these savings becomes apparent in data showing trends in earnings and expenses. The Government do not consider this approach sustainable at a time when most areas of the public sector are having to achieve efficiency savings in order to sustain jobs and income levels. In view of this, and in line with its evidence to the pay review body,  the Government have decided to abate the DDRB's recommendations for GMPs and GDPs by applying a prospective efficiency assumption of 1 per cent. of contractors' operational costs. This will have the effect of reducing the proposed uplift in the value of contract payments to 0.8 per cent. for GP practices and 0.9 per cent. for dental practices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="100310m0002.htm_para13"><a name="10031062000083">On 10 June, I informed the House that the Department for Transport and the Irish Department of Transport had agreed to undertake an independent assessment  of aids to navigation around the UK and Ireland. Subsequently, the Department awarded a contract to Atkins, who has now completed the assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="100310m0002.htm_para14"><a name="10031062000084">The report of the assessment makes over 50 recommendations, many of which will be demanding of the three general lighthouse authorities (GLAs), and the two Governments, or which challenge long-standing assumptions about delivery and charging for the provision of aids to navigation. Key recommendations include:</p>
<a name="100310m0002.htm_brev0"><a name="10031062000117"><ul><p class="tabletext">The creation of a GLA joint strategic board to drive efficiencies;</p>
</ul><a name="100310m0002.htm_brev1"><a name="10031062000118"><ul><p class="tabletext">The use of an annual target reduction calculator (RPI-X%) for GLA running costs; and</p>
</ul><a name="100310m0002.htm_brev2"><a name="10031062000119"><ul><p class="tabletext">The development of a "roadmap" agreed with the Irish Government on the financing of the Commissioners of Irish Lights, setting out an incentivised financial model, which retains the all-Ireland body while allowing its costs within the Republic of Ireland to be covered wholly from Irish sources.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="100310m0002.htm_para15"><a name="10031062000085">The report also contains recommendations concerning the management of the general lighthouse fund and the charging of light dues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="100310m0002.htm_para16"><a name="10031062000086">Many of the recommendations can be implemented quickly. Others will prove challenging and we will need to consult widely on some before deciding how to proceed. Nevertheless I welcome the Atkins report, which offers a blueprint for the provision, management and funding of aids to navigation for many years to come. The report will shortly be posted on the Department's website and copies will be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="100310m0002.htm_para17"><a name="10031062000087">Last June, I also announced the first increases in light dues since 1993. They comprised a twofold set of increases, with the changes due to take effect on 1 July 2009 and 1 April 2010, providing payers with more time to prepare for the second rise and price their services accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="100310m0002.htm_para18"><a name="10031062000088">The general lighthouse fund that finances the expenditure of the GLAs is now, as a result of careful administration and management, together with better than expected investment income returns over the last year, in a more robust position than was previously forecast. We have also worked closely with the GLAs to identify efficiency savings over and above the 5.6 per cent. reductions I announced last year with further reductions being made in 2010-11, largely in back-office running costs. The Atkins report also makes recommendations to deliver further GLA efficiencies over time. All of these outcomes have reduced anticipated future calls on the general lighthouse fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="100310m0002.htm_para19"><a name="10031062000089">In the light of these factors, and having listened to the views of the GLAs and the Lights Advisory Committee representing shipping industry light dues payers, I have reviewed the level of light dues needed to maintain the fund at a viable level. As a result, I have concluded that we should now implement a smaller increase in light dues levels. I am therefore reducing by 2p the increase in light dues to be paid on and after 1 April so that the rate will stand at 41p per net registered tonne from that time. As previously announced, the tonnage cap will increase to 40,000 net registered tonnes, reflecting the increasing size of vessels that make up the world fleet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="100310m0002.htm_para20"><a name="10031062000090">I have chosen this course of action to ensure that the general lighthouse fund remains able to finance the GLAs and ensure the safety of all mariners, while recognising the difficult economic times that the shipping industry continues to experience.</p>
