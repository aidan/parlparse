 On 18 November 2009, I represented the UK at the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Budget ECOFIN).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="91123m0001.htm_para0"><a name="0911233000015">Finance Ministers agreed to adopt Preliminary Draft Amending Budget 10 (as updated by the Commission and amended during the course of negotiations) to the 2009 EC Budget. This amends the 2009 Budget to reflect latest implementation capacity, thus reducing the level of funding required from member states in 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="91123m0001.htm_para1"><a name="0911233000016">Finance Ministers agreed to adopt amending letter 2 to the Commission's preliminary draft Budget for 2010, as amended during the negotiations. This included the latest information on agricultural market prices and other developments, support to nuclear decommissioning in Bulgaria and additional provisions for dairy sector support. In parallel, Finance Ministers also agreed to adopt the Commission's proposal to amend the inter-institutional agreement of 17 May 2006 as regards the multi-annual financial framework, again as amended during the negotiations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="91123m0001.htm_para2"><a name="0911233000017">During a conciliation meeting between the Council and the European Parliament, agreement was reached on the 2010 EC Budget and to finance the outstanding €2.4 billion tranche of the European economic recovery plan, in full, with no increase to the 2007-2013 financial framework. Financing was secured through a substantial reduction to the agriculture heading ceiling and smaller reductions to other ceilings including administration. This was matched by a corresponding increase to the spending ceiling for the Budget's competitiveness for growth and employment heading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="91123m0001.htm_para3"><a name="0911233000018">The agreement establishes total payment levels of €122,937 billion (1.04 per cent. of EU GNI). The European Parliament is scheduled to vote on its own Second Reading between 14 and 17 December, after which the 2010 EC Budget will be formally adopted. By working with our like-minded partners the Government secured a 2010 budget that was €4.6 billion (4 per cent.) lower than that proposed by the European Parliament and lower than the Commission's proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="91123m0001.htm_para4"><a name="0911233000019">Four joint statements relating to the Budget were also agreed at Budget ECOFIN. These concerned: the continuity of the 2010 budgetary procedure, the simplification and more targeted use of structural funds in the context  of the economic crisis, EU buildings policy and the administration heading in 2010. The Government are supportive of these statements, which reaffirm the importance of community assistance through the structural and cohesion funds, and call for sound financial management and budget discipline in key areas of concern.</p>

The Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) has been asked to take forward work on principles and possible timings, and report back as soon as possible.

The Prime Minister's calls for a rebalancing of risk and rewards in the financial sector were reiterated, as well as the options proposed to address this, which are to be further examined by the IMF: an insurance fee to reflect systemic risk; a resolution fund; contingent capital arrangements; and a global financial transactions levy. The Council emphasised the importance of continuing to ensure strong co-ordination between the EU and G20.</p>

The Government are pleased with the outcome. The directive should ensure a higher level of public health protection by raising minimum excise duties on cigarettes and fine-cut tobacco, which will also help to reduce revenue lost to the Exchequer from cross-border shopping and smuggling of tobacco products into the UK from low tax EU member states.</p>

The error pertains to childhood obesity data for the years 1995 to 2007 inclusive and will affect all publications during these years.</p>
</ul><a name="91123m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="0911233000067"><ul><p class="tabletext">Between 1995 and 2007 there was an error which meant that small numbers of children that should have been classified as either "overweight" or "obese" were omitted from these categories because of rounding of age and body mass index (BMI) thresholds. The revised percentages of those who were overweight in each year differ by 0.1 to 0.8 percentage points and for those who were obese in each year they differ by 0.1 to 1.1 percentage points from those originally published, and 0.3 per cent. to 1.2 per cent. of children in each year were misclassified. In no cases were results significantly different from those presented previously.</p>

Figures within the reports, referring to the children's categories of overweight or obese may be slightly different, but none are significantly different. All figures in the Health Survey for England 2008 (expected to be published on 17 December 2009), main report and trend tables will be calculated using the correct methodology and the time series data for 1995 to 2007 will all be updated using the correct methodology".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="91123m0001.htm_para24"><a name="0911233000042">Dr. Boorman was commissioned by the former Secretary of State for Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West and Hessle (Alan Johnson). following Dame Carol Black's review of the health of Britain's working age population: "Working for a healthier tomorrow". His review also supports the commitment to NHS staff in the NHS constitution that: "The NHS commits to provide support and opportunities for staff to maintain their health, well-being and safety".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="91123m0001.htm_para26"><a name="0911233000044">Dr. Boorman, supported by his independent review team, has engaged widely with NHS stakeholders and has gathered and analysed a large amount of evidence about staff health and well-being in the NHS. He makes 20 recommendations to improve staff health and well-being, which we welcome and fully support and accept.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="91123m0001.htm_para27"><a name="0911233000045"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="91123m0001.htm_para28"><a name="0911233000046">Improving health and well-being is one of the staff pledges in the NHS constitution and Dr Boorman's report contributes to the case for staff engagement and well-being as vital if the NHS is to meet the quality and productivity challenge. Dr. Boorman's report emphasises the impact of staff health and well-being on the quality of care that they give patients. Organisations that have better staff health and well-being indicators also have better patient satisfaction scores.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="91123m0001.htm_para29"><a name="0911233000047"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="91123m0001.htm_para30"><a name="0911233000048">In terms of productivity, the business case for reducing sickness absence is unquestionable: there are 10.7 million days lost to sickness absence each year in the NHS-at a cost of £1.7 billion. Dr. Boorman proposes that the NHS could-as a whole-reduce sickness absence by one third and save the NHS £550 million a year. This has been achieved by other large organisations following strategic health and well-being initiatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="91123m0001.htm_para31"><a name="0911233000049"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="91123m0001.htm_para32"><a name="0911233000050">Dr. Boorman's findings demonstrate clearly to the NHS that investing in staff health and well-being will reap long-term benefits. NHS organisations need to be exemplars in promoting the health and well-being of their staff. By doing this, they support the NHS to play its key role in promoting public health.</p>

The overall  £9.325 billion public sector funding package for the London 2012 games remains unchanged. Within this there has been some movement in the anticipated final cost (AFC) of the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) programme which, as of 30 September, was £7.241 billion compared to £7.234 billion at the end of the last quarter (30 June), against the maximum funding available of £8.1 billion. This is a consequence of the potential requirement for upgrading local facilities for games-time training venues and increases in cost pressures. Savings have also been made on areas including site preparations and logistics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="91123m0001.htm_para38"><a name="0911233000057">The majority of contingency remains unreleased and the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) continues to make strong progress in preparing the venues and infrastructure in the Olympic park.

More than 1,000 companies have won direct contracts from ODA worth more than £5 billion and, as of September 2009, a total of 7,270 people were working on the Olympic park and village.
