</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">review how best to strengthen the safeguards to protect the charitable sector from terrorist abuse and protect donor confidence in so doing; and</p>

</p>

<a name="60213m01.html_para16"><a name="stpa_16">Thirdly, in order to disrupt terrorist networks when they come to light, the Treasury will strengthen asset-freezing mechanisms to make them more proactive and pre-emptive.

<p>

 I wish to inform the House that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, His Excellency Hamid Karzai, President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, opened the London conference on Afghanistan on 31 January. My right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the Secretary of State for Defence, the Secretary of State for International Development and I represented the UK at different sessions. The conference was attended by over 60 delegations.
</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>13 Feb 2006 : Column 55WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

to deepen their partnership, as we work together to build a peaceful, prosperous and democratic Afghanistan. The launch of the &quot;Afghanistan Compact&quot; (a copy of which I have placed in the Library), and discussion of the interim Afghanistan National Development Strategy and of the revised National Drug Control Strategy, all contributed to a renewed sense of purpose and direction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213m01.html_para21"><a name="stpa_21">Many delegations made new financial pledges at the conference, making available over $10.5 billion for the implementation of Afghan Government priorities over the next five years. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister told the conference that for its part the UK would spend &#163;500 million in assistance for Afghanistan over the next three years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213m01.html_para22"><a name="stpa_22">The conference recognised the interconnected nature of the challenges ahead, with progress on security, governance and development being mutually reinforcing. It recognised the cross-cutting nature and scale of the narcotics problem and the threat that this posed to Afghanistan&#039;s reconstruction. Delegates welcomed the newly updated National Drugs Control Strategy. On security issues, it was noted that Afghanistan continues to welcome assistance from international forces and supports the expansion of the NATO-led ISAF. On governance, there was broad support for sensitive handling of transitional justice issues and acknowledgement of the valuable role played by NGOs in Afghanistan&#039;s reconstruction. The conference welcomed the Afghan Government&#039;s plans for economic and social development by focusing on private sector development, investment in key infrastructural sectors such as power, water and roads, and by building human capacity. There was also useful discussion about improving aid effectiveness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213m01.html_para23"><a name="stpa_23">I am pleased that representatives of the Afghan National Assembly and of Afghanistan&#039;s Civil Society were able to attend the conference. Our partnership is both with the Government and the people of Afghanistan and their elected representatives.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60213m01.html_para24">The challenge now is to build on the momentum created by the conference&#151;to implement the Compact so as to bring real improvements to the lives of people in Afghanistan. Early follow-up action will include establishing the new joint co-ordination and monitoring mechanism envisaged in the Compact, to achieve greater coherence of effort between the Afghan Government and the international community, led for the latter by the UN.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213m01.html_para25"><a name="stpa_24">I will set out the detail of UK support for the newly updated National Drug Control Strategy in a separate written ministerial statement tomorrow.

 In 2002 the Government stated their policy to move gradually to a position where the recurrent costs of regulation are fully recovered from service providers. This remains our policy.

<a name="60213m01.html_para26"><a name="stpa_25">Increased fees for registration and inspection will be charged therefore by the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) from April 2006. These are set out in the table. The fees are subject to a 15 per cent. increase over 2005&#150;06 levels, except in relation to boarding schools and further education colleges whose fees already match the full cost of regulation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213m01.html_para27"><a name="stpa_26">In parallel, the Government will address the overall cost of regulation to limit what providers will pay in future. We are also working with the inspectorates, and have been for some time, to ensure regulatory services are provided as cost effectively as possible, and working with public commissioners of care to ensure they understand regulatory costs are a legitimate part of the cost of providing care and need to be reflected in commissioning fees.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213m01.html_para28"><a name="stpa_27">Individual letters are being sent to all providers of care services regulated by CSCI to notify them about the increases.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60213m02.html_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality  (Mr. Tony McNulty): </b> 
 I have, as of 12 February, made changes to the immigration rules regarding children coming to the United Kingdom with a visa or entry clearance issued for the purpose of a visit. Some of these are accompanied by adults; many are not accompanied by an adult even though it has in the past been possible to obtain a visa without declaring that this will be the nature of the journey made. These changes will, therefore, provide further safeguards for children when entering the UK as visitors.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213m02.html_para0"><a name="stpa_28">We will require that a child seeking to visit the UK in their own right, i.e. unaccompanied, must demonstrate that there are adequate arrangements for their care here and that they identify a person in their home country who is responsible for them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213m02.html_para1"><a name="stpa_29">Where a visa national child is seeking entry to the UK as a visitor in the company of an adult, that adult must be identified, and the child&#039;s visa must identify the adult with whom they seek to enter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213m02.html_para2"><a name="stpa_30">At present a child can apply for entry clearance at the same time as other close family members, be granted an entry clearance, and then travel to the UK either alone or in the company of an adult other than one of those who applied for a visa along with them. This can allow children to enter the UK in the company of an adult who is either unrelated or with whom they have little connection. By doing this they can evade the extra scrutiny of the reception and care arrangements awaiting the child in the UK which is given to children who travel unaccompanied. Some instances can be well intentioned but highly irregular, but in others the child is used to facilitate fraud, and can endure serious physical harm. However, the main cause of concern is the subsequent difficulty in tracing these children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60213m02.html_para3"><a name="stpa_31">The Rules will now contain additional requirements for visa national children coming to the UK for a visit, be they travelling alone or with an adult. Each child will be issued with a separate entry clearance vignette. When

applying for a visa for a child, the parent or guardian will be required to indicate whether the child will travel to the UK alone or with a nominated adult. The child&#039;s entry clearance will be endorsed to indicate the adult who will accompany the child. The entry clearance will not be valid for travel other than when accompanied by the identified adult. The visitor rules have been amended to reflect this (at Paragraphs 41&#150;46F of the Immigration Rules).

These measures are aimed at tackling some of the problems associated with unaccompanied minors arriving in the United Kingdom, chief of which is the lack of information about their circumstances in their home country. They will contribute to the ability to act, where necessary, when individual children come to attention after arrival for welfare and other reasons. They will ensure that children who enter the UK in the company of an adult do so in a recorded way, with a specific destination for their future care, and with a record of their parents&#039; details in the place where the entry clearance was issued. The records which this provision will allow us to keep will be a deterrent to abuse, as all of those involved in the child&#039;s travel will be traceable.
