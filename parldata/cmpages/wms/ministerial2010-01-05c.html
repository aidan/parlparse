 I am today publishing the Government's new food strategy-"Food 2030", which follows up the Cabinet Office Strategy Unit July 2008 report "Food Matters".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="100105m0001.htm_para0"><a name="1001052000014">Last August, we published our assessment of the UK's food security, and we held an online discussion forum on the future of food between August and October 2009. In total, over 600 people and organisations responded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="100105m0001.htm_para1"><a name="1001052000015">Food security has come to the fore following food prices rising sharply in 2008 for the first time in a generation, provoking riots in some parts of the world. With a growing global population, a changing climate, and pressure being put on land, we are going to need to produce more food, to do so sustainably, and to ensure that the food we eat safeguards our health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="100105m0001.htm_para2"><a name="1001052000016">"Food 2030" sets out the steps that all those involved in food can take to put us on this path, in particular by helping consumers to be better informed and able to buy healthy food from sustainable sources; by minimising waste; by making sure every part of the supply chain is resilient, competitive and has the skills that match the challenge; and by using science and technological advance to assist us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="100105m0001.htm_para3"><a name="1001052000017">All of this will require leadership and co-operation from all those involved in farming, fisheries, food production and public health. I will update the House as the strategy is implemented.</p>

 The Department committed to the introduction of generic substitution in primary care in the national health service, subject to discussion with affected parties, in the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme 2009.

<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 2WS</b><br>
the Department is consulting on three options for the implementation of generic substitution in primary care in England. These options are to:</p>
<a name="100105m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="1001052000038"><ul><p class="tabletext">do nothing;</p>
</ul><a name="100105m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="1001052000039"><ul><p class="tabletext">introduce dispensing flexibility, but with specific exclusions, so that the arrangements do not apply to a selected group of products on an exempt list; and</p>
</ul><a name="100105m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="1001052000040"><ul><p class="tabletext">introduce dispensing flexibility, but limiting the scheme in such a way that the arrangements only apply to a selected group of products on a select list.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="100105m0001.htm_para7"><a name="1001052000022"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="100105m0001.htm_para8"><a name="1001052000023">The Department's preferred approach is the third option, supplemented by an "opt out endorsement". The reasons for this include considerations relating to patient safety and clinical need, savings to the NHS and manageability of implementation for clinicians and prescription infrastructure providers.</p>

 The Government have been working throughout this Parliament to improve safety on Britain's roads. In recent years we have enacted a number of measures designed to deal more effectively with those whose driving puts others at serious risk. We have:</p>
<a name="100105m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="1001052000041"><ul><p class="tabletext">introduced the new offences of causing death by careless driving and causing death while driving unlicensed or uninsured, which have maximum penalties of five years and two years imprisonment, respectively; and</p>
</ul><a name="100105m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="1001052000042"><ul><p class="tabletext">increased the maximum penalty for serious driving offences, including causing death by dangerous driving and causing death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs, from 10 to 14 years imprisonment (Criminal Justice Act 2003, came into effect on 27 February 2004).</p>

<notus-date day="5" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>5 Jan 2010 : Column 3WS</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="100105m0001.htm_para13"><a name="1001052000030">But we need to do more. Dangerous driving is still too prevalent. We should not underestimate the devastating effect that bad driving can have on people's lives. I have listened to the representations from those who are campaigning for increased penalties for dangerous driving. I have come to the conclusion that they are right, and that the current penalties are insufficient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="100105m0001.htm_para14"><a name="1001052000031">I therefore intend to increase the maximum penalty for dangerous driving from two years imprisonment to five years imprisonment. This will require primary legislation. An appropriate provision will be included in a suitable Bill when parliamentary time allows.</p>

 On 29 December the Ministry of Justice published the consultation paper: "Mortgages: Power of Sale and Residential Property". This fulfils the commitment to consult made in the July 2009 Consumer White Paper, "A Better Deal for Consumers: Delivering Real Help Now and Change for the Future", and follows concerns raised over the outcome of the High Court case of <i>Horsham Properties Ltd v Clark and Beech</i> [2008] EWHC 2327 (Ch).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="100105m0001.htm_para15"><a name="1001052000033">The consultation paper proposes that lenders be legally required to seek a possession or sale order from the courts, or obtain the agreement of the borrower, before selling the borrower's home to settle the outstanding mortgage debt. This will guarantee homeowners the opportunity to access the protections available from the court before their home is sold or repossessed. This will prevent possible abuse of the power of sale in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="100105m0001.htm_para16"><a name="1001052000034">The proposals would apply only to owner-occupied properties and would not affect buy-to-let and other commercial mortgage loans. The consultation paper does not extend to issues concerning the financial regulation of lenders.</p>
