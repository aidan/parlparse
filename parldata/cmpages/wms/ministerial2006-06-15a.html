Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Gordon Brown):</b> Her
Majesty The Queen has been graciously pleased to approve my
recommendation that the following coin should be issued in
2007:</p><a name="06061537000088"><ul><p class="tabletext">A

Prince Philip, a &#163;2 coin to mark the 200th anniversary of the
abolition of the slave trade and a fifty pence to commemorate the
centenary of the Scouting

Airfield</h4><p><a name="06061537000023"><b><a name="06061537000090">The
Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne):</b> Kandahar
Airfield plays an essential role in the British and Allied military
commitment to the rebuilding of Afghanistan, a role that is likely to
increase as the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)
expands into the south of the country. It is important, therefore, that
collectively we ensure the airfield and the aircraft that use it are
suitably
protected.</p><p><a name="06061537000025">The
UK has been using Kandahar as a base for its Harrier GR7 Force since
September 2004 and now has much of our deployed helicopter fleet there.
It is only right that the UK shares some of the burden in protecting
this joint facility. While we currently provide some help, we are well
placed to make that help still more effective. We have a specialist
airfield defence capability that few of our partners have and the
skills it would bring will enhance security arrangements at Kandahar
Airfield.</p><p><a name="06061537000027">I
have accordingly decided to commit the 130-strong 34 Squadron of the
RAF Regiment to Kandahar Airfield. This unit will deploy within the
next few weeks and join Afghan, Canadian, Romanian and US forces
defending the Airfield and its environs. I am 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 68WS</b><br>confident that this is an appropriate national contribution to the
crucial task of protecting a facility of central importance to the
success of the wider NATO mission in
Afghanistan.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06061537000004">Environment,

and Eggs Regulations
2006</h4><p><a name="06061537000028"><b><a name="06061537000091">The
Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (David
Miliband):</b> The Cattle Identification (Amendment)
Regulations 2006, the Cattle Database (Amendment) Regulations 2006 and
the Eggs (Marketing Standards) (Amendment) (England and Wales)
Regulations 2006 were laid before Parliament yesterday and entered into
force today, 15 June
2006.</p><p><a name="06061537000029">These
are technical amendments to the Cattle Identification Regulations 1998,
the Cattle Database Regulations 1998, and the Eggs (Marketing
Standards)(England and Wales) Regulations 1995. The European Union
legislation which they originally implemented was subsequently updated
with new regulations. These amendments update the cross-references to
refer to this later European legislation. The current consultation on
other changes to the two cattle Regulations, which ends on 21 June,
will be unaffected by this
change.</p><p><a name="06061537000030">The
effect of not having updated the cross-references has been challenged
in court. I do not want to take any unnecessary risks when it comes to
enforcing this legislation, which is designed to protect public health,
and so I am now closing that gap and making it absolutely clear what
offences are punishable under the legislation. It is particularly
important that cattle keepers comply with EU law on the identification
and movement of cattle if public health is to remain protected. The
step change in performance by the British cattle industry has been
recognised in the lifting of the export ban on beef and bovines, and
rigorous enforcement of the rules has been a factor in getting the ban
lifted. The powers for enforcement of the egg Regulations are subject
to the same consideration and it is right that the enforcement powers
be updated now by these minor
amendments.</p><p><a name="06061537000031">These
amendments will put future prosecutions on a solid legal foundation.
That leaves a question over previous prosecutions. I understand that
there have been around 250 successful prosecutions in which the courts
have interpreted the references to the EU legislation as being
references to the updated EU legislation. The legal effect of the
mismatch has not been tested until now. It is now for the court to
decide what the effect has been and what consequences flow from that
decision in respect of those who have already been
convicted.</p><p><a name="06061537000032">I
must emphasise, however, that these convictions will have been obtained
in respect of actions that breached the EU legislation designed to
protect public health. I am satisfied that our enforcement procedures
have been, and will continue to be, rigorous. Public and animal health
has been protected by the work of our inspectors, and will continue to
be so.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 69WS</b><br><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06061537000005">Foreign

Leone</h4><p><a name="06061537000033"><b><a name="06061537000092">The
Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Margaret
Beckett):</b> Since 29 March, former President of Liberia,
Charles Taylor, has been in detention at the Special Court for Sierra
Leone in Freetown, indicted for crimes against humanity and war crimes
allegedly committed during Sierra Leone's brutal civil
war.</p><p><a name="06061537000034">Regional
leaders and the wider international community judge his continued
presence there to pose a considerable and immediate threat to regional
security. An attempt to free him by force, for example, even if
unsuccessful, could jeopardise the fragile security of Sierra Leone,
Liberia and neighbouring
states.</p><p><a name="06061537000035">It
is for this reason that regional leaders and the international
community have supported the proposal to hold the trial outside the
region, as is provided for in the agreement establishing the
Court.</p><p><a name="06061537000036">The
Government of the Netherlands has agreed that it would allow the trial
to take place before the Special Court for Sierra Leone sitting in The
Hague. If acquitted, former President Taylor would be free to leave the
Netherlands. If convicted, he would serve any sentence imposed by the
Court.</p><p><a name="06061537000037">The
Dutch offer is conditional upon a State agreeing now to allow former
President Taylor, if convicted and should circumstances require, to
serve his sentence in that State. Once that condition is met, the
proposal to transfer the trial could be discussed again by the UN
Security Council, where a draft Resolution establishing a legal basis
for transfer is already in
circulation.</p><p><a name="06061537000038">At
the request of the UN Secretary-General, I have therefore agreed that,
subject to parliamentary legislative approval, the United Kingdom would
allow former President Taylor, if convicted and should circumstances
require, to enter the UK to serve any sentence imposed by the Court.
This is entirely without prejudice to the eventual location or outcome
of the trial. Former President Taylor's right to a fair trial must be
respected.</p><p><a name="06061537000039">Were
the Court to acquit former President Taylor, we would not be required
to allow him to come to the UK. Were he to be convicted, and
subsequently released after serving a sentence, the expectation at this
stage is that former President Taylor would leave or face removal from
the
UK.</p><p><a name="06061537000040">By
offering these assurances, we are removing one potential obstacle to
allowing the trial to proceed. We are also demonstrating the UK's
absolute determination to see the alleged perpetrators of genocide,
crimes against humanity and war crimes held to
account.</p><p><a name="06061537000041">The
UK has a strong international reputation as one of the world's leading
advocates for international justice. We played a key role in
negotiating the establishment of the International Criminal Court as
well as the establishment of other international 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 70WS</b><br>criminal tribunals relating to the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, as well
as the Special Court for Sierra Leone
itself.</p><p><a name="06061537000042">Agreeing
to allow former President Taylor, if convicted and should circumstances
require, to serve his sentence in the UK sends a strong signal of our
willingness to combat impunity by assisting in bringing those who bear
the greatest responsibility for war crimes, crimes against humanity and
genocide to
justice.</p><p><a name="06061537000043">Former
President Taylor's handover to the Special Court in Freetown was an
historic day for the people of Sierra Leone and West Africa. The
international community must not fail them by asking them to run the
risk associated with his continued presence in Freetown. It is for that
reason that we have decided to take this
step.</p><p><a name="06061537000044">The
UK has been a key player in efforts to support Sierra Leone, Liberia
and the wider region, as it seeks to bring an end to the cycle of
destruction and violence which it has suffered for so
long.</p><p><a name="06061537000045">We
were also instrumental in bringing peace to Sierra Leone, and have
supported Sierra Leone as it has built on that peace, and worked to put
the years of war decisively in the past. Our action today will help to
close the chapter of conflict, by allowing the trial of former
President Taylor to go ahead, which will determine the truth regarding
his alleged involvement in Sierra Leone's vicious civil
war.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06061537000006">Home

the final settlement value of cases in progress and the predicted value
of applications which have not yet been received in respect of crimes

Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):</b> Anne Lambert, Deputy
Permanent Representative, UKREP, represented the UK at the Energy
Council in Luxembourg on 8 June. Discussion focused on the EU's
international relations, the internal energy market and sustainable
energy.</p><p><a name="06061537000054">On
international relations, Commissioner Piebalgs summarised the EU's
external energy priorities as a comprehensive energy agreement with
Russia and coherent, systematic dialogues with key supplier, transit
and consumer countries. He said that multilateral action would be most
effective, citing the need for working together within the
International Energy Agency and on an international agreement on energy
efficiency. He provided updates on the energy community treaty for
south-east Europe, on the EU-OPEC dialogue and on EU relations with
Russia. On Russia, he said that the EU should develop a partnership of
mutual self-interest covering investment, diversification, a
reliability of supply and demand, third party access and
non-discrimination; and that the Commission were considering a
comprehensive energy agreement as part of the post-PCA
relationship.</p><p><a name="06061537000055">In
welcoming the Commission's work, some member states emphasised that
energy remained a national competence and that Energy Ministers should
be informed and involved in agreeing Commission activity in advance.
One member state emphasised that progress with Russia depended on
establishing a relationship based on trust. Another member state stated
that the relationship must be reciprocal and based on the energy
charter treaty principles, ensuring that EU companies can operate
freely in
Russia.</p><p><a name="06061537000056">The
Council adopted conclusions on the internal market. The internal market
had been on the agenda at 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 72WS</b><br>the informal dinner on the eve of the Council, during which Commissioner

Paper:</p><a name="06061537000057"><ul><p class="tabletext">A

December, consideration by the Commission of the strategic energy
review, the DG TREN Internal Market report and the final results of the
DG COMP
enquiry.</p></ul><p><a name="06061537000061">Other
documents to issue between now and then would be the energy efficient
action plan, communications on clean coal and nuclear, and the
renewables action
plan.</p><p><a name="06061537000062">Discussion
of the internal market during the formal Council focused on the role of
regional markets, on steps needed to complete the market and on
diversification. The Commission supported regional initiatives, while
warning that these should not undermine the overall objective of a
single energy market. The Commission said that it would continue to
monitor and assess progress, reporting at the end of the year.
Coordinated diversification of supply sources, relevant infrastructure
and new technologies were also crucial. The strategic energy review
would bring all this
together.</p><p><a name="06061537000063">All
Ministers supported regional markets as a building block to developing
a single market. Two Ministers said that existing regional markets
could be extended to other member states and explicitly invited the UK
to join the north-west market, which now involves Germany, France,
Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Many Ministers emphasised the need
to harmonise regional markets to ensure the development of the main
objective of a fully functioning internal
market.</p><p><a name="06061537000064">The
UK advocated political engagement in the development of regional
markets and in effective unbundling and market transparency. Several
member states supported the UK, though one viewed further unbundling
requirements as
unnecessary.</p><p><a name="06061537000065">On
diversification, many member states identified increased
interconnection, development of renewables and energy efficiency
technologies as the key drivers. Some member states pressed for the
development of indigenous sources of supply, including nuclear power.
Others wanted a common approach to diversification, but some noted that
responses related to member states' individual
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06061537000066">One
member state questioned the effectiveness of the EU emissions trading
scheme carbon pricing policy, noting its significant impact on
electricity prices. The Commission thought that the ETS fundamentally
worked, though it needed refining before the next stage. Another member
state thought security of supply more important than liberalisation,
while another noted that it was developing security of supply
indicators with the UK and
Commission.</p><p><a name="06061537000067">On
sustainable energy, the Council adopted conclusions on a biomass action
plan. The Commission said that, in implementing this, priority would be
given to a proposal on renewable heating and cooling and to the
strengthening of the biofuels 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 73WS</b><br>directive. The energy efficiency action plan would emphasise
implementation and enforcement of existing legislation, measures to
address energy consumption and financial incentives. The energy star
negotiation with the US had concluded with agreement on significant
improvements in standards and coverage. The Commission hoped other key
consumer countries would join. Some member states emphasised the
importance of updating labelling
legislation.</p><p><a name="06061537000068">In
conclusion, Finland, the incoming presidency, identified its energy
priorities
as:</p><a name="06061537000069"><ul><p class="tabletext">Developing

Minister for Industry and the Regions (Margaret Hodge):</b> I
represented the United Kingdom at the Telecoms part of the Transport,
Telecommunications and Energy Council on 8 June
2006.</p><p><a name="06061537000074">The
Council began with a presentation by the Commission on their recently
published Communication&#151;the "i2010 eGovernment Action Plan";
which was largely based on a Ministerial Declaration agreed at a
conference in Manchester during our Presidency. The Action Plan
highlights the social and financial benefits that can be gained through
the implementation of an array of different eGovernment initiatives in
helping to bridge the gap between citizens and
administrators.</p><p><a name="06061537000075">Ministers
were asked to endorse a set of Council Conclusions responding to the
eGovernment Action Plan. These focused on five major objectives: the
need to promote eInclusion through national eGovernment strategies; the
importance of user satisfaction in accessing eGovernment services;
Government public procurement contracts which should be available in
electronic format in all cases; convenient and secure authenticated
access to public services in the EU; and the promotion of public debate
and participation in democratic decision-making. As the substance of
the above is compatible with the UK Government's Transformational
Government Strategy, I leant my support to
them.</p><p><a name="06061537000076">The
Presidency then introduced a policy debate on the future challenges for
the EU's electronic communications regulatory framework which the
Commission are currently reviewing, with a major Communication expected
in July to be followed by legislative changes in December. In their
presentation they highlighted the need to promote investment and
innovation in the telecommunications sector and to ensure the framework
met the needs of an ever-evolving and converging technology and
business environment. In my intervention I stressed the necessity for
full implementation of the current framework by all Member States and
the importance of maintaining the complementary goals of investment,
consumer protection and competition,</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 74WS</b><br><p><a name="06061537000077">On the issue of
wireless spectrum, I agreed with the Commission on the need to make the
best use of this finite resource primarily through market-based
management, which will hopefully create a favourable environment for
the introduction in the market of new information communication
technologies.</p><p><a name="06061537000078">In
the interventions from (nearly all) Member States there was a wide
range of views though with the majority welcoming the approach of the
Commission on both the maintenance of the regulatory framework, which
was thought to be sound, and on introducing market based mechanisms
into spectrum
allocation.</p><p><a name="06061537000079">There
was then a short exchange of views on the Commission's recent
Communication on network and information security. The Presidency noted
the overall problems that exist with regards to information security
and the need to gain the confidence of citizens and enterprise by
assuring them that ICTs and information systems are able to handle
information in an accurate, confidential and reliable manner. Those
Member States that intervened generally supported the Commission
approach.</p><p><a name="06061537000080">Due
to a shortage of time it was not appropriate to comment on Commission
Communications on the i2010 First Annual Report and the World Summit on
the Information Society (WSIS) both of which were under Any Other
Business. On the i2010 Annual Report the Commission highlighted the
need for more work to prevent the EU falling further behind our main
competitors; while on WSIS the Commission reported on development since
the Tunis Conference and looked forward to the first Internet
Governance Forum in Greece in
November.</p><p><a name="06061537000081">Finally
the Austrian Presidency thanked the UK for the strong foundations that
we laid during our
Presidency.</p><h4 align="center"><a name="06061537000018">Belvedere

Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):</b> I have today granted
consent to the application by Riverside Resource Recovery Ltd. to build
an energy from waste power station in Belvedere, South East London.
This decision was taken after careful consideration of the
recommendations from the public inquiry inspector who oversaw two
public inquiries that looked into this application in 2003 and
2005.</p><p><a name="06061537000083">Today's
approval takes into account the concerns raised, and includes a number
of conditions recommended by the inquiry inspector to mitigate any
impacts.</p><p><a name="06061537000084">This
energy from waste station will be fuelled by waste which would
otherwise have to go to landfill. London has a serious waste problem,
much of which it currently exports to landfill in the home counties. I
agree with the inspector that even if London were to meet the ambitious
recycling targets envisaged by the Mayor of London, there will still be
ample residual waste to fuel the station. This decision will make an
important contribution to tackling London's waste
problem.</p><p><a name="06061537000085">I
