 I am today announcing the results of the Defence Attach&#233; network, which was notified to the House by the then Minister of State for the Armed Forces on 7 February 2007, Official Report, columns 924-926W. The review was commissioned to ensure that our resources were deployed in the most cost-effective way, in support of the defence contribution to HMG strategic international priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="70917m0001.htm_para0"><a name="0709172000015">The role of Defence Attach&#233;s is to promote the Government&#146;s priorities in the area of international security co-operation. The principal components of this policy are to strengthen international peace and stability by preventing conflicts, by contributing to the transformation of the security structures of vulnerable states, by assisting and building partnerships with those who may contribute to peace-support operations and by reducing the risk of terrorism through greater co-operation and communication. In line with this policy, we will be strengthening our representation both in Afghanistan, where we will have a Defence Attach&#233; from April 2008, and in Pakistan, where we will have an additional Attach&#233; from April 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="70917m0001.htm_para1"><a name="0709172000016">As part of our rebalancing of resources, Defence Sections will be closing over the coming year in Albania, Croatia, Guatemala, Ireland, Macedonia, Slovakia and Thailand. We intend to provide non-resident Attach&#233; cover for these countries (except for Guatemala) from nearby states and, in the case of Ireland, through alternative arrangements. Defence Sections in Argentina, Egypt, France, Greece, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Poland, the Russian Federation, Spain and Ukraine will retain cover but will reduce their Attach&#233; numbers by one. There will also be reductions in military support staff and more of their tasks will be undertaken, where appropriate, by civilian personnel. The rank of certain military posts will also be reduced at the next rotation to a level commensurate with their role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="70917m0001.htm_para2"><a name="0709172000017">The review of the Defence Attach&#233; network has given an opportunity for us to provide greater emphasis and focus to the MOD&#146;s programme of international engagement, and we have confirmed the importance of the role of the Attach&#233; network in contributing to both defence and broader strategic priorities in the 21st century. We shall continue to review our Attach&#233; network, as we have done regularly in the past, to ensure that our investment is effective and relevant to our international interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="70917m0001.htm_para16"><a name="0709172000034">During the period 11 June 2007 to 10 September 2007, two new control orders were made with the permission of the court under section 3(l) (a) of the 2005 Act and, on 25 June and 4 July 2007, served on two British citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="70917m0001.htm_para17"><a name="0709172000035">Control orders can only be made and renewed if they meet the test set out in the Prevention of Terrorism Act in that:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="70917m0001.htm_para18"><a name="0709172000041">Obligations are tailored to the individual concerned and are based on the risk that individual poses. Each control order is kept under review to ensure that the obligations remain necessary and proportionate. Specifically, as Lord Carlile recommended in his February 2006 report on the operation of the control order system, the Home Office has established a Control Order Review Group (CORG), with representation from law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to keep the obligations in every control order under regular (quarterly) formal and audited review and to facilitate a review of appropriate exit strategies. During this reporting period, four review groups were held in relation to the orders currently in force. In addition, further meetings were held on an ad hoc basis as specific issues arose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="70917m0001.htm_para19"><a name="0709172000042">As a result, during this reporting period, five control orders were renewed in accordance with Section 2(6) of the 2005 Act. Four control orders have expired and one has been revoked since the last report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="70917m0001.htm_para20"><a name="0709172000043">In total, therefore, there are 14 control orders currently in force, eight of which are in respect of British citizens. Four of the individuals live in the Metropolitan Police Service area; the rest fall within other police force areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="70917m0001.htm_para21"><a name="0709172000044">Three of the 14 individuals currently subject to a control order have absconded&#151;one in January 2007 and two in May 2007. One further individual absconded during this reporting period&#151;in June 2007. His control order expired on 31 July 2007. Details in relation to this abscond were given in a written statement on 21 June 2007. Parliament has also previously been informed of a further individual who absconded in May 2007. This individual is currently on remand and therefore when his control order expired during this reporting period no further control order was made against him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="70917m0001.htm_para22"><a name="0709172000046">The anonymity order for the individual who absconded in September 2006 was lifted by the High Court on 25 May 2007. The anonymity orders for the two individuals who absconded in May 2007 were lifted by the High Court on 23 May 2007. For police operational and legal reasons, the Government are not currently seeking to lift the anonymity orders of the other two individuals who absconded (one in January 2007 and the other in June 2007). Finding individuals who have absconded is an operational matter for the police and investigations are ongoing.</p>

2005 Act against decisions by the Secretary of State relating to the modification of obligations imposed by non-derogating control orders. Appeals have been made in respect of 10 modification requests that were refused and one modification which was made by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="70917m0001.htm_para25"><a name="0709172000049">During this reporting period, three court judgments relating to control orders were handed down from the High Court. In the control order review hearing in <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v AF </i>[2007] EWHC 1970 (Admin) the High Court accepted that the Secretary of State had reasonable grounds for suspecting that the individual was involved in terrorism-related activity and that the control order and obligations were necessary to protect the public. The control order modification hearing in <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v AF </i>[2007] EWHC 2001 (Admin) was heard between 23 and 25 July 2007. AF had appealed the Secretary of State's decision to refuse 10 modification requests. The High Court upheld the Secretary of State's refusal to make eight of the requested modifications, but directed that the Secretary of State slightly modify two of AF's obligations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="70917m0001.htm_para26"><a name="0709172000050">The control order modification hearing in <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v Mahmoud Abu Rideh </i>[2007] was heard on 29 August 2007. On  7 September, the High Court dismissed Mr Abu Rideh's appeal.</p>

In relation to <i>E</i>, the Lords also considered the extent, if any, of duties on the Secretary of State under section 8 of the 2005 Act and the duty to consult the family about the impact on them of the control order. We await the outcome.</p>
