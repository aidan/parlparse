 On 18 January 2007, <i>Official Report</i>, column 933, my right hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Tessa Jowell), announced the planned annual increases in the TV licence fee under the BBC&#146;s six-year funding settlement, which began in April 2007. In line with that settlement, from 1 April 2009, the fee for a colour television licence will be &#163;142.50 and the fee for a black and white licence will be &#163;48.00. I have today laid before the House the regulations necessary to bring these new fees into force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="90309m0001.htm_para0"><a name="0903091000015">The regulations also extend the facility for cash payment schemes to the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey, to bring the availability of these facilities into line with the UK; and extend the facility for quarterly direct debit payments to Jersey and Guernsey, to bring the availability of these facilities into line with the UK and Isle of Man.</p>

 The board of inquiry into the tragic loss of 14 personnel as a result of the Nimrod XV230 crash on 2 September 2006 made a number of recommendations to improve the safety of the fleet. Following on from this work the Nimrod fleet is currently undergoing modifications to replace a number of fuel seals and the engine bay hot air ducts. These programmes were due to complete by 31 March 2009 but, unfortunately, problems with the provision of replacement fuel seals mean that both programmes will be delayed beyond that date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="90309m0001.htm_para1"><a name="0903091000017">Our technical experts have advised that in order that the risks involved in operating the aircraft remain tolerable and as low as reasonably practicable, no Nimrods should fly after 31 March 2009, unless their hot air ducts have been replaced. Ministers and the Chief of the Air Staff accept this advice. Delays to the replacement of fuel seals will, however, have no impact on flying since our experts assess that the risk is tolerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="90309m0001.htm_para2"><a name="0903091000018">For this reason, our priority now is to ensure that we modify the remaining aircraft as quickly as possible so we are temporarily withdrawing Nimrod aircraft from overseas operations until early summer. This will allow us to free up the maximum number of aircraft for the modification programme while also allowing Nimrod to continue with its critical homeland security tasks. During this period, we will use other UK and coalition assets to maintain an effective surveillance capability overseas.</p>

The reallocation of these personnel will cause a temporary reduction in routine UK-based Nimrod flying but will not affect our ability to protect UK interests at home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="90309m0001.htm_para4"><a name="0903091000020">We have reassessed the situation in the light of these developments and concluded that the Nimrod fleet remains airworthy and safe to fly, subject to the measures outlined above.</p>

It does not identify any significant airworthiness issues and the findings of the report do not alter previous assessments that the Nimrod aircraft remains safe to fly. Copies of the report will be placed in the Library of the House and on the MOD website. A copy is also being passed to Mr Charles Haddon-Cave QC for inclusion in his review of Nimrod safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="90309m0001.htm_para13"><a name="0903091000030">I want this debate to engage with all sectors of society, with men and women, boys and girls. We need to identify what we can do collectively to overcome and end violence against women. As part of this consultation, we will be holding a series of regional events in every part of England over the next three months to enable everyone to tell us what they think. Discussion and debate are essential if we are to raise awareness of the scale of the problem, and to improve the confidence of women and girls.</p>

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="0903091000042"><a name="90309m0001.htm_spmin4"><a name="0903091000073"><b>The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</b>
 I am today publishing a consultation document on proposals to reform the economic regulation of airports. Economic regulation plays an important role in ensuring that airports, particularly in the south east of England, make the best use of existing capacity, have regard to the environmental impact of their operation and deliver a responsive service to their customers, at an acceptable price.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="90309m0001.htm_para24"><a name="0903091000043">There has been considerable criticism of the current legislation, which has remained essentially unchanged since the privatisation of the British Airports Authority over 20 years ago. I have listened carefully to the points made by the aviation industry, passenger representatives, airport operators, the Competition Commission, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and other interested stakeholders. I have also taken advice from Professor Martin Cave and a panel of regulatory experts, who have been undertaking detailed work over the last few months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="90309m0001.htm_para25"><a name="0903091000044">These proposals are designed to put the passenger at the heart of the regulatory regime. To demonstrate this, I am proposing a number of key changes.</p>
<br>


<meta name="Date" content="9 Mar 2009">

<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 5WS</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="90309m0001.htm_para26"><a name="0903091000045">Firstly, I propose that the CAA should be given, in its role as the economic regulator for airports, a primary duty towards the passenger. Secondly, I propose to put the consumer representation for air passengers on a statutory footing for the first time. I intend to do this by transferring the functions and expertise of the Air Transport Users Council to Passenger Focus. Passenger Focus has a well established reputation as an effective advocate for rail passengers. It is also taking on a similar role for bus passengers. Giving it responsibility for air transport will enable a traveller&#146;s end-to-end journey to be considered within a single organisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="90309m0001.htm_para27"><a name="0903091000046">As further evidence of the Government&#146;s commitment to air passengers, I am also publishing a report &#145;Understanding the Airport Passenger Experience&#146;, which gives more insight into the end-to-end airport journey and the types of improvements passengers actually want. Together with this, I am publishing advice from the CAA on improving the air passenger experience, and the results of a passenger survey. Copies of these reports and the consultation document have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="90309m0001.htm_para28"><a name="0903091000047">I want economic regulation to be targeted, flexible and efficient. I am therefore proposing the introduction of a licence-based scheme of regulation, similar to that which exists already in other regulated sectors. Only the very largest airports&#151;those with over 5 million passengers per annum or with significant market power&#151;would require a licence. This will deliver greater certainty about the ability of airport operators to finance the necessary investment in airport and runway capacity needed to improve the passenger experience. In addition these proposals, while ensuring that passenger interests will continue to be safeguarded, will remove 42 smaller airports from economic regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="90309m0001.htm_para29"><a name="0903091000048">It is also essential that airports take fully into account the environmental consequences of their operations. I intend to give the CAA an environmental duty with respect to its economic regulatory functions. This will ensure that, when operating as an economic regulator, the CAA will consider the environmental consequences of its decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="90309m0001.htm_para30"><a name="0903091000049">I propose that all 13 airports with more than 5 million passengers per annum should be required to produce an annual report on the environmental impact of their operations, and their mitigation measures.

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="90309m0001.htm_para31"><a name="0903091000050">I believe that these proposals are not only an important step forward in their own right, but that they are important enabling measures around which further environmental policy can be developed and implemented.
