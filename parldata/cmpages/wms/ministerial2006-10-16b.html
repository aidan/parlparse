 Economic reform in Europe is vital to the prospects for growth and jobs in the UK. The challenges of globalisation mean that all EU member states must pursue real structural reforms to create a Europe that becomes more competitive as the route to delivering full employment and opportunity for all, and where flexibility and fairness advance together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="61016m0001.htm_para0"><a name="0610166000012">Under the Lisbon strategy for jobs and growth, relaunched in 2005, the Government welcomed the introduction of national reform programmes. In October 2005, the Government published the first UK national reform programme (NRP), setting out priorities for national economic reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="61016m0001.htm_para1"><a name="0610166000013">Today the Government published an update on the UK NRP, which reports on its comprehensive programme of long-term reform to deliver strong economic performance and employment growth in the UK now and in the future. This update demonstrates how Britain is leading economic reform in Europe, showing how an approach based on openness,  free trade, competition and investment&#151;in science, technology and skills&#151;represents the right response to the challenges of globalisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="61016m0001.htm_para2"><a name="0610166000014">Copies of the UK National Reform Programme: Update on progress 2006 are available in the Libraries of the House.</p>

 Schools must be safe places for both pupils and staff. Incidents involving knives and other weapons in school are rare, but we need to give headteachers stronger powers to act if they suspect a knife or another weapon is in their school. The Violent Crime Reduction Bill, currently being debated at Report stage in the House of Lords includes new powers for head teachers to search pupils if the heads suspect their pupils are carrying a weapon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="61016m0001.htm_para13"><a name="0610166000048">We will also provide guidance for schools on screening all their pupils for weapons using technology such as airport style walk-through metal detecting arches or hand held metal detecting wands. Screening can be carried out on all pupils, without their consent and without suspicion that a weapon might be found, provided it is carried out in a way that respects pupils' privacy. If screening indicates a weapon may be present, school staff could then use the new power included in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill (VCRB) to carry out a hands-on search. We plan to issue full guidance to schools on screening and hands-on searches if the VCRB receives Royal Assent.</p>
