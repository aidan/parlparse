 As indicated in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's five-year plan, which was deposited in the House Library on 17 March 2005, we undertook a public consultation between 25 November 2005 and 28 February 2006 about lottery funding for the good causes of arts and film, heritage and sport after 2009, and I am now announcing the outcome and my decision on future arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_381"><a name="60621m0001.htm_para2"><a name="06062153000022">The public told us: there is overwhelming support for what lottery money is used for in the arts and film, heritage and sport; there is very strong support for the existing share balance; and people believe very strongly that each cause is important and want stability and continuity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"><a name="60621m0001.htm_para3"><a name="06062153000023">So I am delighted to announce my decision, which is that I will retain the current lottery shares for arts, sport and heritage for ten years from 2009 to 2019.</p>

 I am today announcing, with my right hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for Constitutional Affairs (Baroness Ashton), that as a result of joint work between the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Cabinet Office, the National Archives and the Office of Public Sector Information will merge, under the joint name of the National Archives.

The Office of Public Sector Information (incorporating Her Majesty's Stationery Office) leads the management of Crown copyright, regulates the re-use of public sector information and, through its HMSO function, has responsibility for legislation and official publishing. This merger therefore presents opportunities to reinforce the growing links between our respective strands of information policy and advisory functions, whilst building on our specialist skills and expertise to provide a joined-up approach to information management and therefore benefit all who work in the information field.</p>
