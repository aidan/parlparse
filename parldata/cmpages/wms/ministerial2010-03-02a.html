<p><a name="st_142"><a name="10030256000018"><a name="100302m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="10030256000118"><b>The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change (Edward Miliband):</b>
 Together with my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and the Minister for Housing, I am publishing today "Warm Homes, Greener Homes: A strategy for Household Energy Management", which sets out the strategy for improving energy efficiency in people's homes through to 2020. Copies of the document will be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="100302m0001.htm_para0"><a name="10030256000019">Improving domestic energy efficiency helps people to make their homes more comfortable, to save money on their energy bills and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This strategy sets out a comprehensive approach to helping people do that across all tenure types.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="100302m0001.htm_para1"><a name="10030256000020">The strategy will deliver greenhouse gas emissions savings of at least 4 million tonnes of CO2 per annum by 2020, ensuring the UK hits its target of cutting emissions from households by 29 per cent. by 2020.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="100302m0001.htm_para2"><a name="10030256000021">The strategy sets out our commitment to support people to install cavity wall and loft insulation in every home where practical to do so by 2015, while increasing the volumes of more significant insulation measures. We will help people to install eco-upgrades to their homes-which go beyond basic measures to include solid wall insulation and/or micro-renewable energy generation-in up to 7 million homes by 2020, on the way to ensuring that all homes have benefited from energy efficiency measures by 2030. There will be particular support for vulnerable groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="100302m0001.htm_para3"><a name="10030256000022">To deliver against these objectives, the strategy sets out a new policy framework. This reflects the fact that the existing obligation for suppliers to support energy efficiency measures is due to expire at the end of 2012, and also the new challenges that need to be overcome to meet our stretching ambitions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="100302m0001.htm_para4"><a name="10030256000023">The strategy has four elements:</p>
<a name="100302m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="10030256000103"><ul><p class="tabletext">An enhanced role for local authorities, including a requirement on energy companies to partner with councils to deliver local area-based programmes and further support for district heating;</p>
</ul><a name="100302m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="10030256000104"><ul><p class="tabletext">New financing mechanisms, including an obligation on energy companies to support people to improve their energy efficiency and plans for legislation to enable households to install measures without upfront costs, with repayments made out of the savings in energy bills;</p>
</ul><a name="100302m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="10030256000105"><ul><p class="tabletext">Universal standards for the rented sector, including a new warm homes standard for social housing to complement decent homes and plans for regulation of the private rented sector;</p>
</ul><a name="100302m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="10030256000106"><ul><p class="tabletext">Support for consumers in understanding their options, including a universal advice service, new standards for installation, and plans to make better use of the energy performance certificate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="100302m0001.htm_para5"><a name="10030256000024">We estimate that the implementation of this strategy will help support around 65,000 jobs in 2020 in the installation and manufacture of insulation and micro-generation, with further jobs created in the wider supply chain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="100302m0001.htm_para6"><a name="10030256000025">The proposals in this strategy signal a step change in the level of ambition for the household sector over the next decade that will put the country on track to meet our carbon targets while at the same time saving families money on their fuel bills, creating jobs and helping to secure our energy supplies.</p>

The Commission said it would release €5 million (£4.39 million) in budget support within the next few days, rising to €50 million (£43.9 million) in the remainder of 2010; and was committing a further €90 million (£79.1 million) in humanitarian assistance, on top of the €30 million (£26.4 million) already committed, probably primarily for areas outside Port-au-Prince.</p>

He highlighted that the EU needed to pursue the dual track policy and also increase the pressure in relation to human rights, whilst the E3 plus 3 pursued work on the new UNSCR. Ashton concluded that there was a high degree of consensus around several recommendations: including that the dual-track policy should be pursued "calmly and steadily"; and that the EU should be ready to support the UN track.

The Commission presented initial proposals for engagement with the new President that set out the reforms required and the EU support on offer. Following a discussion of these proposals, the High Representative noted the support from many member states to engage strongly with the new Ukrainian team, but also the need for progress with reforms on the Ukrainian side.

 The Government of Bangladesh held a high level Bangladesh Development Forum (BDF) meeting in Dhaka on 15-16 February 2010. It was the first such event since 2005, and it took place one year after the current Government took office. The objective of the forum was for the Government to share, and discuss with development partners, their long-term plan to reach middle income status by 2021 (Vision 2021); the content of their new national strategy for accelerated poverty reduction; and their proposed reforms and delivery priorities.</p>

Future programme direction and ongoing implementation of the existing portfolio will be guided by the BDF outcomes and framed by the joint co-operation strategy.</p>

The Government confirmed their desire to establish a climate change multi-donor trust fund, with grant funding committed from the UK, the European Union and Denmark. The fund will by led by the Government with the World Bank providing technical back-stopping and fiduciary management.</p>

 I am announcing today the Government's plans for a new urban challenge fund designed to support local authorities in delivering economic growth and improving the health and environment for local communities in urban areas</p>

<p><a name="stpa_410"><a name="100302m0002.htm_para10"><a name="10030256000091">The Prime Minister's strategy unit report on urban transport and the DFT response "The Future of Urban Transport", published in November 2009, identified a range of transport challenges faced by our cities. It estimated the cost of congestion, in delays and unreliability suffered by road users, to be of the order of £12 billion a year. The PMSU report also indicated that the measurable costs to society of poor air quality, inactivity leading to obesity, and road accidents in urban areas, are each similar to those of congestion. The evidence from the PMSU report is that initiatives geared to tackling the various challenges simultaneously better would achieve "triple win" outcomes in terms of economic growth, improvements to health, and improvement to the urban environment. This new fund will support forward-looking cities and local authorities in delivering these outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_411"><a name="100302m0002.htm_para11"><a name="10030256000092">The aim of the new fund will be to deliver clear and measurable benefits for urban areas in terms of:</p>
<a name="100302m0002.htm_brev0"><a name="10030256000112"><ul><p class="tabletext">enhanced mobility, through offering people wider choices for their journeys;</p>

</ul><a name="100302m0002.htm_brev2"><a name="10030256000114"><ul><p class="tabletext">better health as a result of improved safety and much greater levels of walking and cycling;</p>
</ul><a name="100302m0002.htm_brev3"><a name="10030256000115"><ul><p class="tabletext">streets and public spaces which are enjoyable places to be, where exposure to harmful emissions is reduced, and where quality of life is transformed:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="100302m0002.htm_para12"><a name="10030256000093">The fund will support packages of measures designed to deliver all of these benefits. The packages are likely to include a combination of sustainable travel measures, investment to encourage modal shift and better bus services alongside demand management measures, better and city-wide traffic management and improved street design. Acting together, these measures will deliver a step change in the local economy, the health of urban residents and the environment they enjoy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_413"><a name="100302m0002.htm_para13"><a name="10030256000094">The new fund will replace the transport innovation fund. Work by a number of authorities showed that a combination of measures was necessary to tackle the problem of congestion and could deliver wider benefits to local communities, the urban economy and environment. TIF also encouraged new thinking in a number of areas,  <br>

for example on a phased and incremental approach to demand management. Its weaknesses lay in its too narrow a focus on the issue of congestion, the failure to win public acceptance for the more challenging proposals, and inability to transform governance at the same time as delivering radical change. The new fund will draw on the lessons from TIF and the new ideas that have come forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_414"><a name="100302m0002.htm_para14"><a name="10030256000095">Sustainable travel measures will be a key component of the packages supported by the new fund. The sustainable travel towns initiative has shown that small-scale, relatively inexpensive measures can deliver significant reductions in car trips, increases in bus use, walking and cycling and consequential improvements in health. In order to achieve best value from available resources, the sustainable travel programme for cities will be absorbed into the urban challenge fund. While there will be no separate fund for cities, we would expect these sorts of measures to form part of a wider package of interventions, and deliver even greater benefits than those already achieved through the sustainable travel towns initiative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_415"><a name="100302m0002.htm_para15"><a name="10030256000096">The Department will be considering the future of our current congestion performance fund and targets with a view to ensuring there is an integrated approach to addressing all of the challenges in urban areas.</p>
