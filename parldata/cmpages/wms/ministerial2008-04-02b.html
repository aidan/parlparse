 I am today announcing the outcome of a review of the suspension of adoptions of Cambodian children by UK residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="80402m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08040249000032">In June 2004, the then Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families, the Member for Barking (Margaret Hodge), announced the suspension of adoptions in response to concerns raised and investigated by officials from the DfES (now DCSF) who visited Cambodia, by the British Embassy in Cambodia and, separately, by other stakeholders about the intercountry adoption process in Cambodia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="80402m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08040249000033">A review of the suspension was announced last year and was carried out by my Department. The purpose of the review was to update the information on which the suspension was based, to find out what concerns, if any, remain valid and whether there are any other concerns about practices taking place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="80402m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08040249000034">The review work assessed the current situation in Cambodia regarding intercountry adoption, including what changes, if any, to practice and legislation have been made in the three years since the temporary suspension was introduced. The review also took account of Cambodia&#146;s accession to the Hague Convention (on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption 1993).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="80402m0001.htm_para3"><a name="08040249000035">On 12 December, the UK lodged an objection to Cambodia&#146;s accession to the Hague Convention, in accordance with article 44 of the convention. Cambodia&#146;s accession to the convention therefore has no effect as regards relations between the UK and Cambodia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="80402m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08040249000036">Evidence from the review demonstrates that: adoption legislation, practice and procedure in Cambodia remain insufficient to ensure the proper protection of children and their families; lifting the suspension at the current time would expose Cambodian children and their families to an increased risk of improper practices that are contrary to the principles of the Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption (the Hague Convention) and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="80402m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08040249000037">The suspension of adoptions of Cambodian children by UK residents therefore still remains in place. I will of course consider the effect of any changes to adoption legislation and practice in Cambodia in keeping the suspension under review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="80402m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08040249000038">I am also announcing today the outline timetable for the implementation of the statutory provisions relating to the restrictions of adoptions from abroad in the Children and Adoption Act 2006. I intend to implement sections 9 and 10 and, in so far as they are not already in force, sections 11 and 12 of the 2006 Act in summer 2008.</p>

 I announced plans last September to set up an independent regulator of qualifications and tests. In December, along with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills I announced, for consultation, more detailed proposals. Subject to legislation, the new Office of the Qualifications and Examinations Regulator (Ofqual) will act as independent guardian of standards across the tests and qualifications system in England. The Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA) will develop curriculum, assessment and qualifications. I wish to update the House on progress with these plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="80402m0001.htm_para7"><a name="08040249000040">As we develop and reform qualifications and tests, it is critically important not only that they are of the highest quality, but also that they are seen so to be. The new arrangements that we are putting in place will help to achieve this, underpinning high quality qualifications and tests with high levels of confidence. In making this change, we are building on the principles that underpinned the establishment of, for example, the Monetary Policy Committee and the Statistics Board, which have improved public trust in the systems they regulate through a combination of independence, clarity of remit and a transparent accountability framework. The joint command paper (Cm 7281) &#147;Confidence in Standards: Regulating and Developing Qualifications and Assessment&#148; published in December sought views on the roles and powers of the independent regulator and of the development agency for curriculum, assessment and qualifications into which QCA will develop. The consultation period closed on 10 March. The proposals were generally well received, and there were lots of valuable and detailed points on which we will need to reflect as we develop our detailed proposals. We will publish a formal response to the consultation paper by mid-June.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="80402m0001.htm_para8"><a name="08040249000041">In the meantime, we will continue as planned to make those changes we can achieve within the existing legislative framework, so that we can secure benefits from the  <br>

reforms as soon as possible. As a first step the Office of the Qualifications and Examination Regulator will shortly be established on an interim basis carrying out the QCA&#146;s regulatory functions across this spring and summer test and examination period. While working within current legislation, Ofqual will be operationally independent. These interim arrangements will be an important step towards the new regulatory landscape that we are developing, and in themselves will contribute to confidence in the standards of the tests and qualification system in England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="80402m0001.htm_para9"><a name="08040249000042">In the consultation paper on the reforms we confirmed that we were setting in motion an appointments process for a chair of the regulator. Following a process overseen by the Office for the Commissioner of Public Appointments, I am delighted to tell the House that Kathleen Tattersall OBE has been appointed to be the first chair of the new independent regulator. Kathleen is the chair of the Chartered Institute of Educational Assessors (which today receives its Royal Charter). Until 2003 she was director general of the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (AQA), having been chief executive of a succession of awarding bodies over the previous 20 years. She will join the QCA Board and lead Ofqual in its interim form. Subject to legislation, she will become the regulator&#146;s first chair when it is established as an independent statutory body. Kathleen Tattersall and Ofqual&#146;s acting chief executive, Isabel Nisbet, will play critical leadership roles in setting up the new organisation, setting its strategic direction and developing the new regulatory framework which it will operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="80402m0001.htm_para10"><a name="08040249000043">Setting up a new regulator will help ensure that learners of all ages and their teachers feel that their hard work and achievements are properly recognised. We are confident that these reforms to the regulatory landscape will both provide greater transparency in the arrangements for regulating and developing qualifications and tests, and secure the confidence in standards on which they depend.</p>

 I made a statement on 11 March in which I set out concerns about compliance with the school admissions code and admissions legislation, based on an internal review of the published admission arrangements of schools in a sample of three local authorities. I explained that my Department was verifying the findings with the local authorities and schools concerned, and that we would present the detailed information to Parliament once we had given them the opportunity to respond.</p>

adjudicator&#146;s powers so that he can act where he considers that any admission arrangements are not compliant with the statutory requirements; and to improve the process of consultation on admission arrangements in order to ensure that parents and communities can contribute to the development of admissions policies for their schools. Copies of the draft amendments have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="80402m0001.htm_para13"><a name="08040249000047">We are publishing today a step-by-step guide to the admissions and appeal processes for parents. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House. The guide contains straightforward advice for parents on all aspects of choosing a school place for their child, and sets out what they can do if they have concerns about the legality of a school&#146;s admission arrangements. A copy of this guide will be made available for every parent applying for a school place in 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="80402m0001.htm_para14"><a name="08040249000048">My Department will publish further detailed proposals in the early summer to improve the application and allocation process for parents and to further strengthen the admission system so that it works for all children. This will include an improved process for ensuring that parents and communities are consulted on admission arrangements for their schools and improvements to admission forums.</p>

 Before October 1998 there were no checks in the system to prevent the sale of school playing fields. Local authorities could sell school playing fields and use the proceeds for whatever purpose they saw fit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="80402m0001.htm_para16"><a name="08040249000051">Since 1998, under section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, all local authorities and maintained schools in England have needed the consent of the Secretary of State before they can dispose of a school playing field or any part of a school playing field.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="80402m0001.htm_para17"><a name="08040249000052">Published guidance sets out the criteria for giving consent and makes it clear that a disposal will only be allowed if the sports and curriculum needs of schools and their neighbouring schools continue to be met. Community usage of school playing fields is considered in decisions and any sale proceeds must be re-invested in outdoor sports facilities where possible, or, if not, in indoor sport or education facilities.</p>

 On 4 February 2008, <i>Official Report</i>, column 47WS, I laid before Parliament a written ministerial statement about payments under the Local Authority Business Growth Incentives scheme (LABGI) in the light of legal challenge. I am now in a position to announce the methodology the Government intend to use, to make additional payments to local authorities for years 1 and 2 of the scheme and to make payments for year 3 of the three-year scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="80402m0002.htm_para0"><a name="08040249000201">For years 1 and 2, the Government propose to make additional payments to eligible local authorities using all Valuation Office Agency change codes which record an increase in rateable value and which were not previously used in LABGI calculations. This will ensure that  all codes that could contain elements of business  growth are taken into account. As a result, we propose that additional payments totalling approximately  &#163;50.9 million should be made to authorities (approximately &#163;13.5 million for year 1 and &#163;37.3 million for year 2).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="80402m0002.htm_para1"><a name="08040249000202">For year 3, the Government intend to replicate the revised methodology for years 1 and 2 of the scheme in year 3. As I indicated in my statement of 4 February, it is necessary at this stage to retain a portion of the  year 3 funding as a contingency and I intend to retain &#163;100 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="80402m0002.htm_para2"><a name="08040249000203">A further announcement about the distribution of the remaining funding will be made in due course. This funding will be allocated to local authorities in full, in line with the policy purposes for which LABGI was designed. The exact methodology will be confirmed once any uncertainty associated with legal challenges has been resolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="80402m0002.htm_para3"><a name="08040249000204">The Government, therefore, are able to allocate around &#163;246 million to authorities at this stage for year 3 of the scheme. As in previous years, it will be necessary to apply a scaling factor to the calculated allocations in year 3 to ensure that the funding distributed does not exceed the amount available. Each authority&#146;s allocation will be scaled back to 28 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="st_203"><a name="08040249000210"><a name="80402m0002.htm_spmin1"><a name="08040249000297"><b>The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Andy Burnham):</b>
 I am today laying the draft Heritage Protection Bill and explanatory notes for pre-legislative scrutiny. Copies of the related Impact Assessment are available in the Vote and Printed Paper Offices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="80402m0002.htm_para8"><a name="08040249000211">This is a draft Bill for England and Wales, which sets out the legislative framework for a unified and simpler heritage protection system that will be more open, accountable and transparent. The new system will provide more opportunities for public involvement and community engagement in understanding, preserving and managing our heritage. As the Impact Assessment makes clear, the main benefits of the reforms introduced by the Heritage Protection Bill are not best expressed in terms of the financial balance sheet, but are better understood in terms of public value and sustainability. The reforms set out in this Bill will enable us to preserve the historic environment and manage its transition to the future, in the light of both present values and in the interest of future generations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="80402m0002.htm_para9"><a name="08040249000212">The draft Bill is based on the proposals set out in the White Paper, &#147;Heritage Protection for the 21st Century&#148; (March 2007), which itself was based on three key principles: the need to develop a unified approach to the historic environment; maximising opportunities for inclusion and involvement; and supporting sustainable communities by putting the historic environment at the heart of an effective planning system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="80402m0002.htm_para10"><a name="08040249000213">The draft Heritage Protection Bill contains provisions for a single system for national designation (&#147;registration&#148;) of terrestrial heritage assets to replace the listing of buildings, scheduling of monuments and registering of parks, gardens, battlefields and, in Wales, historic landscapes. In England, we will be transferring responsibility for national designation of all these assets to English Heritage; in Wales that responsibility will remain with the Welsh  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="2 Apr 2008">

<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>2 Apr 2008 : Column 58WS</b><br>
Ministers. There will be new Heritage Registers, one each for England and Wales, containing details of all nationally designated heritage assets, as well as world heritage sites in England and Wales. There will also be formal appeals or review mechanisms for registration decisions, and provisional registration to give &#147;interim protection&#148; to historic assets while they are being considered for registration, as well as wider formal consultation on applications to register.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="80402m0002.htm_para11"><a name="08040249000214">Alongside this unification of designation, we will be unifying and streamlining the associated consent processes, with the introduction of a new Heritage Asset Consent to replace Listed Building Consent and Scheduled Monument Consent, and the merger of Conservation Area Consent with planning permission. In England, the new Heritage Asset Consent will be administered by local planning authorities, allowing the management of the historic environment to take place at local level; in Wales, the draft Bill will provide flexibility to allow central decision making where appropriate, recognising the different levels of capacity in Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="80402m0002.htm_para12"><a name="08040249000215">We recognise the need for effective conservation and management of the historic environment at local level to be knowledge-based, and for the records of our historic environment to be available to as many people as possible. This Bill will secure the basis for informed stewardship of the historic environment, within and beyond the planning system, by placing local authorities under a new statutory duty to maintain or have access to an Historic Environment Record (HER). HERs are a comprehensive resource on the local historic environment, containing information on archaeological sites and finds, historic buildings and historic landscapes, complementing and enriching our existing collections of museum, archives and libraries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="80402m0002.htm_para13"><a name="08040249000216">In keeping with this drive towards greater accessibility, the new Heritage Registers will also be available online and new records will be simpler, clearer and more detailed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="80402m0002.htm_para14"><a name="08040249000217">The draft Bill will also introduce a new statutory framework for voluntary management agreements between the owners of heritage sites and structures and local or other authorities. These agreements will free owners from the need for repetitive consent applications for similar works, reducing the bureaucratic and administrative burdens for owners and local authorities alike, and providing greater certainty on the long-term management of the site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="80402m0002.htm_para15"><a name="08040249000218">Striking the balance between flexibility and the need to ensure protection alongside conservation and management characterises our proposals to reform the marine heritage protection system in England and Wales. We have broadened the range of marine historic assets that can be protected, ensuring that there is greater consistency&#151;where appropriate&#151;with the terrestrial system, and brought greater flexibility to the licensing system. As we have done for terrestrial designations, we have also built a formal consultation process into the registration of marine heritage sites and ensured protection for those assets formally being considered for designation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="80402m0002.htm_para16"><a name="08040249000219">These reforms will give us a heritage protection system that is open, flexible and accountable. Our heritage is an important source of national and community identity; people recognise its value and  <br>

work hard, voluntarily and professionally, to ensure its conservation and pass it on. We are increasingly recognising the value of the historic environment in contributing to the Government&#146;s wider agenda in terms of place-making and promoting economic prosperity through regeneration and sustainable use of existing resources. The proposals in the draft Heritage Protection Bill will enable us and future generations to benefit from a thriving, well-managed, sustainable and widely-enjoyed historic environment.</p>

 We are gravely concerned about the situation in Gaza. The closure of Gaza&#146;s crossings is contributing to the collapse of the economy. There are shortages of essential humanitarian supplies such as medicines, foodstuffs and hearing aids. Restrictions on supplies of fuel and electricity have led to widespread power cuts and water shortages. While we fully understand Israel&#146;s security concerns, we do not support the decision to close Gaza crossings. The Foreign Secretary and I have called on Israel to open them, and to lift all restrictions immediately on humanitarian supplies and electricity. While resolving the humanitarian situation is in the hands of the parties concerned, we are doing what we can to help alleviate the situation.</p>

This is part of the pledge of up to &#163;243 million over three years, linked to political progress, which I announced at the Paris donor conference last December. The UK is leading the international community in following through on its Paris pledges promptly, providing funding when it is most needed before other pledges come through.</p>

It would enable boards and trusts to demonstrate, in a transparent way, the value for money of their services, and to drive improvements in the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of their service delivery. Best Value reviews would be based around five areas&#151;consult, compare, challenge, collaborate and, where appropriate, compete. The reviews may result in the competition of services, but only if they have shown that that would be the most efficient and effective delivery option; the Best Value process is neutral as to the final result. By delivering efficiency savings, Best Value will provide value for money to the taxpayer and, by improving the effectiveness of service delivery to offenders, it will contribute towards our aim of reducing reoffending.</p>
