 Today the Government have announced the next steps in our comprehensive review of employment laws. We have launched a consultation on proposals to improve the way workplace disputes are resolved and published an "Employer's Charter" to give employers more confidence to take on workers and support growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para0"><a name="11012755000017">In the consultation we are seeking views on measures to achieve more early resolution of workplace disputes so that parties can resolve their own problems, in a way that is fair and equitable for both sides, without having to go to an employment tribunal; ensure that, where parties do need to come to an employment tribunal, the process is as swift, user friendly and effective as possible; and help business feel more confident about hiring people (by increasing the qualifying period for employees to be able to bring a claim for unfair dismissal from one to two years).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para18"><a name="11012755000037">The public forest estate in England is around 258,000 hectares of Government-owned land managed by the Forestry Commission. It represents less than one fifth  <br>

of the woodlands of England, with the majority of the remainder in private and voluntary sector ownership. The estate was started at a time of national crisis after the first world war, with severe shortages of timber and a woodland resource depleted to less than 5% of the land area in Great Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para19"><a name="11012755000038">In line with the Government's broad policy to effect a shift from big Government to big society, the consultation sets out the rationale for reducing state ownership and management of forest resources. The status quo is not an option. There is a fundamental conflict of interest in the Forestry Commission's role. It is the largest player  in the commercial forestry sector, a sector it also regulates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para20"><a name="11012755000039">The Government's approach to looking at new models of ownership and management of the public forest estate in England will be underpinned by a set of key principles that are designed to protect public access and other public benefits that so many enjoy. The Government's proposals, on which the consultation seeks views, are for a mixed approach which includes:</p>
<a name="11012755000113"><ul><p class="tabletext">recognising that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to the different types of woodland and forestry;</p>
</ul><a name="11012755000114"><ul><p class="tabletext">inviting new or existing charitable organisations to take on ownership or management of the heritage forests in order to secure their public benefits future generations to enjoy;</p>
</ul><a name="11012755000115"><ul><p class="tabletext">creating opportunities for community and civil society groups to buy or lease forests that they wish to own or manage; and</p>
</ul><a name="11012755000116"><ul><p class="tabletext">issuing long-term leases on the large-scale commercially valuable forests. By leasing rather than selling, it will be possible to ensure that the public can continue to enjoy their benefits.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para21"><a name="11012755000040">The Government are committed to the ongoing provision and protection of the public benefits provided by the public forest estate. The policy we are consulting on shows how we intend to achieve this. We will ensure that the powers in the Public Bodies Bill reflect our policy objectives, so that the powers and duties within it are strengthened to safeguard the natural and social capital our forests provide now and for future generations. This would apply to the powers of sale, lease and management of the public forest estate. The consultation proposes that conditions will be attached to leases so that access and other public benefits are protected. We will consider:</p>
<a name="11012755000117"><ul><p class="tabletext">introducing a general duty on the Government to have regard to the maintenance of public benefits when exercising the powers under the Bill;</p>
</ul><a name="11012755000118"><ul><p class="tabletext">exempting the most iconic heritage forests from the full range of options so that for example, the Forest of Dean or the New Forest could only be transferred to a charitable organisation or remain in public ownership, in line with the policy as set out in the consultation.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para59"><a name="11012755000079">Baroness Ashton is expected to provide a short debrief on her presentation to the December European Council on the EU's relations with its strategic partners, setting out next steps in this work programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para60"><a name="11012755000080"><i>Russia</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para61"><a name="11012755000081">We expect Ministers to discuss the formation of a more balanced partnership between the EU and Russia; one which promotes and strengthens mutual prosperity and is underpinned by a legally-binding, ambitious new EU-Russia agreement. It is likely that frozen conflicts in the former Soviet Union will be discussed, including the need for pressure on Russia to deliver on Transnistria. Climate change and energy, and rule of law and modernisation in Russia are also likely to be raised. Ministers will address the human rights situation in Russia, following a number of recent, well-publicised cases of concern. There will also be discussion of how to deliver progress on the EU-Russia agreement, improve the architecture of EU-Russia co-operation, and improve internal EU working methods on Russia policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para62"><a name="11012755000082">Additionally, Ministers may reflect on the shocking act of terrorism at Moscow's Domodedovo airport on 24 January. The Foreign Secretary's statement on this can be seen at the link below.</p>

Due to Iran's insistence on unacceptable pre-conditions, no further talks are scheduled. Following the talks in Istanbul, Baroness Ashton released a statement on behalf of the E3 plus 3 on 21 January:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para69"><a name="11012755000089">Ministers will discuss EU support for Tunisia following recent events. We expect conclusions to be adopted which call for a stable and inclusive transition to elections as soon as practicable, and restate the EU's support for political and economic reform in Tunisia. The Government consider that free and fair elections, as promised by Tunisia's interim Government, are essential for Tunisia's stability; and we firmly support EU assistance in this area.</p>

 I am today announcing a review, led by the Home Office chief scientific adviser, Professor Bernard Silverman, of research and development in forensic science.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para73"><a name="11012755000094">Research and development in forensic science is essential to ensure the continued availability of a high-quality, efficient, forensic science capability for the criminal justice system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para74"><a name="11012755000095">The purpose of the review is to consider the current and likely future status of research and development relevant to forensic services for the criminal justice system within England and Wales. The scope will include, but not be limited to, fingerprints, DNA profiling, digital forensics (e-forensics) and more specialist aspects of forensic science.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para75"><a name="11012755000096">The review will consult widely with forensic service providers and related organisations in the public and private sectors, academia and research funders, as well as issuing an open call for submissions of evidence. The review will also work closely with the National Policing Improvement Agency and police service customers. It is expected that the review will conclude in April 2011.</p>

 My right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice and I attended the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council on 20 and 21 January in Gödöllo.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para77"><a name="11012755000099">Discussions on the Interior day centred on two themes: "Internal Security: combining efforts in combating organised crime" and "comprehensive security through integrated border management".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para78"><a name="11012755000100">The Commission opened the item on organised crime by highlighting cybercrime and asset recovery; they felt there was a need to focus on the exchange of best practice. The Chair of the European Parliament LIBE Committee suggested that proving the effectiveness of the EU in the security field was one of the biggest challenges for the EU. The Europol director gave a preview of their organised crime threat assessment noting an increasing risk in particular in relation to the infiltration of the legal economy and facilitation of illegal activity by the internet. There was an increasing use of aircraft and helicopters for smuggling of goods, use of minors for petty crime and sexual exploitation, an upsurge in counterfeiting and a largely unnoticed trade in endangered species. Interpol highlighted the ability of organised crime to destabilise whole countries and gave the example of cocaine trafficking via West Africa.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para79"><a name="11012755000101">The UK said that it recognised organised crime as a real threat alongside counter-terrorism and would be developing a new strategy. In particular the UK acknowledged cybercrime as requiring particular attention, although it was often old crimes committed by new methods. The UK welcomed practical co-operation, rather than legislation, and agreed with the presidency that we needed to look imaginatively at ways of tackling crime, including seizure of assets. Most member states thought further work on asset-freezing, confiscation and sharing was a priority and welcomed the Commission's commitment to bring forward a report on the issues in the second half of 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para80"><a name="11012755000102">The Commission opened the second session by highlighting action they were taking. They would forward a border package over the next year, including looking at an EU electronic system for travel authorisation (ESTA) and a proposal on a European border surveillance system (EUROSUR). They also saw a need to finalise discussion on the new Frontex regulation and to reform the Schengen evaluation mechanism. Frontex, the EU's External Borders Agency, felt that priorities were better inter-agency co-operation, situational awareness and targeted co-operation at the border. Frontex also needed to be able to do more on capacity building and returns with third countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para81"><a name="11012755000103">The UK stated that it was correct to focus on integrated management of the border and supported the Greek action plan, which was critical to the EU's collective success. For the UK modern technologies were a key part of a 21st century response to maintain border security while facilitating legitimate travel. For that reason the UK supported the philosophy behind EU proposals for registered travellers and an entry-exit scheme and, given our experience, the introduction of biometric visas. We were concerned about the UK's exclusion from the proposal for the Schengen evaluation  <br>

mechanism. The e-borders system allowed the UK to focus resources and evidence suggested that intra-EU flights were important and hoped that would be covered by the new EU passenger name records measure. In subsequent discussion many member states highlighted the use of technology as important and in particular interoperability of technologies. Many welcomed the Commission proposals for amendment to the Schengen evaluation mechanism and thought that greater use needed to be made of Frontex.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para82"><a name="11012755000104">The Justice day began with a discussion on a Communication published by the Commission entitled "EU Citizenship: how to dismantle the obstacles to EU citizens' rights?" This sets out what the Commission considers to be the obstacles EU citizens face when trying to exercise their rights across national borders and suggests actions to tackle them. Among other things, the presidency invited discussion about whether the Justice and Home Affairs Council should adopt an oversight role over the actions suggested in the report, but this gained little support. The UK welcomed the overview the Commission report provided and highlighted criminal justice as an area where we needed absolute confidence in others' systems. The UK suggested that the Commission should also focus on making it easier for individuals and businesses to enforce civil debts across borders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para83"><a name="11012755000105">Ministers were also asked what they considered to be the key elements of the proposal on Succession and Wills in simplifying citizens' rights. This gave rise to a substantial debate. The UK reiterated its concerns with this proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para84"><a name="11012755000106">Over lunch, the presidency held a discussion on the role of the Council in ensuring the effective implementation of the charter of fundamental rights in the legislative process. Their paper raised the question whether there was a need for further Council processes to verify member states' compliance with the charter. The UK, together with a number of other member states, questioned whether there was sufficient support for the presidency's proposal to be taken forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="110127m0001.htm_para85"><a name="11012755000107">Next, there was a discussion on "Judicial training: how to improve training of legal professionals in the EU". The Stockholm programme stressed the importance  <br>

of judicial training and the Commission has committed to producing a communication on training of legal practitioners in September 2011. The majority of member states, including the UK, did not favour creation of a new training institution, preferring to build on existing structures including the European Judicial Training Network. The UK welcomed the intention of improving judges' knowledge of EU law and each others' systems and particularly the Commission's recognition that it would have to accommodate very different systems.</p>
