 I am pleased to announce today that the Ministry of Defence has decided to proceed towards financial and contractual close of the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) project PFI deal. The FSTA project is an innovative programme intended to provide future air-to-air refuelling and strategic air transport capability, through a service based contract funded under the private finance initiative. It will provide the Royal Air Force with a modern capability to replace our VC10 and TriStar aircraft.</p>

Extensive evaluation of the final bid has demonstrated that PFI offers a cost effective solution to this requirement and we are now proceeding towards financial and contractual close of the deal with AirTanker Ltd. We expect AirTanker Ltd. to now begin the fund raising process.</p>
