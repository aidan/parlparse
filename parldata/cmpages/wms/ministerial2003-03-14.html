 The 2002 pre-Budget report announced that the Government would discuss with stakeholders the most effective economic instruments for ensuring that the aviation industry is encouraged to take account of, and where appropriate reduce, its contribution to global warming, local air and noise pollution.
<P>

<a name="30314m01.html_para3">To take this process forward, the Government will shortly be issuing invitations to all key representative stakeholders to attend discussion sessions. The stakeholders will include umbrella organisations covering the following broad areas:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Industry and business (including airlines, airport operators, manufacturers, tourism bodies and union representatives)
<P>

National environmental groups

The expert community
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30314m01.html_para4">To provide background and support to these discussions, the Government are today publishing a discussion paper, <i>Aviation and the environment: using economic instruments</i>. This document, copies of which are available in the Libraries of the House, covers:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government's objectives for aviation. The Government believe that aviation should aim to maximise its significant social and economic benefits and minimise its environmental impacts.
<P>
<BR>

<P>

<a name="30314m01.html_para6">The discussions with stakeholders, as well as the document being published today, will help to inform policy on the future development of air transport in the UK on which the Government are consulting through a series of documents issued last summer and, additionally, through a second edition of the South East consultation document published on 27 February. The Government will set out their views in their air transport White Paper later this year.
