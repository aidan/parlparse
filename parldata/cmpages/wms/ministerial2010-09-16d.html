 The Foreign Affairs Council was held on 10 September in Brussels. I represented the UK.</p>

I reinforced the UK position that EPAs should be development-friendly and we should avoid any negative implications of the agreements wherever possible. The UK will work closely with the Commission in developing thinking and approach going forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para5"><a name="10091614000038">Italy called for provisional application of the FTA to be delayed by at least 12 months, arguing that the current agreement was not balanced, particularly in the automotive and textiles sectors, and a proper understanding should be reached with the European Parliament on the safeguard regulation before the FTA is implemented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para6"><a name="10091614000039">I emphasised that the EU needed to defend its credibility and avoid any damaging read-across to other multilateral and bilateral negotiations.

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para7"><a name="10091614000040">No agreement was reached on 10 September. On 15 September, Korea stated it would accept Italy's request to delay provisional application of the FTA until 1 July 2011. The signature of the agreement is scheduled to take place on 6 October 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para9"><a name="10091614000042">The Commission outlined the approach in its communication on the future of the European Union's international investment policy, stressing the need to prioritise countries for new EU-investment agreements. Despite widespread criticism of the regulation, particularly on the need for certainty for businesses, several member states supported the overall approach to investment policy as set out in the communication.</p>

 I wish to inform the House about the unsolicited mail campaign Ministry of Defence (MOD) will be running in the lead-up to Christmas (which is 100 days from today).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para15"><a name="10091614000052">This Government are dedicated to the care and welfare of the men and women of our armed forces, particularly those on operations in Afghanistan. This is reflected in the first class deployed welfare package which is constantly being improved to maximise the support we give to our armed forces on operations. A vital part of that package is ensuring the safe and timely delivery of personal mail from family and friends. To that end, we have a policy in place which encourages the generous British public to support our troops in ways other than by sending unsolicited goodwill parcels through the mail system.</p>

<notus-date day="16" month="9" year="2010" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><b>16 Sep 2010 : Column 53WS</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para16"><a name="10091614000053">By way of background, during the build-up to Christmas 2007, the volume of unsolicited goodwill parcels overwhelmed the in-theatre postal and logistic capacity, resulting in a considerable delay to personal mail. British Forces Post Office (BFPO) estimates it will handle around 19,200 unsolicited parcels over Christmas this year (the eight-week period between mid-October and mid-December) as opposed to 6,400 over a "normal" eight-week period. In addition to the impact on personal mail, delivering unsolicited packages over the "final mile" to forward operating bases and patrol bases puts increased pressure on essential in-theatre resources. Additional helicopters and road convoys are required, both of which take essential transport assets away from their primary task and place our personnel at increased personal danger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para17"><a name="10091614000054">It is for these reasons that the MOD will be encouraging the British public to show their support through one of the recognised MOD service charities rather than sending unsolicited goodwill parcels. All service personnel on operations over Christmas will receive a seasonal gift box from the MOD endorsed charity, "uk4u Thanks!". The charity works closely with the MOD, using free space in the existing supply chain to deliver the boxes over a period of time, so without impacting on the normal mail system. Other charities which help to support our troops include Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA), Afghan Heroes, Support our Soldiers and Operation Shoebox.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para18"><a name="10091614000055">This is not an easy issue and will seem counter-intuitive to many, but I ask for your full support in directing the public towards MOD recognised charities rather than sending unsolicited mail as a means of expressing their much valued support to our deployed personnel.</p>

 On 26 May this year, during the debate on the Queen's Speech, I confirmed that we would be honouring the pledge we made in opposition to hold an independent review of the evidence relating to the tragic accident on 2 June 1994 when a Chinook helicopter crashed at the Mull of Kintyre, killing all 29 people on board.</p>

Pakistan had always said that trade was the key to its relationship with the EU. The Commissioner for Development (Piebalgs) said the Development Co-operation Instrument had provision for €225 million for Pakistan for 2011-13.

Over 250 serving staff have chosen the financial package. To date, 117 principal applicants and 241 dependants have been resettled via the scheme for serving staff</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para71"><a name="10091614000112">With the draw-down of the UK defence presence in Iraq, the Ministry of Defence no longer employs any Iraqi staff and their numbers accounted for the largest proportion of applicants under the scheme. As a result of this, in view of the declining rate of applications and the stabilisation of the security situation in Iraq, we consider that the time is right to close the scheme to new applications from serving staff. From today, only applications from serving staff who will qualify for either financial or resettlement benefits under the scheme on 12:00 noon Arabian standard time on 16 October 2010 and, thus, will have attained 12 month' continuous service by this date, will continue to be accepted. Further, such applications will cease to be accepted from 12:00 noon Arabian standard time on 16 January 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para72"><a name="10091614000113">Recently, there have been inquiries as to whether staff who received financial packages under the LESAS scheme are entitled to apply to switch to the resettlement option. We will permit those staff who accepted the financial package under either the scheme for former or serving staff to apply, in writing, for consideration for resettlement instead. The deadline for an application is 12:00 noon Arabian standard time on 16 November 2010. We will not consider applications: (a) received after that deadline; (b) from an individual who has previously been refused resettlement under either the schemes for former or serving employees; or (c) from an individual who has not repaid the financial package within eight weeks of applying for resettlement. A successful applicant will need to meet all the criteria for resettlement under the relevant scheme. Should an applicant be refused resettlement, they will be repaid the financial package. It should be noted that the now closed scheme for former employees had a cap of 600 places, with some places unfilled at the time of closure. So, applications to switch under that scheme will be subject to that cap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para73"><a name="10091614000114">We shall work with our missions in Iraq to ensure that full publicity is given to the closure of this scheme in the local media.</p>

We could not have made our contribution to the rebuilding of Iraq without their service and, in some cases, sacrifice. The scheme was designed to reflect this debt and I am pleased that it proved popular and effective.</p>

Those proposals would cost the NHS in excess of £100 million. The impact assessment states that it would lead to a net disbenefit to patients valued at almost £200 million.

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para81"><a name="10091614000125">Moreover, the Government have embarked on a very clear strategy for the NHS that reduces central control and intervention in operational decisions, giving NHS managers the autonomy to make decisions that reflect the needs of their local community.

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para82"><a name="10091614000126">However, our strategy also puts patients at the centre of decision making, and supports patients to be able to make informed choices. It is clear from the consultation feedback that the parking policies and practices in some trusts fall short of these standards. Patients undergoing extended outpatient treatment, and long-stay inpatients, should not be further disadvantaged, and nor should their health needs be possibly compromised by high cumulative parking costs. A fair scale of concessionary rates should be offered, and all eligible patients should be fully informed and helped to take advantage of them. These standards are fundamental to patient-centred care and informed choice.</p>

The Home Office continues to hold control order review groups (CORGs) every quarter, with representation from law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to keep the obligations in every control order under regular and formal review and to facilitate a review of appropriate exit strategies. During this reporting period, two CORGs were held in relation to the orders currently in force. In addition, further meetings were held on an ad hoc basis as specific issues arose.</p>

Two control orders have been renewed in accordance with section 2(6) of the 2005 Act in this reporting period. Three control orders have been revoked during this reporting period. One control order was revoked because it was not possible to meet the disclosure test set out in the June 2009 House of Lords judgment (<i>AF &amp; Others</i>) on article 6 (right to a fair trial) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Two control orders were revoked as they were no longer considered necessary.</p>

A right of appeal is also provided by section 10(3) of the 2005 Act against decisions by the Secretary of State to refuse a request by a controlled person to revoke their order or to modify any obligation under their order.

In <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v. AY</i>, [2010] EWHC 1860 (Admin) handed down on 26 July 2010, the court upheld the control order on the basis that there was and remained reasonable grounds for suspecting that AY was involved in terrorism-related activity, that it was and remained necessary for a control order to be imposed on him for purposes connected with protecting the public from a risk of terrorism and that each of the obligations in the control order was and remained necessary for purposes connected with preventing or restricting AY's involvement in terrorism-related activity. The court also considered and rejected the argument that an unsuccessful prosecution for a terrorism-related offence precludes the Secretary of State from making a control order on essentially the same material as that relied upon by the prosecution at trial.</p>

The issue was what the appropriate remedy should be in control order cases where the Secretary of State elects not to make sufficient disclosure to comply with article 6 of the ECHR. The Court of Appeal found that the appropriate remedy in these circumstances is for the control order to be quashed from the date it was made and not for it to be revoked with effect from a date after the control order was served on the individual as the Secretary of State had sought to argue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para102"><a name="10091614000149">The proposed legislative reform order would allow a one-time, temporary and limited enclosure of land on Wanstead flats, in Epping Forest. This will be for the specific, time-limited purpose of housing a temporary muster, briefing and deployment centre during the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics to support the policing operation. Centres of this kind are a tried and tested feature of large scale police operations and will be essential in helping to deliver a safe, and secure games. No other suitable sites have been identified in this part of London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para103"><a name="10091614000150">The Government are clear that these proposals are dependent on the Epping Forest Act 1878 reverting to its full protection at the end of the proposed 120 day period. No lasting powers relating to Wanstead flats or Epping Forest would be conferred on the police or any other bodies as a result of this order. This will ensure that members of the public can continue to enjoy the full benefits of this open space in perpetuity. The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) will pay the City of London corporation £170,000 in lieu of rent and this money will be used to ensure that users of Wanstead flats receive lasting benefits.</p>

 I am announcing today proposals to bring the tribunals judiciary in England and Wales under the overall leadership of the Lord Chief Justice. The changes require primary legislation and I hope to include them in a Bill as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para104"><a name="10091614000152">An announcement was made in March that the Ministry of Justice would be bringing together Her Majesty's Court Service and the Tribunals Service in a single, unified organisation.

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para105"><a name="10091614000153">I subsequently agreed with the Lord Chief Justice and Senior President of Tribunals that in bringing together the administration of the courts and tribunals the current judicial structure should also be reviewed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para106"><a name="10091614000154">Our shared vision is to work towards a unified judiciary encompassing both courts and tribunals. This could be achieved, so far as concerns England and Wales, by transferring the statutory powers of the Senior President of Tribunals to the Lord Chief Justice, and creating a new office of Head of Tribunals Justice with a statutory obligation to protect and develop the distinct and innovative features of the tribunals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para107"><a name="10091614000155">The Senior President of Tribunals is a statutory role that has jurisdiction in both Scotland and Northern Ireland. Further, a number of important tribunal jurisdictions extend to one or both of those countries, and cross-border sittings are a normal part of the judicial work of many tribunal judges. I recognise the importance attached by them and the Senior President to this aspect of their work, and the advantages it offers to the interests of users and the efficiency of the system overall. I am in discussions with judicial leaders and with Scottish and Northern Ireland Ministers about whether and how we might transfer the Senior President's tribunal responsibilities to the Lord President and Lord Chief Justice of NI respectively. Any such transfer will wish to preserve the benefits of existing arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="st_54"><a name="10091614000156"><a name="100916m0001.htm_spmin16"><a name="10091614000228"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):</b>
 I am publishing today, 16 September, a consultation paper on proposals to amend the criteria defining strategic national corridors (SNCs). This will result in the identification of roads, including the Al between Newcastle and the Scottish border, as being of national significance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para108"><a name="10091614000157">The strategic national corridors were established in 2009 to define the network over which the largest proportion of strategic traffic-that is traffic travelling between the 10 largest urban areas, 10 busiest ports and seven busiest airports in England-moves around the country. The original definition also provided for connectivity between the four nations of the United Kingdom, but there was no specific provision for connecting capital cities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para109"><a name="10091614000158">The Government believe that the routes linking Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast to the nearest urban strategic destination should be recognised for the strategic connectivity that they provide. For this reason I am today launching a consultation on proposals to change the definition, to explicitly include links with our capital cities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para110"><a name="10091614000159">As a result of this change we believe that two routes would be identified as having national significance: namely the Al between its junction with the A19 north of Newcastle, and the Scottish border, providing a defined link to Edinburgh; and a route between Bootle and the Twelve Quays ferry terminal in Birkenhead, providing connectivity with Belfast. We have also set out information about alternatives to these routes which I invite consultees to consider. Routes linking the network with Cardiff were identified in 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para111"><a name="10091614000160">The consultation does not include any specific proposals to increase the capacity of these routes. However, the Department is considering the nature of the problems on the Al north of Newcastle so that, as part of the spending review, Ministers will be in a position to consider these alongside other priorities in identifying those schemes and programmes that it will be proceeding with, consistent with resources available and the Government's objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="100916m0001.htm_para112"><a name="10091614000161">I am pleased to announce that the consultation will run for a period of 12 weeks, and invite everybody with an interest in the roads potentially affected to take part. A consultation document and instructions for responding can be found on the Department's website and a copy has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
