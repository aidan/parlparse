<p><a name="40610m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport  (Tessa Jowell): </b> 
 The provision for the Government indemnity scheme is made by the National Heritage Act 1980. The scheme facilitates public access to loans of works of art and other objects for public display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by private owners and non-national institutions. It does this by indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to their loan. Loans covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also covers loans of such objects for study purposes within borrowing institutions where this would contribute materially to the public&#039;s understanding or appreciation of the loan. Examples of this are enhancing interpretation or explanation to the public of objects, or bringing into the public domain the conclusions of any study.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40610m01.html_para0">In the six month period ending 31 March, the following undertakings to indemnify were given under section 16 by the relevant Departments for objects on loan to national and non-national institutions. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport issued 687 undertakings, the Scottish Executive Education Department issued 179 undertakings and the National Assembly for Wales issued 229.

<p><a name="40610m01.html_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs  (Mr. Jack Straw): </b> 
 The FCO has today published a booklet entitled &quot;Inclusive Government: Mainstreaming Gender into Foreign Policy&quot;, prepared by its Gender Advisory Group. Copies of this booklet have been placed in the Library of the House. From 23 June it will also be available on the FCO&#039;s website at www.fco.gov.uk.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40610m01.html_para4">Mainstreaming gender is about considering fully the impact on men and women of a particular policy, project or service, and taking steps to ensure that those impacts are positive for both sexes. Mainstreaming gender is crucial to the work of the FCO.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40610m01.html_para5">This booklet draws together the work the FCO is already doing on gender, and serves as a toolkit for FCO staff to mainstream gender more fully into their work. I hope it will help to ensure that the FCO can devise more effective policies, and make better use of resources, leading to positive outcomes for the UK.
