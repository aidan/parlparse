With regard to the EU emissions trading system, the UK highlighted the need for a sufficiently robust central cap with a clear downwards emissions reduction trajectory as proposed by the European Commission, and supported the linking of emissions trading systems as a building block towards a global carbon market. The UK also emphasized our opposition to mandatory earmarking or hypothecation of auction revenues, and the reassignment of auctioning rights. Elsewhere, the UK stressed the importance of focusing on the objective of a 30 per cent. reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as part of an international agreement on climate change.

 We are this year undertaking the biggest reform of Britain&#146;s immigration and border security system for 45 years.</p>

There was also support for the proposal that those intending to sponsor a spouse should declare their intention before leaving the UK; for a Code of Practice to provide consistency and a safeguard to protect the vulnerable; and for stronger measures to allow the UKBA to revoke indefinite leave to remain following abandonment of spouse or evidence of abuse of the marriage route to gain settlement.
