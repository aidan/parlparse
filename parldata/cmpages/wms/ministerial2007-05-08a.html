In the run-up to Operation TELIC, life insurance companies reacted to what they saw as the increased risk to Service personnel by closing schemes to new applicants, increasing premiums or excluding benefits for chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons.

 An informal meeting of the EU Competitiveness Council took place in Wuerzburg in Germany from 26-28 April. The Council was split into two halves. Part I dealt with Science and Research. Part II dealt with Economic issues.</p>

Along with other Ministers, Malcolm Wicks emphasised the importance of this debateon fostering the free movement of knowledge and overcoming fragmentation in Europe, and stressedthe need to include consideration of subsidiarity and European added value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"><a name="70508m0002.htm_para5"><a name="07050815000105">Under the second item there was a discussion of the proposed European Institute of Technology, where Malcolm Wicks and other Ministers welcomed progress made in negotiations under the German presidency while noting outstanding financial and governance issues to be addressed.</p>

In particular they focused on factors affecting the attractiveness of the EU as an investment location, noting that the Ernst and Young European Attractiveness Survey confirms that the EU remains the most attractive region in the world for more than 50 per cent. of the companies surveyed. In my intervention I emphasised the economic factors which had made the UK a highly attractive investment location.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_406"><a name="70508m0002.htm_para10"><a name="07050815000110">As a second item, Ministers discussed the role of EU state aid in influencing foreign direct investment in the EU. Ministers noted that the Ernst and Young Survey recorded that only a relatively small proportion of companies considered state aid was a significant factor in their investment decisions. Commissioner Kroes, myself and a majority of other Ministers who spoke intervened to oppose a Presidency suggestion that consideration be given to relaxing EU state aid rules in order to match aid offered by third countries, arguing that this would distort competition and risk WTO litigation.</p>

 The Department of Trade and Industry issued a written answer to House of Commons Parliamentary Question Number 2005/3120 from my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), 13 February 2006,<i>Official Report, </i>Volume 442, column 1635W, which sought information regarding the (a) prosecutions and (b) successful prosecutions for insider trading since 1991. Richard Steele was named as a person who had been convicted of such an offence. The record should show that whilst criminal proceedings were brought against Richard Steele for insider trading, namely an offence contrary to Section 52 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993, he was not convicted of that (or any other) offence. The record should also therefore show that from 1997 to 13 February 2006 proceedings were brought against 15 individuals, of which eight were successful.</p>
