 Today the Government have published a consultation document on transferring consumer credit regulation from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to the new Consumer Protection and Markets Authority (CPMA).

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para4"><a name="10122138000027">The new scheme will replace the old scheme which the previous Government tried to reform in February 2010. I first announced that the coalition Government intended to reform the civil service compensation scheme on 6 July 2010, following which the Superannuation Bill was introduced to Parliament on 15 July to ensure that reform of the scheme could not be vetoed by any one of the unions. Extensive discussions then took place between officials and Ministers and the civil service trade unions. Proposals were put to the Council of Civil Service Unions on 24 September. In the event, the council did not accept those proposals, but five of the unions-Prospect, the FDA, the Prison Officers' Association (POA), the GMB and Unite-approached the Government directly and asked to continue discussions on those terms. There followed an intensive period of meetings between the five unions and officials, which on 5 October resulted in an agreement being reached between the negotiators on terms that might form the basis of a new compensation scheme. The five unions wrote to confirm that these terms had accurately recorded an agreement, that all their negotiating teams were able to recommend positively to their executives, as being the best that might be achieved in negotiation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para5"><a name="10122138000028">Subsequently, the POA's executive committee voted to distance itself from that agreement and to request further discussion. The sixth union, the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) Union, had decided not to take part in the talks at the point when the five other unions had agreed to negotiate separately with the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para6"><a name="10122138000029">The Superannuation Act 2010, which received Royal Assent on 16 December, amended the Superannuation Act 1972 so as to remove the requirement for agreement of the civil service unions to any changes that could reduce the benefits of the compensation scheme. However, during the passage through Parliament of the Superannuation Bill, the Government agreed a number of changes to it, including a further amendment to the Superannuation Act 1972 so as to introduce a clear requirement that future consultation on any changes that would reduce the value of the civil service compensation scheme must be undertaken</p>
<a name="101221m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="10122138000030"><ul><p class="tabletext">"with a view to reaching agreement"</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para7"><a name="10122138000031">and that a report is made to Parliament setting out the details of the consultation that has been carried out with the unions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para8"><a name="10122138000032">During the Superannuation Bill's passage through Parliament, the Government remained committed to trying to reach an agreement with the Council of Civil Service Unions and offered every opportunity to those unions that wished to engage constructively in negotiations. Five of them did so, and their proposals formed the basis of the discussions and subsequent agreement on which the new proposed scheme is based.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para9"><a name="10122138000033">On 9 November, the Council of Civil Service Unions wrote with suggestions for areas that could be considered in further talks, and I responded on 15 November. The suggestions made in the council's letter would have had the effect of reducing the level of compensation paid to many lower-paid civil servants, and I therefore did not wish those suggestions to form the basis of further discussions. Having a new scheme that provides genuinely better protection for the lowest-paid civil service workers,  <br>

many of whom are members of the PCS, has been  an important aim of the Government throughout the discussions on reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para10"><a name="10122138000034">I explained to the Council of Civil Service Unions that, in the absence of detailed proposals from the PCS, work would have to proceed on drafting the rules for a new scheme. On 6 December 2010 officials sent the draft rules for the new compensation scheme to the Council of Civil Service Unions to seek its views. Those rules form the basis of the new compensation scheme, which is being laid before Parliament today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para11"><a name="10122138000035">The Superannuation Act 2010 provides a fall-back position by introducing statutory caps on compensation which would be applied if, for any reason, the Government cannot implement the new proposals. The Government are now in a position to be able to repeal the caps set out in the Act through the Superannuation Act 2010 (Repeal of Limits on Compensation) Order 2010, which comes into force today. The repeal means that the statutory caps of a maximum of 15 months' pay for voluntary departures and 12 months' pay for compulsory departures, will not apply to the new civil service compensation scheme that is starting on 22 December 2010. The key points of the new civil service compensation scheme are as follows:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para17"><a name="10122138000042">This was to be achieved by placing a duty to secure sufficient number and variety of apprenticeship places for those eligible young people on the chief executive of skills funding. The sections of the Act covering the "offer" have not been commenced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para18"><a name="10122138000043">The education Bill will redefine the "offer". It will place a higher duty on the chief executive of skills funding to prioritise funding for apprenticeship training for the same people who were covered by the apprenticeship offer and who have secured an apprenticeship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para19"><a name="10122138000044">This new duty will constitute a much more robust deal for these young people because it will ensure that the chief executive of skills funding gives priority for funding apprenticeship training to those eligible for the "redefined offer". We will continue to work with those key stakeholders representing vulnerable and disadvantaged young people to ensure that they have equal access to "redefined offer". This new duty will be more straightforward, more meaningful and less bureaucratic than the apprenticeship offer set out in sections 91-99 of the Apprenticeships, Schools, Children and Learners Act 2009 "apprenticeship offer".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para20"><a name="10122138000045"><i>Amendments to functions of the Chief Executive of Skills Funding</i>-The Apprenticeships, Schools, Children and Learners Act 2009 (section 6) names the chief executive of skills funding as the certifying authority for apprenticeships. We propose to amend this section in order to give the Secretary of State powers to designate the person or persons to be the certifying authority for apprenticeships in a manner which broadly mirrors similar provisions in Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para21"><a name="10122138000046">The rationale for this amendment is that this Government want to see the responsibility for issuing apprenticeships certificates remain with sector skills councils and other sector bodies rather than the national apprenticeships service, to whom the chief executive of skills funding would delegate this role. The national apprenticeships service will continue to have end to end responsibility for apprenticeships. However, under the new statutory apprenticeship arrangements, the intention is for sector skills councils and sector bodies to issue apprenticeship frameworks and are best placed therefore to ensure that the English framework requirements for the issue of a certificate in respect of the statutory completion conditions are met. In addition, there are currently no contingencies in the England provisions. The amended section will allow the same contingencies in England as in Wales that the Secretary of State may act as the certifying authority where there are no other appropriate persons to do so.</p>

 I am today laying before the House a statement of changes to the Immigration Rules pertaining to tier 1 and tier 2 of the points-based system. Copies of which will be available from the Vote Office.</p>
<br>


<meta name="Date" content="21 Dec 2010">

<notus-date day="21" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>21 Dec 2010 : Column 167WS</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_386"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para81"><a name="10122138000120">On 28 June the Home Secretary announced in the House of Commons that the Government would introduce an interim limit on economic migration in anticipation of the introduction of a permanent limit in April 2011. This limit applied to out-of-country main applicants to tier 1 (general) between 19 July 2010 and April 2011, and numbers entering through this route would be equal to those entering in the equivalent period for 2009-10. The limit also applied to the number of migrants who can be offered jobs by sponsor employers through tier 2 (general). This route was to be reduced in the interim period by 1,300 migrants, the equivalent of a 5% reduction across the relevant routes of tiers 1 and 2.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_387"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para82"><a name="10122138000121">The first of the changes in the statement of changes to the Immigration Rules will close the tier 1 (general) category of the Immigration Rules to persons applying from outside the United Kingdom. I am taking this step as a result of the volume of applications that have been received since 19 July 2010, the date I set the interim limit on tier 1 general.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para83"><a name="10122138000122">The second of these changes, specifying the level of the tier 2 (general) interim limit in the Immigration Rules, is being made to take account of the divisional court judgment of 17 December 2010 in the cases brought by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants and the English Community Care Association. The divisional court determined that in order for the Government's interim limit policy to have legal effect the level of the limit should be specified in the Immigration Rules, as opposed to UK Border Agency guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_389"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para84"><a name="10122138000123">The statement of changes remedies the matter. The interim limit on tier 2 (general) will apply from 21 December 2010 until 5 April 2011. The level of the limit is 10,832 and will apply to the number of certificates of sponsorship available to licensed tier 2 (general) sponsors. The changes will take effect immediately to ensure that employers and other users of the UK's immigration system have certainty about its operation. I would welcome the opportunity to debate these immigration rules changes should Members choose to pray against the statement of changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_390"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para85"><a name="10122138000124">The Home Secretary has been granted a certificate to appeal; either directly to the Supreme Court if it grants permission or, if not, to the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_391"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para86"><a name="10122138000125">Tier 1 (general) will be closed to out-of-country applications because of the number of applications that have been received since 19 July 2010. The route is not being closed in response to the divisional court's decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_392"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para87"><a name="10122138000126">The statement of changes to the Immigration Rules laid before Parliament on 28 June 2010 was constructed to provide for the application of interim limits on the number of applications for entry clearance granted under the tier 1 (general) category. Under the Immigration Rules as amended by the changes made on 19 July, applications over and above this upper interim limit would be rolled over for consideration in a subsequent grant period. However, as the Home Secretary announced to Parliament on 23 November, the Government have decided tier 1 (general) route will not continue in its current form and will be refocused as a route aimed at entrepreneurs, investors and the exceptionally talented. This means that there will be no additional allocation of places under the tier 1 (general) category under which rolled-over applications could be considered once the current interim limit is reached.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_393"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para88"><a name="10122138000127">We should not continue to accept applications under the existing route if they cannot be granted once the current interim limit is reached. We expect, taking into account current trends in applications and refusal rates, the interim limit to be reached imminently. The statement of changes to the Immigration Rules therefore removes existing provision for the granting of entry clearance in the tier 1 (general) category.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_394"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para89"><a name="10122138000128">I regret that, given the difficulty in anticipating the date on which the interim limit would be reached, it has not been possible to observe the usual convention of laying such a statement of changes before Parliament 21 days in advance of its entry into force. I also wish to clarify that the numerical limit applied to tier 1 applications under the interim limit is 5,100 and not 5,400 as the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee has previously been informed. The latter figure was the limit that would have applied if interim limits had commenced on 1 July 2010, whereas in fact they commenced on 19 July 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para90"><a name="10122138000129">This change is effective from 23 December and applications for entry clearance as a tier 1 (general) migrant made on or after that date will not be accepted. Applications for entry clearance as a tier 1 (general) migrant made before that date will still be considered against the existing Immigration Rules. These changes do not apply to those who have existing leave in the tier 1 (general) category and require an extension of stay, nor do they apply to those presently in the United Kingdom in another category of stay and are applying for a variation of leave as a tier 1 (general) migrant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_396"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para91"><a name="10122138000130">As noted above, tier 1 of the points-based system will be redesigned to make enhanced provision for entrepreneurs and investors and to incorporate new provisions for the exceptionally talented. This will ensure that tier 1 continues to offer a route for those who are able to make the greatest economic contribution to the United Kingdom. These changes will be introduced in April next year and I will announce the detail of these new arrangements to Parliament in due course.</p>

 As I explained to the House yesterday, in light of the early and severe onset of winter last month I asked David Quarmby CBE to follow up his earlier review of winter resilience with an urgent audit of how well highway authorities and transport operators in England have coped with the cold weather between 24 November and 9 December 2010.

However, given the more recent extreme cold snap, and that forecasts predict snow into the new year, we welcome David's recommendations on how we can further bolster our resilience. It is now vitally important that those to whom they are addressed take these recommendations forward without delay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_398"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para93"><a name="10122138000133">The audit emphasises the volatile nature of British weather, but notes the Met Office's view that the three severe winters are genuinely independent events. However, as I explained to the House yesterday, I will be assessing advice from the Government's chief scientific adviser, Professor Sir John Beddington, on the longer-term implications of the changing climate and the way in which they should influence our investment decisions across the sector in relation to winter resilience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_399"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para94"><a name="10122138000134">The report finds that local highway authorities generally coped well with the extreme and early winter conditions, but used a significant amount of their salt stocks in doing so. To assist with salt supply over the Christmas and new year holiday period when deliveries from the mines tend to become more infrequent, I am making available to highways authorities 30,000 tonnes from the national strategic salt supply which was established earlier in the year in response to Quarmby's first review. I have also asked the Highways Agency to make arrangements for the import of further supplies of salt, up to an additional 250,000 tonnes, to strengthen further our resilience. This is expected to start arriving in January.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_400"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para95"><a name="10122138000135">But we need to ensure that we make the best possible use of existing stocks, new mine production and imported supplies. As we cannot be sure how long the current severe weather will persist, or how often it will recur this winter, prudence requires that all highway authorities should critically examine their current levels of usage and look for economies to maximise the duration of existing stocks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para96"><a name="10122138000136">Varying spread rates between local highway authorities have been identified as a concern for David Quarmby. I have already asked the UK Roads Liaison Group and  <br>

the National Winter Service Research Group to prepare additional straightforward guidance on spread rates based on all evidence available, so that all highway authorities can adopt the practice of the best.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_402"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para97"><a name="10122138000137">The report also refers to the extraordinary events that occurred on the M25 at junction 3 on 30 November. Highways Agency officials have already briefed me on these events, and I look forward to a full report in due course analysing the incident and setting out the lessons that the agency have learnt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_403"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para98"><a name="10122138000138">The rail network has been particularly badly affected by the weather this year, perhaps in contrast to the two previous winters. Quarmby's recommendations here are for the longer term; and I am asking the rail industry to formulate proposals on contingency timetables, real-time information and third rail alternatives. I will also ask them to conduct the recommended review of their operational performance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para99"><a name="10122138000139">Although the focus today is very much on aviation and the problems at Heathrow in particular, this was less of an issue during the period that this report covers and there are therefore no specific recommendations directed at the aviation sector. It is clear, however, that, as a separate piece of work, we will need to work with BAA and the airlines to understand exactly what went wrong at Heathrow over the weekend and why it has taken the airport so long to recover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_405"><a name="101221m0001.htm_para100"><a name="10122138000140">I would like to thank David Quarmby, who has delivered this audit report to a very challenging timetable. As with his previous reports, his analysis and recommendations are clear-sighted, and will help the transport sector to improve its resilience to winter weather.</p>
