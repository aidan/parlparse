Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office (Mr. Pat
McFadden):</b> I am pleased to announce that the 2006 version
of the &#147;Public Bodies Directory&#148; has now been completed
and copies of the directory are available in the Library for the
Reference of Members. The directory provides information on individual
public bodies as at 31 March 2006. The directory isalso
accessible at:
http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/other/agencies/public_bodies/index.asp.
This shows that at31 March 2006 there was a reduction of 28
long-term public bodies since the same date in
2005.</p><p><a name="0609113000040">The
directory lists the public bodies sponsored by central Government, with
contact details, information about their remit and about the membership
of their boards. It also introduces a new category within the public
bodies classifications; Public Broadcasting Authorities. This
recognises the unique governance arrangements pertaining to the BBC and
S4C, which set them apart from other non-Departmental bodies and public
corporations.</p><p><a name="0609113000041">The
board membership figures are broken down between male and female
members for individual bodies, and summaries are provided at
departmental level for the proportions of board members who are women,
have declared they have a disability or come from a minority ethnic
background. There have been small increases in all categories. As at 31
March 2006, 35.5 per cent. of appointments made were women (up 0.5 per
cent. on the position at 31 March 2005), 5.9 per cent. were members of
ethnic minority groups (up0.4 per cent.) and 5.1 per cent.
were to those declaring a disability (up 0.8 per
cent.).</p><p><a name="0609113000042">A
cross-Government summary of individual Departments&#146; figures will
be placed on the public appointments website at:
www.publicappointments.gov.uk. This reinforces the
Government&#146;s commitment to continue to pursue its diversity
objectives and to promote outreach activity and
plans.</p><p><a name="0609113000043">The
directory also includes information about the Government&#146;s Task
Forces, Ad-hoc Advisory Groups and Reviews, giving a more complete
picture of the bodies and groups working to deliver the
Government&#146;s
objectives.</p><h4 align="center"><a name="0609113000016">Social

proud of in our efforts to tackle poverty, promote social justice and
create the right environment for sustained economic
growth.</p><p><a name="0609113000047">However,
a consequence of this success is that the more modest progress of some
specific groups within our society has become more
apparent.</p><p><a name="0609113000048">This
Action Plan is the first step towards changing that. It aims to create
the conditions to allow everybody to accept opportunity, reach their
full potential and play their full part in
society.</p><p><a name="0609113000049">This
Action Plan marks a new direction for the Government&#146;s social
exclusion policy. It commits us
to:</p><a name="0609113000050"><ul><p class="tabletext">Better
identification and early intervention: We will identify early who is at
risk of persistent exclusion and use this information to more
effectively intervene and support those most in need, and before
disadvantage becomes
entrenched.</p></ul><a name="0609113000051"><ul><p class="tabletext">Identifying
what works: We will systematically identify and promote interventions
that work. To ensure effective adoption of best practice, we will build
the capability of providers and
commissioners.</p></ul><a name="0609113000052"><ul><p class="tabletext">Multi-agency
working: We will break down barriers and enhance flexibility so local
providers and agencies can work together to meet the needs of excluded
groups, especially those facing multiple
problems.</p></ul><a name="0609113000053"><ul><p class="tabletext">Personalisation,
rights and responsibilities: We will tailor services to the needs of
the individual. We will empower, where it is appropriate, excluded
groups to make choices on their own behalf or ensure there is an
independent, trusted third party to work on their behalf. Our approach
will be framed by a clear understanding of the rights and
responsibilities of citizens, services and the
community.</p></ul><a name="0609113000054"><ul><p class="tabletext">Supporting
achievement and managing underperformance: Where local authorities and
services are delivering, Government will leave them alone. But where
there is underperformance, Government will
intervene.</p></ul><p><a name="0609113000055">The
Action Plan outlines how these principles will be applied or piloted
for excluded groups throughout the lifetime&#151;during the early
years, the childhood years and the adult years. Implementing more
focused and immediate interventions will supplement and inform deeper
systemic
reform.</p><p><a name="0609113000056">Copies

Roulement - Theatre Reserve
Battalion</h4><p><a name="0609113000065"><b><a name="0609113000393">The
Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne):</b> On 18 July in
a written ministerial statement I confirmed the details of the force
package for the next routine roulement of UK forces in Iraq in November
when the lead UK formation, currently 20 Armoured Brigade, will be
replaced by 19 Light Brigade. I would now like to confirm some of the
details of preparations for this roulement. As for previous roulements,
elements of the Theatre Reserve Battalion, currently the 2nd Battalion,
the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, will be deployed to provide additional
security during what is always a period of intense activity for UK
forces. There will also be some additional support aimed at
contributing to improving security in Basra
city.</p><p><a name="0609113000066">In
total this involves approximately 360 additional personnel. They will
begin deploying shortly and complete their work not later than January
2007.</p><p><a name="0609113000067">This
is a critical period for the Iraqi people and their Government. There
is an opportunity to improve significantly the security situation in
Basra city&#151;building on, and reinforcing, recent progress in
Baghdad. Improved security in Basra will create the conditions for the
important civil development work being led by the UK&#146;s
Provincial Reconstruction Team. Therefore I have agreed that the
deployment of troops from the Theatre Reserve Battalion, while strictly
time limited, should on this occasion be brought forward and extended
by a short period. In addition, I have also authorised the deployment
of Royal Engineers to assist with reconstruction and countering the
threat from improvised explosive devices, a Royal Marine boat troop to
assist in tightening security on the Shatt Al Arab waterway, and a
troop of Royal Military Police to augment our training of the Iraqi
Police.</p><p><a name="0609113000068">We ask our
servicemen and women to discharge difficult and dangerous tasks. But
over the next few months, through security operations and civil
development projects, we have a key opportunity to make improvements to
the lives of the people&#151;of Basra and lay the foundations for the
departure, once the conditions are right, of coalition forces from
front line roles in Iraq.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="9" year="2006" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><b>11 Sep 2006 : Column 112WS</b><br><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="0609113000005">Education

Annual Report on Strategic Export Controls is an innovation of this

past. Our export licensing system is one of the most rigorous and
transparent regimes in the world and the Annual Report&#151;in this
new format&#151;symbolises our continued commitment to accountability
and transparency by presenting detailed information in a more modern
and user friendly format. This year, due to the increasing volume of
information on strategic exports that is being published by the
Government, all the statistical data that was historically published
only in hardcopy is now made available on a CD ROM which accompanies
the report. Since 2004 the Government have also produced detailed
Quarterly Reports available on the Internet&#151;ensuring that the UK
provides some of the most open and timely export licensing information
available anywhere. The new CD ROM includes the Quarterly Reports for
2005, as well as more consolidated data, information on licence
refusals and fuller information on trade control (trafficking and
brokering) licences issued during 2005. The complete report will be

Africa - Humanitarian
Update</h4><p><a name="0609113000124"><b><a name="0609113000399">The
Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary
Benn):</b> At the beginning of this year the UN judged that
8.2 million people in East Africa and the Horn were in need of urgent
humanitarian assistance, mainly food aid, following the worse drought
for a decade. Since then approximately 490,000mt of food aid has been
delivered to respond to these needs. Additional assistance has been
provided in the form of emergency medical, nutritional, water and
sanitation, shelter and other forms of relief. The UK has provided
approximately &#163;55 million or $103.9 million towards this.
Overall the international donor community have provided over $660
million towards the relief
effort.</p><p><a name="0609113000126">The
long rains in the early and mid part of 2006 have led to improvements
in most areas. Unfortunately, most notably in Ethiopia, flooding has
brought its own tragedy as over 600 people have died and more than
150,000 have lost their homes or been affected in one way or another.
Most recently DFID has made available a further &#163;6 million for
humanitarian assistance in Kenya, where malnutrition rates remain high
and current season harvest assessments present a very mixed picture. In
Ethiopia we have provided&#163;l million for urgent relief
to flood-affected
people.</p><p><a name="0609113000128">Humanitarian
assistance is still needed to address the urgent medical and
nutritional needs of the most seriously sick and malnourished, and to
meet other basic needs, including clean water, to the reduce risks of
death and disease. Basic humanitarian indicators remain worrying, but
we expect that the steps taken by relief agencies have mitigated what
might have been more serious consequences, such as widespread mortality
and displacement. We are closely monitoring the
situation.</p><p><a name="0609113000130">Assistance
is also being provided in an effort to improve productive capacity by
investing in livestock or other farming inputs such as seeds, tools and
livestock vaccinations. However, it remains a challenge to achieve
sustained benefits for the poorest and most vulnerable communities. In
Ethiopia we are leading supporters of a productive safety nets
programme to tackle chronic hunger; we are working on the development
of a similar programme in Kenya. It is also important to note that
substantial risks remain from conflict in the region, and we are
working closely with the international community to promote peace and
stability as a prerequisite to finding long term solutions to
persistent humanitarian
crises.</p>

Child Health Programme, which was not funded by DFID. An action plan
will help strengthen competitive tendering procedures and increase
transparency for the purchasing of drugs and equipment, and new
standards will be introduced to improve the quality of products. Until
these measures take effect, all procurement contracts over $200,000
will be handled by international
agents.</p><p><a name="0609113000135">The
total cost of this second phase of the Reproductive and Child Health
Programme is around &#163;5 billion, which the Indian central and
state Governments will meet the bulk of. External aid will be around 15
per cent. of the overall budget, with the single largest contribution
coming from DFID. Our aid is being fully coordinated with other
development partners, including the World
Bank.</p><p><a name="0609113000136">The
Reproductive and Child Health Programme is universal in coverage, and
it will provide care through pregnancy, childbirth and childhood. But
resources will be targeted on India&#146;s poorest states, including
Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, and Madhya Pradesh and will especially
target women and children among the poorest and most marginalised
families, in Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes.</p><p><a name="0609113000137">DFID&#146;s
financial support will be used for upgrading maternity facilities;
increasing skilled attendance at birth; the purchase of essential
drugs, equipment, supplies and contraceptives; staff training;
communications; the piloting of new ideas; and assessing the impact of
the programme. DFID technical assistance will finance a National Health
Systems Resource Centre, which will provide overall technical
assistance to the Programme at central and state level, and strengthen
health sector
procurement.</p><p><a name="0609113000138">This
second phase of the programme is ambitious and will require a huge
expansion in the delivery of public sector health services, to tackle
some of the country&#146;s biggest health problems. It also includes
a number of additional accountability and financial management
safeguards to strengthen the Government&#146;s anti-corruption
systems. The programme will be monitored closely by the Indian
Government and development partners, through reviews every six months.

Humanitarian Situation in
Gaza</h4><p><a name="0609113000139"><b><a name="0609113000401">The
Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary
Benn):</b> The recent conflict in Lebanon caused great harm to
the civilian populations in both Israel and Lebanon. A million people,
a quarter of Lebanon&#146;s population, were displaced by the
fighting and in Israel 300,000 people were reported to have fled their
homes or taken to shelters. Israel had every right to defend itself
against Hezbollah, but from the beginning we expressed the need for a
proportionate response. I believe that this requires all sides to
respect international humanitarian
law.</p><p><a name="0609113000141">The
ceasefire, reached after much diplomatic activity, including strenuous
efforts by the British Government, is holding and has aided the relief
effort but the humanitarian situation in Lebanon remains
serious.</p><p><a name="0609113000143">On
15 August, the day after the ceasefire came into effect, I visited
Beirut to assess the situation for myself. The priorities for the
humanitarian aid effort were to secure sustained access for
humanitarian convoys to reach the most vulnerable; to ensure safe
return for displaced citizens; to minimise the risk of injury and death
from unexploded munitions for those returning and for aid workers; and
to repair basic infrastructure, such as water and power supplies and
bridges.</p><p><a name="0609113000145">From
early in the conflict, the UK responded to Lebanon&#146;s call for
help. Our total funding commitment now stands at &#163;22.3 million,
including our share of multilateral spending, making us one of the
biggest bilateral contributors to the humanitarian effort. In line with
our assessment of current priorities, this money is helping to provide
shelter, healthcare, water and sanitation, and to clear unexploded
munitions. We have agreed to provide urgently needed prefabricated
bridges to open critical humanitarian supply routes. The first three
bridges arrived in Lebanon on 1
September.</p><p><a name="0609113000147">The
Government have also urged Israel to lift all restrictions on normal
shipping entering Lebanese ports, as set out in resolution 1701. This
is essential in order to help restore the economy. The partial lifting
of the economic blockade last week has further enhanced the chances of
avoiding a much bigger humanitarian crisis and will help Lebanon begin
the path to recovery. We continue to push for further progress on the
issue.</p><p><a name="0609113000149">The
international community has responded generously to Prime Minister
Siniora&#146;s appeal for assistance at the Stockhom conference on
early recovery held on 31 August. Collectively we have pledged over
$900 million to aid recovery. It will be important that these pledges
are acted on as soon as
possible.</p><p><a name="0609113000151">Lebanon
needed our aid, and we are ready to do more as needed, but more than
anything else what Lebanon and the region need is peace. The conflict
of this summer was a symptom of a wider collective failure to resolve
the conflict that has affected the 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="9" year="2006" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><b>11 Sep 2006 : Column 118WS</b><br>Middle East for decades. UN SCR 1701 was a step in the right direction,
and must be implemented by all parties, but we need to encourage
negotiation, compromise and above all political leadership to end the
long-term suffering of people on both sides of the
border.</p><p><a name="0609113000153">Unfortunately,
what has happened in Lebanon is not the only humanitarian crisis in the
region. We cannot forget the plight of the Palestinians, especially in
Gaza, where violence continues and people die. Since the start of the
current conflict on 28 June, over 200 Palestinians have been killed and
over 700 injured. The cost of damage to agriculture and industry is now
estimated at around $46 million. Many households continue to receive
only six-eight hours of electricity per day. However, there are plans
to rebuild the Gaza power station and to supply electricity from Egypt,
which should improve the situation. Intermittent electricity supply is
affecting all key services. Water supply and sanitation services remain
limited, with severe health implications. The UN now estimates a 65 per
cent. increase in the number of children with diarrhoea compared with
this time last year. Hospitals are struggling to operate vital
equipment and to store drugs and vaccines
safely.</p><p><a name="0609113000155">Food
prices are rising and 70 per cent. of Gazans are now considered to be
food insecure. The World Food Programme reports a 72 per cent. increase
in numbers using their feeding programme. Gaza crossing points are open
intermittently, primarily for humanitarian food supplies. Action is
needed to ensure unrestricted humanitarian access, including the supply
of medical equipment, fuel, food and
electricity.</p><p><a name="0609113000157">At
the Stockholm Donor Conference on1 September, donors pledged
$500 million for the Occupied Palestinian Territories, of which $200
million was for humanitarian aid. The UK pledged &#163;3 million to
the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) for operation, maintenance
and repair work to keep water, sanitation and electricity services
running. This follows an earlier contribution to the TIM of &#163;3
million to fund essential health supplies. In addition, the UK made a
contribution of &#163;15 million to the United Nations Relief and
Works Agency (UNRWA) in April. UNRWA provides healthcare and other
basic services for Palestinian refugees, who comprise 70 per cent. of
Gaza&#146;s population. The UK has also deployed two experts to the
United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to
improve its capacity to monitor the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
These two experts will assist donors and others to make sure help gets
to those who need it the
most.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="0609113000010">Health</h3><h4 align="center"><a name="0609113000027">NHS

maintain the free provision of related services, including the supply

Powers</h4><p><a name="0609113000328"><b><a name="0609113000406">The
Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety (Mr.
Tony McNulty):</b> Section 14(1) of the Prevention of
Terrorism Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) requires the Secretary of State to
report to Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of
every relevant three-month period on the exercise of the control order
powers during that
period.</p><p><a name="0609113000329">During
the period 11 June to 10 September 2006, nine orders were made with the
permission of the court under section 3(l)(a) of the 2005
Act&#151;one in respect of a British citizen on 19 June 2006, one in
respect of a foreign national on 31 July 2006, six in respect of
foreign nationals on 1 August 2006 and one in respect of a British
citizen on 5 September
2006.</p><p><a name="0609113000330">The
Secretary of State has also renewed one control order in accordance
with Section 2 (4) (b) of the 2005 Act on 30 August
2006.</p><p><a name="0609113000331">There
are 15 control orders currently in force, six of which are in respect
of British
citizens.</p><p><a name="0609113000332">During
the period two requests to modify a control order obligation were
agreed, and seven requests to modify a control order obligation were
refused. A right of appeal exists in section 10(3) of the 2005 Act
against a decision by the Secretary of State not to modify an
obligation contained in a control
order.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="0609113000012">Trade

of Doha Development Agenda
Negotiations</h4><p><a name="0609113000333"><b><a name="0609113000407">The
Minister for Trade (Mr. Ian McCartney):</b> I would
like to update the House on the World Trade Organisation&#146;s (WTO)
negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda. On July 24, Pascal Lamy,
the Director General of the WTO announced that he was recommending the
suspension of the negotiations across all subjects, after talks between
the US, EU, Brazil, India, Australia and Japan broke down on the key
issues of agricultural domestic support, agricultural market access and
non-agricultural market access. He said the suspension would give all
WTO members time to reflect, to examine available options and to review
their positions. His recommendation was accepted at a WTO General
Council meeting on27
July.</p><p><a name="0609113000334">The
UK Government are very disappointed that insufficient progress has been
made in the negotiations to allow the conclusion of the Doha Round this
year. While it is very disappointing that no agreement has yet been
reached, it is premature to say that the Doha Round has collapsed and
cannot be revived. We believe that all key players have a
responsibility to use the suspension of the negotiations to reflect on
their positions with a view to showing flexibility in future that will
allow an agreement to be reached. Developing countries, including the
poorest countries, are the biggest losers from the failure to reach
agreement.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="9" year="2006" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><b>11 Sep 2006 : Column 123WS</b><br><p><a name="0609113000335">The UK remains
committed to achieving an ambitious, pro-development outcome to these
negotiations. Our priority now is to encourage all WTO members to
re-engage</p><p><a name="0609113000336">in the
negotiations as soon as possible. The UK Government have taken and will
continue to take every opportunity to press for this&#151;within the
EU and with other WTO members. The UK Government will also continue to
press for progress on Aid For Trade for developing countries. Building
developing countries&#146; capacity to trade is important in helping
them integrate into the global economy and for providing a route out of
poverty and we do not believe that Aid for Trade should be conditional
on the successful conclusion of the
DDA.</p><p><a name="0609113000337">The
UK will continue to support a multilateral, rules based, international
trading system. We believe multilateralism is the best way of tackling
unfair trade
practices.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="0609113000013">Work
