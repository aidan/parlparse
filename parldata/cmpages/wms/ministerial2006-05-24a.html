Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls):</b> The
statement on the 2006 budget of the European Communities (EC budget),
entitled &#147;European Community Finances&#148; (Cm 6770), has
today been laid before Parliament. This White Paper is the 26th in the
series. As in the past, it covers annual budgetary matters and includes
details of recent developments in European Community financial
management and in countering fraud against the EC budget. It also
describes the EC budget for 2006 as adopted by the European Parliament,
and details the United Kingdom's gross and net contributions to the EC
budget for calendar years 2000 to 2006 and financial years 2000-01 to
2007-08.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06052471000003">Health</h3><h4 align="center"><a name="06052471000010">Legal
Services
(Regulation)</h4><p><a name="06052471000016"><b><a name="06052471000049">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs
(Bridget Prentice):</b> On17 October 2005, I
informed this House of the publication of the White Paper &#147;The
Future of Legal Services: Putting Consumers First&#148; setting out
the Government's proposals for the regulatory reform of legal services
in England and Wales. I am pleased today, just seven months later, to
be publishing the draft Legal Services Bill for pre-legislative
scrutiny, as the first step in delivering on those proposals. Copies of
the draft Bill and accompanying regulatory impact assessment will be
placed in the Libraries of both
Houses.</p><p><a name="06052471000017">The
draft Bill sets out our detailed plans for the creation of a strong
independent oversight regulator the Legal Services Board which will
ensure that front line regulators discharge their duties effectively.
In addition, legislation will provide the LSB with a wide range of
powers including those to authorise and de-authorise front line
regulators and to quickly bring unregulated legal services under its
remit through secondary legislation to best protect consumers
interests. Our proposals also provide for the creation of an
independent office for legal complaints, which for the first time will
remove the handling of legal complaints from the legal professions. The
OLC will help to foster greater consumer confidence and result in quick
and fair redress.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 88WS</b><br><p><a name="06052471000018">The draft Legal
Services Bill also sets out arrangements to facilitate alternative
business structures, which would enable different kinds of lawyers, and
lawyers and non-lawyers, to work together on an equal footing. These
structures will allow legal services to be delivered in new ways,
promoting greater competition and innovation and enabling providers to
better respond to the demands of consumers. A range of safeguards will
be put in place to protect consumers and demand high
standards.</p><p><a name="06052471000019">In
taking forward these proposals the Government have continued to engage
with key stakeholders. The consumer advisory panel, comprising
representatives of main consumer bodies, has contributed significantly
to informing and shaping the proposed reforms. In addition to the
consumer panel we have, throughout the process, maintained effective
engagement with all stakeholder groups including the legal professions,
consumer organisations and the general
public.</p><p><a name="06052471000020">The
draft Legal Services Bill will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny
by the Joint Committee that has been constituted for that purpose,
which will report by July 2006. This timeframe provides an opportunity
for Parliament to take evidence and consider the detail of the
proposals and make recommendations through the Joint Committee's final
report.</p><p><a name="06052471000021">These
proposals are complex and important and I believe it is right that
Parliament should have the opportunity to scrutinise them in draft
form. I look forward to receiving the Joint Committee&#146;s
report.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06052471000004">Environment,

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Mr. Ben Bradshaw):</b> I am pleased to announce the
Government's response, to the 25th report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution: &#147;Turning the Tide&#151;Addressing the
impact of Fisheries on the Marine
Environment&#148;.</p><p><a name="06052471000023">The
Royal Commission's report, which was presented to Parliament in
December 2004, was an important contribution to thinking on how we can
better protect the marine environment. The RCEP report made over 70
recommendations covering a wide range of fisheries activity and their
impact on the marine
environment.</p><p><a name="06052471000024">We
have for the most part accepted the RCEP's recommendations. The key
recommendation in the RCEP report was the need for a new
frameworkfor marine management. Our response reflects
developments on the Marine Bill, in particular the public consultation
launched in March this year. The response also reflects Government's
recent decisions on decommissioning, and progress made since
publication of &#147;Securing the Benefits&#148;, the Fisheries
Departments' response to the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit landmark
report, &#147;Net Benefits&#148;.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 89WS</b><br><p><a name="06052471000025">Key elements of the response,

Britain - China
Centre</h4><p><a name="06052471000035"><b><a name="06052471000051">The
Minister for Trade (Mr. Ian McCartney):</b> I am pleased to
announce the Government's continued support for the Great Britain-China
Centre (GBCC), through a grant-in-aid by the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, after a recent
review.</p><p><a name="06052471000036">The
GBCC has been a centre of expertise on China, with a particular focus
on human rights, labour reform and improving the rule of law in China,
since 1974. It can contribute unique skills and access to fulfilling
these important functions. The Centre also provides support for
parliamentary and other exchanges with China. The GBCC is a
Non-Departmental Public Body (NDPB) sponsored by the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office through an annual grant-in-aid of
&#163;300,000.</p><p><a name="06052471000037">The
Foreign and Commonwealth Office commissioned a review of the GBCC in
mid-2005. The aim of the review was to examine whether the function
provided by the GBCC was required, and whether the Centre's existing
form as a NDPB was the best option for
delivery.</p><p><a name="06052471000038">During
the consultation period following the review, many honourable Members
expressed their views to the Government on the valuable role of the
GBCC in promoting sensitive issues such as labour reform and the rule
of law in China. It was judged that the arm's-length approach of the
GBCC brings value-added benefit that cannot be achieved by Government.
In light of these responses and subsequent work bythe GBCC
and officials of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to correct the
management and control weaknesses identified in the Review, the
Government have decided to maintain the GBCC's NDPB
status.</p><p><a name="06052471000039">The
follow-up work to the review has ensured that the GBCC now has stronger
financial controls, a better alignment of the Centre's work with
Government policy on China and improved management oversight.
Ministerial agreement to these new measures brings to an end the
process initiated by the review. The GBCC 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 90WS</b><br>now looks forward to further consolidating and expanding its position as
a centre of expertise on China, widening its project base and
diversifying its funding sources, including from the EU, UN and the
private
sector.</p><p><a name="06052471000040">Throughout
this period, we have appreciated the constructive and co-operative
approach of all members of the Executive Committee and staff of the
GBCC. The Government welcome the conclusion of the review and looks
forward to continuing to work in partnership with the GBCC on
China.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06052471000006">Transport</h3><h4 align="center"><a name="06052471000013">M6
Toll</h4><p><a name="06052471000041"><b><a name="06052471000052">The
Secretary of State for Transport (Mr. Douglas Alexander):</b>
The M6 toll road was privately financed, built, and is now operated by
Midland Expressway Ltd (MEL) under a concession agreement signed by the
then Secretary of State for Transport in
1992.</p><p><a name="06052471000042">Having
borne all the financial and development risk associated with the
construction of the &#163;900 million M6 toll, Macquarie
Infrastructure Group (MIG)&#151;the owners of MEL&#151;are
proposing to refinance MEL's debt, recognising the revised risk MEL now
bears as operator of the road, which has been open to traffic since
December
2003.</p><p><a name="06052471000043">I
am pleased to record that MIG have agreed to fund &#163;112 million
of road improvements in the West Midlands from their total refinancing
resources.</p><p><a name="06052471000044">This
re-investment will fund improvements to the slip road access from the
M42 to the southern end of the M6 toll, and will cover the costs of
construction, operation and maintenance of a new road from the M54 and
Telford to the M6 and the M6
toll.</p><p><a name="06052471000045">The
need for this link was identified in the west midlands area multi-modal
study (WMAMMS), to improve access to and from the M54 corridor and
Telford, and the Highways Agency has been undertaking detailed work
with a view to developing a scheme for entry to the targeted programme
of
improvements.</p><p><a name="06052471000046">The
new road should open to traffic around 2012 (subject to the usual
statutory processes), helping to free up current bottlenecks and to
improve road travel through the
region.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06052471000007">Wales</h3><h4 align="center"><a name="06052471000014">Departmental
