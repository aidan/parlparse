<P>
<a name="31201m01.html_spmin2"><B>The Secretary of State for International Development   (Hilary Benn): </B> 
 The humanitarian crisis that has affected six countries in Southern Africa (Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe) since September 2001 has eased in recent months. Emergency operations have largely ended in Malawi and Zambia and are working on a reduced scale in Swaziland. The position in Zimbabwe remains very serious and, while there are also significant needs in Lesotho and Mozambique, these too are now on a much smaller scale.
<P>

<a name="31201m01.html_para7">Efforts to support recovery operations are either underway or being planned in all six countries and DFID is examining, with partners, what further actions we can take to reduce hunger and vulnerability in the region in the long term. These efforts will need to take careful account of the widespread impact of HIV/AIDS in Southern Africa.
<P>

<a name="31201m01.html_para8">Humanitarian needs are greatest in Zimbabwe, largely caused by the Zimbabwe Government's disastrous policies. Foreign exchange shortages have meant that the Government of Zimbabwe has been unable to import significant volumes of food and seeds for planting, and the Government continues to prevent the private sector from importing or marketing grain. Rampant inflation and increasing unemployment has meant that few people are able to purchase the limited food available in the market. Though the needs of displaced former commercial farm workers and their families have yet to be assessed accurately, it is estimated up to half a million of them are in need of assistance. The economic collapse means that urban areas are also badly affected and vulnerability levels in the major centres have been rising steadily. A further assessment of needs 



<P>
<P>1 Dec 2003 : Column 45WS<P>
in urban areas will be published shortly. In total, half the population of Zimbabwe&#151;around five and a half million people&#151;are likely to need food aid over the coming months.
<P>

<a name="31201m01.html_para9">There has long been concern about possible interference by the Zimbabwe Government with international food aid programmes. It is the agreed policy of the World Food Programme and other donor agencies working in Zimbabwe that relevant operations will be suspended in the event of such political interference. There have, however, been no significant incidents of this kind in recent months and no suspensions have therefore been needed. Minor incidents have occurred periodically but all of these have been investigated and resolved with local authorities using agreed procedures. By contrast, food distribution controlled by the Zimbabwe Government through the state Grain Marketing Board is not subject to the same monitoring procedures and there is evidence that it is distorted for political reasons.
<P>

<a name="31201m01.html_para10">In Mozambique, while harvests in the North remained good, there has been near total crop failure in many Southern and Central districts as a result of poor rainfall last year. This has affected about 650,000 people who are in need of food and other assistance.
<P>

<a name="31201m01.html_para11">In Lesotho, crop failure has also affected a significant part of the population with up to 700,000 people estimated to be affected following the failure of the winter harvest. There are considerable problems of access to many of the most vulnerable populations, many of whom comprise growing numbers of orphans and child-headed households.
<P>

<a name="31201m01.html_para12">To address these needs DFID will be spending over &#163;40 million this year on immediate humanitarian assistance in the Southern African region. This builds on the &#163;125 million that the Government has already spent since September 2001. The vast majority of the new funds this year (&#163;35 million) will be for humanitarian assistance operations in Zimbabwe. We have also provided &#163;3.5 million to fund emergency operations in Mozambique and Lesotho and are continuing to monitor the position in those countries closely. Resources are being channelled through the main UN agencies, notably the World Food Programme, as well as through a range of NGOs to support emergency feeding and nutrition programmes. We have also provided &#163;500,000 for enhanced monitoring of food aid deliveries and beneficiary selection procedures in Zimbabwe. In Mozambique, DFID will also be supporting efforts led by the Ministry of Agriculture to better target humanitarian assistance in addition to providing immediate food aid and nutritional support. We are also providing &#163;1.5 million to the UN's regional co-ordination and support office in Johannesburg to help the UN's regional planning and improve its country programmes in affected countries. The World Food Programme has responded to the concerns of DFID and other donors, as well as partner governments by stepping up efforts to increase the amount of food that it purchases in local markets. They and others are working to address remaining barriers, including import restrictions between countries in the region.




<P>
<P>1 Dec 2003 : Column 46WS<P>

<P>

<a name="31201m01.html_para13">Pockets of vulnerability remain in Malawi and Zambia, but we have seen important improvements in the food security situation in both countries over the past few months. Strategic grain reserves have recovered and these will need to be carefully managed. In Malawi, our support for subsidised inputs programmes continues to provide affordable seeds and fertilisers for poorer households, enhancing household food security and allowing them to grow maize that can offer an alternative to imported commodities. In Zambia, maize is both available and accessible.
<P>

<a name="31201m01.html_para14"><P>

<a name="31201m01.html_para15">Food security will continue to be a concern throughout the region for the foreseeable future, especially given indications that vulnerability is increasing, partly due to the high rates of HIV/AIDS in Southern Africa. DFID is developing a regional hunger and vulnerability strategy for working with national Governments and regional institutions to promote food security in the future in ways that both protect and promote livelihoods for the most vulnerable communities.

 I am pleased to report to the House the outcome of our review of how we fund local authorities for the cost of paying housing benefit and council tax benefit. This forms part of our overall programme of housing benefit reform.
<P>

<a name="31201m02.html_para4">My right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government, Regional Governance and Fire, reported to the House on 19 November, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 787&#150;89, that we had agreed with local government that it would be sensible to rationalise the funding of housing and council tax benefit subsidy. He went on to say that in implementing that transfer of responsibility we had ensured that all properly made claims will be fully funded.
<P>

<a name="31201m02.html_para5">The outcome of the subsidy review, and the associated transfers of funding, is that the Department for Work and Pensions will from April 2004 be responsible for funding local authorities for the payments of housing benefit and council tax benefit they make, replacing a complex set of arrangements whereby funding came from various different sources.
<P>

<a name="31201m02.html_para6">The Local Government Act 2003 provides for the funding of rent rebates to be taken out of the housing revenue account. As a result, we will transfer responsibility for payment of rent rebate subsidy from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and National Assembly for Wales to the Department for Work and Pensions from 2004&#150;05. This Department is already responsible for rent rebate subsidy in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="31201m02.html_para7">The Department will also take responsibility from April 2004 for those residual elements of rent allowance and council tax benefit subsidy currently paid to local authorities by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Executive.
<P>

<a name="31201m02.html_para8">Bringing all these disparate funding streams together has provided the opportunity for a full review of the subsidy system. The aims of the review were to achieve greater simplification and rationalisation, reduce burdens on local authorities, achieve fairer incentives for performance, and achieve a cost-neutral streamlined system.
<P>

<a name="31201m02.html_para9">As a result, I am pleased to report to the House that, for all payments of housing benefit and council tax benefit across Great Britain, l00 per cent. subsidy will be paid for all correctly paid benefit, and the subsidy rate for properly backdated claims will increase from 50 per cent. to 100 per cent.




<P>
<P>1 Dec 2003 : Column 48WS<P>

<P>

<a name="31201m02.html_para10">In addition, we will introduce a new performance-related way of funding local authorities for specified overpayments, linked to an authority's achievements against thresholds set by DWP. Local authorities will also be paid a contribution towards the cost of discretionary local schemes in respect of war pensions disregards.
<P>

<a name="31201m02.html_para11">A transitional protection scheme will also apply, designed to cushion the impact on local authorities of implementing the subsidy reform package.
<P>

<a name="31201m02.html_para12">Finally, we are planning to produce a new subsidy claim form combining all subsidy claims.
<P>

<a name="31201m02.html_para13">We are confident that these reforms will bring welcome rationalisation of the highly complex arrangements inherited by this Government.

 On 18 September 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 62WS, I informed the House that British Energy had made a further drawing on the credit facility following its repayment of all outstanding amounts in March. On 14 October 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 11WS, I informed the House that the company had formally agreed with creditors the terms of its proposed restructuring.
<P>

<a name="31201m02.html_para14">British Energy has subsequently asked for the maximum amount available under the facility to be increased from &#163;200 million to &#163;275 million. I am advised by the company that the principal reasons for this request are the costs of unplanned outages at Sizewell B and Heysham 1 and the impact of current volatility in wholesale electricity prices (increasing both the required levels of trading collateral and the cost of the unplanned outages) which have had an adverse impact on the company's liquidity.
<P>

<a name="31201m02.html_para15">We and our advisers have considered British Energy's request carefully. This is the first opportunity I have had to inform the House that, in the light of that consideration, I have confirmed to the company that I will increase the maximum amount available under the facility to the amount requested, subject to the condition that the increase will be limited to the period prior to the expected receipt of the proceeds from the sale of the company's interest in Amergen, or 22 February 2004, if earlier, whereafter it will be reduced to &#163;200 million.
<P>

<a name="31201m02.html_para16">The increase in the facility is within the rescue aid ceiling approved by the European Commission last year, although as a matter of courtesy my officials are informing the Commission. The stringent controls governing drawings on the facility by British Energy remain in place, and the company's obligations under the credit facility agreement continue to be secured by charges over the British Energy Group's assets. We continue to expect any drawings on the facility to be repaid in full, including interest, as soon as the company is in a position to do so.

<P>

<a name="31201m03.html_para0">The draft regulations will be made under new powers conferred by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.

Friend the Home Secretary to take a fundamental look at the operations of the Criminal Records Bureau. In particular, the Review Team 



<P>
<P>1 Dec 2003 : Column 50WS<P>
recommended that the critical role of Registered Bodies in the Disclosure process should be upgraded by making them unambiguously responsible for validating the identity of Disclosure applicants and for ensuring that application forms are fully and accurately completed. The draft regulations achieve these objectives by attaching conditions to registration; were such conditions are breached the provisions in the Criminal Justice Act will enable a Registered Body's registration to be suspended or revoked.
<P>

<a name="31201m03.html_para1">The Criminal Records Bureau will put in place a Registered Body assurance team to improve the level of training and support to Registered Bodies to help them meet the standards expected of them. To meet the cost of managing and supporting the Registered Body network, the draft regulations provide for Registered Bodies to pay an annual fee of &#163;300. The consultation paper invites views on alternative means of funding the Registered Body assurance team.

It now has the capacity to process over 50,000 Disclosure applications per week, double the number of summer 2002, and is consistently meeting its service standards of issuing 90 per cent of Standard and Enhanced Disclosures within 2 and 4 weeks respectively. Moreover, the CRB has now taken on the processing of some one quarter of a million applications from staff working in the care sector.

<a name="31201m03.html_para3">The Government has previously made clear that the CRB must be self-financing from 2005&#150;06. As the CRB moves towards full cost recovery, it is necessary to reduce (from &#163;18.8 million in 2003&#150;04 to &#163;8.1 million in 2004&#150;05) the substantial subsidy the Bureau currently receives from the general taxpayer and make a compensating increase in the Disclosure fee. From 1 April 2004 the fee for an Enhanced Disclosure will be &#163;33 and for a Standard Disclosure &#163;28. The fee payable by a Registered Body for registering an additional counter-signatory will be increased to &#163;33. Disclosures will continue to be issued free to volunteers, saving the voluntary sector some &#163;12 million in 2004&#150;05.
