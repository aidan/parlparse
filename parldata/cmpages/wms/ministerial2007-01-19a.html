<p><a name="st_0"><a name="07011959000011"><a name="70119m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="07011959000078"><b>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. Phil Woolas):</b> I am aware that for some time there has been significant concern that the current governance arrangements in Stoke-On-Trent are not best serving local people. Indeed the Local Government White Paper published in October 2006 at paragraph 3.25 uniquely mentions Stoke-on-Trent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="70119m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07011959000012">In December last year my Department published the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill. In the Bill Government set out the options for leadership governance models for all Councils: i) A directly elected Mayor and Cabinet, ii) A directly elected executive, iii) An indirectly elected leader with Cabinet. All Councils in England will have to choose one option.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="70119m0001.htm_para1"><a name="07011959000013"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="70119m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07011959000014">The situation in Stoke fits none of these models.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="70119m0001.htm_para3"><a name="07011959000015">Following consultations with Stoke-on-Trent, it is clear that a consensus exists for change. The elected Mayoralty was decided by the people through a referendum and the post-holder has been elected until 2009. My proposal is therefore that once the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill comes into force (subject to the will of Parliament) the opportunity can be taken for a referendum on the future governance, choosing one of the three models available. The elected Mayor will of course stay in office until 2009 when the new arrangements, chosen by the people of Stoke-on-Trent, can come into effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="70119m0001.htm_para4"><a name="07011959000016">I am keen that the people of Stoke-on-Trent are served by the leadership model which best suits their community. For this reason Government will not be prescriptive as to which model should be used. However, the status quo is not an option. In practice this means that a referendum could be organised after the Bill receives Royal Assent, which depending on Parliament will be by October 2007. The elected Mayor will stay in office until May 2009, when the new arrangements will come into effect. Elections in 2009 will be based on the new model.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="70119m0001.htm_para5"><a name="07011959000017">I am also minded to establish an independent Commission into governance arrangements in Stoke, and I will be talking to the council about this. The Commission would report by October and the remit would include public sector arrangements in Stoke-on-Trent. The Commission's report would therefore inform the public debate in Stoke-on-Trent prior to a referendum.</p>

There has been a massive decrease in the numbers of unskilled jobs: there were no longer jobs for life but, with effective lifelong learning systems, it should be possible to offer employment for life. Training needs to be demand-led and vocational qualifications need to have real intellectual rigour and there is a big political imperative to tackle this agenda. There are important links with higher education, with research and development and science.</p>
