 Today I have laid a statutory instrument, &#147;The Building and Approved Inspectors (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/3318)&#148;, which amends part B (fire safety) of the building regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="61218m0001.htm_para2"><a name="0612188000017">The building regulations set design standards for new and altered buildings. These changes will affect future building work in England and Wales, (typically the erection, extension or material alteration of a building) and how fire safety is designed into a building. Separate legislation applies in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="61218m0001.htm_para3"><a name="0612188000018">The main legislative changes are the introduction of a new regulation 16B to require the provision of fire safety information to the &#147;responsible person&#148; in respect of those buildings covered by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 and a revised B3(3) (internal fire spread (structure)) which gives explicit recognition to the use of automatic fire suppression systems, such as sprinklers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="61218m0001.htm_para4"><a name="0612188000019">Guidance on how the functional requirements of the part B may be met in practice is given in approved document B. In support of the new legislation, I arranged for the publication of a new version of the guidance in approved document B which, as requested by stakeholders, particularly small businesses, has been split into &#147;Volume 1: Dwellinghouses and Volume 2: Buildings other than Dwellinghouses&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="61218m0001.htm_para5"><a name="0612188000020">The changes to the guidance address a wide range of issues, including the use of sprinklers and door-closing devices, changes to the guidance on domestic loft conversions, introduction of a maximum unsprinklered compartment size for single storey warehouses, new guidance on residential care homes and increased measures to assist firefighters dealing with fires in tall buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="61218m0001.htm_para6"><a name="0612188000021">Protecting people from fire in their homes and workplaces remains a key element of Government policy on fire safety. The review looked at fire safety in all types of premises including dwellings, residential care homes, public buildings and warehouses. It also considered the important role sprinklers and other types of fire protection measures may have, particularly in buildings where the occupants are most at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="61218m0001.htm_para7"><a name="0612188000022">New provisions must be evidence-based and fully justified and taken forward in a robust and efficient manner. The review that led to these changes drew upon recent experience of actual fires. It took account of the findings of relevant research and the results of discussions with industry and other interested parties over several years, culminating in a full public consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="61218m0001.htm_para8"><a name="0612188000023">This package represents better defined and more efficient regulation that will deliver real benefits for both occupants and firefighters alike. A final regulatory impact assessment detailing the impacts of the fire safety aspects of the package has been published alongside the statutory instrument and approved documents, as have a number of relevant research reports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="61218m0001.htm_para9"><a name="0612188000024">My officials will be participating in a number of events, conferences, seminars and workshops in the new year to inform people of the changes prior to their coming into force on 6 April 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="61218m0001.htm_para10"><a name="0612188000025">The changes to the building regulations also include the authorisation of several new competent persons self-certification schemes that will enhance compliance, particularly in respect of the energy efficiency requirements of the regulations, and a number of other minor amendments, which will come into force on 15 January.</p>

 I have today issued a consultation document on &#147;The application of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive to &#145;stalled&#146; Reviews of Old Mineral Permissions and Periodic Reviews of Mineral Permissions in England&#148;. This seeks comments on proposals for amending regulations relating to England to, first, deal with initial reviews of old mineral planning permissions which are undetermined and so &#147;stalled&#148; for want of environmental information. Secondly, comments are sought on proposals to apply sanctions to make the application of the environmental impact assessment directive to all reviews of mineral planning permissions as effective as possible. Similar amending regulations are being proposed in relation to Wales.</p>

<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column 109WS</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="61218m0001.htm_para12"><a name="0612188000028">The proposed regulations would put beyond doubt that the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) (England and Wales) Regulations 1999, as amended by the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) (England and Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2000 (the 2000 regulations), which include a sanction of suspension of operations for failing to provide the necessary environmental information, apply to stalled applications for initial reviews of old mineral permissions. These applications were submitted before the 2000 regulations came into force, and some have not been determined because necessary environmental information has not been provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="61218m0001.htm_para13"><a name="0612188000029">Many mineral sites are operating under permissions granted many years ago which contained few, if any, conditions to mitigate the impact of mineral extraction. Uniquely within the planning system, legislation was introduced in the 1990s to review and update to modern environmental standards these old permissions which can last for many decades and to regularly review all mineral permissions. At that time, it was assumed that, because the reviews did not grant consent but merely updated mineral operating conditions, there was no need to apply the environmental impact assessment directive. However, subsequent court judgments established that conditions reviews did constitute &#147;development consent&#148; as defined in the directive, which had not, therefore, been fully transposed. Consequently, the 2000 regulations were introduced to apply the environmental impact assessment directive to these reviews.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="61218m0001.htm_para14"><a name="0612188000030">Guidance issued with the regulations advised that they applied only to applications for review made after the 2000 regulations came into force on 15 November 2000. Operators of sites with applications for initial review which had not been determined by that date were asked to submit any necessary environmental information voluntarily. Most did so. But there are around 40 such applications in England which are &#147;stalled&#148; for a variety of reasons, including some where operators are refusing to provide environmental information when requested to do so by mineral planning authorities. There is currently no sanction to encourage them to do so and at active sites operations can continue under the terms of the original permissions with little or no mitigation of the environmental impacts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="61218m0001.htm_para15"><a name="0612188000031">Subject to consultation comments, the proposed amending regulations would apply the sanction of suspension for continuing failure to provide the necessary environmental information and so help to conclude these reviews and bring operations up to modern standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="61218m0001.htm_para16"><a name="0612188000032">The consultation paper also proposes further sanctions to apply to all reviews of mineral permissions for failure to provide necessary environmental information. These are:</p>
<a name="61218m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="0612188000033"><ul><p class="tabletext">(a) automatic suspension of operations if additional environmental information required to enable a determination of whether a review requires an environmental impact assessment is not provided;</p>
</ul><a name="61218m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="0612188000034"><ul><p class="tabletext">(b) a requirement for mineral planning authorities to consider making suspension orders to secure environmental remediation where operations have been automatically suspended for a period of 12 months without provision of outstanding environmental information; and</p>

Victims can apply to a court for a non-molestation order to forbid someone using or threatening violence and/or harassing, pestering or intimidating them.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence and I wish to make the following statement to the House about the inquests of servicemen and women who have died overseas which fall within the jurisdiction of the Oxfordshire coroner, Nicholas Gardiner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="61218m0002.htm_para0"><a name="06121817000023">All casualties suffered by the UK armed forces are a source of profound regret. UK service personnel have put their lives on the line to help build strong, stable and democratic nations and protect the interests of the United Kingdom and we cannot pay high enough tribute to the job that they are doing, or to the sacrifice  <br>

that some of them have made. We are committed to assisting the families of UK Service personnel who have died on operations overseas when their loved ones are returned to the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="61218m0002.htm_para1"><a name="06121817000024">We made statements to the House on 5 June and 12 October with information about the conduct of inquests by the Oxfordshire coroner and today we are announcing progress which has been made since the written ministerial statement in October.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="61218m0002.htm_para2"><a name="06121817000025"><i>Background</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="61218m0002.htm_para3"><a name="06121817000026">Coroners are independent judicial officers appointed and paid for by the relevant local authority. Their officers and staff are employed by the local authority and/or the police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="61218m0002.htm_para4"><a name="06121817000027">Each death of a serviceman or woman killed in an operation overseas whose body is repatriated to England and Wales is subject to an inquest. The inquest&#151;both the investigation into the death and the holding of the public hearing into the death&#151;is conducted by the coroner with jurisdiction which derives from where the body lies. In the case of deaths of servicemen and women whose bodies are flown into Brize Norton military airbase, the Oxfordshire coroner has jurisdiction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="61218m0002.htm_para5"><a name="06121817000028">In the 12 months preceding the June written ministerial statement, in addition to the non-armed forces inquests which the coroner has in his jurisdiction, Mr. Gardiner and his deputy coroners had conducted 31 inquests into the deaths of servicemen who died in Iraq. One inquest was dealt with by the Powys coroner and one by the Swindon and Wiltshire coroner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="61218m0002.htm_para6"><a name="06121817000029">At the time of the June ministerial statement, there remained 59 inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel killed in Iraq and 11 inquests of civilians whose bodies were flown into Brize Norton. At the time of the October written ministerial statement, a further nine inquests had been held into the deaths of servicemen who have died in Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="61218m0002.htm_para7"><a name="06121817000030">When I made the statement in June, we had only asked the coroner to provide details of inquests into those deaths in his jurisdiction relating to Iraq. By the time of the October statement the coroner had provided us with details of outstanding inquests into six deaths from previous conflicts or other military exercises abroad and three further civilian casualties, the earliest of which occurred in 1998. The position in relation to the inquests in these additional deaths was reported to the House in the October statement. Including these deaths, there remained 59 inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel and 11 inquests into the deaths of civilians at the time of the October statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="61218m0002.htm_para8"><a name="06121817000031">Since the October statement, the coroner has provided us with details of outstanding inquests into six deaths from a military exercise in the Czech Republic in 2004. Including these deaths, there now remain 48 inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel and nine inquests into the deaths of civilians who lost their lives in Iraq and whose bodies were repatriated to RAF Brize Norton.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="61218m0002.htm_para9"><a name="06121817000032">We have not included in this statement inquests into a further 11 deaths in Iraq and 33 deaths in Afghanistan which occurred after 15 May 2006 and which were repatriated into Brize Norton, as the additional support for the coroner outlined as follows is only intended to clear the backlog of cases he had in  <br>

 My right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor has made the following written ministerial statement:</p>
<a name="61218m0003.htm_brev0"><a name="06121817000340"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The right to vote in the UK is considered by many to be a privilege as well as an entitlement, and that persons who are convicted of an offence serious enough to warrant a term in prison have cast aside that privilege and entitlement for the duration of their sentence. Successive UK Governments have held to the view that the right to vote forms part of the social contract between individuals and the State, and that loss of the right to vote, reflected in the current law, is a proper and proportionate punishment for breaches of the social contract that resulted in imprisonment. That remains this Government&#146;s position, and that of a number of other Council of Europe states.</p>
</ul><a name="61218m0003.htm_brev1"><a name="06121817000341"><ul><p class="tabletext">On Thursday 2 February 2006, the Government committed to consult on the issue of voting rights for convicted UK prisoners, following the 6 October 2005 judgment of the European Court of Human Rights Grand Chamber in the case of Hirst. Today the Government have published a consultation document that considers the principles of prisoner enfranchisement and the options available to the UK following the judgment. The judgement decided that total disenfranchisement for all convicted prisoners was not within the terms of the convention.</p>
</ul><a name="61218m0003.htm_brev2"><a name="06121817000342"><ul><p class="tabletext">The paper sets out the background to the case of Hirst v. UK, the conclusions reached by the Grand Chamber, and proposes a number of potential options on which the Government would welcome views.</p>
</ul><a name="61218m0003.htm_brev3"><a name="06121817000343"><ul><p class="tabletext">This is a contentious issue. The Government are firm in their belief that individuals who have committed an offence serious enough to warrant a term of imprisonment, should not be able to vote while in prison. Nonetheless we recognise that we must decide how to respond to the Grand Chamber&#146;s judgment.</p>
</ul><a name="61218m0003.htm_brev4"><a name="06121817000344"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Government welcome responses from all sides of the debate. We encourage respondents to consider the background material provided, and each option, thoroughly before submitting a response. The final date for submitting a response is 7 March 2007. Following the results of this consultation, the Government will produce a second stage consultation document, exploring how any proposed change to current arrangements might work in practice.</p>
</ul><a name="61218m0003.htm_brev5"><a name="06121817000345"><ul><p class="tabletext">Once the consultation process has concluded, and views considered, we will put proposals to Parliament, who must, ultimately, debate and decide upon an issue as significant as this&#148;.</p>

 In March 2006 I announced to the House that following a number of developments, primarily the decision to extend the depth repair programme for the FV430 fleet of armoured vehicles, the previously contemplated rationalisation of four of ABRO&#146;s business units, including the closure of ABRO&#146;s armoured vehicle facility at Donnington, would need to be reconsidered.</p>

contemplated (including closure of the Donnington armoured vehicle facility) is not likely to be required in the short to medium term because of the volumes of repair, upgrade, maintenance and overhaul work. The market in which ABRO operates will continue to evolve in the medium to longer term, in line with the demands of the military customers and the potential introduction of new arrangements for supporting land-based military equipments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="61218m0003.htm_para1"><a name="06121817000349">This Government remain committed to modernising our armed forces. To this end, we must continually look for more efficient support solutions to enable us to invest more resource to support our men and women at the front line. To enhance the future prospects of the organisation ABRO, like all providers of equipment support, will therefore need to build on the improvements it has already made to its efficiency and effectiveness, in particular to the infrastructure supporting its operational capacity and capability. I have asked ABRO to pursue these further improvements with renewed vigour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="61218m0003.htm_para2"><a name="06121817000350">ABRO expects to announce plans to deliver this objective during the early part of 2007. Where required, ABRO will of course consult staff and trade unions about any changes impacting on staff.</p>

Full-time soldiers of the Royal Irish (Home Service) leaving as a result of disbandment will be eligible for the normal tri-service resettlement package (seven weeks graduated resettlement training time, &#163;534 towards costs), and fully funded access to the MOD&#146;s career transition partnership (CTP) service for two years after discharge. Extended access to the CTP for a further five-year period is available through the regular forces employment association or officers association in cases of greater need. In addition to these provisions members of the Royal Irish (Home Service) discharged after 1 August 2005 will be eligible for a grant to fund further resettlement training. The Department of Employment and Learning (Northern Ireland) has also agreed exceptionally to waive the qualification period of six months for entry to the &#147;new deal&#148; programme for the Royal Irish (Home Service). This will allow immediate access to Government-funded employment  <br>

Furthermore, we will be discussing with the trustees of the Royal Irish benevolent fund the need for some public support for the fund to take account of the disbandment of the home service element.</p>

However, one member state maintained that the text did not go far enough to meet its concerns about the need for prisoner consent and the right of the executing state to determine whether transfer to its territory would facilitate social rehabilitation.

Several member states, including the UK, preferred the non-binding text, arguing that the framework decision added no value for the citizen and created legal uncertainty. A large majority of member states were in favour of a binding instrument or prepared to be flexible. However, within the majority there was disagreement on whether a binding text should contain explicit derogations so as to protect national law. The issue would be taken up by the German presidency who are making it a priority of their presidency to reach agreement on a binding text.</p>

A majority of member states wished to proceed with SISOne4all given their view that the political implications of delaying the lifting of internal borders were serious. The UK stressed its support for measures to allow the new member states to join the Schengen area as soon as possible, but also reiterated its concerns about costs, timetable and technical feasibility. The presidency proposed a compromise text on the basis that only those member states connected to SIS I would be liable for the extra costs resulting from the extension of the network, thereby excluding the UK and some other states from liability. The Council conclusions were agreed on this basis.</p>

This represented a major move towards the UK position. Community finance would have remained within the scope of the Instrument for the transport of civil protection assistance to disasters inside and outside of the EU provided the member state sending the assistance met 50 per cent. of the costs. The amount of community expenditure available for transport would also have been capped at 60 per cent. of the total spend available through the instrument. There was support for this proposal from most other delegations. However the UK was not prepared to agree the instrument at the Council on this basis. The presidency agreed to send the item back to Coreper for further discussion. Following a further concession to the UK whereby the maximum amount of community expenditure available for transport was lowered to 50 per cent. agreement was reached at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 11 December.</p>

As such, it may be useful to note that the EU has recently begun to develop initiatives in the field of combating radiological and biological terrorism.

Domestically, the UK is proposing to make illegal the possession of a limited range of violent and extreme pornographic material and would like other member states to consider how they control the publication and distribution of such material. The Home Secretary urged that this work be taken forward under the German presidency. Judge Vassilios Skouris, President of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), gave a presentation on the ECJ&#146;s proposals for accelerated procedures for handling cases in the area of freedom, security and justice.

<p><a name="st_21"><a name="06121817000473"><a name="61218m0005.htm_spmin0"><a name="06121817000512"><b>The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr. Douglas Alexander):</b>
 Today I am announcing a package of funding of &#163;3 billion to improve local transport outside London. It builds on last year&#146;s settlement of &#163;1.6 billion to ensure that 122 local transport authorities, including the six Passenger Transport Authorities are allocated a total of &#163;8 billion over the five years of the local transport plan period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="61218m0005.htm_para0"><a name="06121817000474">This capital funding is in addition to the &#163;3 billion made available in regional funding allocations for local authority major schemes and Highways Agency schemes of regional significance over the next four years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="61218m0005.htm_para1"><a name="06121817000475">This is the first local transport settlement since local authorities reviewed the delivery of their first five-year plans and produced the final versions of their second five-year local transport plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="61218m0005.htm_para2"><a name="06121817000476">I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate local authorities on their good performance over the course of the first five-year plans. I have been very impressed with the improvement in delivery of transport services during this period. There has been sustained progress, for example, in reducing local road casualties and in the condition of many local roads. Authorities have made substantial investment to manage traffic more effectively and reduce its adverse impacts on residents, town centres and the environment more generally. In many areas, better infrastructure for buses, cyclists and pedestrians has been put in place and transport is making a contribution to more sustainable development and economic growth. Examples of local authority achievement throughout the country are highlighted in a recent report by Atkins which has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, and is also available at:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="61218m0005.htm_para3"><a name="06121817000478">Local authorities have also taken the opportunity to make substantial improvements in the quality of the provisional plans submitted last year. Twenty-one authorities have been assessed as having produced excellent plans. Today&#146;s announcement clearly demonstrates our commitment to building upon the successes already achieved.</p>

 The Department announced last week that it has started a competition to find an operator to run train services on the inter-city east coast main line from London to the north-east and Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="61218m0005.htm_para6"><a name="06121817000483">We expect a new operator will be in place in 12 to 18 months&#146; time. Until that date it has been agreed that the current operator, Great North Eastern Railway (GNER) will operate the franchise on the Department&#146;s behalf under a temporary management contract.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="61218m0005.htm_para8"><a name="06121817000485">Under this temporary contract, GNER will continue to deliver train services and will help ensure a smooth transition to the winner of the franchise competition.</p>

DfT has set GNER a challenging but achievable revenue target to incentivise a growth in the value of the franchise. If GNER beats this target, it will earn a share of that success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="61218m0005.htm_para10"><a name="06121817000487">For passengers and staff the new contract will mean that services will operate as normal. All tickets are valid and passengers can continue to book and reserve seats in exactly the same way as today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="61218m0005.htm_para11"><a name="06121817000488">This is in line with our intention in the rail White Paper of July 2004, that if an operator falls into financial difficulty it should expect to surrender the franchise. To renegotiate a contract would set a precedent that we are willing to bail out operators at extra cost to the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="61218m0005.htm_para12"><a name="06121817000489">Companies interested in operating the services in the future are being asked for expressions of interest.

It proposes that the current service levels are maintained and the additional Leeds half-hourly services are included.</p>

 In June, I announced that the first schemes to be considered for funding from the productivity strand of the transport innovation fund fell into two priority themes which fitted with the key objective of supporting national productivity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="61218m0005.htm_para14"><a name="06121817000492">We considered a number of strategic rail freight schemes which could improve the capacity and resilience of the strategic national freight distribution network. We also considered several strategic road network schemes involving improved traffic management techniques which could help to make the most of capacity at key pressure points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="61218m0005.htm_para15"><a name="06121817000493">I am pleased to confirm that after initial scrutiny a number of these schemes have shown that they have strong potential to provide a significant benefit to national productivity and to demonstrate high value for money. These schemes would all fit well with Rod Eddington&#146;s recommendations to address the constraints of our congested and growing city catchments, key inter-urban corridors and international gateways.</p>

The Under-Secretary for Transport, My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris) has similarly agreed that work should be taken forward on the Gospel Oak to Barking line scheme, in which I have an interest. Particularly if some or all of these schemes were taken forward together, they would greatly enhance the capacity of the railway to move modern, larger containers that would otherwise have to move by road.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="61218m0005.htm_para17"><a name="06121817000495">We will work with the Highways Agency to develop the case for TIP funding for the traffic management schemes on the Birmingham Motorway Box and the M62 (Leeds Bradford).

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="61218m0005.htm_para18"><a name="06121817000496">Consideration of TIP funding for some of these schemes will be dependent on confirmation of funding contributions from regional bodies and private sector beneficiaries. We will be making final decisions on the allocation of funding as these schemes develop and in the light of my Department&#146;s detailed investment appraisal and business case scrutiny process.</p>
