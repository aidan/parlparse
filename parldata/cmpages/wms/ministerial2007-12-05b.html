 I have today laid a statutory instrument, the Building and Approved Inspectors (Amendment) Regulations 2007, which amends the requirements relating to the commissioning of fixed building services in Part L (conservation of fuel and power) of Schedule 1 to,  and Schedules 2A (self-certification schemes) and 2B (circumstances where there is no requirement to notify a building control body of work to be undertaken) to, the Building Regulations 2000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="71205m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07120551000017">The principal change to Part L is to clarify the requirements for the energy efficiency of fixed building services such as heating, hot water service, air-conditioning, ventilation and lighting systems to ensure that the systems are designed, installed and tested and adjusted to operate at a reasonable level of energy efficiency. This change, along with the changes to the requirements relating to commissioning of these services, should result in a higher level of energy efficiency at no additional cost to building owners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="71205m0001.htm_para1"><a name="07120551000018">The principal changes to Schedule 2B are to clarify the types of minor work that can be carried out without the involvement of a building control body with no risk to health, safety or energy efficiency. In all cases where the installation of appliances or components would require testing and adjustment of the system to reach a reasonable level of energy efficiency the work will remain notifiable to ensure that this is done properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="71205m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07120551000019">The regulations also amend Schedule 2A in order to authorise two new self-certification schemes and to allow self-certification of larger solid fuel appliances so that the installation of such appliances using biomass as a fuel can be self-certified as compliant. These changes will help secure compliance and reduce the overall burden on building control bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="71205m0001.htm_para3"><a name="07120551000020">Revised guidance on the relevant parts of the building regulations, some of which will be in draft form and subject to consultation before being finalised, will be issued shortly.</p>

 On 25 July 2007 I announced to the House the nine unitary proposals that the Secretary of State was minded to implement, having considered all the available relevant information, if and when the necessary provisions of the then Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill were enacted. In four cases&#151;proposals from  <br>

Bedford Borough Council, Chester City Council, Exeter City Council, and Ipswich Borough Council&#151;we recognised that there were risks to their achieving the outcomes specified by the affordability criterion. We asked these councils to undertake further work and submit additional information on the financial viability of their proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="71205m0001.htm_para4"><a name="07120551000022">I also announced that the Secretary of State was minded to request the Boundary Committee of the Electoral Commission to advise on Norwich City Council&#146;s proposal, and not to implement the remaining 16 unitary proposals that we had received  in response to our Invitation to Councils issued on  26 October 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="71205m0001.htm_para5"><a name="07120551000023">That invitation reflected our belief that introducing unitary local government is a way of removing the weaknesses found in many existing council structures based on county, district, and parish tiers. Those existing structures often add to public confusion, create fragmented and sometimes competing local leadership, and lead to duplication, inefficiency and co-ordination failures in service delivery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="71205m0001.htm_para6"><a name="07120551000024">Since July we have received a range of further information and representations about the unitary proposals, including in the case of the four proposals on which we sought additional financial information. The relevant provisions of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 came into effect on 1 November.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="71205m0001.htm_para7"><a name="07120551000025">The Secretary of State is therefore now able to take her decisions as to which unitary proposals to implement under her statutory powers. The basis of these decisions is the Secretary of State&#146;s assessment of the proposals against the five criteria set out in the original invitation, and which now have the status under the 2007 Act of guidance to which councils should have had regard when making their proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="71205m0001.htm_para8"><a name="07120551000026">These five criteria are that if change is made and new unitary structures are implemented, then that change should be affordable (first criterion); and be supported by a broad cross section of partners and stakeholders (second criterion); and that the future structures should provide strong, effective and accountable strategic leadership (third criterion); deliver genuine opportunities for neighbourhood flexibility and empowerment (fourth criterion); and deliver value for money and equity on public services (fifth criterion).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="71205m0001.htm_para9"><a name="07120551000027">On this basis, having considered all the information and representations now available to her, including all the additional material that she has received since July, the Secretary of State has decided to confirm her earlier &#147;minded to&#148; decisions in all cases, except, as explained below, for the unitary proposals from Exeter city council and Ipswich borough council. In the cases of the Bedfordshire and Cheshire proposals we plan to take decisions in the near future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="71205m0001.htm_para10"><a name="07120551000029">Accordingly, she has decided to implement without modification the five unitary proposals listed in table 1 below. Her judgment is that there is a reasonable likelihood that all these proposals, if implemented, will achieve the outcomes specified by the five criteria.</p>

They thus take further the concept of unitary local government developed in the 1990s. They open the door to the creation of new flagship councils which can lead the way on empowering citizens and communities, promoting prosperity, and modernising local service delivery to achieve both greater efficiencies and better outcomes. In the areas concerned the number of councils will be reduced from 33 to 5. On the basis of councils&#146; current estimates, the savings from these five proposals, once implemented, will be over &#163;75 million annually, giving councils opportunities for improved services or lower council taxes.</p>

She intends to specify in her request that the matters on which the Committee&#146;s advice is sought include whether for the areas affected by these proposals&#151;in each case the city or borough area and the remaining county area&#151;there could be alternative unitary solutions, involving boundary changes, that would meet the five criteria set out in the original invitation.</p>

Once we have received and, following any appropriate consultation, assessed any responses to this further invitation, we intend to take our statutory decisions about unitary proposals for Bedfordshire.

Houses approving the drafts, we will make the orders as soon as practicable which will provide for the establishment of new unitary local government from  1 April 2009 in the areas concerned, and for key transitional arrangements, including first elections to the new unitary councils. Following consultation with each area&#146;s existing councils, our intention is for May 2008 elections in Durham, and Northumberland, and May 2009 elections in Cornwall, Shropshire, and Wiltshire.

Our intention is that all the protections that would apply under the TUPE Regulations will apply, together with all that the regulations imply in relation to procedure, as if TUPE legally applied. Our aim, therefore, is that employees&#146; terms and conditions in the new unitary council will be no less favourable than those which would apply under their existing employer.

 Over the next year, the Government will bring in the biggest shake-up of the immigration system for over 40 years. As part of this, key aspects of our migration reform programme are being announced today, including: a statement of intent which sets out how the points system will work for highly skilled migrants; two consultation documents&#151;one on proposals to tackle forced marriage, and another on proposals to introduce a pre-entry English language requirement for spouses; and the results of an initial consultation on simplifying immigration law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="71205m0002.htm_para6"><a name="07120551000115">One of the key changes to reform migration will include a firmer, faster and fairer Australian-style points system.

We are creating a unified border force, bringing together the Border and Immigration Agency, Customs and UK Visas. The new agency will provide tougher policing at ports and airports with a highly visible uniformed presence, counting all migrants in and out of the UK; and we are introducing compulsory identity cards for foreign nationals, meaning that we will know who is here and what they are entitled to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="71205m0002.htm_para8"><a name="07120551000117">The economic benefits of migration are clear. Migrants put far more into the treasury purse than they take out; migrants contributed an estimated  15-20 per cent. to the UK&#146;s growth in 2001-2005&#151;worth around &#163;6 billion to output growth in 2006. Highly skilled migrants are key to Britain winning these benefits, filling crucial roles in financial and public services, education and health, ICT and business. Following the success of the existing highly skilled migrant programme, the purpose of the highly skilled tier of the points system is to attract and retain the most talented migrants who have the most to contribute economically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="71205m0002.htm_para14"><a name="07120551000141">The consultations on proposals to tackle forced marriage and to introduce a pre-entry English language requirement for spouses fulfil the promises made in our strategy &#147;Securing the UK Border&#148;, published in March 2007, to consult on new arrangements for marriage visas, including an English language requirement. Copies of the consultation documents have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="71205m0002.htm_para15"><a name="07120551000142">Forced marriage is a form of aggression that puts women in particular at risk of harm and of being exploited. The Home Office together with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has already made progress in tackling forced marriage by creating the forced marriage unit in 2005. The unit handles up to 300 cases per year. Around a third of the cases involve children, some as young as 13. We believe that increased protection against coercion and potentially violent or abusive situations is called for. The problem of forced marriage has not disappeared and so we feel it is right to take measures to protect vulnerable people from these pressures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="71205m0002.htm_para16"><a name="07120551000143">The Government are aware that this is a topic with many sensitive aspects but three principles stand out as important. First, no one should be pressurised into sponsoring a marriage visa. Secondly, those who wish to sponsor a marriage partner from overseas should be encouraged to establish an independent adult life here first and to see that as an important way of helping their partner integrate. Thirdly, spouses who are abandoned by a person they have sponsored are entitled to an assurance that their sponsorship will not be abused for further advantages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="71205m0002.htm_para17"><a name="07120551000144">We recognise that forced marriage is not the same as arranged marriage. The Government are not expressing any concern about arranged marriages, which we know to be a part of many cultural traditions, and which involve the consent of both parties. But young British citizens must never be forced into relationships they do not want at a time in their lives when they could be establishing themselves as adults through further education or through work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="71205m0002.htm_para18"><a name="07120551000145">For this reason, one of the proposals we are suggesting is that the minimum age at which a person can sponsor a marriage partner from overseas should be raised from 18 to 21. The same minimum age would apply to the person being sponsored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="71205m0002.htm_para19"><a name="07120551000146">We are also considering introducing a code of practice which would say how an application for a marriage visa should progress if one of the parties is identified as vulnerable. This would build on work carried out by entry clearance officers in relation to in-depth interviews with couples. It would enable views to be given in confidence and assess whether sufficient scope had been given to protect the potentially vulnerable party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="71205m0002.htm_para20"><a name="07120551000147">We are also looking at whether we should do more to investigate allegations of abuse of marriage for immigration advantage after entry; how this might be investigated and what other provisions might be necessary for safeguarding women in particular after the entry of a sponsored spouse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="71205m0002.htm_para21"><a name="07120551000148">The consultation on the proposal to introduce a pre-entry English language requirement for spouses discusses the key issues around how a requirement of  <br>

this nature might work in practice. People who apply for a marriage visa principally do so with the intention of joining their loved ones in the UK on a permanent basis. They are given full access to the labour market on arrival and are able to apply for full settlement after 2 years providing they meet the criteria in the immigration rules. It is right therefore that we should consider ways to assist a spouse integrate into life here, which includes promoting the development of English language skills at an early stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="71205m0002.htm_para22"><a name="07120551000149">We are seeking views on the proficiency level at which the requirement would be set, on how we would make language learning accessible universally and on how the spouse might demonstrate that a language requirement had been met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="71205m0002.htm_para23"><a name="07120551000150">The consultation periods will run for 12 weeks and the final date for responses is 27 February 2008.

The Government have welcomed his proposals in particular for a common EU policy on data sharing, but will wish to explore in more detail some of the ideas raised for example about future work on the use of special investigative techniques. Draft Council Conclusions will also be agreed on enhancing the security of explosives.  <br>

The UK welcomes the Portuguese presidency&#146;s continued drive to finalise these wide-ranging and complex pieces of work on explosives. There will also be a presentation and first exchange of views on the amending framework decision on combating terrorism. The Government support the Commission&#146;s proposals and look forward to working with the Commission to develop complimentary measures against terrorist use of the internet.</p>

The Europol working group will now focus its attention on the remaining chapters of the draft Council Decision. The Government support the proposed drafts which include helpful revisions that strengthen the Europol management board and provide more oversight. However these chapters will need to be revisited and revised again at working group level early next year once the work of three expert groups dealing with staffing and budgetary issues has been completed. This will provide the opportunity for further discussion before the entire Council Decision is taken to the Council for agreement.</p>

The UK did not opt into this dossier at the start of the negotiations. We therefore have no vote in Council. We have, however, negotiated significant improvements to the text which deal satisfactorily with the points which gave rise to our decision not to opt in, and acknowledge the good co-operation with our European partners that has made this possible. The Government will shortly embark on a process of consultation before deciding whether the UK should now signify its wish to accept the measure, under the terms of our Protocol to Title IV of the Treaty.</p>

The Government have made clear that they would not therefore support some of the more far-reaching proposals in the recent Commission Communication on the future of Eurojust and the European judicial network.</p>
