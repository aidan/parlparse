<a name="subhd_1"><a name="60608m0001.htm_sbhd0"><a name="06060864000012"><h4 align="center">PPS22</h4>

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="06060864000023"><a name="60608m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="06060864000131"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Yvette Cooper):</b>
 On 9 February my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy informed the Standing Committee of the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Bill that I would undertake an urgent review of local plans to determine whether there is a problem with emerging plans that do not fully incorporate PPS22 guidance. That review has now been completed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="60608m0001.htm_para0"><a name="06060864000024">The review has shown that in emerging new style regional spatial strategies and local development frameworks there has been a strong take-up of the policy in PPS22 on the use of on-site renewables in new developments. For those authorities preparing new plans where an appropriate stage in plan making has been reached, 26 out of 29 surveyed have devised policies to secure on-site renewables in new developments. The majority of them have set a requirement for 10 per cent. on-site renewables, where it is viable. Many of those at an earlier stage of developing their local development frameworks have not yet included PPS22 policies, although they still have time to do so. We strongly encourage them to do so. For those areas still completing old style plans, such as unitary development plans, policies on on-site renewables are less likely to have been included.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="60608m0001.htm_para1"><a name="06060864000025">It is essential that all planning authorities follow this example and take account fully of the positive approach to renewables set out in PPS22 at the earliest opportunity in their plan-making. In particular the Government expect all planning authorities to include policies in their development plans that require a percentage of the energy in new developments to come from on-site renewables, where it is viable. Such policies have a vital role to play in reducing emissions, through the use of carbon-neutral energy sources. Local authorities who are now updating their plans through new local development frameworks should take the opportunity to update their policies in this area. The Government's forthcoming draft planning policy statement on climate change will be an opportunity to consider further how the planning process more generally can help combat climate change by extending the contribution of renewables from both on-site and off-site sources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="60608m0001.htm_para2"><a name="06060864000026">A more detailed breakdown of plans that were examined for this review of PPS22 policies has been published today on the DCLG website at: http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1500549 and is available in the Libraries of both Houses. I have instructed my officials to write to all chief planning officers enclosing a copy of this ministerial statement  <br>

The scheme facilitates public access to loans of works of art and other objects for public display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by private owners and non-national institutions. It does this by indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to objects they loan. Loans covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also covers loans of such objects for study purposes within borrowing institutions where this would contribute materially to the public's understanding or appreciation of the object loaned. Examples of this are enhancing interpretation or explanation to the public of objects, or bringing into the public domain the conclusions of any study.</b>

As a result of two major temporary exhibitions taking place in non-national museums and galleries and the high value of the objects included in those exhibitions, it has been necessary to temporarily increase the limit to &#163;1.74 billion, effective from June 2006 until July 2006.</p>

All member states welcomed the proposal but could not agree on a number of points: the proposal to include mass catering and the obligation to use the EU logo or an EU organic indication. The Presidency noted the discussion and informed Council that two further working groups would now be held and that work on a compromise text would continue under the Finnish Presidency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="60608m0001.htm_para9"><a name="06060864000036">The Commission noted that in several member states farmers had missed the deadline for single farm payment applications due to technical difficulties.

I can now inform the House that I have approved &#163;94 million for a new Protection of Basic Services Grant. Its objective is to maintain and expand basic services, such as primary schooling, basic health care, water supply and sanitation, and agricultural extension, in order to continue Ethiopia's slow but steady progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals while promoting transparency and accountability in the delivery of these services. It is also being supported by the World Bank, whose Board has just approved funding of $215 million (&#163;123 million).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="60608m0002.htm_para4"><a name="06060864000096">The project will provide for regular financial monitoring and reporting to ensure that funds are being allocated fairly and are being used for the agreed purposes. For the first time detailed budgetary information will be provided to citizens to increase local accountability. I hope that Civil Society organisations will play an important role in helping citizens to understand how money in the budget is allocated and what it is used for, and in bringing those responsible to account for spending decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="60608m0002.htm_para5"><a name="06060864000097">I have also recently approved &#163;30 million for the Productive Safety Nets Programme for the current year to provide assistance to 7 million chronically food insecure households&#151;the poorest people in the country. This programme removes the need for the annual emergency food appeal by providing poor people with predictable and guaranteed cash and food in exchange for work on public projects such as local roads and water schemes. During my visit to Ethiopia earlier this year, I was able to see for myself the way in which this programme was providing vital assistance to poor people to enable them to build better lives.</p>

We have urged the Ethiopian Government to ensure that the trials are fair, transparent and speedy, and are supporting the observation of the trial by an international jurist.</p>

 I am today announcing the publication of consultation documents for the new East Midlands, West Midlands and cross-country rail franchises. Copies of the consultation documents have been placed in the House Library and are available on the Department for Transport website at: www.dft.gov.uk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="60608m0002.htm_para7"><a name="06060864000101">On 18 October 2005, the Secretary of State announced that three new rail franchises would be created (East Midlands, West Midlands and a new  <br>

cross-country) from four currently existing franchises (Central, Silverlink, Cross-Country and Midland mainline). The new franchises will begin operation on Sunday 11 November 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="60608m0002.htm_para8"><a name="06060864000102">The publication of the three documents begins the formal consultation process on the service levels the new train operators should provide. The documents are a consultation on the franchise specifications and seek views on the minimum service level the Department for Transport (DfT) will wish to procure. This consultation and the responses received will later inform the Invitation to Tender (ITT) that bidders for each franchise will be asked to bid against this autumn. Bidders will have to provide the minimum service levels the ITT sets out and will be able to propose additional services above this minimum subject to any operational constraints and affordability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="60608m0002.htm_para9"><a name="06060864000103">Our aim is to ensure that all three franchises build on the recent success of current operators. Passenger numbers on Britain&#146;s railway are growing, particularly on key routes served by these new franchises. We want to see those numbers continue to grow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="60608m0002.htm_para10"><a name="06060864000104">These new franchises are expected to meet current and future passenger demand and deliver a 2-5 per cent. increase in the number of trains operated per day. Bidders will also be required to build on recent performance improvements, and deliver value for money for both fare and taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="60608m0002.htm_para11"><a name="06060864000105">The documents propose service levels that will address crowding, allow for future growth and will put faster services in place on key routes. Passenger capacity will increase. On the cross-country franchise, DfT is proposing a timetable structure that allows bidders to put forward a substantial increase in capacity on key crowded trains. The Department expects bidders to propose additional carriages and longer trains on busy routes. Overall, the cross-country network is expanding with extra stations served. In particular, the consultation documents propose service levels that further capitalise on the &#163;7.6 billion investment on the West Coast main line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="60608m0002.htm_para12"><a name="06060864000106">This is an important consultation that covers the provision of over 2,000 daily rail services. The consultation will run until 7 August 2006. Over the coming weeks the Department will be having extensive discussions with local interested stakeholders. It is important to ensure that these new franchises deliver further improvements for current and future rail passengers.</p>

negotiations with the USA; and the draft proposals on vessel traffic monitoring and port state control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="60608m0002.htm_para14"><a name="06060864000109">The Austrian presidency has indicated that they will be aiming for the Council to reach a political agreement on the draft public service obligation (PSO) regulation. This would establish new rules for the payment of subsidy and the award of exclusive rights for public passenger transport services by rail and by road.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="60608m0002.htm_para15"><a name="06060864000110">In the negotiations to date we have secured some changes to ameliorate potentially adverse effects on UK public transport arrangements. We have also succeeded in amending the proposal in such a way as to create a more level playing field for operators and to create an environment for further opening of the passenger transport market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="60608m0002.htm_para16"><a name="06060864000111">However, there are still some issues to be resolved.

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="60608m0002.htm_para17"><a name="06060864000112">At the Council the Government will be prepared to support a deal if the final text on the table appears to offer a satisfactory balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="60608m0002.htm_para18"><a name="06060864000113">I expect the Council to adopt a set of Council conclusions welcoming progress on road safety&#151;in particular, the publication of the Commission's mid-term review of the 2003 road safety action programme. The mid-term review indicates that progress will need to be accelerated in order to meet the EU target to halve road deaths by 2010. The conclusions also recognise that measures need to be strengthened at the appropriate level&#151;community or member state&#151;to deal with particular issues. In addition, the conclusions acknowledge the role of technology, campaigns and the road safety charter and will invite the Commission to take necessary actions, including, where appropriate, making legislative proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="60608m0002.htm_para19"><a name="06060864000114">The Council will also be debating Council conclusions in regard to the Commission's communication on inland waterways&#151;NAIADES (navigation and inland waterway action and development in Europe). The conclusions agree the action programme to promote inland waterways for freight transport and comment on the detailed proposals of the recommendations contained within it. Although the communication only has limited relevance to the United Kingdom&#151;as our inland waterways are not connected to those on the continent&#151;the Government recognise the potential of Europe's inland waterways to help reduce traffic congestion and harmful effects on the environment as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="60608m0002.htm_para20"><a name="06060864000115">The presidency has proposed the signature of the transport protocol to the Alpine Convention, which is an international agreement aimed at protecting the Alpine environment. The UK would in principle be prepared to support the signature but believes that the Council should take account of the views of a member state that is directly affected and opposed to the protocol.</p>

The Government support the presidency text of the directive, subject to achieving a satisfactory agreement on detailed points concerning the length of the fishing vessels to be fitted with AIS technology and the implementation timetable for the different categories of fishing vessels (according to their overall length).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="60608m0002.htm_para22"><a name="06060864000117">The Council will also hear a progress report from the Commission on the proposed directive on port state control which will simplify the existing much amended legislation. The proposed directive will also make for better use of limited port state control inspection resources, targeting for inspection those ships which pose the greatest risk while reducing the inspection burden on the owners/operators of quality ships. The requirements of the directive should be compatible with the outcome of the current work on targeting ships for inspection being undertaken by the Paris memorandum on port state control (which comprises EU port States plus Russia, Canada, Iceland and Norway).</p>

The Government support the SESAR project as a key element of the Single European Sky. The joint undertaking will allow for an integrated approach to the development of SESAR involving all parts of the aviation industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="60608m0002.htm_para24"><a name="06060864000119">The second aviation item will see the Commission reporting on two aspects of aviation external relations&#151;on the state of play on negotiations to agree an &#147;open skies&#148; agreement with the US, and on negotiations with Russia over the issue of Siberian overflight payments.</p>
