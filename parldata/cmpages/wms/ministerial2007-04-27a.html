 I am announcing today the findings of a Board of Inquiry (BOI) into the tragic incident in Basra, Iraq on 6 May 2006 when a Lynx helicopter based at Basra Air Station crashed, killing all five of its occupants&#151;Wing Commander Coxen, Lieutenant Commander Chapman, Flight Lieutenant Mulvihill, Captain Dobson and Marine Collins. I pay tribute to them, and to the brave men and women of our armed forces, who continue to face hostile conditions on a daily basis. Our thoughts are with all their families and friends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="70427m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07042735000014">The key conclusion of the BOI is that the Lynx was shot down by a surface-to-air missile using a Man Portable Air Defence System fired from the ground. The next of kin have been informed of the Board's conclusions and have been presented with copies of the relevant documentation. This information has also been provided to the Oxfordshire Assistant Deputy Coroner who is scheduled to hear the inquest into the deaths of these Service Personnel.</p>

 The Department has been made aware of an incident on 25 April, whereby personal data held on the Medical Training Application Service (MTAS) was made available through unauthorised channels.</p>

This breach had no impact on the current recruitment of junior doctors into specialty training. The data was accessible only for a short period of time on 25 April. Details of the website address were leaked to the media. The MTAS team removed the data as soon as the error was brought to their attention. The Department, of course, deplores such leaks.</p>
