               <b>The Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Mr David Gauke):</b>
 I am today announcing further reforms to the relief from import VAT known as Low Value Consignment Relief (LVCR). These reforms will make a positive contribution to the UK economy as well as contributing towards the fairness of the tax system and reducing the deficit.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_251">

               <a name="11110977000012"> In Budget 2011, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the Government intended to take action to end the exploitation of LVCR, which in recent years has been used on an increasingly large scale to sell low value goods free of VAT to UK consumers, a purpose for which it was never intended. Most of this trade originates from, or is routed through, the Channel Islands.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_252"> 
               <a name="111109m0001.htm_para1"> 
               <a name="11110977000013"> Our objectives in reforming LVCR are twofold. First, to ensure that UK companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, can compete on a level playing field with companies with operations in the Channel Islands. Secondly, to protect tax revenue for the Exchequer while taking into account the costs of collecting small amounts of VAT.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_253"> 
               <a name="111109m0001.htm_para2"> 
               <a name="11110977000014"> As the first step towards reform of the way in which the UK applies the LVCR rules we legislated in Finance Act 2011 to reduce the LVCR value threshold, below which items are imported free of VAT, from £18 to £15. That change is being implemented from 1 November.</p>

               <a name="11110977000015"> In taking that legislation through the House I made it clear that it was only the first step towards preventing the exploitation of LVCR.</p>

               <a name="11110977000016"> I can announce today that, as from 1 April 2012, LVCR will no longer apply to goods supplied commercially, as part of a distance selling transaction, from the Channel Islands. Legislation to enact this change will be published in draft on 6 December, for inclusion in Finance Bill 2012.</p>

            <p class="tabletext">By far the greatest volume of all international parcel post to the UK from outside the EU is estimated to originate in the Channel Islands, and much of it appears to be linked to the exploitation of LVCR.</p>

Data for consultancy services expenditure were collected from NHS bodies for the first time in  2007-08.

<sup>(2 )</sup>Figures for 2009-10 and 2010-11 for executive non-departmental public bodies, executive agencies and special health authorities are on a different basis to those for earlier years and are therefore not directly comparable.
<sup>(3)</sup> Figures included for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) are for “Professional and administrative fees”. This category includes litigation and other legal costs as well as expenditure on consultancy services, which cannot be separately identified.
<sup>(4)</sup> Figures included for the Care Quality Commission do not include external legal advice. It is not possible to identify how much of this expenditure falls within the definition of “consultancy services”.
