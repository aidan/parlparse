On 10 June 2006, the Department of Health launched a consultation on
proposed measures to deal with anti-social individuals creating a
nuisance or disturbance on National Health Service healthcare premises.
In some areas of the NHS certain individuals can divert resources away
from healthcare provision by causing a nuisance or disturbance to
patients and staff. This consultation document proposes introducing new
legislation to give NHS health bodies new powers to tackle this
problem. This paper seeks comments on the need for such legislation and
all aspects of its formulation and use. The consultation period will
close on 1 September
2006.</p><p><a name="0606122000027">Copies

Minister of State, Department of Health (Ms Rosie
Winterton):</b> The Employment, Social Policy, Health and
Consumer Affairs Council met on 1-2 June. The health issues were taken
on 2 June. Items on the main agenda were; the proposal for a Directive
of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive
95/2/EC on food additives other than colours and sweeteners and
Directive 94/35/EC on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs; women's health;
promotion of healthy lifestyles and prevention of type 2 Diabetes;
common values and principles in EU health systems; review of the EU
strategy for sustainable development; pandemic influenza preparedness
and planning; combating HIV/AIDS; the proposal for a Regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council on advanced therapy medicinal
products and amending Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No.
726/2004; and the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament
and of the Council amending Council Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC
and Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and the Council as
regards the review of the medical devices
directives.</p><p><a name="0606122000030">The
Council adopted the amendments to the additives and sweeteners
directives by qualified majority voting. The UK voted in favour of
these.</p><p><a name="0606122000032">Council
conclusions were adopted on women's health and promotion of healthy
lifestyles and prevention of type 2
diabetes.</p><p><a name="0606122000034">Council
conclusions were also adopted on common values and principles in EU
health systems. The UK expressed particular support for these, which
build on conclusions agreed under the Irish Presidency in 2004,
reminding the European institutions of the importance of safeguarding
the values and principles that underpin EU health systems in their
work.</p><p><a name="0606122000036">There
was a policy debate on the review of the EU sustainable development
strategy. Key themes included recognition that improved health
contributes to economic growth; addressing health inequalities; and the
importance of the global dimension in promoting health in less

significant role employers could play in providing healthy workplaces
and the value of sharing strategies for improving mental
health.</p><p><a name="0606122000038">There
was an exchange of views on the Commission communication on combating
HIV/AIDS within the EU and in neighbouring countries. The communication
received broad support and there was wide recognition of the need to
focus on prevention activities especially among at-risk groups. The UK
emphasised the need for the EU to take HIV/AIDS into account in its
near neighbourhood policies and
funding.</p><p><a name="0606122000040">There
was a lunchtime discussion on pandemic influenza
preparedness.</p><p><a name="0606122000042">The

directives on advanced therapy medical products and medical

any other business, the Council heard a report from the Presidency on
the European Parliament's vote on 16 May that allowed a second reading
agreement on the proposed regulation on nutrition and health claims on
food, and on the proposed regulation on the addition of vitamins and
minerals and other substances to food. Both regulations will come back
to Council for adoption once the administrative processes to ensure
legal and linguistic consistency have been
completed.</p><h4 align="center"><a name="0606122000013">Herceptin</h4><p><a name="0606122000044"><b><a name="0606122000098">The
Secretary of State for Health (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</b> On 24
May Roche, the manufacturers of Herceptin (Trastuzumab), announced that
the European Commission had granted a licence extension for Herceptin
to include use in patients with HER2-positive early breast
cancer.</p><p><a name="0606122000046">On
9 June the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)
published its draft guidance on Herceptin. This recommends the drug for
women with early stage HER2-positive breast cancer, except where there
are concerns about cardiac function. The full draft recommendations are
as
follows:</p><a name="0606122000047"><ul><p class="tabletext">1.1
Trastuzumab, given at three week intervals for one year or until
disease recurrence (whichever is the shorter period), is recommended as
a treatment option for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast
cancer following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and
radiotherapy (if
applicable).</p></ul><a name="0606122000052"><ul><p class="tabletext">1.2
Cardiac function should be assessed prior to the commencement of
therapy and trastuzumab treatment should not be offered to women who
have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55 per cent or
less, or who have any of the
following:</p></ul><a name="0606122000056"><ul><p class="tabletext">a
history of documented congestive heart
failure;</p></ul><a name="0606122000057"><ul><p class="tabletext">high-risk

of transmural infarction on electrocardiograph
(EGG);</p></ul><a name="0606122000061"><ul><p class="tabletext">poorly
controlled hypertension.</p></ul><a name="0606122000062"><ul><p class="tabletext">1.3 Cardiac functional
assessments should be repeated every three months during trastuzumab
treatment. If the LVEF drops by 10 per cent. from baseline and to below
50 per cent. then trastuzumab treatment should be suspended. A decision
to resume trastuzumab therapy should be based on a further cardiac
assessment and a fully informed discussion of the risks and benefits
between the individual patient and their clinician.</p></ul><br><notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>12 Jun 2006 : Column 48WS</b><br><p><a name="0606122000064">These
recommendations are subject to an appeal period which closes on 28 June
2006. During this period registered stakeholder organisations including
those representing healthcare professionals, patients and carers can
appeal against the draft guidance. Final guidance is expected to be
issued at the beginning of July 2006, assuming there are no
appeals.</p><p><a name="0606122000066">Once
finalised, the recommendations will mean that all eligible patients
with early stage HER2-positive breast cancer should receive Herceptin
on the NHS. Although the recommendations are subject to appeal, there
are no national restrictions on the NHS using Herceptin in the interim
and the draft recommendations should, of course, be taken into account
by Primary Care
Trusts.</p><p><a name="0606122000068">I
would like to congratulate NICE on issuing its draft recommendations on
Herceptin just two weeks after the drug was licensed for use in early
breast cancer. This shows how the new single technology appraisal
process allows NICE to issue guidance within weeks of a licence being
granted.</p><p><a name="0606122000070">The
important thing now is for NHS cancer networks to ensure that all women
diagnosed with early breast cancer receive a HER2 test to determine if
they are HER2-positive and might therefore benefit from treatment with
Herceptin.</p><p><a name="0606122000072">Professor
Mike Richards, the National Cancer Director, is already working with
cancer networks to ensure that testing arrangements are put in place. I
am expecting an update from Professor Richards next week and I will
ensure that both Houses receive a report on progress soon
afterwards.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="0606122000005">Home

2006, and one in respect of a foreign national on 16 May

Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary
Benn):</b> I informed hon. Members on 9 March of the official
launch of the United Nations (UN) Central Emergency Response Fund
(CERF). The CERF is intended to provide UN humanitarian agencies with
early funding so that they can respond immediately when a crisis
strikes, and to enable them to channel funds to neglected
emergencies.</p><p><a name="0606122000083">To
date, the CERF total stands at $262 million from 42 donors, of which
the UK is the largest single contributor with $70 million (&#163;40
million) for this first year of operation. The CERF has made an
encouraging start, with $92 million committed to a number of
humanitarian crises, the largest allocations of which are going to the
Horn of Africa ($25 million); Darfur ($20 million); the Democratic
Republic of Congo ($17 million); Chad ($10 million); Niger ($6
million); Cote D'lvoire ($2 million); and Burundi ($2
million).</p><p><a name="0606122000085">The
UK has a seat on the CERF Advisory Group, which provides the UN's
Emergency Relief Coordinator with advice on the speed and
appropriateness of fund allocations, and examines performance and
accountability. The Group had its first meeting on 23
May.</p><p><a name="0606122000087">In
the light of the CERF's encouraging start, and as part of our ongoing
efforts to improve the quality and quantity of the UK's response to
humanitarian crises, I am pleased to inform the House that I have
approved a further commitment to the CERF of &#163;120 million over
the next three years (January 2007 to December 2009), which is
conditional on DFID continuing to be satisfied with the results that
the UN is achieving with the CERF. We will monitor the performance of
the CERF closely to ensure this investment is used to the best effect.
I hope that this long-term commitment will encourage other donors to do
likewise, thereby strengthening the financial sustainability of the
CERF, and we will be actively lobbying key donors to this
end.</p><br><notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>12 Jun 2006 : Column 50WS</b><br><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="0606122000007">Northern
