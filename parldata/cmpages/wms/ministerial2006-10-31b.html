 I represented the United Kingdom at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting in Luxembourg on 24 and 25 October 2006. Ross Finnie, the Scottish Environment and Rural Affairs Minister, also attended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="61031m0001.htm_para10"><a name="06103161000037">The Council reached political agreement on a Council Regulation fixing cod recovery measures and a range of separate fishing quotas in the Baltic sea for 2007. The UK is not directly affected by this regulation, but it was important that it was approved promptly to avoid over-loading future Council agendas later in the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="61031m0001.htm_para11"><a name="06103161000038">The Council held an exchange of views on the EC/Norway fisheries agreement for 2007 based on a presidency questionnaire. I stressed the importance of the agreement to UK interests and the need to strike an appropriate balance between conserving the fish stocks in question and providing sufficient fishing opportunities to ensure the long-term sustainability of our industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="61031m0001.htm_para12"><a name="06103161000039">The Council also held an exchange of views on the Commission's communication on fishing opportunities for 2007 based on a presidency questionnaire. The communication sets out their ideas on catch limitations and related measures in advance of the scientific advice on which their proposals are ultimately based (which has since surfaced). I welcomed the Commission's communication as a significant step in taking forward their front-loading initiative, but identified a number of major concerns about particular elements of it. These included our opposition to the proposed 25 per cent. cut in North sea cod quota and to draconian cuts in fishing effort for 2007, on the basis that these would undermine the impending review of the cod recovery mechanism and harm the future competitiveness of the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="61031m0001.htm_para13"><a name="06103161000040">The presidency noted that there was in its opinion broad support in Council for a general approach on the proposed regulation on definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks, despite serious reservations by several member states and the Commission on the proposal. Along with a number of member states, I underlined our concerns about the legal aspects of the proposals on vodka, on which further work is needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="61031m0001.htm_para15"><a name="06103161000042">The Council also held a policy debate on the Commission's proposal for organic farming on the basis of a questionnaire drawn up by the presidency. The discussion focused on labelling requirements for organic produce.

<p><a name="stpa_360"><a name="61031m0001.htm_para18"><a name="06103161000049">The Council adopted a political agreement on the proposed Directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe, based closely on the general approach agreed at the June Council. The Directive, the first legal measure to be brought forward under the Commission's Air Thematic Strategy of September 2005, consolidates and simplifies current EU ambient air quality legislation, retaining existing standards for pollutants in air, but gives member states several new flexibilities to help them comply with the legislation. The UK supported the political agreement as it represents a balanced compromise. Although the UK would have liked a binding exposure reduction target for fine particles, we are satisfied that the political agreement would result in a net improvement in public health protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="61031m0001.htm_para19"><a name="06103161000050">Council Conclusions were agreed on Climate Change ahead of this year's COP/MOP in Nairobi in November.

They emphasise the key role that the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) has to play in creating a price for carbon, as well as the potential of a range of new technologies (including carbon capture and storage) to reduce CO2 emissions both within and outside the EU. The UK supported the Conclusions. Climate Change was also discussed over lunch by Ministers who were joined by the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Yvo de Boer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="61031m0001.htm_para20"><a name="06103161000051">The Council failed to agree unanimously Conclusions on the preparations of the Eighth Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention on the control of trans-boundary hazardous wastes and their disposal. These were adopted as Presidency Conclusions instead. The UK supported the Presidency Conclusions, in particular the inclusion of strong language on ship dismantling. The new convention being negotiated under the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is unlikely to enter into force for several years and interim measures are needed to improve environmental conditions .at current ship dismantling facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="61031m0001.htm_para21"><a name="06103161000052">Council Conclusions were agreed on the Thematic Strategy on the sustainable use of natural resources. The UK supports the Thematic Strategy as a first-step towards decoupling economic growth from the environmental impacts of resource use. The UK supported the Council Conclusions and is particularly pleased to see strong links being made to the Commission's proposed EU sustainable consumption and production (SCP) Action Plan, which we believe will be an important means of advancing this agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"><a name="61031m0001.htm_para22"><a name="06103161000053">The Council held a policy debate on the Thematic Strategy for the protection of the marine environment and the proposed Marine Strategy Directive. Member states were asked to consider whether the Strategy and Directive are adequate, whether an explicit definition of Good Environmental Status (GES) is required in the Directive and how to balance and strengthen national measures and regional co-operation. The UK intervened to support an ambitious but realistic definition of GES in the Directive and to highlight the need for cost-benefit analysis as GES is developed. The UK also proposed that the Directive be strengthened so that there is a requirement for appropriate decisions or actions to be taken, within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy, where fishing is preventing a member state from achieving GES.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"><a name="61031m0001.htm_para23"><a name="06103161000054">Under Any Other Business, member states raised the First European Congress on Conservation Biology, a ban on mercury exports from the EU, forest fires, invasive alien species, import of unauthorised GMOs into the EU and the investigation concerning the tanker Probo Koala. In addition, the resumption of commercial whaling by Iceland was discussed. The UK condemned the decision by Iceland and urged other member states to voice their concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"><a name="61031m0001.htm_para24"><a name="06103161000055">The Presidency and the Commission updated Ministers on EU/Third Country meetings with: the EU/Russia Partnership Council on Environment; Korea; China; ASEM; and India.</p>

stakeholder briefing documents, which give a synopsis of each ITT, have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and are available on the Department for Transport website at www.dft.gov.uk</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="61031m0002.htm_para7"><a name="06103161000188">On the 18 October 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, col 52-53 WS, the Secretary of State announced that three new rail franchises would be created (east midlands, west midlands and a new cross-country) from four currently existing franchises (Central, Silverlink, Cross Country and Midland Mainline). The new franchises will begin operation on Sunday 11 November 2007 and will provide over 2,000 daily rail services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="61031m0002.htm_para8"><a name="06103161000189">Each ITT has been informed by recent public consultations. Bidders have to provide the minimum service levels the ITT sets out and can propose additional services subject to any operational constraints and affordability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_378"><a name="61031m0002.htm_para9"><a name="06103161000190">Our aim is to build on the recent success of current operators, meet current and future passenger demand and facilitate increases in capacity. The changes proposed will increase the number of trains operated per day over the rail network. In many areas, timetables will change to help deliver more frequent and faster services. In particular the West Coast Main Line will see marked increase in capacity, following the significant investment on the route, with the implementation of a 2008 timetable. In the new cross country franchise, bidders will be required to price a 30 per cent. increase in capacity on key routes. The east midlands franchise starts the process of segmenting the long distance and commuter markets on the route, which will make train lengthening simpler to implement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"><a name="61031m0002.htm_para10"><a name="06103161000191">Bidders must deliver value for money for both passengers and tax payers, and deliver improvements for current and future rail users. Performance will be contracted to improve significantly across all three new franchises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_380"><a name="61031m0002.htm_para11"><a name="06103161000192">In the east and west midlands franchises, where the operators are responsible for stations, the busiest stations will achieve Secure Stations Accreditation to improve passenger safety. The winners of the three franchises will also accept interoperable smartcard ticketing across the whole of the franchise during its lifetime. Fares regulation will remain capped at a maximum average rise of RPI+1 per cent. on all regulated tickets.</p>
