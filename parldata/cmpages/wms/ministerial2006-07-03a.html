Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls):</b> Robust
counter-terrorist finance measures help to save lives and hold
terrorists to account for their actions, and the Government constantly
review the operation of their financial sanctions against terrorist
suspects.</p><p><a name="0607038000016">In
accordance with UN Security Council Resolutions, countries are required
to freeze the assets of individuals who are involved with terrorism and
stop them receiving payments. For example UNSCR 1390 (2002) calls upon
states to &#147;Freeze without delay the funds and other financial
assets or economic resources of these (listed) individuals, groups,
undertakings and entities, including funds derived from property owned
or controlled, directly or indirectly, by them or by persons acting on
their behalf or at their direction, and ensure that neither these nor
any other funds, financial assets or economic resources are made
available, directly or indirectly, for such persons&#146;
benefit.&#148; This is implemented in the UK through EC Regulation
881(2002) and the Al-Qaeda and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order
2002.</p><p><a name="0607038000017">To
ensure that these sanctions do not contravene basic human rights, UN
Security Council Resolution 1452 states that payments that are
&#147;necessary for basic expenses including payments for foodstuffs,
rent or mortgage, medicines and medical treatment, taxes, insurance
premiums and public utility charges&#148; should be paid under a
licence approved by a competent authority. Licences are considered and
approved by HM Treasury under the relevant EC Regulation and
Order.</p><p><a name="0607038000018">In
the UK, it is a requirement that when an individual is listed for
involvement in terrorism, including an association with Al-Qaeda, state
benefits paid direct to them are immediately suspended. Payments are
approved under licence by the Treasury generally only where benefits
are necessary to meet basic
needs.</p><p><a name="0607038000019">The
Government have decided that, given the fact that household income is
generally pooled, state benefits paid to individuals sharing the same
household with a listed person would be, directly or indirectly, for
the listed person&#146;s benefit and should therefore be subject to
appropriate restrictions and
conditions.</p><p><a name="0607038000020">The
following procedures will apply to all state benefits paid to a
household which includes a listed person, or to which a listed person
is
attached:</p><!--<brev>--<a name="0607038000021"><ul><p class="tabletext">State
benefit payments will be suspended pending the granting of a licence by
the Treasury.</p></ul><!--</brev>--<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 26WS</b><br><!--<brev>--<a name="0607038000022"><ul><p class="tabletext">Licences will be issued
by the treasury in accordance with our legal obligations. Where
licensed payments are approved, the Treasury will apply appropriate
detailed safeguards to ensure that surplus funds are not made available
to the listed person. This will be assessed on a case-by-case basis on
the basis of
risk.</p></ul><!--</brev>--<p><a name="0607038000023">This
procedure is currently being applied in respect of the households of
five listed individuals. In each of these cases, the Government have
suspended payments of child benefit and in two of these cases also tax
credits pending the granting of licences. In four cases, because of the
absence of other income, the Government are paying interim support to
the households concerned. Once licences are obtained, these interim
payments will stop and payments will restart under the appropriate
licence
conditions.</p><p><a name="0607038000024">In
four of these cases, applications for the approval of licences are
being considered by the United Nations Sanctions Committee. Subject to
UN approval, the Treasury will issue licences for the payment of
relevant benefits and tax credits to the households concerned. In the
fifth case, an application has been submitted to the UN
today.</p><p><a name="0607038000025">Strict
licence conditions will apply to payments in each of these cases. As
part of these conditions and on the basis of a risk assessment, in
three of these cases, the Treasury will require the appointment of a
third party, who will control the onward disbursement and use of
benefit funds to protect against the risk that these funds are diverted
to terrorism and ensure that all licensing conditions are enforced and
monitored.</p><p><a name="0607038000026">It
is the Government's intention that following UN approval, licences will
be granted as soon as possible subject to the appropriate licence
conditions to guard against funds being
diverted.</p><!--<dpthd>--<h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="0607038000003">Communities

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Meg Munn):</b> My right hon. Friend, the Secretary
of State, has published the revised chapters 10 and 11 in relation to
the above topics. This follows the examination in public into the draft
chapters in October 2004, the panel report in December 2004, and the
consultation on the First Secretary of State&#146;s proposed changes
that closed on11 November
2005.</p><p><a name="0607038000028">These
chapters form an integral part of regional planning guidance (RPG) for
the south-east and represent a revision to RPG9, as published in March
2001. Following commencement of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase
Act (September 2004) this will now form part of the statutory regional
spatial strategy
(RSS).</p><p><a name="0607038000029">Chapter
10 takes sustainable waste management within a resource management
approach as its underlying theme starting with waste reduction. The aim
is to drive waste up the hierarchy towards more recovery, re-use,
recycling and composting and away from landfill. To achieve this
additional waste management capacity and new types of facilities will
be required. The new policies set targets to achieve these through the
development documents 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 27WS</b><br>now being prepared under the reformed planning system whilst ensuring
that development does not harm the region&#146;s environment or the
quality of life of its
people.</p><p><a name="0607038000030">The
maintenance of a healthy regional economy requires an adequate supply
of minerals to support new housing building and deliver key
infrastructure projects. Planning policy has to balance the essential
requirements of the regional economy for minerals with the
environmental impact arising from their extraction, processing and
transport. The replacement regional minerals strategy, chapter 11
provides a set of policies and proposals to strike that
balance.</p><p><a name="0607038000031">The
consultation period for the proposed changes to the draft chapters
ended on 11 November 2005 with some 90 responses from individuals and
organisations respondents were broadly supportive of the proposed
changes.</p><p><a name="0607038000032">The
final consultation has not resulted in any significant changes to the
minerals policies or
principles.</p><p><a name="0607038000033">There
have been two significant changes in relation to waste as a result of
the public consultation. The first involves new figures for waste to be
managed as a result of updated and more accurate research. The
amendments to the figures and policies W5, W6 and W13 for the region
are minimal, but the amendments to table 4 in policy W7, where figures
are given for each sub region, are, in some of the sub regions, more
significant.</p><p><a name="0607038000035">Secondly,
there have been amendments to policy W17 and its supporting text to
clarify the policy on the subject of development in the green belt.
These changes are required for consistency with PPG2: green
belts.</p><p><a name="0607038000036">These
chapters are integral and clearly identifiable parts of RPG9. It will
be reviewed through the development of the spatial strategy for the
south-east, &#147;The South East Plan&#148; the draft of which was

Defence</h4><!--</stpa>--<p><a name="0607038000038"><b><a name="0607038000090">The
Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne):</b> At a time
when our armed forces are conducting operations around the world, it is
important thatthe Ministry of Defence Department seeks every
opportunity to ensure that every pound of the tax payer&#146;s money
devoted to defence is used to best effect. I am therefore announcing a
number of improvements to the way in which we use that
money.</p><p><a name="0607038000040">Subject
to consultation with the trades unions, we propose to make a number of
changes to the organisation and processes by which we manage defence.
Together, these changes will lead to better delivery of support to our
armed forces and the front line.</p><p><a name="0607038000041">In
December 2005, the Department published the &#147;Defence Industrial
Strategy&#148; (Cm 6697). The Defence Industrial Strategy set a
challenge for both industry and the Department. We are asking industry
to work more effectively with us, and in a number of sectors, to
restructure better to meet our needs. We are working closely with them
to achieve this. Equally, the strategy 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 28WS</b><br>calls on the Department to make a step change in the manner in which it
conducts the acquisition and management of military capability. In
response, a senior official was appointed in January 2006, to conduct a
review of current structures, organisation and processes to determine
whether these support, encourage, hinder or obstruct the
Department&#146;s ability to deliver through life capability
management. The report&#151;&#147;Enabling Acquisition
Change&#148;&#151;has now been presented to Ministers who, subject
to consultation with the trades unions, have accepted its
recommendations. A copy of the report has been placed in the Library of
the House of Commons, and also can be viewed on the Department&#146;s
website.</p><p><a name="0607038000043">The
report stresses both the primacy of through life considerations and
that improving acquisition skills is critical to success. It recommends
changes to the Department&#146;s planning processes, including to the
part played by the front line commands, and the governance of
acquisition. These changes are designed to facilitate Through-life
capability management and to make the Department more agile against a
background of rapid changes in the security environment and technology.
The review also concluded that the Department should build on the
progress made by the Defence Procurement Agency and the Defence
Logistics Organisation to work more closely together by merging them.
This will remove a fundamental barrier to through-life capability
management: the continued existence of two organisations with separate
identities and cultures, one that procures military capability arid the
other that supports
it.</p><p><a name="0607038000045">The
new organisation will take the best from each organisation and form a
single entity responsible for the procurement, maintenance and
sustainment of military capability, continuing to draw on the private
sector where this will provide best value for money. Its fundamental
ethos will be the delivery of equipment and logistics capability to the
front line and for operations. The chiefs of the Defence Logistics
Organisation and the Defence Procurement Agency will jointly be
responsible for creating the new organisation by April 2007.
Arrangements will be put in place to run the new organisation under a
unified management structure over the following 12 months while the new
organisation establishes itself. An open competition will be run to
appoint, from April 2008, the head of the new
organisation.</p><p><a name="0607038000047">Implementation
of the recommendations will represent a significant change programme
for the Department. Ministers and senior management are committed fully
to taking it forward as swiftly as possible. However, throughout this
period of change, delivering new capability and maintaining support to
the front line will remain
paramount.</p><p><a name="0607038000049">Consistent
with the decisions set out above and the commitments announced in the
July 2004 White Paper: &#147;Delivering Security in a Changing World:
Future Capabilities&#148;, I have decided that steps should be taken,
again subject to consultation, to collocate elements of the Defence
Logistics Organisation with the Defence Procurement Agency in the
Bristol/Bath area. This will be a key part of the programme of
improving efficiency and effectiveness across the Department in order
better to support our armed forces. Collocation, which is estimated to
produce 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 29WS</b><br>savings of around &#163;200 million over a 25-year period, will result
in a reduction of 360 civilian posts. A further 100 military posts will
be
civilianised.</p><p><a name="0607038000051">This
decision involves the DLO withdrawing from a number of sites over the
next five years. Initial withdrawals are planned from Andover south and
Sapphire House, Telford; with subsequent withdrawals planned from RAF
Brampton, Caversfield and Sherborne. The DLO will also drawdown from
RAF Wyton. A presence is planned to be retained at Andover north, from
where the supply chain will be
controlled.</p><p><a name="0607038000053">I
can also confirm that Andover is the preferred site option for the new
Headquarters Land Forces which will be formed from the integration of
Headquarters Land Command, currently based in Wilton, and the
Adjutant-General&#146;s headquarters, currently based at Upavon.
Subject to further work and final decisions next year, we envisage,
from 1 April 2009, Headquarters Land Forces will be fully operational
at Andover. This will provide the Army with a contemporary, integrated
and efficient headquarters of about 1,750 military and civilian staff.
Compared to current headquarters staffing levels this represents a
reduction of about 240 civilian and 100 military posts and we expect
this to be accompanied by a significant reduction in running
costs.</p><p><a name="0607038000055">Separately,
I have also approved, subject to consultation, proposals to relocate to
RAF Wyton those staff at RAF Brampton not affected by DLO/DPA
collocation. This will enable the disposal of the Brampton site, unless
an alternative defence use can be found, with attendant reductions in
the Department&#146;s running costs. These changes will lead to a
reduction of between 50 and 100 posts, mostly civilian
contractors.</p><p><a name="0607038000057">I
recognise that these decisions affect a large number of the
Department&#146;s employees and their families. I would like to place
on record the Government&#146;s appreciation of their hard work and
dedication. The Department will work to minimise the impact by
providing all the help it can for those affected, and avoiding
compulsory redundancies where
possible.</p><p><a name="0607038000059">The
Department is committed to modernising the way in which we deliver new
equipment and support to the armed forces. In order to do this we must
continually examine the way we do our business to improve the resources
available to the front line. These changes are an essential part of
that
strategy.</p><!--<dpthd>--<h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="0607038000005">Education
