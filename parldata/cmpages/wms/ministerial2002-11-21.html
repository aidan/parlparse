<a name="21121m01.html_para0">However, the Department will continue to work with operators and users to encourage the maintenance of adequate contingency plans against the possibility of any future operator failure.

 As part of a rolling programme of appointments, I have decided to appoint 23 new members to the Regional Development Agency boards outside London; the Mayor of London makes appointments to the LDA. The names of the new Board members are set out below.
<P>

<a name="21121m01.html_para1">Twenty-two of these appointments begin on 14 December 2002 and are for three years, expiring on 13 December 2005. To fill a current vacancy, Bryony Rudkin took up post on the EEDA Board on the 14 November. The rolling programme enables the boards to be refreshed and bring new talent and ideas to the boards on a regular basis. I have placed further details of the new appointees in the library of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="21121m01.html_para2">Decisions on appointments have been made following open competition and following consultation with key national and regional players.

<a name="21121m01.html_spmin4"><B>The Minister for Employment Relations, Industry and the Regions   (Alan Johnson): </B> 
 I am today laying before Parliament an affirmative Statutory Instrument which details the procedure which the employer will have a statutory duty to follow when an eligible employee makes an application to work flexibly under the new right.
<P>

<a name="21121m01.html_para3">These new regulations provide the detail to the flexible working provision set out in broad terms in the Employment Act 2002, which received Royal Assent in July. They detail each stage of the procedure and how decisions on applications to work flexibly should be notified to the employee. They also provide an employee with a right to be accompanied at the meeting to discuss the application and, if necessary, at appeal. A companion may be any worker employed by the same employer. The regulations also specify the procedure for making a complaint to an employment tribunal when an employer fails to comply with the right to be accompanied and allows a tribunal to make an award of up to two weeks' pay. A week's pay will be subject to the cap provided under the Employment Rights Act 1996.
<P>

<a name="21121m01.html_para4">These regulations, subject to their approval by both Houses, will be followed by two negative Statutory Instruments. One will set out the details of the eligibility criteria, complaints and remedies. These specify that the maximum amount of compensation an employment tribunal may award for breaches of the procedure (other than failure to allow a companion) or where a decision by the employer to reject the application is based on incorrect facts, is eight week's pay. A week's pay will again be subject to the cap. The other negative Statutory Instrument will concern the extension of the ACAS arbitration scheme to cover the right to request.
<P>

<a name="21121m01.html_para5">The detail of this new right has been the subject of a three-month public consultation. The right will come into effect next April, at the same time as the Government extends maternity leave and pay and introduces paid paternity and adoption leave. Together these new rights will provide more choice and support

<a name="21121m01.html_spmin5"><B>The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport   (Tessa Jowell): </B> 
 <i>A Safe Bet for Success</i>, which we published in March 2002, set out the Government's plans for the overall reform of the controls on gambling. We said that we would categorise gaming machines into four groups. Within these categories, Group D amusement machines would have maximum stakes and prizes of 10p and #5 and would be playable by children. Machines in groups A to C would have maximum stakes and prizes of more than 10p and #5, and would not be playable by children.
<P>

<a name="21121m01.html_para7">We have had representations from the gaming machines and arcades industry about machines with non-money prizes, often called 'crane' machines, which are extensively played by children, especially in arcades at the seaside. These currently operate on a maximum stake of 30p, and their operators have pointed out to us that they will not be commercially viable if their stake is reduced to 10p.
<P>

<a name="21121m01.html_para8">The Government believes that children and gambling should be kept apart and has taken careful note of the conclusions which the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport have reached on this issue.
<P>

<a name="21121m01.html_para9">But it is important not to endanger the traditions of family entertainment at the seaside, which people have enjoyed for generations.
<P>

<a name="21121m01.html_para10">We are determined as part of our ongoing reform of the controls on gambling to listen carefully to the business sectors involved, and we recognise that there is a case for allowing children's and family amusement machines which do not offer money or exchangeable token or ticket prizes to keep their current maximum stake of 30p.
<P>

<a name="21121m01.html_para11">We have therefore decided that the stake limit which we will propose to Parliament for Category D amusement machines will be 30p if the machine does not offer prizes in money or exchangeable tickets and tokens, and 10p in all other cases.
<P>

<a name="21121m01.html_para12">This will not affect the maximum prize limit which we wish to see for these machines, which will remain at #5. Nor will it affect the stake and prize limits for machines paying out exchangeable tickets and tokens, which will remain at 10p and #5 respectively.

Posts have been involved in many of these events, and senior representatives at Post will be attending events organised by the local community. Senior representatives at Posts and prominent members of the local Scottish Societies will deliver a joint message from my right hon.

<P>

<a name="21121m02.html_para0">The NHSU will offer training and development for everyone at every level of the NHS. This includes those staff who may not have experienced learning since leaving school. It will make learning a right for all staff in the NHS.
