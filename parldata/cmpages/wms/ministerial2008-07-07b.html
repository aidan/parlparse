<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="80707m0001.htm_para8"><a name="0807072000032">The Department of Health will be taking forward work to promote healthier eating with consumers and working with the food industry to increase consumption of fruit and vegetables. They will also lead on developing nutritional standards for food provided through public sector catering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="80707m0001.htm_para9"><a name="0807072000033">The Food Standards Agency will take forward work to make it easier for consumers to get Government information and advice on a healthy, environmentally sustainable diet. The FSA will improve information on healthier choice options from shopping for food to eating out, and will develop a &#147;whole food chain approach&#148; to food safety.</p>

This includes the Health Committee itself and also Professor Sir John Tooke who was commissioned by the Department to carry out an independent review of MMC and who published his final report in January this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="80707m0001.htm_para17"><a name="0807072000042"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="80707m0001.htm_para18"><a name="0807072000043">While acknowledging that we have some way to go, it is important to record that much progress has been made over the past year&#151;not least through the crucial work of the MMC England programme board which has produced a recruitment and selection process  which is both more equitable and has the broad support of the medical profession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="80707m0001.htm_para19"><a name="0807072000044"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="80707m0001.htm_para24"><a name="0807072000049">A stakeholder event on this important issue was held on 3 June to meet the aim of working with the profession and building consensus on the way forward. There was broad agreement from participants that there should be no rush to introduce changes in 2009 although further work and debate are needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="80707m0001.htm_para25"><a name="0807072000050"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="80707m0001.htm_para26"><a name="0807072000051">With regard to recruitment and selection, we agree that responsibility should be devolved to deaneries with some elements of central co-ordination and guidance and we further agree that there should be a staged recruitment process established in the future, expanding the additional flexibility which has already been built into the process for this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="80707m0001.htm_para27"><a name="0807072000052"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="80707m0001.htm_para28"><a name="0807072000053">The House of Lords ruling on 30 April prevented the implementation of long-standing policy guidance for managing access to specialty training posts by doctors from outside the European Economic Area (EEA). However, there is wide consensus that Government intervention is necessary and justified to maximise the training opportunities for UK-trained doctors. The changes to the immigration rules announced by the Home Office in February 2008 have been well received by the medical profession and will stand while we discuss with all those involved how best to resolve this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="80707m0001.htm_para30"><a name="0807072000055">We have noted and considered carefully the proposals put forward by both Sir John Tooke and the Health Committee regarding the establishment of NHS Medical Education England (NHSMEE) and the future of the MMC England programme board.</p>

In respect of the programme board, responsibility for operational requirements and the implementation of policy will be devolved to the NHS and operational elements of the existing Department of Health MMC team devolved to the control of a strategic health authority (SHA) on behalf of the NHS in a way that carefully ensures business continuity of a function which is recognised as having made progress.</p>

 In the &#147;Prison Policy Update&#148; document published in January this year I announced a major drive to overcome some of the principal barriers to the reform and rehabilitation of offenders. As part of that I asked the director general of the then Prison Service to commission a review of the supply of illicit drugs into prisons. As a result, Mr. David Blakey, a former inspector of constabulary and chief constable of West Mercia, was commissioned to conduct a review into the effectiveness of HM Prison Service&#146;s measures for disrupting the supply of drugs into prisons, and to make recommendations for improvements. I am grateful to Mr. Blakey for his considered and well-targeted report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="80707m0001.htm_para35"><a name="0807072000061">The report makes 10 recommendations, ranging from suggestions to roll out mobile phone blocking technology to fostering the good work we have been taking forward in intelligence. The director general of the National Offender Management Service and I have accepted all of the recommendations and I have asked him to implement them as soon as practicable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="80707m0001.htm_para37"><a name="0807072000063">NOMS has in place a comprehensive drug treatment framework, based on the national treatment agency&#146;s revised &#147;Models of Care&#148;, to address the different needs of drug misusers in prison. Treatment interventions include: clinical services (detoxification and/or maintenance prescribing); CARATs (counselling, assessment, referral, advice and throughcare services)&#151;a range of interventions that, following assessment, deliver treatment and support; and drug rehabilitation programmes which focus on addressing the attitudes and behaviour of drug misusers.</p>
