 I have welcomed today the report from Brian Lamb, Chair of the Special Educational Consortium, on information for parents of children with special educational needs and disabled children (SEND), and accepted his recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="90429m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09042947000021">I asked Brian Lamb in December 2008 to consider improvements to information as part of his wider inquiry into parental confidence in the special educational needs system. I accept the report&#146;s central recommendation that good engagement and communication with parents of children with SEND is something which we should expect of all those working in children&#146;s services. We will require this as part of the &#163;3 million &#147;Achievement for All&#148; pilots we are taking forward in ten areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="90429m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09042947000022">I will set out details in July on how we will take forward recommendations on improving school and local authority compliance with requirements on producing information for parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="90429m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09042947000023">We will also take forward the recommendation to use the major reforms we are planning to make schools and children's services responsive, personalised and accountable to all parents, work for parents of children with SEND.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="90429m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09042947000024">I have asked Brian Lamb for further advice in July in two particular areas of concern that he has raised. First, on whether the Ofsted inspection provisions and the wider changes to the school improvement and accountability framework, give sufficient priority to SEN and disability or whether changes are necessary, including to legislation. Secondly, on whether statements of special educational needs are sufficiently clear; whether they are understood by parents; and how well they contribute to improving children&#146;s outcomes.</p>

Local authorities monitor these impacts and breaches of these environmental regulations may also be dealt with by the Environment Agency.

Together, we have identified five key themes&#151;health, choice and control, social inclusion, employment, and raising awareness and training. These themes were chosen as representative of the main concerns that we hear from people with autism, and as such, are the areas that we believe can deliver the greatest change.

 I would like to update the House on my recent visit to Sri Lanka to assess the humanitarian situation. I urged the Government of Sri Lanka to support a ceasefire to allow the civilians still held in the conflict area to leave, to improve the conditions for the internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Government controlled areas by dramatically increasing access for humanitarian agencies; and to focus the Government&#146;s mind on the need for the early return and resettlement of the IDPs. There are two distinct humanitarian groups of concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="90429m0001.htm_para24"><a name="09042947000071">The first is the fate of the civilians caught up in the conflict area in north-eastern Sri Lanka. There is still uncertainty about the exact number of civilians who remain in the conflict area with estimates ranging from 20,000 to 70,000 civilians. However, the UN estimates that up to 50,000 civilians remain caught in an area measuring less than five square miles. Since September 2008, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been the only humanitarian agency allowed to have a presence in the conflict area by the Government of Sri Lanka. Approximately three times a week the ICRC ships food and emergency items such as blankets and medical supplies into the conflict area, and evacuates the wounded and their carers out of the conflict area. The fate of these remaining civilians is our most pressing concern. It is vital that they are able to move away from danger to safety under UN oversight, and that, in the meantime, humanitarian agencies have access to the conflict area to deliver humanitarian assistance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="90429m0001.htm_para25"><a name="09042947000072">The second is the 180,000 or more IDPs who have escaped the conflict area to camps under Government of Sri Lanka control; including the 113,000 who have arrived in the last ten days. I spoke with some of the IDPs in the camps. Many were traumatised by their experiences in the conflict area and concerned at being separated from members of their families. It is essential that these camps meet international standards and that the Government of Sri Lanka allows unrestricted access by humanitarian agencies to undertake their life saving work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="90429m0001.htm_para26"><a name="09042947000073">During my trip I urged the Government of Sri Lanka to abide by its public commitment to return 80 per cent. of the IDP population to their homes by the end of the year. It is vital that the camps are temporary in nature and that the IDPs are allowed to return home as quickly and safely as possible. The Government of Sri Lanka asked for UK help to respond to the humanitarian crisis and to return the IDPs back to their homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="90429m0001.htm_para27"><a name="09042947000074">The UK will continue to provide support to mitigate the humanitarian crisis. During my visit I announced a further &#163;2.5 million of humanitarian funding for Sri Lanka, bringing the total to &#163;7.5 million. I would like to  <br>

assure the House that all UK funding is provided directly to neutral and impartial international humanitarian agencies to save lives and reduce suffering. For example, on the 27 April, the UK contributed &#163;500,000 to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to airlift 5,000 tents to provide temporary shelter for the IDPs; &#163;3.1 million remains on hand to respond rapidly to needs on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="90429m0001.htm_para28"><a name="09042947000075">The overriding imperative is for both sides to take all steps to safeguard civilian lives. The UK has repeatedly made clear that there can be no military solution and called again and again for a ceasefire. The Government of Sri Lanka&#146;s announcement, of an end of offensive operations using heavy weapons, made during my trip is a welcome first step. The LTTE must allow the civilians to leave the conflict area. Lasting peace in Sri Lanka can only come about through a fully inclusive political process that takes into account the legitimate aspirations of all Sri Lanka&#146;s communities&#151;Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims. The Sri Lankan Government must make a concerted drive to achieve a political solution. The UK Government will continue to press for urgent progress in all of these areas. To this end, the Foreign Secretary is in Sri Lanka today to meet President Rajapakse.</p>

 Afghanistan and Pakistan are of critical strategic importance to the UK. Helping both countries to ensure their own security, stability, growth and development is vital both for the Afghan and Pakistani people and for our own national security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="90429m0002.htm_para1"><a name="09042947000078">In January 2006 we signed a 10-year development partnership agreement with the Government of Afghanistan. I am today announcing our new four-year country plan, at a moment when we so urgently need a renewed effort from across the international community. The plan explains how we will support the Afghan Government in achieving its goals under the Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS), which was launched at the Paris Conference in June 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="90429m0002.htm_para3"><a name="09042947000080">DFID&#146;s support to Afghanistan is part of the wider UK Government strategy for the region set out by the Prime Minister. Our programme fits alongside the work of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, forming a comprehensive effort to help strengthen state institutions, counter the threat of violent extremism, and pursue sustainable economic growth across the region. Over the same 2009 to 2013 period, we have pledged already to spend &#163;665 million helping the Pakistani Government to achieve its vision of becoming a stable, economically and socially developed country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"><a name="90429m0002.htm_para5"><a name="09042947000082">Our Afghanistan country plan focuses on four areas where we are best placed to provide support under the ANDS: building an effective state; encouraging economic growth; providing alternatives to poppy growing; and promoting stability and development in Helmand. We will maintain our humanitarian support, primarily  through UN agencies. We will strengthen our focus on gender, by building partnerships within the Government of Afghanistan and with other donors&#151;particularly multilateral institutions&#151;to increase their contribution to addressing gender inequality.</p>

We will continue to spend at least 50 per cent. of our assistance through Afghan Government systems: as well as ensuring value for money for the UK, this is the best way to improve Afghan capacity to govern, and to strengthen the connection between the citizen and the state. We are asking other donors to do the same in order to strengthen Afghan capacity through coordinated and transparent planning.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, my right hon. and noble Friend the Attorney-General and I are today announcing the publication of &#147;Engaging Communities in Criminal Justice&#148; (Cm 7583), a consultation document which has been laid before Parliament. We are also announcing the publication of the associated consultation-stage &#147;Impact Assessment&#148;, which has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Copies of both documents are available from the Vote Office, and the Printed Paper Office. Both documents will be available from the CJS Online website at: http://consultations.cjsonline.gov.uk/ and on the web sites of the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office and the Attorney-General&#146;s Office.</p>

It represents the next stage in the Government&#146;s programme for a criminal justice service that is effective, delivers justice for all, has the interests of victims and witnesses at its heart and which inspires the trust and confidence of the people it serves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="90429m0002.htm_para9"><a name="09042947000087">The proposals are part of a consultation and are centred on three areas: strengthening the connections between communities and their prosecution and court services; ensuring that justice outcomes are more responsive and more visible and improving communication between local people and their criminal justice services. The proposals are designed to better open up the whole justice system to communities so that services are more transparent, responsive and more accountable to local people. The Government believe that a number of measures likely to be of direct benefit to local communities could be established more quickly in a number of areas. We are therefore establishing 30 pioneer areas across England and Wales which will implement a package of measures during 2009.</p>

It contains estimates of the actual or potential costs of the proposals and an assessment of the potential operational impact on criminal justice services and other local delivery partners, including those in the third sector. The final &#147;Impact Assessment&#148; will be revised and updated in light of information received during the consultation and any further available  <br>
