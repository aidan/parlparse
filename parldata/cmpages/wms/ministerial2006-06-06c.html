 Amendments will be tabled to schedule 6 to the Finance (No 2) Bill 2006 for Report stage to block a tax avoidance scheme used by companies and others to obtain relief against corporation tax or income tax for the capital element of loan repayments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="60606m0001.htm_para0"><a name="06060648000032">The scheme involves arrangements which in substance are loans and are accounted for as financial arrangements but in form involve the transfer of expected income or payment streams in exchange for a lump sum, with the income or payments continuing until they equal the amount of the lump sum plus interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="60606m0001.htm_para1"><a name="06060648000033">The income transferred is not taxed on the transferor, so the effect is that relief is obtained for repayments of capital as well as interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="60606m0001.htm_para2"><a name="06060648000034">The measures to be included in the Bill will treat the transferor for tax purposes as if it had taken out a conventional loan, so that relief will only be given for the interest element. Any chargeable gain arising on the transfer will be disregarded. It will also apply to more complex schemes where the income is shifted by adjusting partnership profit shares.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="60606m0001.htm_para3"><a name="06060648000035">The legislation will replace the rent-factoring rules in section 43A to 43G ICTA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="60606m0001.htm_para4"><a name="06060648000036">Further details of the measure with draft legislation and explanatory notes are published on the HMRC website. The measure has effect in relation to transfers taking place on or after 6 June 2006. It will also apply to transfers that have taken place before that date but will only have affect in relation income or payments arising on or after that date.</p>

 I have today issued a consultation paper, &#147;Draft Marine Minerals Dredging Regulations and Procedural Guidance&#148;. This seeks comments on a proposed statutory scheme of regulation, which will formally transpose the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Habitats Directives, in relation to marine minerals dredging in waters around England and Northern Ireland. Subject to consultation comments, we are hoping that the final Regulations implementing the new statutory scheme will come into force by the end of 2006.</p>

It currently licences marine minerals dredging from the seabed under its control on a commercial basis, but only if a favourable Government View (GV) on the environmental acceptability of the proposal has first been issued by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. The GV procedure is a voluntary, informal process which already incorporates the various requirements of the EIA and Habitats Directives. The proposed Regulations will replace this informal procedure and formally transpose the Directives.</p>

Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The paper is also available on the Department for Communities and Local Government website at: www.communities .gov.uk.

published Commission e-Government action plan, the presidency have prepared a set of Council conclusions looking at the priorities that need to considered in the area of e-Government policy. I intend to endorse these Council conclusions which are compatible with the UK Government's Transformational Government Strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"><a name="60606m0001.htm_para33"><a name="06060648000097">The presidency will then introduce a policy debate on the future challenges for the electronic communications regulatory framework. This anticipates the Commission's forthcoming review of the regulatory framework for electronic communications markets. A Communication on this issue is expected in July and negotiation will formally begin under the German presidency. I will highlight some of the specific challenges that the UK would like to see addressed in the review of the framework. In particular, I plan to stress the need for effective implementation of the existing regulations and the importance of striking the right balance between maintaining competition, encouraging investment and protecting consumers.</p>

The report gave a short account of work in progress under the Austrian presidency as regards impact assessments, simplification of legislation, screening of pending legislative proposals and assessing and reducing administrative costs. I welcomed the progress made by the Commission and the presidency in taking forward this important agenda and I led member state interventions by stressing the need to match rhetoric with action, in particular on special provisions for SMEs and setting targets for reducing burdens.

The questions were on harmonisation, early repayment and cross-border comparability of consumer credit agreements. The discussion in the Council focused primarily on the central question of maximum harmonisation and mutual recognition within the directive. I welcomed the objective of opening up the single market in consumer credit, but emphasised that any directive would have to maintain levels of consumer protection, and should be based on a rigorous analysis of costs and benefits.</p>

 The UK's railway system is a network made up of 2,500 stations and 11,000 miles of track. It carries one billion passengers a year. The British public understand that an aviation-style closed security system on a rail network of this size is unworkable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_410"><a name="60606m0002.htm_para27"><a name="06060648000134">However we must still aim to cut down the risks as much as possible, whilst still allowing people to go about their day to day business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="60606m0002.htm_para29"><a name="06060648000136">We announced on 10 March 2005 that the Department for Transport had identified a package of short, medium and long-term measures to enhance rail counter-terrorist security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_417"><a name="60606m0002.htm_para34"><a name="06060648000142">The stage 2 consultation paper also announced our intention to extend the current night restrictions regime for a further year to end on 29 October 2006. This decision was confirmed, when the former Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport announced the movements limits and noise quotas to apply for the summer 2006 season, 15 December 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, column 177WS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_418"><a name="60606m0002.htm_para35"><a name="06060648000143">I have now decided on the restrictions that will apply from 29 October 2006 to October 2012.

This is but one aspect of the full decision that I am publishing today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_420"><a name="60606m0002.htm_para37"><a name="06060648000145">As in the previous regime, the new night restrictions regime for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted recognises both a night period, 2300-0700 hours, and a night quota period, 2330-0600 hours. During the whole of the night period, the noisiest types of aircraft (classified as QC/8 or QC/16) may not be scheduled to land or to take off and they are effectively banned from doing so (other than in the most exceptional circumstances) in the night quota period. The next noisiest types (QC/4) may also no longer be scheduled to operate in the night quota period. In addition, during the night quota period movements by most other types of aircraft (including the new QC/0.25 category) will be restricted by a movements limit and a noise quota, which are set for each season. The seasons change with the clocks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_421"><a name="60606m0002.htm_para38"><a name="06060648000146">Unlike previous night restrictions regimes, the new restrictions take account of environmental objectives and specific noise abatement objectives for each airport.
