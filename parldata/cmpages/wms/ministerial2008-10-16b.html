The final presidency compromise text met their concerns and political agreement was reached on this basis. This will allow the Council to prepare a common position, which will form the basis of negotiation with the European Parliament.</p>

The presidency argued that in the current financial crisis it was even more important for the EU to maintain political leadership on climate issues and urged member states not to lose momentum on progress. The Commission and presidency both considered that it was possible to reach agreement on the package by the end of the year.</p>

 On 8 January 2008 I wrote to the Police Negotiating Board (PNB) asking them to consider a multi-year deal for police officers starting in September 2008.

This deal is for an award of 2.65 per cent. from 1 September 2008, 2.6 per cent. from 1 September 2009, and 2.55 per cent. from 1 September 2010. This means by 2010 a police constable will be able to earn up to &#163;36,500, 50 per cent. more than in 1997.

 This year sees the biggest changes to Britain&#146;s immigration and border security system for 45 years.

Our ambition is that migration policy maximises benefits for Britain and manages local impacts.</p>

Today we are publishing a further statement on the first of these changes with the creation of a separate category for business, sport, entertainer and special visitors.

None of this will be at the expense of the level of service now provided by the Pensions Appeal Tribunal (England and Wales). Our aim in making this statement is to ensure that the armed forces community are reassured that the valued features of the PAT are preserved and protected in the new system.</p>

The present PATs do not have such a guarantee although in practice they are independent of Government.

The First-Tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal (Chambers) Order 2008 provides for the first-tier tribunal to be organised into chambers, including a separate war pensions and armed forces compensation chamber. The order assigns all of the functions of the current PAT (England and Wales) to that chamber.

In establishing rules that are specific to this chamber those who currently use PAT (England and Wales) will have the same level of procedural protection as users of the PATs in Scotland and Northern Ireland, as rules will be made with the specific needs of this jurisdiction only in mind. Members of the armed forces community were concerned that this protection would not be provided if the chamber shared rules with other chambers in the first-tier tribunal.</p>

The President and Deputy President of the PAT have been consulted on the draft and are in agreement with it. The draft practice statement requires the continued use of service members on hearing panels within the war pensions and armed forces compensation chamber and maintains their present role without diminution or alteration. The Qualifications for Appointment of Members to the First-Tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal Order, as laid before Parliament, requires that service members have considerable experience of service in Her Majesty&#146;s naval, military or air forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="81016m0001.htm_para27"><a name="08101661000052">There was a policy debate on the proposal for a directive on cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety. A key issue in the debate was whether the proposal could be adopted under the first pillar, as currently intended by the presidency and supported by some member states, or whether it should be a third pillar (Justice and Home Affairs) issue. The UK expressed its view that the third pillar would be the correct legal base. Pointing out the UK&#146;s strong record in this area, we recognised the concerns and underlying objectives of the proposal, but stressed that it was necessary to go forward with practical measures. The majority of member states supported a third pillar approach. Following this debate, work will continue in the working group and Coreper, and it is expected that the issue will return to the Council in December.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="81016m0002.htm_para3"><a name="08101661000057">The Council reached political agreement on proposals for directives on the responsibility of EU member states which are flag states and the insurance requirements of shipowners. These were substantially amended versions. Negotiations before and during the Council led to further welcome amendments. The presidency and Commission also made clear that the European Parliament would only negotiate on the complete third maritime safety package with these two amended proposals included. Taking all of this into account, the UK supported the agreements on both of the significantly amended proposals.</p>
