 A paper giving details of the outcome of the two-year review of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which the former Financial Secretary to the&nbsp;Treasury announced on 4 November 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 28WS, is available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House, and is accessible on: www.hm-treasury.gov.uk.

<p><a name="41202m01.html_spmin1"><b>The Paymaster General  (Dawn Primarolo): </b> 
 I have completed the annual review under section 141 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. I propose the following changes to take effect from 6 April 2005. These rates and limits will also apply to national insurance contributions in Northern Ireland.

<p>
<a name="41202m01.html_para1">In line with the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, the lower earnings limit for primary Class 1 contributions is to be raised to &#163;82 a week. It is set at the level of the basic state pension for a single person from April 2005 and rounded down to the nearest pound.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m01.html_para2">The primary and secondary thresholds for Class 1 contributions will continue to be aligned with the weekly amount of the income tax personal allowance, which will be increased to &#163;4,895 from April 2005. The primary and secondary thresholds will therefore be increased to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#163;94 a week. This means that no tax or Class 1 contributions will actually be paid on earnings below this level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m01.html_para3">The upper earnings limit for primary Class 1 contributions will be raised to &#163;630.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m01.html_para5">The rate of Class 2 contributions will be raised to &#163;2.10 a week. Self-employed people with earnings below the annual small earnings exception can apply to be exempted from paying Class 2 contributions. This limit will be raised by &#163;130 to &#163;4,345 in line with inflation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m01.html_para6">The annual lower profits limit for liability to Class 4 contributions will increase to &#163;4,895 a year (in line with&nbsp;the income tax personal allowance). The upper profits limit will increase by &#163;1,040 to &#163;32,760, to maintain the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;link with employees&#039; earnings liable to Class 1 contributions.

<p><a name="41202m02.html_spmin0"><b>The Paymaster General  (Dawn Primarolo): </b> 
 This Government are determined to ensure that all employers and employees pay the proper amount of tax and NICs on the rewards of employment, however those rewards are delivered. Despite the efforts of successive Governments of all persuasions over several years, we continue to be presented with ever more complex and contrived attempts to avoid paying tax and NICs on rewards from employment, particularly in relation to bonuses in the City.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m02.html_para0">In the most recent year for which we have figures, well-rewarded individuals receiving bonuses of at least &#163;1.5 billion in total sought to avoid paying their fair share of tax and NICs.






<br>&nbsp;<br>2 Dec 2004 : Column 45WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m02.html_para1">The disclosure rules in Finance Act 2004 have revealed that this kind of avoidance is still rife. Without prompt and decisive action we think there could be up to &#163;2 billion paid this year in bonuses on which the amount of tax and NICs properly due is at risk, as a result of increasing ingenuity and inventiveness of the tax avoidance industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m02.html_para2">We cannot allow avoidance on this scale to continue. It is only right that everyone who should pay tax and NICs, does pay and that they pay their fair share when it is due. The overwhelming majority of employers and employees do pay their fair share. But for too long some employers and employees with the benefit of sophisticated tax advice have sought to avoid their responsibilities and to pass more of a burden onto the rest of us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m02.html_para3">Early attempts at avoidance in this area took the form&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of paying bonuses and salaries in gold bullion, diamonds and fine wines. When these routes were closed, employers started to pay bonuses through shares and share options to reduce the amount of NICs they had to pay, avoid their obligation to operate PAYE, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reduce employees&#039; tax bills. When, in 1998, assets readily convertible into cash were brought within PAYE, and NICs, avoidance schemes moved on to more complex arrangements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m02.html_para4">Despite extensive reforms to the tax legislation in 2003, employers and their advisers are continuing to devise and operate ever more contrived avoidance schemes. One such example of which Inland Revenue has learnt involves payment of a bonus to an employee in the form of dividends on shares in a specially constructed company. This avoids tax at 40 per cent. and employer and employee NICs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m02.html_para5">The Inland Revenue will be challenging such arrangements in the courts where it is appropriate to do so. We cannot however await the outcome in the courts before taking action. We intend that from today both tax and NICs legislation should achieve our objective of subjecting the rewards of employment to the proper amount of tax and NICs, however the rewards are delivered. Taxpayers who contribute their fair share 





<br>&nbsp;<br>2 Dec 2004 : Column 46WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

have a right to expect that others will also do so.We also want to make it plain that to the extent that legislation may still not achieve our objective in the face of continuing avoidance, we will ensure it does.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m02.html_para6">To that end we will be including legislation in FB 05, effective from today, to close down the avoidance schemes we know about. A technical note explaining what we intend to do in FB 05 will be published today. We will also ensure that NICs is charged on these schemes with effect from today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m02.html_para7">However, experience has taught us that we are not always able to anticipate the ingenuity and inventiveness of the avoidance industry. Nor should we have to. Our objective is clear and the time has come to close this activity down permanently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m02.html_para8">I am therefore giving notice of our intention to deal with any arrangements that emerge in future designed to frustrate our intention that employers and employees should pay the proper amount of tax and NICs on the rewards of employment. Where we become aware of arrangements which attempt to frustrate this intention we will introduce legislation to close them down, where necessary from today.
</p>

<br>
Notes to the table:
<br>
The above calculation involves estimating several figures that are inherently difficult to forecast accurately, such as the gross rate yield and the prior year adjustments. The resulting figure of &#163;18.100 billion has therefore been rounded to &#163;18.000 billion exactly to avoid spurious accuracy.
<br>
For 2001&#150;02, 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04, the amounts shown are generally those reported on the outturn (NNDR3) returns, with those for 2003&#150;04 being regarded as provisional in advance of the receipt of audited returns. For 2004&#150;05, the amounts shown are the provisional outturn for the year based upon authorities&#039; provisional contributions to the non-domestic rating pool, as reported on NNDR1 returns. For 2005&#150;06 figures, the estimates are based on:
<br>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 1: The gross rate yield represents the estimated effective total rateable value of non-domestic hereditaments on local rating lists multiplied by the small business non-domestic rating multiplier of 41.5p. The supplement of 0.7p that is also applied to businesses paying for the new small business rate relief is not included, and neither is the small business rate relief included within the reliefs at item l(i). This reflects the fact that the income from the supplement is intended to equal the cost of the relief nationally, resulting in a zero net effect upon the Distributable Amount.
<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 1(i)(a): The cost of the transitional reliefs in 2004&#150;05 is estimated to be zero, to reflect the fact the scheme is designed to be self-financing, through phasing in reductions to rate bills.
<br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 1(i)(b): The empty property relief adjustments include voids and partially occupied hereditaments. The 2005&#150;06 figure includes an allowance to reflect the increase in the gross rate yield.
<br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 1(i)(c): Charitable rate relief. The 2005&#150;06 figure includes an allowance to reflect the increase in the gross rate yield.
<br>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 1(i)(d): Rural Shops and Post Office relief. Figures include mandatory relief for general stores and post offices under the Local Government and Rating Act 1997. The 2005&#150;06 figure includes an allowance to reflect the increase in the gross rate yield.
<br>
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 1(i)(e): Community Amateur Sports Clubs (CASCs). This is mandatory rate relief for sports clubs registered with the Inland Revenue as Community Amateur Sports Clubs under Section 64 of the Local Government Act 2003, which came into effect on 1&nbsp;April 2004. The 2005&#150;06 figure includes an allowance to reflect the increase in the gross rate yield.
<br>
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 1(i)(f): Discretionary relief granted to charities, non-profit making organisations and for other reasons including discretionary relief for village shops and post offices under the Local Government and Rating Act 1997. The 2005&#150;06 figure includes an allowance to reflect the increase in the gross rate yield.
<br>
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 1(ii)(a) and (b): The allowances for the costs and losses incurred by authorities in collecting non-domestic rates from ratepayers.
<br>
9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 1(ii)(c): City Offset&#151;the amount which the City of London is not required to pay into the non-domestic rating pool. It has been set to zero for 2004&#150;05 onwards.
<br>
10.&nbsp;Item 1(iii): Net adjustment in respect of appeals and other amendments to the rating list affecting liability for previous years rates settled in that year: comprising repayments and associated interest payments.
<br>
11.&nbsp;Item 2: the rateable value of non-domestic hereditaments on the central rating list multiplied by the multiplier, less the net effect of transitional arrangements, and adjusted for appeals and other changes in respect of previous years.
<br>
12.&nbsp;Item 3: Almost all properties previously included in the Crown List are included in the local list figures at item 1.
<br>
13.&nbsp;Item 4: the contribution from central government to offset the amount of the Secretary of State&#039;s estimate of income foregone as a result of transitional arrangements is assumed to be zero for 2005&#150;06, given the self-financing nature of the transitional relief scheme.

<p><a name="41202m03.html_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Local and Regional Government  (Mr.&nbsp;Nick Raynsford): </b> 
 The Government are today announcing the allocation to administering authorities of &#163;1.715 billion for the Supporting People programme in 2005&#150;06. These grants are awarded to authorities to enable them to provide housing related services to over 1.2 million vulnerable people in our society.






<br>&nbsp;<br>2 Dec 2004 : Column 48WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m03.html_para0">The Supporting People programme was successfully launched in April 2003. Since then authorities have made good progress in managing the programme but there is work still to do. Findings from an independent review, inspections by the Audit Commission, and other research work have shown that there are considerable opportunities for authorities to make efficiency savings in their programme and that some services are not delivering the quality of support that clients deserve.






<br>&nbsp;<br>2 Dec 2004 : Column 49WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m03.html_para1">We are addressing these concerns by requiring authorities to complete reviews of individual services by April 2006 and ensure that these are value for money, good quality and strategically relevant. In partnership with local stakeholders, authorities are developing five-year strategies for their programmes and these will examine critically the services delivered and focus them on local need and strategic priorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m03.html_para2">Additionally, we are providing help and advice through capacity building programmes, and monitoring and support to authorities and providers. This includes projects to develop and disseminate best practice, a benchmarking programme, web-based support through hub services, and support to authorities struggling with their administration of the programme. We will also continue to work with authorities and providers to ensure that administration of the programme is effective and does not create unnecessary burdens.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m03.html_para3">As a preventative programme, Supporting People contributes to a range of key Government targets and objectives. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be working closely with colleagues across Government to ensure that the Supporting People programme is better integrated with other support packages.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m03.html_para4">Throughout 2005&#150;06, we will be developing the monitoring arrangements for the programme including measuring performance against three key Supporting People performance indicators. We will use this data to establish baseline performance and will then look to authorities to deliver continued improvement in outcomes over time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m03.html_para5">Early next year we will consult on the revised needs based distribution formula which will provide the basis for allocating Supporting People grant in the future. In the long run this could give rise to significant changes in current pattern of allocations between authorities and I recognise this cannot be achieved quickly. We have previously announced that under the Spending Review 2004 settlement the funding for Supporting People in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 will be around &#163;1.7 billion. To provide some further assurance to authorities about the pace of change I have decided that no authority should face a reduction of funding of more than 5 per cent. or an increase of more than 10 per cent. in either of these years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m03.html_para6">This Government&#039;s on-going commitment to the Supporting People programme and our continued support to authorities and other stakeholders in the delivery of the programme will ensure the continued improvement in value for money and better use of resources in 2005&#150;06 and beyond.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m03.html_para7">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is also beginning today a consultation on the grant conditions for Supporting People in 2005&#150;06, which we are proposing to keep broadly the same as 2004&#150;05. The consultation ends on 11 February 2005. We are writing to local authorities to inform them of their allocations.

 My right hon.

We recognise that we are at a critical point of this 10-year strategy, the goals of which can only be achieved by sustaining the drive and energy we have demonstrated so far. Our continued commitment to addressing this key inequality and public health issue is signalled by our PSA jointly held with the Department of Health. Reducing teenage pregnancies and supporting young parents is central to our change for children programme with its aim of improving the life chances for all young people.

): The joint Defra&#151;HM Treasury consultation &quot;Developing Measures to Promote Catchment-Sensitive Farming&quot; sought views on the broad possible approaches and measures (including regulatory, voluntary and economic measures) to reduce&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diffuse water pollution from agriculture. The

<br>&nbsp;<br>

consultation, which closed on 9 September 2004, stressed the need for action to further improve water quality and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to help meet the requirements of domestic and international targets including the water framework directive. It also suggested that a package of different measures likely to be needed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m03.html_para10">Respondents to the consultation expressed a variety of views across the range of possible measures. A detailed analysis of responses is available on the Defra website www.defra.gov.uk/. In brief: there was broad support for the concept of a package of measures; many respondents suggested a potential role for regulation as a means for targeting catchments that are particularly environmentally sensitive or where there is a particular problem from diffuse water pollution from agriculture; views were divided on the use of economic instruments; and voluntary and awareness-raising measures were generally strongly supported. The Government are today publishing a summary of responses to the consultation.

Police performance is improving and the justice gap is continuing to narrow. Our correctional services are operating effectively, we have expanded drug treatment and asylum is increasingly under control.

<p><a name="41202m04.html_spmin3"><b>The Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety  (Ms Hazel Blears): </b> 
 I have today placed in the Library a copy of the Home Secretary&#039;s proposals for allocation of police grant for England and Wales in 2005&#150;06. The Home Secretary and I intend to implement the proposals subject to consideration of any representations and to the approval of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m04.html_para11">This Government are continuing to deliver on law and order. Our programme of reform and improvement for the police service in England and Wales over the past four years has been matched by a significant increase in resources for policing. On a like for like basis, expenditure on policing supported by Government grant or spent centrally on services for the police has increased by 39 per cent. or over &#163;3.0 billion between 2000&#150;01 and 2005&#150;06. This substantial increase has helped to both support the reform agenda and deliver the things that we all want to see. Crime is down and there are record numbers of police officers, police staff and community support officers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m04.html_para12">We have recently set out our programme for further change. On 9 November we published &quot;<i>Building Communities, Beating Crime: A Better Police Service for the 21st Century</i>&quot;. This is an ambitious agenda for sustainable improvement in policing. We are aiming for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the spread of neighbourhood policing, with improved responsiveness and customer service; further modernisation of the police workforce to ensure that the service is fully equipped and able to deliver these changes; and greater involvement of communities and citizens in determining how their communities are policed. We are committed to working with the service, police authorities and their partner agencies in delivering safer communities across our country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m04.html_para13">The national policing plan for 2005&#150;08 was published on 24 November. This too puts the law abiding citizen at the heart of policing, with the police working in partnership to create and maintain secure and confident communities. Our key priorities are to reduce overall crime; provide a citizen-focused police service; take action with partners to increase sanction detection rates; reduce people&#039;s concerns about crime and anti-social behaviour; combat serious and organised crime and counter the increased risk from terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m04.html_para14">The police funding settlement will support the priorities outlined in the Plan. The police will receive sufficient resources to enable them to provide an efficient and effective service to the public. We have listened very carefully to the concerns raised by the policing community. The Association of Police Authorities and the Association of Chief Police Officers made available 





<br>&nbsp;<br>2 Dec 2004 : Column 54WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

their own surveys of projected cost increases for 2005&#150;06. These have been taken into account in determining Government increases in grant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m04.html_para15">Total provision for policing to be supported by grant in 2005&#150;06 will be &#163;11,833 million. Central Government revenue grant funding direct to police forces will increase by 5.1 per cent. This includes an increase of 4.8 per cent. in total formula grant and more than &#163;760 million in specific grants. Taken together with the increase in central funding for police communications, IT and support services, this provides an increase in supported spending of 6.7 per cent. overall.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m04.html_para16">The overall 6.7 per cent. increase or &#163;746 million includes police formula grants, specific grants, capital related grants, direct Home Office spending and the formula spending on which revenue support grant is based. It also includes counter-terrorism and security, and international and organised crime funding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m04.html_para17">For formula grant, the Home Secretary and I have added &#163;194 million in Home Office Police Grant to last year&#039;s general police grant provision. There has also been an increase of &#163;156 million in Revenue Support Grant and National Non Domestic Rates from ODPM and the Welsh Assembly. This will give police authorities maximum scope to determine their own spending and help authorities manage down financial pressures next year. This extra money has enabled us to increase police formula grant by 4.8 per cent. in 2005&#150;06.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m04.html_para18">Last year we took the exceptional decision to provide a broadly standard rate increase in general grants in recognition of the financial pressures on all authorities. This year we will again provide a minimum increase for all police authorities but we have been able to return to a better reflection of the funding formula. The settlement provides a funding floor of 3.75 per cent. This will benefit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26 police authorities who under application of the formula without damping would have received &#163;103.6 million less. Increases for other authorities, above the funding floor, range up to nearly 6.9 per cent. This approach balances financial protection for all police authorities with distribution of additional resources to areas where need is greater. Above-floor increases will help authorities facing rapid population growth and those that have faced ceiling restrictions in the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m04.html_para19">The minimum increase of 3.75 per cent. in general grants is substantially above police pay increases and inflation. Police Authorities, the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities have impressed upon me the particular pressures they face in the coming year. I am responding to their concerns with what is one of the highest police settlements in recent years. To help meet those pressures, particularly on police pensions, police grant overall and the floor level include a special 0.25 per cent uplift, around &#163;20m that would not otherwise have been provided. I do not intend to claw back the &#163;20m in future years, but equally we will not take it into account when calculating grant increases in 2006&#150;2007. The effect will be that grant increases in 2006&#150;2007 will be calculated as increases on a baseline from which the 0.25 per cent. uplift has been removed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m04.html_para20">Pressures on policing change over time and the way in which we assess police authorities&#039; relative need for grant support has to develop. As the National Policing Plan 2005&#150;08 explains, we are reviewing the formula that underpins police grant, in association with the service. 





<br>&nbsp;<br>2 Dec 2004 : Column 55WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

We are examining the factors that drive demands on the police and will take account of those factors at local level which are known to affect levels of criminality. We will be updating the formula in the light of new data, and we are&nbsp;exploring the possibility of linking performance expectations and resource allocation and the extent to which specific grants can be incorporated in general grant. We are also supporting wider Government consultation on three-year rather than annual grant settlements and collaborating with the Lyons Review of Local Government funding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m04.html_para21">The settlement continues to take account of our commitment to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the police service. We expect, for the three years from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2005&#150;06 to 2007&#150;08, the Police Service to deliver efficiency gains of 3 per cent. per annum, half of which are to be cashable gains. Guidance on efficiency plans for 2005&#150;06 has been issued this week.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m04.html_para22">The Home Office, the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities are committed to working in partnership to deliver cumulative year on year improvements in the value for money to deliver the efficiency targets. Future police grant allocations will be considered in the light of police&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;authorities meeting the target for efficiency improvements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m04.html_para23">This is an excellent settlement. If police authorities deliver efficiency gains, and exercise judicious financial planning, there is no reason for police authorities to set excessive increases in police precepts on council tax next year. The Government&#039;s policy in relation to council tax increases of less than 5 per cent. has been clearly set out by my rt hon Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and my hon. Friend the Minister for local government.

A further &#163;8 million to cover pay inflation has been included within the general grant uplift. This Fund has been remarkably successful in helping the police service boost its strength which reached a record level of 139,728 in August 2004. Subject to forces maintaining their strength, we will continue to pay for the 9,650&nbsp;police officers recruited through the scheme by a combination of specific and general grant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m04.html_para41"><i>Counter Terrorism:</i> As last year, we will continue to provide additional funding to the Police Service to enable it to respond to the increased threat from international terrorism. We will be providing the Metropolitan Police with some &#163;61 million in 2005&#150;06 for ring-fenced counter terrorism funding. Provincial forces in England and Wales will receive &#163;35 million of revenue and &#163;8 million of capital in 2005&#150;06 for dedicated counter terrorism work. This will be allocated following full consultation with the Association of Chief&nbsp;Police Officers and individual forces.

All forces in England & Wales receive a share of the grant. Next year will be the third year of the Fund. BCU Commanders will have discretion locally to pool their BCU allocations with the new Safer and Stronger Communities Fund if they wish.

For 2005&#150;06 I have again split the allocation. A further &#163;9 million (making &#163;18 million) has been included in general grant. &#163;69 million will be available as a specific grant, an increase of &#163;9 million over the provision for 2004&#150;05.

In addition to this, I announced on 24 November the introduction of a Neighbourhood Policing Fund which would provide initially &#163;50 million to be spent on additional CSOs to bring us up to our target of 5,500 by 31 March 2005.

<p>
<a name="41202m04.html_para57">We are also establishing the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill recently introduced into Parliament. This agency will mean a step change in how we fight and defeat organised crime and the harm that is caused by it. The harm is currently estimated to be at least &#163;20 billion a year to the United Kingdom. It will be a new organisation with a new operation that will bring together the functions of NCS and NCIS, which will be abolished as a result, as well as the serious drug trafficking and organised immigration crime aspects of Customs and the Immigration, Service. The costs of these constituencies will transfer into SOCA once it is established in April 2006. The cost met by the Home Office in 2005&#150;06 is estimated at &#163;24 million.

2006&#150;07 new arrangements for funding pensions will protect forces from extraordinary fluctuations. For 2005&#150;06 the Home Secretary and I are providing some general relief.

These have been used to allocate pensions provision in the general grant formula. For the future, we are reviewing current arrangements to make pensions&#039; costs more predictable and manageable. Police authorities would continue to meet police pensions, funded by employer and employee contributions and topped up by central Government if that were insufficient to meet the audited pensions bill.

<p>
<a name="41202m04.html_para68">We have listened carefully to all stakeholders in determining this settlement. We are continuing to provide the resources the police service need to work effectively and matching reform with investment. The proposals will ensure that all forces in England & Wales receive a fair share of resources. There is a guaranteed minimum increase in general grants for all police authorities but resources are also being targeted to where resources are needed most. The settlement will allow us to maintain record police officer numbers as well as expand the growing number of Community Support Officers, who are reassuring the public and helping to reduce crime and fear of crime.

 Today I am announcing firm allocations for the 116 local highway authorities and six passenger transport authorities in England, outside London, for capital expenditure in 2005&#150;06.

This brings the total investment in local transport projects in the last five&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years to over &#163;8 billion, a 100 per cent. increase&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compared to the previous five years. Today&#039;s announcement clearly demonstrates the Government&#039;s continuing commitment to delivering better local transport.

As previously stated, Ministers have delivered sustained and predictable funding for each of the five years of the first LTP period (2001&#150;06).

<a name="41202m05.html_sbhd4"><h4 align=center>Occupational Pensions Security</h4>





<p><a name="41202m05.html_spmin4"><b>The Minister for Pensions  (Malcolm Wicks): </b> 
 Since the financial assistance scheme was announced in May we have made good progress in scoping what is an extremely complex problem, involving hundreds of pension schemes, with differing scheme rules and in different stages of winding up. Following an initial data-gathering exercise, we laid a report before the House in June, setting out an estimate of the numbers affected.






<br>&nbsp;<br>2 Dec 2004 : Column 65WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m05.html_para12">Ministers and officials have since consulted with scheme members, trade unions and industry experts to gather and analyse more data, and explore options for the best way to get assistance to those who need it most.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m05.html_para13">Obviously, the full extent of the problem can be known only once all potentially eligible schemes have been identified and information obtained on the individuals affected and the extent of their losses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m05.html_para14">In September, we launched a second, more detailed data-gathering exercise to identify potentially eligible schemes. It is important that all scheme trustees and actuaries who think their schemes might be eligible respond by 10 December. Data-gathering on the position of individuals will follow.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m05.html_para15">While we continue to seek industry contributions to the financial assistance scheme, full participation in this exercise is an immediate opportunity for the pensions industry to provide valuable practical help and assistance in kind.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m05.html_para16">As we have previously said, the scheme will not give everyone all of what they want. Nor will the scheme provide the same assistance levels as the pension protection fund, which provides cover going forward, funded by a levy. The primary objective is to provide significant help to those who have lost the most.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m05.html_para17">The available funding is set. People who are younger have more time to work and save for a pension to replace one that has been wholly or partially lost. Therefore we are minded to gear assistance levels with reference to the number of years an individual is from their retirement. To further focus resources, we are considering making payments for all individuals at age 65.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m05.html_para18">The pension protection fund has a benefit cap for those below scheme pension age, and it makes sense that the FAS should also have one, which we intend to set at a lower level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m05.html_para19">To minimise bureaucracy and to maximise payments to those facing the most serious losses, Ministers intend that, other assistance criteria aside, the FAS will include only those who will receive at least &#163;10 a week, or equivalent, from the scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m05.html_para20">Information already gathered makes clear that the vast majority of those that had started winding up with significant funding shortfalls did so after January 1997. We can therefore confirm that members of schemes that commenced winding up from 1 January 1997 will potentially be eligible, subject to the other FAS entry rules. Schemes starting to wind up right through to the introduction of the pension protection fund (6 April 2005) will also be potentially eligible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m05.html_para21">Solvent employers have a duty to support their schemes and provide the benefits that members were expecting. So, it is right that the FAS focuses on insolvent employers. Nevertheless, issues concerning the definition of &quot;employer solvency&quot; remain under active consideration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m05.html_para22">Those who have lost out due to their scheme winding up underfunded have already seen their expectations for retirement upset once. It is therefore important that the resources available for FAS are deployed in a way that ensures that any new promise made to those eligible will&nbsp;be delivered. This points to providing assistance by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;means of top-up to the occupational pension that 





<br>&nbsp;<br>2 Dec 2004 : Column 66WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

individuals would otherwise receive. Trustees should therefore fulfill their duty to wind up schemes in an expeditious manner, including annuitisation where appropriate. We will consider further the precise means of delivery&#151;options include a top-up pension, a cash lump sum, or purchase of an annuity at age 65.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m05.html_para23">Early next year we would hope to be in a position to announce what we propose by way of indicative assistance levels to those facing the most urgent difficulties, as well as an indicative list of schemes that are likely to be eligible for assistance if those schemes are subsequently shown to comply with the FAS rules.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m05.html_para24">The complexity of the issue, the amount of data that has had to be collected, and the level of consultation undertaken, means that the formal regulatory consultation will begin in the spring.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41202m05.html_para25">In April we will set up the body to administer the scheme and following the formal consultation we will lay regulations before Parliament, making payments as soon as practicable thereafter.
