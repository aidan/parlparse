<a name="60418m01.html_sbhd0"><h4 align=center>Citizen Information Project</h4>





<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60418m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury  (Mr. Des Browne): </b> 
 On 28 October 2004 <i>Official Report</i>, Column 53WS, my predecessor announced that the Government had accepted a recommendation from the Citizen Information Project (CIP) about using the proposed National Identity Register (NIR) as an adult population register and that further exploratory work should be undertaken, including on shorter-term opportunities for efficiency savings in handling contact details (name, address, date of birth) in existing registers. This also included the possible use of personal reference numbers, as mentioned in the Government&#039;s reply (Cm 6359) to the fourth report from the Home Affairs Committee Session 2003&#150;04 HC130. The CIP team, based within the Office for National Statistics (ONS), has now reported its final conclusions and its recommendations that:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">there is significant value to both citizens and the public sector in greater sharing of contact details (name, address, date of birth, reference numbers) in a secure way across the public sector;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">this should be implemented through the identity cards scheme on the basis that the scheme eventually becomes compulsory. The Identity and Passport Service should be responsible for developing the National Identity Register (NIR) as an adult population database. Over time public sector systems, business processes and culture should be adapted to use the NIR as the definitive source of contact details in the longer term;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">in developing the child index to support better delivery of children&#039;s services, the Department for Education and Skills should also consider whether there is scope to realise further efficiency and effectiveness benefits through a child population register;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">a number of specific, short-term arrangements for sharing contact information should be considered by the departments and agencies concerned; and</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">HM Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) should, as a priority, agree the detailed terms of reference, time scale and resources required to complete an evaluation of the costs, legal, operational and other implications of making wider, managed use of the National Insurance Number and the associated citizen contact details held by DWP.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60418m01.html_para0"><a name="stpa_0">The Government have accepted these recommendations and further work is being carried out in line with the transformational Government implementation plan published on 29 March 2006. The Identity Cards Act 2006 includes securing the efficient and effective provision of public services as a purpose of the National Identity Register. Any further necessary legislation to implement the CIP recommendations will be subject to consultation as appropriate.

 The Mental Capacity Act 2005 created the Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA) service to help vulnerable people who lack capacity to make important decisions about serious medical treatment and changes of residence. The role of the IMCA is to support and represent the person who lacks capacity. Decision makers in the national health service and in local authorities (for example doctors and social workers), will have a duty to consult IMCA for the most vulnerable&#151;those who have no family or friends to be consulted&#151;in relation to decisions about:

 I regret that in an answer to a question from the hon. Member for Richmond Park during development questions on 29 March 2006, I stated incorrectly that $13.5 million had been given towards the crisis in East Africa from the new United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). In fact, $13.5 million was the figure that the CERF secretariat was expecting in initial applications to the fund from UN agencies in the region. On 31 March, $1.7 million of that $13.5 million was approved and disbursed to the World Health Organisation. The remaining applications are in the process of being approved for disbursal to other agencies. Under the current CERF operating rules, there is an in-principle maximum ceiling of $30 million available per crisis.

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60418m02.html_spmin1"><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Mr. David Hanson): </b> 
 On 3 April I announced that the Northern Ireland discretionary budget for 2006&#150;07 will be &#163;74.69 million; &#163;13.62 million will be allocated to grants; &#163;60.97 million to loans and &#163;0.1 million will be held as a contingency reserve. The new allocations represent an increase of &#163;15.1 million over the initial gross budget set at April 2005. This increase will be funded through higher loan recoveries, plus an increase in net treasury funding of &#163;10.8 million for this year. This &#163;10.8 million is the first instalment of the increases to the discretionary announced in the autumn 2004 pre-budget report to deal with new policy changes to the social fund loans scheme (see below). These measures, which amount to an increase in funding for the social fund of &#163;18.9 million over the three years to 2008&#150;09, will enable the social fund to play a more effective role in helping those families most vulnerable to over-indebtedness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60418m02.html_para1"><a name="stpa_16">The community care grant budget has been increased by &#163;0.3 million to &#163;13.62 million. This will provide more help to customers, in particular families with children and the disabled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60418m02.html_para2"><a name="stpa_17">The loans budget has been increased to &#163;60.97 million, an increase of &#163;14.8 million on the initial 2005&#150;06 loans budget. To improve the fairness of the scheme, budgets will be allocated in a way that will over time achieve greater consistency of outcome for customers wherever they live.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60418m02.html_para5"><a name="stpa_19">We have greatly simplified the rules for determining the size of the maximum budgeting loan amount that can be offered to eligible applicants. And there are now only three rates that can be offered:

<br>&nbsp;<br>18 Apr 2006 : Column 6WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

for determining size of the maximum budgeting loan, means that applicants will understand better the help that is available and when they can access it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60418m02.html_para7"><a name="stpa_21">We have increased the overall limit on loan amounts that any applicant can borrow from the social fund. At the same time we are reducing the highest loan repayment rates and giving applicants longer to repay their loan debt.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60418m02.html_para8"><a name="stpa_22">Also from 3 April 2006, budgeting loan applicants will benefit from being able to have more savings before any budgeting loan award is affected. The capital limit is doubled to &#163;1,000 (under pension age) and &#163;2,000 (pension age).
</p>

<p>
<a name="60418m02.html_para9"><a name="stpa_23">Overall this is a significant package of changes. Also, in making loans more affordable and easier to access, we aim to help people avoid alternative high cost lenders.
