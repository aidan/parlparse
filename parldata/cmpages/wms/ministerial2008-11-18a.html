<p><a name="st_81"><a name="08111871000025"><a name="81118m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="08111871000178"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Alistair Darling):</b>
 I set out in my statements to Parliament on 8 October, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 277-280 and 13 October, <i>Official Report</i>, column 539, the details of the Government&#146;s recapitalisation scheme. All UK incorporated banks&#151;including UK subsidiaries of foreign institutions&#151;with substantial business in the UK, and building societies, are eligible to apply for the scheme. To date, RBS Group plc and&#151;subject to their merger proceeding&#151;Lloyds TSB plc and HBOS Group plc have announced the terms on which they are participating. Those terms are set out in detail in the placing and open offer agreements, and in the preference share subscription agreements. I have today arranged for final, signed versions of the agreements to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="81118m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08111871000026">I now set out the detail of dealing with future applications to the scheme from those banks which are currently raising capital&#151;either by an agreement with HM Treasury or otherwise&#151;and which, for whatever reason, may seek to negotiate a substantively new proposal or new agreement with HM Treasury about the terms of any recapitalisation. Detailed terms of participation would remain a matter for discussion with the board of the institution concerned, taking proper account of prevailing market conditions, but HM Treasury would expect to apply the following general principles:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="81118m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08111871000027">The objective of the recapitalisation scheme is to ensure that each eligible institution has sufficient capital to sustain confidence in the institution. Institutions should therefore have a sufficient buffer of capital above the minimum requirement both to absorb losses that might ensue from a downturn and to continue lending on normal commercial criteria. In assessing any proposals in relation to eligible institutions, HM Treasury will continue to focus on three key objectives:</p>
<a name="81118m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08111871000142"><ul><p class="tabletext">maintaining financial stability;</p>
</ul><a name="81118m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="08111871000143"><ul><p class="tabletext">safeguarding the interests of taxpayers; and</p>
</ul><a name="81118m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="08111871000144"><ul><p class="tabletext">protecting depositors and consumers.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="81118m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08111871000028">In providing capital to any eligible institution, HM Treasury, on the advice of the Bank of England and Financial Services Authority, would need to be satisfied that these three objectives were met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="81118m0001.htm_para3"><a name="08111871000029">There is no automatic right of access to the recapitalisation scheme. At minimum HM Treasury would expect the following high-level conditions to be met before capital could be offered to any eligible institution:</p>
<a name="81118m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="08111871000145"><ul><p class="tabletext">the institution must have a plan to meet an appropriate level of capitalisation, as determined by the FSA. (Information about the FSA approach is set out in its statement of 14 November 2008). It is a matter for the institutions concerned to disclose to the market their capital requirement;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="81118m0001.htm_para10"><a name="08111871000036">Any securities acquired by HM Treasury under the recapitalisation scheme will be managed on a commercial basis by UK Financial Investments Ltd (UKFI).

 The Secretary of State for Health and I today welcome the publication of the final report of the independent review of child and adolescent mental health services. We would like to thank the CAMHS external review group for their report and recommendations. In particular, we would like to thank Jo Davidson, the chair and group director of children and young people's services at Gloucestershire county council and Dr. Bob Jezzard, the vice-chair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="81118m0001.htm_para14"><a name="08111871000042">This has been a challenging review. Children&#146;s mental health is an area where there are strong views and perspectives. The external review group should, therefore, take great credit for having produced such a coherent and evidence-based report, which sets out a clear vision for how we can all take responsibility for promoting children&#146;s mental health and psychological well-being, alongside clear recommendations for how we can best achieve the step change in the quality and consistency of services at all levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="81118m0001.htm_para15"><a name="08111871000043">We asked the chair and vice-chair to investigate:</p>
<a name="81118m0001.htm_brev13"><a name="08111871000155"><ul><p class="tabletext">the progress that has been made, since the launch of standard 9 of the children&#146;s national service framework and the publication of &#147;Every Child Matters&#148; in 2004, in delivering services to meet the educational, health and social care needs of children and young people at risk of and experiencing mental health problems, including those with complex, severe and persistent needs; and</p>
</ul><a name="81118m0001.htm_brev14"><a name="08111871000156"><ul><p class="tabletext">the practical solutions that can be used by those developing policy and delivering, managing and commissioning services to address current challenges and deliver better outcomes for children and young people with mental health problems, and how these solutions can be monitored.</p>

The fact that the review&#146;s recommendations respond to the concerns of users of these vital services gives its report added weight and importance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="81118m0001.htm_para17"><a name="08111871000045">We agree with the review&#146;s analysis that whilst considerable improvements have been made to the support and services delivered in this area, there is still a great deal of change that needs to take place at all levels of the system to support the delivery of integrated, child and family-focused mental health and psychological well-being services that are organised around children and young people&#146;s needs.</p>

We are delighted that Dame Jo Williams, former chief executive of Mencap has agreed to chair the review and Dr Lesley Hewson, consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist and director of CAMHS, Bradford District Care Trust, to act as vice-chair; and</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="81118m0001.htm_para20"><a name="08111871000048">We are committed to: taking forward key recommendations within the report on improving access for children, young people and their families to mental health support through universal services; improving the access, quality and impact of mental health services for vulnerable children and young people; and ensuring that parents and carers have access to high quality advice and support when they are concerned about their children&#146;s mental health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="81118m0001.htm_para21"><a name="08111871000049">For example, legislation to strengthen Children&#146;s Trusts is already in train.

Thanks to the determination of our partners in local authorities, the voluntary sector and other agencies dealing with the homeless, we achieved that goal several years ago.

To make this happen we want to make sure that in every part of the country people get the help they need, so no one has to sleep rough.

 On 8 May 2008 we introduced through the Standards Committee (England) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/1085) the reformed conduct regime for local authority members, in which responsibility for standards of conduct and dealing with allegations of misconduct by members is largely devolved to each council&#146;s independently chaired standards committee. In this regime the Standards Board for England has the role of a strategic regulator, and only the most serious cases of misconduct by members are to be investigated by the Standards Board and determined by case tribunals of the Adjudication Panel for England, established under the Local Government Act 2000.</p>

These sanctions are currently available only to councils&#146; standards committees. Making these sanctions available to case tribunals will allow them to deal proportionately with, for example, a case which, although referred to the tribunal on the grounds that it is very serious, the tribunal concludes is a less serious matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="81118m0002.htm_para6"><a name="08111871000068">We do this primarily by supporting our GPs with specialist out-patient assessment and treatment at our military regional departments of community mental health centres sited in military bases.

Where this is necessary, it is provided regionally in specialised psychiatric units under a contractual arrangement. Since 2003 this contract has been with the Priory Group. The contract with the Priory Group has worked very well and was extended for two years. In line with our usual commercial practice a competitive tendering exercise has now been conducted in order to place a new contract.

They offer a single point of contact for admissions and access to a series of dedicated beds across the United Kingdom. South Staffordshire and Shropshire Foundation Trust describe their services as culturally sensitive and have proposed an in-patient care pathway that provides assessment and treatment in environments that would allow service patients to be accommodated in a separate area and be able to separate themselves from the civilian NHS population if they wished this and it was clinically appropriate. The South Staffordshire and Shropshire Foundation Trust&#146;s philosophy and approach to in-patient care is consistent with that of the MOD and with generally accepted best practice; rapid assessment, stabilisation and return to care within the community as soon as possible.</p>

These are: Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust, Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, NHS Grampian, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust, Somerset Partnership NHS Trust, and Hampshire Partnership NHS Trust. All of the trusts selected are rated good or excellent for their quality of care in the Healthcare Commission&#146;s recent Annual Health Check. The South Staffordshire and Shropshire Foundation Trust will act as the &#147;network lead&#148; and as such, will guarantee the quality and governance of the services provided. The foundation trust status of the winning bidder offers MOD access to services that are subject to unprecedented levels of corporate governance and are monitored by an independent regulator.</p>

 &#147;High Quality Care for All&#148;, the final report of the NHS next stage review, set out the vision of an NHS in which quality is the organising principle for everything the service does. The chief executive of the NHS, David Nicholson CBE, the NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh, and the chief nursing officer Dame Christine Beasley are today writing to every NHS organisation in England, asking them to start to take concrete steps to make this happen. The document they are sending to the NHS, &#147;Measuring for Quality Improvement: the approach&#148;, sets out clearly what local teams, NHS organisations&#151;both providers and commissioners&#151;and strategic health authorities will be asked to do to promote better measurement of quality to enable them to improve their services. It also describes the range of activities that the Department will undertake to support the NHS at local level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="81118m0002.htm_para25"><a name="08111871000131">The launch of &#147;Measuring for Quality Improvement&#148; marks both a key step towards realising the vision of &#147;High Quality Care for All&#148;, and the start of an important journey of improvement which will ultimately involve the entire NHS in England.

 Following the judgment of the Law Lords in the case of Heffernan&#151;R (on the application of Heffernan) v the Rent Service&#151;on Wednesday 30 July 2008, the Government will lay amendments to the Rent Officers (Housing Benefit Functions) Order 1997 and the Rent Officers (Housing Benefit Functions) (Scotland) Order 1997 in order to clarify the rules that enable rent officers to define the local rental market areas which help determine entitlement to housing benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="81118m0003.htm_para0"><a name="08111871000134">The way in which the geographical areas, or localities, for assessing housing benefit are determined has a direct impact on the amount of benefit individual customers receive. If applied, the judgment would result in a dramatic increase in the number of localities nationally, as each would be based on a limited number of neighbourhoods. These new locality boundaries would not necessarily be the same as those that existed before the rent services carried out their most recent reviews of boundaries and could result in a large number of low-income tenants finding that housing benefit would no longer cover their rent. Without amendment to the Rent Officers Order, this would now happen automatically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="81118m0003.htm_para1"><a name="08111871000135">This is not our policy intent which is why amendments will be laid at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="81118m0003.htm_para2"><a name="08111871000136">The routine locality reviews that were undertaken by the rent services in 2006-07 under the Rent Officers Order resulted in fewer localities across the country as a whole. These reviews were undertaken in consultation with local authorities, who have access to a discretionary fund to compensate individual tenants in hardship cases. The vast majority of the new boundaries were agreed by local authorities. The amendments of the Rent Officers Order will enable the rent services to review the boundaries in those localities where local consensus was not achieved. In any year, the rent services are committed to reviewing 25 per cent. of all locality boundaries.</p>

 On 22 May 2008 the Minister for Pensions Reform announced that John Elbourne had been asked to &#147;examine the current arrangements for the engagement of older people and the ability of those arrangements to inform policy and actions of Government at all levels&#148;. Specifically, this was to include examining better Government for older people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="81118m0003.htm_para3"><a name="08111871000138">John Elbourne will publish his report at 3 o&#146;clock this afternoon on the Department for Work and Pensions website.
