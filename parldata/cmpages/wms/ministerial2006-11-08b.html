 The Government have committed themselves to informing Parliament on an annual basis of the sanctions regimes being implemented by the United Kingdom.

The UK also implements sanctions regimes imposed autonomously by the EU in relation to Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burma, China, the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (in connection with individuals indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia), Moldova, Sudan, Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe. In accordance with a decision of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the United Kingdom implements arms embargoes on Armenia and Azerbaijan.

 I am informing the House of my intention to publish shortly a consultation document entitled &#147;Making Sentencing Clearer&#148;. This document meets the commitment I made in July, in the review of the criminal justice system, to bring forward with the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General a consultation on a number of sentencing and related issues.</p>

 On 1 August 2005 the Department launched a consultation paper seeking views on the principle of whether foreign registered aircraft based in the UK being used for non-commercial purposes should be required to be placed on the UK or another EU register. This would ensure that the safety of such aircraft was overseen by the Civil Aviation Authority or another EU aviation authority and that they were operated to European safety standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="61108m0001.htm_para7"><a name="06110849000026">The response explains that the Government&#146;s objective remains that aircraft based in the UK should be required to meet safety standards acceptable within Europe and be subject to checking by the UK and other European aviation authorities.</p>
