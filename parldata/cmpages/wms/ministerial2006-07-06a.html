The 2005-06 annual report and accounts for the Meat Hygiene Service
were laid before Parliament today. Copies have been placed in the

(Cornwall Partnerships NHS
Trust)</h4><p><a name="06070680000032"><b><a name="06070680000093">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Ivan
Lewis):</b> The Healthcare Commission and the Commission for
Social Care Inspection (CSCI) have published a report of their
investigation into abuse at Cornwall Partnerships NHS Trust. The
investigation uncovered systematic abuse of people in a number of the
trust&#146;s learning disability services. Such abuse is totally
unacceptable and a source of both anger and
concern.</p><p><a name="06070680000034">My
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has written to Anna Walker,
chief executive of the Healthcare Commission fully to accept the
conclusions of the report and agree that the special measures proposed
should be applied to the trust under the Health and Social Care
(Community Health and Standards) Act 2003. The Department will work
closely with the trust, the strategic health authority and the local
primary care trusts in addressing all the recommendations and
implementing the special measures. We also would expect to see
immediate action on national recommendations at a local
level.</p><p><a name="06070680000036">In
addition, the Department is supporting the Healthcare Commission to
audit facilities for people with learning disabilities to ensure that
this kind of situation is not happening elsewhere. This will ask all
organisations in England providing learning disability services to the
NHS to undergo a review to assess them against specified criteria. The
audit will identify services that are not registered and identify
people who have been placed inappropriately. The analysis of this work
will determine what further action the regulatory bodies
take.</p><p><a name="06070680000038">One
of the key national recommendations is for the Department to strengthen
the process for safeguarding vulnerable adults. The Department is
taking forward a series of policies to ensure additional safeguards
for the protection of vulnerable adults. These include the
Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill and the implementation of the
Mental Capacity Act 2005. The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups
Bill is currently going through Parliament. It will ensure that
unsuitable people are not employed by the NHS in future. In addition,
proposals to amend the Mental Capacity Act will close the Bournewood
gap. Together these will provide more robust protection for all
vulnerable groups, including adults with learning disabilities such as
those in Cornwall. We will be responding to further national
recommendations in the report and ensuring that we learn from this
grave situation. We will keep the House
informed.</p><p><a name="06070680000040">With
the help of an external team appointed by the Department and the SHA,
the local NHS and county council have already taken steps to safeguard
vulnerable adults. They have also provided support to people with
learning disabilities and their families. The regulators have referred
40 people to Cornwall county council protection of vulnerable adults
scheme and these will be thoroughly investigated. Investigations will
be carried out by the police where
necessary.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 49WS</b><br><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06070680000004">International
Development</h3><h4 align="center"><a name="06070680000012">Sudan</h4><p><a name="06070680000041"><b><a name="06070680000094">The
Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary
Benn):</b> Sudan remains a priority for the UK Government. The
Department for International Development and the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office are jointly supporting the Government of Sudan to
implement the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) signed on 5 May, and to
deliver development in
Sudan.</p><p><a name="06070680000043">Together
with our international partners, we call on the Government of Sudan and
the Sudan Liberation Movement / Minni Minnawi to implement the
agreement without delay. We are providing support for immediate
implementation needs including assistance for the African Union (AU) to
publicise the DPA and its benefits on the ground. The UK is also
engaged with the Darfur Joint Assessment Mission on recovery and
development. We are disappointed that the SLM/A Abdel Wahid faction and
the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) have not signed the
DPA.</p><p><a name="06070680000045">The
African Union (AU) troops continue to do an important and much-needed
job in seeking to ease the suffering of the people of Darfur, but they
need to be replaced by a UN peacekeeping operation. The Sudanese
Government has not yet agreed to this. Kofi Annan is explicit that he
wants a UN force in Darfur; the Security Council has taken a strong
line; the African Union wants one and so do many leading African
countries. We will continue to press the Government of Sudan to accept
it and call on others to do the
same.</p><p><a name="06070680000047">Lord
Triesman, the Minister for Africa, attended the AU Summit on 1 and 2
July in Banjul to push for faster progress in implementing the DPA and
for an early handover from AMIS to the
UN.</p><p><a name="06070680000049">The
UK will be represented at an AU donors' conference on 18 July in
Brussels. We are encouraging the AU and other participants to use the
conference to address how the AU and the international community can
help take forward the Darfur Peace
Agreement.</p><p><a name="06070680000051">On
Friday 23 June, the Government of Sudan publicly began disarming a
small group of Janjaweed in South Darfur witnessed by UK and US Embassy
representatives. We welcome this step, and will call on the Government
to continue this work and to present a plan for neutralising and
disarming the Janjaweed/armed militias, which they are required to do
under the Darfur Peace Agreement
(DPA).</p><p><a name="06070680000053">On
25 June, the Sudanese Government suspended all UN activity in Darfur
apart from humanitarian assistance from the World Food Programme (WFP)
and UNICEF. They lifted the suspension the following day. This had some
impact on the UN's humanitarian work in West Darfur, but minimal
disruption elsewhere. This was a provocative act by the Sudanese
Government in response to the UN helping a prominent Darfur rebel. The
Government of Sudan should allow UN humanitarian agencies and NGOs
unimpeded access in Darfur.</p><p><a name="06070680000055">Some
3.6 million people are affected by the conflict, of whom 2 million are
internally displaced persons 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 50WS</b><br>(IDPs). The UK is the second biggest bilateral humanitarian donor to the
Darfur crisis (after the US), contributing over &#163;126 million
since September 2003. On 9 May, I announced a further &#163;9 million
to the multi donor Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF), bringing our total
allocation to &#163;49 million this year. The UK is now providing
more to the UN Workplan in 2006 than in
2005.</p><p><a name="06070680000057">We
are concerned about the IDPs in Darfur and the temporary cutting of
rations by the World Food Programme (WFP). The WFP was forced to halve
its rations in Darfur in May due to lack of funding. But rations have
now been improved to 84 per cent. as a result of recent US and
Government of Sudan contributions (20,000 metric tonnes of
cereals).</p><p><a name="06070680000059">We
welcome this announcement, as it comes at a critical time in the year
with the rainy season starting in Darfur. The full ration will be
restored by October, and we are working with the UN and the largest
food aid donors (EU and US) to ensure shortfalls are prevented in the
future. The UK is also funding nutritional safety net programmes to
mitigate the impact of reduced rations on the most vulnerable in
Darfur.</p><p><a name="06070680000061">We
condemn the continuing cross-border attacks from Darfur into Eastern
Chad that have led to the displacement of 50,000 Chadians within Chad
and further numbers fleeing across the border into Darfur. Eastern Chad
now hosts 200,000 refugees from Darfur, and there are 45,000 from the
Central African Republic in the South. Further insecurity in Eastern
Chad would have very serious humanitarian implications. The UK is
providing &#163;4 million in humanitarian assistance in 2006 to
Chad.</p><p><a name="06070680000063">We
are pressing both Governments to fulfil their obligations under the
Tripoli agreement and for the Government of Sudan to disarm and expel
these Chadian groups as soon as possible, which they are required to do
under the Darfur Peace Agreement
(DPA).</p><p><a name="06070680000065">In
terms of international co-operation, the UK has stated that it is
willing to chair a group of donors to look at the restructuring of
Sudan's external debt. This is, however, conditional on real progress
by the Government of Sudan in resolving the Darfur
conflict.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06070680000005">Trade

Trading
Review</h4><p><a name="06070680000067"><b><a name="06070680000095">The
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Alistair
Darling):</b> In November 2005, my predecessor asked DTI
officials to look at the impact of relaxing the current restrictions on
Sunday shopping
hours.</p><p><a name="06070680000068">At
present, large shops over 280 square metres or 3,000 square feet are
permitted to open for six continuous hours between 10am and 6pm on a
Sunday. These shops are not permitted to open on Easter Sunday. The
current Sunday trading rules have been in place for many years now and
it is important that from time to time we look at whether regulations
like these are still appropriate.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 51WS</b><br><p><a name="06070680000069">As part of the
review, the DTI commissioned an independent economic cost benefit
analysis from Indepen Consulting Ltd., which is now available on the
DTI website. The headline conclusion of the cost benefit analysis is
that the net economic benefit of full liberalisation is worth
&#163;20.3 billion over 20 years or &#163;1.4 billion per annum.
The report also states that the net benefit of allowing large shops to
open on Easter Sunday would be &#163;1.03 billion over 20
years.</p><p><a name="06070680000070">At
the same time (January 2006 to April 2006) the Department has sought a
wide range of views on all aspects of this issue. Consumers, religious
groups, employees and businesses of all sizes have given us their
views. We received nearly 1,000 responses to the informal consultation.
A summary of these responses has been published on the DTI website
today and copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. We
also held a small business focus group in February, and a stakeholder
conference in May attended by a wide range of interested parties.
Write-ups of both these events are also available on the DTI website
and in the Libraries of both Houses. In addition, we asked the Office
for National Statistics to ask some survey questions on our behalf, and
the analysis of this data has also been published
today.</p><p><a name="06070680000071">We
considered all aspects of the impact of changes to Sunday trading. It
is clear that there is no substantial demand for change to the present
regime. Most respondents believe the current situation strikes the
right balance between all the interests involved. After considering all
the evidence received, we have concluded that this is not the right
time to make any changes to the Sunday trading
laws.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06070680000006">Transport</h3><h4 align="center"><a name="06070680000014">Regional
Funding
Allocations</h4><p><a name="06070680000072"><b><a name="06070680000096">The
Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Douglas Alexander):</b>
Last July we sought advice from English regions on their priorities for
major transport projects up to 2015-16. I am today responding to that
advice.</p><p><a name="06070680000073">The
Government have, for the first time, given regions a say in
decision-making about transport schemes that affect them at the
regional and local levels. It has been the first opportunity for the
RDA, regional assembly, their local authority partners and other key
interests to consider together their transport programmes against the
region&#146;s high level objectives, and to develop a realistic,
prioritised and affordable programme which offers the best overall
contribution to meeting those objectives. They have worked together to
identify which of the many proposals before them should go forward, and
in what timescale. They have without exception devoted considerable
care and effort to developing their advice, and to securing a consensus
on what needs to be done. I applaud the considerable progress which has
been
made.</p><p><a name="06070680000074">I
intend to seek views widely on how the process might be further
enhanced. Taking those views into account, I expect to seek further
formal advice on transport priorities within the next two
years.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 52WS</b><br><p><a name="06070680000075">This current
advice has been provided against a background of increased and
sustained investment in transport under this Government. We have
increased spending on regional and local major transport schemes by
around 50 per cent. (in real terms) since 2001-02, and the indicative
budgets on which the regional advice is based sustain this record level
of investment over the 10-year
period.</p><p><a name="06070680000076">As
a result of this increased provision, a large number of schemes are
currently underway across the country. These include, outside London,
35 local authority major schemes (generally costing over &#163;5
million) as well as 12 Highways Agency schemes on routes of regional
importance. In addition, in the light of the regions confirming their
priority, I am today giving final approval to a further five local
authority schemes, allowing them to proceed to construction or
implementation in the next few
months.</p><p><a name="06070680000077">The
regions have also advised on schemes at earlier stages following
initial Government approval. Reflecting that advice, I expect to fund
78 of these schemes in future years, subject to the schemes securing
powers, continuing to deliver good value for money and controlling
their
costs.</p><p><a name="06070680000078">The
regions have also recommended some new schemes that had not been
previously approved. I am today approving 17 of these for entry to the
regional programmes, following our assessment of their business cases.
This is an important first step for these schemes, which in many cases
will now need to seek statutory powers. Other recommended new schemes
need further work and assessment, but subject to that being completed
satisfactorily, we would expect at least a further 90 schemes to be
added to the programmes over the next ten years. Further priorities may
emerge in later
years.</p><p><a name="06070680000079">Given
that the regions have looked at priorities across their region and
against wider objectives for the first time, it is not surprising that
they have concluded that, in some cases, schemes that had previously
been approved are not their highest priority. I am accepting their
recommendations that six schemes in the Highways Agency's targeted
programme of improvements and nine local authority schemes should not
be funded in the RFA period. All other schemes previously approved are
expected to progress, though in eight cases, reflecting the
regions&#146; priorities, they will proceed to a significantly
different timescale than had previously been
planned.</p><p><a name="06070680000080">I
am today writing to each region responding to their advice and giving
details of the schemes that we expect to fund. I am placing copies in
the Libraries of both
Houses.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06070680000007">Work
