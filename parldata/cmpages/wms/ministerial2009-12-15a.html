<p><a name="st_102"><a name="09121534000027"><a name="91215m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="09121534000561"><b>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</b>
 This Government have put in place a comprehensive set of tax reliefs for charities and for those who choose to donate to charities. These tax reliefs provide valuable incentives to encourage people to give and provide support to the charity sector. In the UK we are rightly proud of our charity sector, which continues to undertake important work in the UK and around the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="91215m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09121534000028">It is therefore particularly regrettable that we have become aware of an artificial, aggressive and offensive tax avoidance scheme that seeks to abuse those tax reliefs available for donations to charity. A similar scheme to exploit this same relief was shut down in the Finance Act 2004, and we are aware that other schemes to exploit these reliefs have been marketed since then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="91215m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09121534000029">The Government will not tolerate tax avoidance or tax evasion, and will act promptly to tackle both of these, so I am today announcing changes to be made to legislation, with immediate effect, to counter these schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="91215m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09121534000030">The scheme exploits the relief available for donations of listed shares and other types of qualifying investments (including land) to charities in section 431 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 587B of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. An offshore company sells to a taxpayer listed shares with a market value well in excess of the amounts paid. However the offshore company has an option to buy back the shares, exercisable after three years, for £1. The taxpayer then gifts the shares to a charity and gets tax relief on the higher market value of the shares, despite having paid only a fraction of that market value for the shares.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="91215m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09121534000031">The option to buy back the shares is not taken into account for the purposes of determining the amount of the relief. The rules disregard contingent liabilities, such as an option, until the liability crystallises, typically by the exercise of the option in this case. In reality the option is never exercised and the scheme organiser gets the money back from the charity through some contrived arrangements.The benefit to the charity is typically  less than half of 1 per cent. of the value of the tax relief obtained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="91215m0001.htm_para4"><a name="09121534000032">The Government do not accept that these highly contrived arrangements have the effect sought, but will remove any doubt by introducing appropriate legislation in the Finance Bill 2010. The new rules will reduce the tax relief on such arrangements to the lower of the cost of acquisition to the donor of the shares or investments gifted, or the market value at the date of disposal, where the acquisition was made as part of a tax advantage scheme. This legislation will have immediate effect from 15 December 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="91215m0001.htm_para5"><a name="09121534000033">The legislation will not affect genuine donations to charity where tax avoidance arrangements are not involved and HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will be consulting with the charity sector to ensure that the legislation achieves its intended effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="91215m0001.htm_para6"><a name="09121534000034">Further details are contained in a draft explanatory note published on HMRC's website at: www.hmrc.gov.uk, today with the proposed draft legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="91215m0001.htm_para7"><a name="09121534000035">It is particularly offensive that individuals seeking to avoid tax do so in a way that exploits charity tax reliefs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="91215m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09121534000036">I am therefore giving notice of our intention to deal with any arrangements that emerge in future that are designed to take advantage of the tax reliefs for donations of qualifying investments under section 431 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 587B of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. The Government introduced these reliefs in 2000, with the intention that they should be used only for genuine donations to genuine charities. Where HMRC becomes aware of arrangements which attempt to frustrate that intention, the Government will introduce legislation to close them down, where necessary with effect from today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="91215m0001.htm_para9"><a name="09121534000037">This action will not affect the vast majority of charities and donors who organise their affairs in a straightforward and ordinary way. The Government continue to believe that charities make an important contribution to our society and do not deserve having their reputation called into question by such offensive tax avoidance.</p>

house building across the country started, and providing the affordable homes that people need, is a priority during the current exceptional economic circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="91215m0001.htm_para12"><a name="09121534000042">The Government set out the housing pledge as  part of Building Britain's Future on 29 June, with a £1.5 billion package of measures to build an extra 20,000 new affordable homes in 2009-10 and 2010-11, of which over 13,000 will be for social rent, and 10,000 open market homes. As a result, the Government are now investing £7.5 billion in 2009-10 and 2010-11 to deliver up to 112,000 affordable homes and around 15,000 private homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="91215m0001.htm_para13"><a name="09121534000043">While the majority of funding for the pledge comes from other Government Departments' programmes, given the importance attached to stimulating the housing market, I also reviewed our own investment programmes in Communities and Local Government to support the pledge. As such, the Government have switched £128 million capital funding from the Growth Fund in 2010-11 to support the pledge. All regions have benefited from the pledge funding, which has been considerably greater than the impact of the 2010-11 switch from growth funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="91215m0001.htm_para14"><a name="09121534000044">Given the impact of the exceptional economic circumstances on the delivery of homes and infrastructure, there is uncertainty that it will be possible to use Growth Funds in the way envisaged when multi-year allocations were made before the global recession.

grant money from the Growth Fund will mean it is still used for housing purposes and that the fundamental aims of the Growth Fund-to support housing growth-will still be met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="91215m0001.htm_para15"><a name="09121534000045">I wrote to the leaders of all local authorities in the Growth Areas and Growth Points about the housing pledge on 17 July, highlighting the opportunities for additional funding, and set out the planned adjustment to the Growth Fund. The Government's preferred approach was to make a pro-rata reduction to the provisional 2010-11 capital allocation of each Growth Area and Growth Point. Provisional revenue allocations for 2010-11 remain in full. The Government believe this approach would provide certainty on funding decisions in a timely manner, is fair and transparent. Consultation on the proposed changes lasted six weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="91215m0001.htm_para16"><a name="09121534000046">The consultation showed that although respondents did not welcome any reduction in funding they did show general support for the Government's preferred approach of a pro-rata reduction for every growth area local authority and the Government will therefore revise funding allocations for 2010-11 as set out below. Revised funding allocations will be paid by the Homes and Communities Agency to the nominated accountable body for each Growth Area and Growth Point in the first quarter of 2010-11. Local authorities in growth locations will still have the flexibility to prioritise how funding is used to best support local priorities.</p>

<p><a name="st_106"><a name="09121534000427"><a name="91215m0002.htm_spmin1"><a name="09121534000565"><b>The Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. Bob Ainsworth):</b>
 I am today announcing a new strategy that will see the Ministry of Defence deliver increased levels of helicopter capability for our armed forces. The strategy's priority is support to operations, and through it we will deliver, by 2016, an increase of some 40 per cent. in the number of helicopters suitable for deployment in hot and high conditions, such as Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="91215m0002.htm_para4"><a name="09121534000428">At the heart of the strategy is the procurement of an additional 22 new Chinook helicopters, with a further two expected to replace those that were destroyed in Afghanistan this summer. The current Chinook fleet has seen continuous service on operations over the last 20 years, and it has performed superbly in Afghanistan. It is a proven capability that is highly regarded by those who fly it and troops who use it. Delivery of these aircraft will not only mean more aircraft able to operate in the kind of conditions seen in Afghanistan but also a significant increase in the overall lift capacity of our helicopter fleet. We anticipate delivery of 10 new build Chinook during the course of 2012 and 2013, including two to replace the aircraft recently lost in Afghanistan. The proposed investment in these new Chinook builds on the £400 million that the Ministry of Defence has invested this year to improve the operational performance of the existing Chinook fleet by delivering enhanced engines and cockpits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="91215m0002.htm_para5"><a name="09121534000429">Beyond increasing levels of capability, our other main focus has been on simplifying the delivery of helicopter capability. As the HCDC set out in its recent report, Helicopter Capability (HC434), the optimum means to achieve efficiencies is through reducing the number of different types of helicopter fleet; with each fleet type comes an associated support cost overhead and training cost. The new strategy will enable the Department to reduce the number of fleet types.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="91215m0002.htm_para6"><a name="09121534000430">We aim to remove all marks of our Sea King fleet by 2016, with its roles to be delivered by our Merlin helicopter fleet or, in the case of UK peacetime search and rescue capabilities, by a joint private finance initiative service that we intend to provide with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. To enable this transition, we intend to capitalise on our past investment in Merlin and its over-water capabilities and safety features, including by modifying our Merlin Mk3/3a helicopters to enable them to operate effectively from amphibious shipping as well as continuing to contribute to our battlefield lift requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="91215m0002.htm_para7"><a name="09121534000431">The £300 million Puma life extension programme, which will deliver a step change in the aircraft's capability, will proceed, delivering vital battlefield lift capability for operations alongside Chinook until at least 2022. Beyond the retirement of Puma, we intend that the Ministry of Defence will operate four broadly equal-sized core helicopter fleets comprising Chinook, Apache, Wildcat  <br>

and Merlin, with much smaller niche fleets for specialised roles. As a result of the measures set out above, we do not intend to proceed with the future medium helicopter competition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="91215m0002.htm_para8"><a name="09121534000432">We anticipate that the reduction in fleet types will produce substantial through-life cost savings over the next decade and beyond. We are also exploring the possibility of further benefits that might arise through, for example, estate rationalisation and the more efficient delivery of training solutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="91215m0002.htm_para9"><a name="09121534000433">Although the major components of this strategy will be subject in due course to separate investment decisions, the new approach represents excellent news for the overall helicopter capability available to our armed forces and provides industry with a clear vision of our investment priorities over the coming decade against which they can align their resources. While a significant percentage of the planned investment will be made on a US product (Chinook), we anticipate that much of the investment required to deliver other elements of the strategy will be made in the UK, supporting UK jobs, and sustaining essential onshore skills as well as delivering value for money.</p>

 Seven months have now passed since the end of the conflict in Sri Lanka. I would like to update the House on developments in the humanitarian and political situation in Sri Lanka.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"><a name="91215m0003.htm_para23"><a name="09121534000484">Since the end of the conflict the UK has focused its efforts on securing an improvement in the humanitarian situation. The end of the fighting in May left over 280,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in camps in northern Sri Lanka. The UK's approach to the situation has been fourfold: to advocate for improvements in conditions in the camps so that they meet international standards; to push for the early and safe return of IDPs to their home areas; to support, with the Department for International Development's (DFID) allocation of £12.5 million since September 2008, the vital work of the humanitarian agencies that have been providing assistance to the IDPs; and to urge the Government of Sri Lanka to allow those not yet resettled to have the ability to enjoy unrestricted freedom of movement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="91215m0003.htm_para24"><a name="09121534000485">Conditions in the camps have improved to the extent that basic needs are now generally being met. In recent weeks there has been some progress in the return of IDPs. As of 6 December, the UN has confirmed that over 158,000 IDPs have been released. Of this number approximately 29,000 vulnerable people had been transferred to host families or institutions. This leaves less than 112,000 people in the Menik farm site and less than 15,000 people in camps in other locations. It is important that IDPs continue to be able to return to their home areas as soon as it is safe to do so. When I spoke to Foreign Minister Bogollogama on 29 October and 4 November, he confirmed that the Government of Sri Lanka was committed to returning those still in the camps. In order to assist this process, the Government have been funding the work of demining non-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as Mines Advisory Group and HALO trust to help make areas safe for return. We will continue to help clear landmines, to provide transport from the camps and to help civilians to restart their lives so they can return home quickly and safely.</p>

We hope this leads to unrestricted freedom of movement for all IDPs as soon as possible. As the Under-Secretary of State for International Development, my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster), made clear in his statement of 28 November, we believe the opening of the camps and granting of real freedom of movement will enable the thousands still living in the camps to start to rebuild their lives. We welcome the fact that a number of national NGOs have now been granted access to some areas where IDPs are returning to such as Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, Mannar and Jaffna in the north. The recent announcement by the Governor of the Northern Province that international NGOs will also be allowed to work in these areas on agreed projects is also welcome. It is imperative that all humanitarian agencies are given full access to all IDPs, including ex combatants, so that they can provide them with the help and protection they need both in the camps and in places of return.</p>

The UK has consistently maintained that one of the prerequisites for lasting peace in Sri Lanka is a political settlement that fully takes into account the legitimate grievances and aspirations of all communities. Presidential elections have now been announced for 26 January 2010. Parliamentary elections in spring 2010 will be a further opportunity for the voice of Sri Lanka's communities to be heard. Free, fair and credible elections will allow Sri Lanka's communities to have their say in shaping the country's future. Adequate arrangements must be made to ensure IDPs can vote in upcoming elections. It is important for all those who want to play a role in Sri Lanka's future to agree to an inclusive political solution that addresses the underlying causes of the conflict.</p>

We therefore welcome President Rajapakse's decision to appoint an independent committee to look into the incidents cited in the US State Department's report. We will continue to press the Government of Sri Lanka to live up to this and his earlier commitment made to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in May to take measures to address possible violations of international humanitarian law.</p>

Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the convention against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the convention on the rights of the child. This report has reinforced our serious concerns over the human rights situation in Sri Lanka and we share the Commission's assessment. The Commission is expected to issue its formal recommendation on Sri Lanka's continued access to the GSP+ scheme shortly. We are clear that, in order to continue enjoying access to the GSP+, Sri Lanka must meet fully its human rights obligations. I have urged the Government of Sri Lanka to take urgent action to address the issues raised by the Commission in its report such as the lack of effective investigations into alleged disappearances and the need to uphold the right to freedom of expression. As EU Foreign Ministers made clear in our conclusions of 27 October, the EU will maintain a dialogue with Sri Lanka on the steps necessary to address the problems highlighted by the Commission's investigation, in order to effectively implement the conventions.</p>

The most important thing for the UK was that the host for each Commonwealth summit demonstrably embodies our shared values-including respect for human rights and democracy. While we welcome the recent progress on freedom of movement for IDPs in Sri Lanka, given our ongoing concerns about the humanitarian and human rights situation at the time, the UK was unable to support Sri Lanka's bid to host CHOGM in 2011.

<p><a name="stpa_386"><a name="91215m0003.htm_para37"><a name="09121534000499">This year's community safety accreditation schemes audit shows an increase in the number of participating forces from 23 in 2008 to 26 this year. The Metropolitan Police was one of the three forces to begin operating a scheme. Over the same period, the number of accredited persons rose from 1406 to 1667 (an 18.5 per cent. rise) and the number of employers with accredited persons rose from 95 to 109. This growth reflects the benefits of the scheme for the police and businesses. Accredited persons help to tackle anti-social behaviour, to provide a visible and reassuring presence on our streets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_387"><a name="91215m0003.htm_para38"><a name="09121534000500">The employers' guide is intended to improve the information available to employers about the scheme and to raise its profile. Four employer case studies (presented in the employers' guide) demonstrate clear benefits, both for the organisation and for the accredited staff, in greater information sharing and closer partnership with the police.</p>

 Section 14(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) requires the Secretary of State to report to Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of every relevant three-month period on the exercise of the control order powers during that period.</p>

Each control order is kept under regular review to ensure that obligations remain necessary and proportionate. The Home Office continues to hold Control Order Review Groups (CORGs) every quarter, with representation from law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to keep the obligations in every control order under regular and formal review and to facilitate a review of appropriate exit strategies. During this reporting period, six CORGs were held in relation to the orders currently in force. In addition, further meetings were held on an ad hoc basis as specific issues arose.</p>

No control orders have been renewed in accordance with section 2(6) of the 2005 Act in this reporting period. In this reporting period there have been six revocations of control orders that were in force. Three control orders were revoked because it was not possible to meet the disclosure test set out in the June 2009 House of Lords judgment (<i>AF &amp; Others</i>) on article 6 of the European convention of human rights (ECHR) (right to a fair trial). One of these orders was not replaced. In the other two cases new non-derogating control orders with significantly reduced obligations  <br>

were imposed in their place; the Government argued before the court that in such cases article 6 was not engaged-or, even if it was, the level of disclosure required in <i>AF &amp; Others</i> did not apply. Two control orders were revoked because they were no longer considered necessary. One control order was revoked on the order of the court. In addition to the six revocations of current control orders, one non-derogating control order previously made but not served was also revoked in this quarter.</p>

One appeal under section 10(1) of the 2005 Act has been lodged with the High Court during this reporting period. A right of appeal is also provided for by section 10(3) of the 2005 Act against decisions by the Secretary of State to refuse a request by a controlled person to revoke their order and/or to modify any obligation under the order.

In the first judgment, handed down on  5 October 2009 in closed only, the court required the Secretary of State to make further disclosure in order to ensure compliance with article 6 despite the court's acknowledgement that the disclosure of this material would cause damage to the public interest. The Secretary of State elected not to make the disclosure identified. Both control orders were revoked and new control orders with significantly reduced obligations were imposed. In the second judgment, handed down on 11 November 2009, the court found that, notwithstanding the new control orders impose less stringent obligations, article 6 applied and that the House of Lords in <i>AF &amp; Others</i> had identified an "irreducible minimum" of disclosure which must be made in all control order cases regardless of the stringency of the obligations. The court granted the Secretary of State permission to appeal and an appeal has been lodged.</p>

The court handed down judgment  in <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v BH</i> on 17 November 2009. The court found that the Secretary of State's decision to refuse to modify BH's geographical boundary to let him attend legal appointment outside his boundary was lawful. This was against the background that the Secretary of State had offered to modify the control order to allow the visit subject to BH agreeing to submit to a personal search as part of a police escort to and from the appointment. BH had refused to agree to this condition and the Secretary of State had therefore refused the modification. The court decided this refusal was lawful, noting that BH's legal representatives were able to visit him within his boundary instead. However, he commented that in circumstances where it would not be proportionate to refuse to modify the boundary for a purpose such as attending an urgent medical appointment, the Secretary of State would not be able to insist that a controlled person be escorted by the police, if the police would not escort the individual without searching him first.</p>

 The Hillsborough tragedy on 15 April 1989 at the FA Cup semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest was the worst disaster in British sporting history.

 The first annual report of the independent Chief Inspector of the UK Border Agency, John Vine, is being laid before Parliament today. The post and role of independent Chief Inspector was created in the Borders Act 2007 and extended in the Borders Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 to reflect the wider role of the new agency. The key focus of the Chief Inspector is the efficiency and effectiveness of the UK Border Agency. The role provides an external, independent and transparent assessment of the Agency and helps to provides reassurance to Parliament and the public. I therefore welcome this account of the first year's work of the Chief Inspector. The annual report sets out the work of the Chief Inspector in establishing his inspection methodology, inspection plan and staffing since the role commenced in July 2008 and summarises the findings from six early inspections.

<p><a name="st_118"><a name="09121583000021"><a name="91215m0004.htm_spmin4"><a name="09121583000123"><b>The Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism (Mr. David Hanson):</b>
 I am today announcing the arrangements we are putting in place to take forward implementation of the national CCTV strategy and to approve an interim CCTV regulator with immediate effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_415"><a name="91215m0004.htm_para17"><a name="09121583000022">CCTV enjoys a high level of public confidence in tackling crime. Home Office research published in 2005 showed that over 80 per cent. of respondents supported the use of CCTV to deal with crime in their neighbourhood. A similar high level of confidence is reflected in the Ipsos MORI poll conducted last year and which we will be publishing shortly. CCTV played a key role in a number of investigations including the London terrorist outrages in July 2005 and the Steven Wright murders in Ipswich as well as offences such as burglaries, robberies, violence and antisocial behaviour across the country. The changes are aimed at ensuring that those involved across the CCTV industry, whether from the public or the private sector, can be actively involved in the development and implementation of national standards on the installation and use of CCTV. Importantly, it also aims to maximise public engagement by raising public awareness of the benefits of CCTV and accountability of owners and users of CCTV systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_416"><a name="91215m0004.htm_para18"><a name="09121583000023">It is important that we retain and build on that high level of public confidence by demonstrating the important contribution to preventing and detecting crime and antisocial behaviour which CCTV can make. We have already announced in Building Britain's Future that we will make sure that local people have a say on the use of CCTV in their area and will be publishing guidance for crime and disorder reduction partnerships next year on communicating with their community on the role of CCTV in public protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_417"><a name="91215m0004.htm_para19"><a name="09121583000024">It is also important that we address public concern about how CCTV is used. I am, therefore, pleased to announce the appointment of the Forensic Science Regulator, Andrew Rennison, as the interim CCTV regulator with immediate effect. The interim CCTV regulator will advise the Government on matters surrounding the use of CCTV in public places, including the need for a regulatory framework overseen by a permanent CCTV regulator, which enables the police, local authorities and other agencies to help deliver safer neighbourhoods while ensuring that personal privacy considerations are appropriately taken into account with supporting safeguards and protections. The establishment of a permanent CCTV regulator would rightly be a matter for Parliament. That is why we are, at this stage, considering the regulatory arrangements function through an interim appointment and the revised governance structure for implementation of the national CCTV strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_418"><a name="91215m0004.htm_para20"><a name="09121583000025">The interim appointment will be for a period of up to 12 months. The appointment is an important step in implementation of the national CCTV strategy. The interim regulator will work with the national CCTV strategy board on six key areas. These are to: develop national standards for the installation and use of CCTV in public space; determine training requirements for users and practitioners; engage with the public and private sector in determining the need for and potential  <br>

content of any regulatory framework; raise public awareness and understanding of how CCTV operates and how it contributes to tackling crime and increasing public protection; review the existing recommendations of the national CCTV strategy and advise the strategy board on implementation, timelines and cost and development of an effective evidence base; and promote public awareness of the complaints process and criteria for complaints to the relevant agencies ( for example, Information Commissioner, local authority or private organisation) or how to deal with complaints relating to technical standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_419"><a name="91215m0004.htm_para21"><a name="09121583000026">The appointment of the Forensic Science Regulator will bring to his CCTV role the expertise, knowledge, and standing he has gained in operating a suitable framework for forensic services. He will play a leading role in identifying and helping meet the needs of both users and the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_420"><a name="91215m0004.htm_para22"><a name="09121583000027">While the interim CCTV regulator will not have responsibility for deciding whether individual cameras are appropriately sited or how they are used, he will be able to help explain to the public how they can complain about intrusive or ineffective CCTV placement or usage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_421"><a name="91215m0004.htm_para23"><a name="09121583000028">Part of the process of promoting greater accountability is engaging directly with key stakeholders. We will shortly be establishing an independent advisory group with representatives from business, CCTV operators, community and third sector groups to monitor and provide direction on implementing the national strategy. The advisory group will advise the interim CCTV regulator and the national CCTV strategy board. These arrangements provide for partnership working at strategic and neighbourhood level. Through these new arrangements, we intend to ensure that CCTV continues to be an important tool available to communities to help tackle crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>

 My noble friend the Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice, has made the following written ministerial statement:</p>
<a name="91215m0005.htm_brev0"><a name="09121583000083"><ul><p class="tabletext">During the debate on 10 December in the House of Lords-on the Commonwealth's shared goals in democracy and development-Baroness Gardner of Parkes asked about eligibility of Commonwealth and Republic of Ireland citizens for membership of the House of Lords. The Government undertook to set out the background to the issue in more detail and to legislate before the end of the current session of Parliament to remove any uncertainty. The Government's firm view is that nothing in the current circumstances prevents any Member of the House of Lords from membership or from taking a full part in the proceedings of the House.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev1"><a name="09121583000084"><ul><p class="tabletext">It was suggested to the Government in April 2009 by the House authorities that the drafting of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 ("the 2006 Act"), and modifications made by that Act to section 3 of the Act of Settlement 1701, could be interpreted to have inadvertently cast doubt on whether Commonwealth and Republic of Ireland citizens are eligible for membership of the House of Lords and to hold certain offices under the Crown.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev2"><a name="09121583000085"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Government have been examining possible interpretations of the changes made by the 2006 Act carefully. Although one possible interpretation would have the effect which has caused concern, this was clearly not the intention of Parliament when passing the 2006 Act, and the Government would disagree with any suggestion that changes should be made in the way that eligibility is regarded.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev3"><a name="09121583000086"><ul><p class="tabletext">The relevant provisions are complex. Section 18 of the 2006 Act included provisions about eligibility for membership of the House of Commons, which were intended to ensure that only persons with indefinite leave to remain in the UK are eligible to be Members of the House of Commons. The Act also extended this provision to elections to the European Parliament, the Greater London Authority, local authorities, and the devolved legislatures. The provision was enacted in response to concerns that elected representatives should be able to serve their term of office in full in the UK. The provision was commenced on 1 January 2007.</p>

</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev5"><a name="09121583000088"><ul><p class="tabletext">This change was made in consequence of the provision at section 18(1) of the Electoral Administration Act 2006, which substituted a new modification of section 3 of the Act of Settlement that applies only for the purposes of membership of the House of Commons: under its terms, Commonwealth citizens who do not have indefinite leave to remain in the UK are prevented from being Members of the House of Commons. However, since the drafting of the legislation did not contain provisions expressly saving the first entry in Schedule 7 to the British Nationality Act 1981 in relation to membership of the House of Lords and other offices under the Crown, a question has been raised about whether the eligibility of Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland citizens for membership of the House of Lords and other positions is affected.</p>

The Senior Salaries Review Body aims to conclude its report by the end of the year. The Senior Salaries Review Body will take into account the cost-saving changes we have made, but its chairman has expressed concern that any proposals by the Government to make further such changes at this time could conflict with the Senior Salaries Review Body's recommendations and might appear to compromise its review. The Government's decision on any further proposals will be taken after the publication of the review. Where applicable, those proposals will be informed by the Senior Salaries Review Body's recommendations and will, in compliance with the House of Commons' resolution of 25 June, have the effect of freezing the Exchequer contribution for 2009-10 at the 2008-09 level as a percentage of payroll.</p>

<a name="91215m0005.htm_brev15"><a name="09121583000098"><ul><p class="tabletext">In December 2008 the then Secretary of State for Transport, the right hon. Member for Ashfield (Geoff Hoon), announced a range of reforms to bus service operators grant (BSOG) to bring this subsidy better into line with Government objectives. As promised in that announcement, we have since been developing the detailed arrangements with stakeholders, and continuing to discuss possible longer-term reforms.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev16"><a name="09121583000099"><ul><p class="tabletext">In April this year the Government introduced two changes to the current BSOG scheme. First, bus operators who have achieved a 6 per cent. improvement in fuel efficiency will receive a 3 per cent. uplift in their BSOG rate from April 2010. Secondly, with effect from April 2009 operators have been able to claim an additional payment of 6 pence for each kilometre operated by a low-carbon bus, per example one that is capable of achieving at least a 30 per cent. reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to a similar size conventional diesel bus.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev17"><a name="09121583000100"><ul><p class="tabletext">I can now confirm the details of two further changes that were first announced in last December's statement and will come into effect in April 2010. From that date operators will receive an 8 per cent. increase in their BSOG rate if they have operational ITSO smartcard systems and, separately, a 2 per cent. increase if they have fitted their buses with GPS equipment. To qualify for the higher rate smartcard equipment will need to accept all English concessionary passes and the incentive will also be linked to accepting integrated ticketing products. To receive either the smartcard or GPS incentive, operators will also have to commit to share specific data with local authorities, central government and other relevant bodies. Together these incentives could be worth around £1,000 in additional grant per bus each year.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev18"><a name="09121583000101"><ul><p class="tabletext">The smartcard and GPS incentives will not apply to London operators. The contractual arrangements for bus services in London already provide the mechanism for securing the outputs that the Government are seeking, such as installation of GPS equipment and availability of GPS data. There is a separate project to enable the Transport for London Oyster network to read ITSO smart cards, to which the Department for Transport has committed £60 million.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev19"><a name="09121583000102"><ul><p class="tabletext">The smartcard incentive is part of a package of measures designed to encourage the introduction of smart and integrated ticketing across the country. These are the subject of a separate announcement today. Encouraging the take up and use of GPS systems will help realise the potential for passengers to receive real-time information about bus services and bus performance.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev20"><a name="09121583000103"><ul><p class="tabletext">I can also announce today our intentions for a more fundamental reform of BSOG which we aim to introduce in the next two to three years.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev21"><a name="09121583000104"><ul><p class="tabletext">As last December's statement made clear, we want our buses to be as green and clean as possible. That is why we are reforming BSOG to ensure it contributes to the Government's strategic objectives, particularly in relation to tackling climate change. Drawing on the results of our consultation in 2008 on options for longer term reform, and from discussions with stakeholders, the Government wish to move away from paying support on the basis of how much fuel is consumed. We will therefore bring forward new arrangements for support on the basis of passenger numbers. This will act to make public transport more attractive thereby delivering environmental benefits through reduced congestion and improved air quality.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev22"><a name="09121583000105"><ul><p class="tabletext">These new arrangements will mean that operators will face the full cost of the fuel they use. This will strengthen the commercial incentives for operators to find ways to reduce their fuel consumption and improve the business case for investment in driver training and low-carbon buses. It also builds on the fuel efficiency target  <br>

and the distance-based payment for use of low-carbon buses that are now part of the current BSOG system.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev23"><a name="09121583000106"><ul><p class="tabletext">The new incentive per passenger arrangements, which build on the work done by the Commission for Integrated Transport, will rely on accurate recording of passenger numbers. This will require audited data of the sort that can be provided through the use of smart ticketing equipment. The move to per passenger payments will therefore be underpinned by the delivery of the Government's smart and integrated ticketing strategy, which has been announced today, and which is itself supported by the new smart ticketing incentive described above. We recognise that it could take up to 10 years for the national bus fleet to be equipped, and we therefore propose a managed transition from BSOG to the new system.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev24"><a name="09121583000107"><ul><p class="tabletext">Introduction of this new form of bus subsidy will also require the approval of the European Commission for reasons of state aid. Given the fundamental nature of the changes that we are proposing, approval is likely to take two to three years. Until the new system has been approved the existing BSOG scheme will continue. Once approval has been given, the per passenger system will be rolled out as quickly as operators can install ITSO smart ticketing systems. The existing fuel-based system will continue in parallel for those operators without smartcard equipment, although the rate of payment may decline over time. Eventually, by around 2020, the BSOG system will end and be replaced entirely by an incentive per passenger.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev25"><a name="09121583000108"><ul><p class="tabletext">We will discuss the detailed implementation of these proposals with members of the Bus Subsidy Advisory Group and with other Government Departments. In particular, we recognise that an incentive per passenger will have different impacts in areas of high and low demand. While the bulk of resources available for bus support will therefore move to an incentive per passenger basis, we will wish to discuss with stakeholders how best to make appropriate arrangements for supporting socially necessary services that become less commercially viable as a result of introducing a per passenger system. This might mean, for example, some of the current BSOG budget being transferred to local authorities.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev26"><a name="09121583000109"><ul><p class="tabletext">It remains our intention as part of these reforms to stop providing BSOG direct to London operators, as announced last December. We will seek to agree detailed arrangements with TfL at the appropriate time.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev27"><a name="09121583000110"><ul><p class="tabletext">The changes I have announced today set the long term direction of changes to bus subsidy and introduce important new incentives to the current system. In summary they will:</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev28"><a name="09121583000111"><ul><p class="tabletext">Provide strong incentives for bus operators further to improve their fuel efficiency, building on the changes introduced in April 2009 which have sent decisive signals to the industry about the need to improve their environmental performance;</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev29"><a name="09121583000112"><ul><p class="tabletext">Give operators real incentives to attract more passengers to their services and out of their cars;</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev30"><a name="09121583000113"><ul><p class="tabletext">Underpin the ticketing strategy also announced today and pave the way for widespread smart ticketing;</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0005.htm_brev31"><a name="09121583000114"><ul><p class="tabletext">Support the take up and use of GPS systems that will increase availability to passengers of real-time information about services and bus performance.</p>

original proposal have been addressed and the Government hope that a satisfactory political agreement can be reached.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_438"><a name="91215m0005.htm_para9"><a name="09121583000055">The Council will be asked to reach a general approach on an amending regulation on structures for the management of the European satellite radio-navigation programmes. The Commission will also give a progress report on the Galileo programme. Regulation 683/2008 significantly changed the role of the Galileo Supervisory Authority (GSA). The amending regulation amends earlier legislation on the GSA to bring it all in line with the 2008 regulation. It changes the name of the body concerned to the European GNSS Agency and gives the European Commission more power in the administrative board. The UK is content that this is a sensible compromise. The UK has been a strong supporter of the need for a security accreditation body which can operate independently. We were also keen that, should the Accreditors take a decision which would significantly increase cost or introduce delay, the Commission cannot overrule them without going to the Council and the Parliament. It would be for Council to decide whether the risk of not doing what the Accreditors wanted was manageable. The Commission and member states have agreed with us that this is a sensible way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_439"><a name="91215m0005.htm_para10"><a name="09121583000056">There will be a progress report on a directive on the deployment of intelligent transport systems (ITS).

<p><a name="stpa_440"><a name="91215m0005.htm_para11"><a name="09121583000057">There will also be a progress report on a proposed directive on aviation security charges. The UK will work towards achieving a fair and proportionate outcome that balances the interests of passengers and airports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_441"><a name="91215m0005.htm_para12"><a name="09121583000058">The Council will be asked to reach a general approach on a directive on reporting formalities for ships arriving in and/or departing from EU ports. The UK supports this measure in principle as it should lead to a streamlining of administrative procedures to be followed by ships. It will be important to ensure that the implementation timetable allows member states sufficient time to adapt existing national systems to the new requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_442"><a name="91215m0005.htm_para13"><a name="09121583000059">The Council will be asked to adopt conclusions following on from the Commission's Communication "A sustainable future for transport: Towards an integrated, technology-led and user friendly system", which was debated by the Council in October. The UK believes the Council conclusions to be a good outcome. They provide the Commission with a clear and useful steer and I expect to be able to sign up to the conclusions at the Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_443"><a name="91215m0005.htm_para14"><a name="09121583000060">The Council will be asked to adopt a decision, authorising the Commission to negotiate an agreement with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), providing a general framework for enhanced co-operation. The UK supports this proposal. There are significant gains to be had from closer co-operation between the Community and ICAO, notably in the field of aviation safety. The presidency has made clear that the draft mandate does not affect relations between individual member states and ICAO, nor does it affect the arrangements for preparing Community positions for meetings of the ICAO Council.</p>

 My right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State for Transport has made the following ministerial statement:</p>
<a name="91215m0006.htm_brev0"><a name="09121583000115"><ul><p class="tabletext">I am today announcing the launch of the Government's smart and integrated ticketing strategy.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0006.htm_brev1"><a name="09121583000116"><ul><p class="tabletext">The strategy follows a consultation which ran for 10 weeks from August this year and sought views on the Government's emerging vision for smart and integrated ticketing across public transport in England. The consultation was well received, with over 120 responses, and there was strong support for the emerging vision although also a strong message that Government needed to set out a clear roadmap for delivery.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0006.htm_brev2"><a name="09121583000117"><ul><p class="tabletext">Our research suggests that smart and integrated ticketing could bring overall benefits of over £1 billion per year and could significantly improve the offer to the passenger through reduced queuing times, removal of the need to carry cash and the provision of seamless journeys.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0006.htm_brev3"><a name="09121583000118"><ul><p class="tabletext">We have incorporated 27 specific Government commitments in the strategy. Key commitments include £20 million of funding to be awarded to nine of the largest urban areas in England (outside London) in order to bring smart ticketing to the greatest number of people most quickly; a change to bus operators' grant (BSOG) which is the subject of a separate announcement today and which will reward operators who equip their buses with smart ticketing infrastructure with an 8 per cent. increase in grant; consideration of possible legislation if insufficient progress has been made in the roll-out of integrated ticketing; and the creation of a dedicated smart and integrated ticketing team within the Department of Transport to co-ordinate delivery of the strategy from a central point.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0006.htm_brev4"><a name="09121583000119"><ul><p class="tabletext">The strategy includes a timetable for delivery, which though challenging, I believe is achievable. Our immediate goal is to see integrated multi-modal smart ticketing schemes, similar to the Oyster scheme in London but using the ITSO specification, in England's major urban areas by 2015. We expect that urban schemes will provide a base from which further expansion can occur, and anticipate that that there will be some local integrated ITSO smart ticketing schemes in every area of the country by 2020. The Department will also continue to put smart ticketing requirements into the rail franchises as they come up for renewal.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0006.htm_brev5"><a name="09121583000120"><ul><p class="tabletext">Longer term, our aim is to see customers possibly being given a choice of ticketing media, potentially including bank cards and mobile phones and improved links between ticketing and information provision to make public transport use an easier and more attractive option to passengers.</p>
</ul><a name="91215m0006.htm_brev6"><a name="09121583000121"><ul><p class="tabletext">The successful delivery of the strategy will depend upon partnership working to ensure that schemes meet the needs of the passengers. In the strategy, the Department lays out the roles envisaged for principal stakeholders; ITSO, the local transport authorities, local transport operators, train operating companies and suppliers. We recognise that we cannot deliver the strategy without the support of all these key stakeholders and I look forward to working with them to ensure that we meet our commitments as soon as possible.</p>

country is better prepared for similar severe events in future. To this end, the then Secretary of State for Transport, my right hon. Friend the Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon), commissioned the UK Roads Liaison Group (UKRLG) to conduct a review of the difficulties experienced in the operation of winter maintenance service at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_445"><a name="91215m0006.htm_para1"><a name="09121583000064">The UKRLG published its report on 4 August (available from the Libraries of both Houses or from: www.ukroadsliaisongroup.org), and I am grateful for the thorough way in which it reviews events. The report makes 19 recommendations, and I am pleased to announce today that the Government have accepted them all, which together should improve our preparedness to face up to the challenges presented by severe winter weather in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_446"><a name="91215m0006.htm_para2"><a name="09121583000065">Most of the recommendations are addressed to local highway authorities and salt suppliers. It is, of course, for each authority to consider these and decide for themselves how best to take them forward. I commend them to authorities' attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_447"><a name="91215m0006.htm_para3"><a name="09121583000066">The report addresses four recommendations specifically to the Department for Transport and the Highways Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_448"><a name="91215m0006.htm_para4"><a name="09121583000067">First, it recommends that the Highways Agency should hold a reserve of salt above that which it needs to meet its service standards, in order to reduce overall demand for salt at critical times. In addition to supporting the UKRLG review, the agency has carried out its own internal exercise to identify those areas of its business which may be improved, to further strengthen its winter service resilience. A number of improvements have been identified and implemented, including a review of the salt stock levels that will be held across the strategic road network in England. The agency has previously implemented a risk-based approach to set its salt stock levels each year. By identifying and considering the impact of issues which may affect salt supplies and associated stock levels, a suitable salt stock profile for each of the agency's operational areas is derived for the winter season ahead. The increased risk of a salt shortage similar to that experienced last season has been considered when setting the salt stock profiles for this winter season, in order to increase the agency's salt stock resilience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_449"><a name="91215m0006.htm_para5"><a name="09121583000068">UKRLG further recommend that the Department should publish an information leaflet for highway authority elected members and senior managers on preparation for severe winter conditions. We have produced such a leaflet and have arranged for this to be distributed today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_450"><a name="91215m0006.htm_para6"><a name="09121583000069">The report proposes that the Department should make preparations to enable rapid introduction of derogation against drivers' hours regulations for specific categories of vehicles and drivers if necessary in times of severe adverse weather conditions. We agree with the recommendation that it is important to implement such derogations quickly, when the need has been identified. We believe that the Department's response in February was as swift as was possible; but we will review our processes to ensure that we remain ready to deal with applications for derogation as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_451"><a name="91215m0006.htm_para7"><a name="09121583000070">UKRLG considered the operation of the centrally co-ordinated Salt Cell that was set up in February. The report concludes that the possibility of a future Government-run Salt Cell should only be considered as  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="15 Dec 2009">

<notus-date day="15" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>15 Dec 2009 : Column 124WS</b><br>
a matter of last resort, but that the Government should develop a contingency plan for any future Salt Cell, to be used in extremis. I again accept the recommendation. My Department is working with a number of stakeholders, both within and without Government, to develop robust protocols against such an eventuality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_452"><a name="91215m0006.htm_para8"><a name="09121583000071">Co-operation and co-ordination between highways authorities and suppliers will be a key component in better management of winter service in the future, however severe the weather. The Highways Agency had already identified the need to develop a closer relationship with its salt supply chain partners. A strategic Salt Liaison Group (SLG) has been established, to discuss issues affecting salt usage and supply for the strategic network. Local highway authorities may wish to reflect on how similar arrangements might benefit them. As part of its own review of lessons learnt, the agency also highlighted the need for improved communications to give earlier warning of any developing salt supply issues. Again, local authorities may wish to consider how they can implement a more precautionary, focused dialogue with salt suppliers in the same way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_453"><a name="91215m0006.htm_para9"><a name="09121583000072">There is already good communication between the Highways Agency and local authorities, and the agency shares a number of depots with local authorities. As well as the cost efficiencies associated with depot-sharing, it can provide access to the network at operationally important locations that may not otherwise be available. The Highways Agency recognises the importance of depot-sharing in providing a cost-effective solution to planning and maintaining an effective winter service. However, depots are often not suitable for sharing either on account of their location, their size or other operational constraints. Each proposal therefore needs to be considered on its individual merits, to ensure that service delivery for both authorities will not be compromised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_454"><a name="91215m0006.htm_para10"><a name="09121583000073">While no system can be completely resilient in extreme circumstances, adopting the UKRLG's recommendations should help the nation to be better prepared should weather conditions similar to this past winters be encountered in future.</p>
