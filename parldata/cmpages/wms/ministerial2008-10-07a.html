 On 3 October 2008 the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child published their Concluding Observations on the United Kingdom&#146;s report on the implementation of the United Nations convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). Publication of the Concluding Observations follows the submission of the UK Government&#146;s written report to the Committee in July 2007 and an Oral Hearing with the Committee on 23 and 24 September 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="81007m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08100730000023">The United Kingdom&#146;s delegation entered into a frank and open discussion with the Committee. This was recognised both in the Committee&#146;s closing remarks at the Oral Hearing and the Concluding Observations. I am pleased that the Committee has also recognised the significant progress we have made in the implementation of the convention and the emphasis we have placed on improving the well-being of children and young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="81007m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08100730000024">I broadly welcome the Concluding Observations and, while areas of difference with the Committee remain, we will give the Committee&#146;s recommendations the careful consideration they deserve. This process will include a dialogue with non-governmental organisations and the four United Kingdom Children&#146;s Commissioners. Our &#147;Children&#146;s Plan&#148;, published in December 2007, sets out our ambitions and strategies to tackle many of the issues the UN Committee has highlighted. Later this year we will report on progress against the commitments made in the children&#146;s plan.</p>

 As I told the House on 20 May 2008, we have published a consultation document, inviting views on whether or not we should, subject to parliamentary approval, move the date of the English local elections from Thursday 7 May 2009 to Thursday 4 June 2009, the same day as the European parliamentary election. That consultation closed on 11 August and we have received 278 representations, including from the Electoral Commission, the Association of Electoral Administrators, the Local Government Association, many of the councils that would be affected and a number of the political parties.</p>

A number of consultees also made representations about various practical measures they believe we should take if the date of the local elections is to be moved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="81007m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08100730000028">Having carefully considered all the representations received I am also today laying a draft Local Elections (Ordinary Day of Elections in 2009) Order 2008 which, if approved by Parliament and made no later than 7 November 2008, would move the local election day in England, in 2009, to the date of the European parliamentary election, planned for Thursday 4 June. The order also makes incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as a consequence of that change of date, including provision for the European elections in England in 2009 to be administered on local government boundaries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="81007m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08100730000029">The local elections that would be affected by this change of date are the elections to all county councils in two-tier areas, the unitary Isle of Wight county council, Bristol city council and the new unitary councils of Bedford, Central Bedfordshire, Cornwall, Shropshire and Wiltshire; a limited number of parish councils and the mayoral elections in Doncaster, Hartlepool, North Tyneside and Stoke.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="81007m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08100730000030">We believe that avoiding elections on two separate occasions within a month will be more convenient for voters, less costly for the taxpayer and more efficient for electoral administrators.

The Service Discipline Acts, which have provided the legal basis for discipline in the armed forces since the 1950s, will be repealed in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="81007m0001.htm_para9"><a name="08100730000035">The transitional provisions that will provide the essential bridge between the three Service Discipline Acts and the Armed Forces Act 2006 have proved more difficult and complex than was envisaged in our original planning. The main reason for this is because the provisions contained in the older legislation have all been amended, often piecemeal, over a period of several decades. The result is a complex web of legislation that applies, sometimes in different ways, to each of the armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="81007m0001.htm_para10"><a name="08100730000036">The legislation will be brought into effect in October 2009. We do, however, plan to maintain momentum by making the necessary legislative changes to enable the director of service prosecutions, created under the Armed Forces Act 2006, to prosecute all cases under the existing Service Discipline Acts from 1 January 2009. We will bring before Parliament in the autumn the necessary secondary legislation to achieve this.</p>
