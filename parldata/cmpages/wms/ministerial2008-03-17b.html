 I am today publishing a joint consultation document with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills that proposes to put local authorities in the lead in delivering our drive to raise the participation age and sets out plans to reform the skills landscape.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="80317m0001.htm_para0"><a name="0803178000016">We want every 16 and 17-year-old to participate in education and training. And we want every adult to have the chance to improve their skills to get a job, a better job, or have a more successful economic life. In this document we set out our proposals for moving &#163;7 billion of funding for education and training of 16 to 18-year-olds to local authorities while establishing a new Skills Funding Agency to fund skills development for adults. We have been working closely with our colleagues in the Learning and Skills Council, with the Local Government Association and with the Association of Directors of Children&#146;s Services. These proposals set out our recommended models for consultation ahead of legislative proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="80317m0001.htm_para1"><a name="0803178000017">The key proposals in the document will help to deliver our ambition to raise the participation age and transform attainment by age 19 and underpin our  aim of a demand-led system and the integration of employment and skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="80317m0001.htm_para2"><a name="0803178000018">Local authorities are in the best place to lead the implementation of the new participation age locally. They are already responsible for schools and are taking responsibility for advising young people. We are now giving them new duties to ensure that the right range of provision is in place for young people to continue in education or training until age 19 and for funding it. In doing so, we are making sure that they have the ability to deliver in full the new curriculum and qualifications entitlement for young people, and to raise standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="80317m0001.htm_para3"><a name="0803178000019">The consultation document sets out how, for young people, we aim to place leadership of the system, accountability for outcomes, duties and the funding to deliver, at a local level&#151;local authorities will have the responsibility and duties to deliver for everyone from birth to 19. Our proposals include:</p>
<a name="80317m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="0803178000020"><ul><p class="tabletext">Giving local authorities the responsibility for ensuring clear local leadership to ensure that every young person is pursuing a programme which engages them and prepares them for life, including young people to the age of 25 with learning difficulties and or disabilities. This includes responsibility for delivering the full entitlement to a choice from the 17 new diplomas, an apprenticeship place and the foundation learning tier, for learners working below level 2.</p>

The NAS will be a discrete, coherent service, led by a director reporting to the Secretaries of State of DCSF and DIUS, and managed at first within the Learning and Skills Council and then the Skills Funding Agency;</p>

Whilst the current landscape has worked well, with the LSC playing a particularly critical role supporting the achievements of young people and adults since 2001, the ever-increasing pace of change means that the skills landscape must change if we are to achieve the skills challenges. With almost three quarters of the workforce of 2020 already out of compulsory education, we need to make sure the skills landscape can respond to the demands of adults and employers.</p>

 I would like to update the House on progress on steps which have been taken to strengthen the vetting and barring system, and on commitments made in respect of List 99 by my predecessors, my right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="80317m0001.htm_para11"><a name="0803178000048">The safety of children and young people is our top priority. We are committed to ensuring we have the toughest ever vetting and barring system for all those working with, or seeking to work with, children and vulnerable adults. The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act, which received Royal Assent on 8 November 2006, introduces further fundamental strengthening of the arrangements for the vetting and barring of individuals employed with children and vulnerable adults. This will incorporate a robust, independent and expert barring process and will provide a modern and improved vetting service for employers, including parents.</p>

These regulations, which amended the Education (Prohibition from Teaching or Working with Children) Regulations 2003, extended the range of offences which will result in automatic inclusion on List 99 to include cautions as well as convictions for sexual offences against children. These changes have ensured that anyone aged 18 or over who is convicted of, or cautioned for, a relevant offence from 28 February 2007 will be automatically included on the list regardless of whether there is evidence that they have been in previous employment in the education and children&#146;s workforce. For the most serious offences individuals are barred without the right to make representations. In other cases individuals are able to make representations, but continue to be barred from employment as teachers or school workers while these are considered.</p>

Full, single central records for all staff were required to be in<i></i>place from 1 April 2007. The existence of an up-to-date record in every school, available for inspection by Ofsted, will help to ensure that schools have carried out and recorded all the checks, including List 99 and CRB checks, on staff properly.</p>

Friend the Member for Bolton, West. In particular he referred to 56 cases where Ministers or officials had decided not to include an individual on List 99. My predecessor confirmed that all of these individuals had been followed up and that one individual was barred. In addition, he also referred to 32 cases of individuals who were on the sex offenders&#146; register, but had not previously been referred to the Department by the police.

Sir Roger Singleton and his panel would examine those cases which, had the sex offenders&#146; register existed, would have resulted in the individual&#146;s inclusion on the register and all cases involving a sexual offence or allegation which resulted in a decision not to include on List 99 or in a restriction or partial bar. My predecessor also asked Sir Roger to include all cases where there were sexual allegations between 1997 and 2005 in addition to all cases involving sexual offences or allegations before 1997. The aim of this was to establish whether any individual posed a risk of harm to children and if any action should be taken.

These cases have been examined and, where appropriate, enquiries made in order to gather additional information from police and other sources. My predecessor reported that in 42 of the 210 cases there is no indication of any sexual offence or allegation, and in one case the person concerned was deceased. These cases are closed. My predecessor also reported that there were 12 cases where, as a result of further enquiries, the partial bar had been changed to a full bar. I can now report that as a result of additional police information the partial bar has been changed to a full bar in 4 more cases, a total of 16. One further individual is deceased.

Friend the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis), announcing additional Department of Health (DH) funding for prison clinical drug treatment. &#163;12.7 million was invested in 2007-08, this will rise to &#163;24.4 million (actual) in 2008-09, &#163;39 million (indicative) in 2009-10 and &#163;43 million (indicative) in 2010-11. This additional funding, further developing the integrated drug treatment system (IDTS) in prisons, is aimed at improving the volume and quality of drug treatment with a particular emphasis on the first 28 days in custody and better integration with the community services to which most drug-misusing prisoners will return.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="80317m0004.htm_para1"><a name="0803178000446">We are also pleased to announce that a national prison drug treatment review group will be established to oversee the continued development of prison drug treatment, informed by recommendations arising from a review of prison drug treatment funding conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="80317m0004.htm_para2"><a name="0803178000447">We are pleased that Professor Lord Kamlesh Patel from the university of Central Lancashire has agreed to chair this group which will consider the PwC recommendations in more detail, agree a single set of priorities and compile national guidance around the streamlining of the commissioning, delivery, funding and performance management of drug treatment for offenders. Lord Patel has made an important contribution both in his role as chairman on the Mental Health Commission and as a non-executive director on the board of the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="80317m0004.htm_para3"><a name="0803178000448">Considerable progress has already been made&#151;funding for prison treatment has increased year on year (up 1008 per cent. since 1996-97), prison drug treatment services have developed rapidly in the past few years with record numbers engaged in treatment. However at the same time, delivery systems had become increasingly complex. In May 2007 the Secretary of State for Health and the then Home Secretary requested an urgent review of the use of existing resources for drug treatment in prisons. The objective of the review was to explore how existing resources could be used more effectively to ensure that that prison drug treatment services reduced re-offending and met the treatment needs for prisoners throughout their time in custody and in preparation for their release.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="80317m0004.htm_para4"><a name="0803178000449">PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed to undertake the review and their report was received in December 2007.

improvements, with many examples of excellent practice. But the report also identified the lack of a clear inter-departmental strategy; fragmented organisational arrangements for funding, commissioning, performance management and delivery of services; the lack of a clear evidence base for some services currently offered; and inefficiencies and gaps in services. The report recommended eight steps which should now be taken to build upon and improve the delivery of drug services to offenders in prison and to extract better value from the considerable resources invested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="80317m0004.htm_para5"><a name="0803178000450">The principal recommendation is to set up a national offender drug strategy group to commission a series of projects that would:</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health and I have today received Dame Carol Black&#146;s review of the health of Britain&#146;s working age population, &#147;Working for a Healthier Tomorrow&#148;, commissioned by our Departments last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="80317m0004.htm_para7"><a name="0803178000460">The report sets out the impact of working age ill-health and the scale of the challenge ahead of us. Ill-health among working age people impacts on many of our key priorities, such as eradicating child poverty, achieving full employment, tackling health inequalities and creating a strong and successful economy. While we have done much across government on this agenda over the past few years, there is clearly more still to do. This is the focus of today&#146;s review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="80317m0004.htm_para8"><a name="0803178000461">The Government welcome the review and will consider Dame Carol&#146;s findings carefully. Over the coming months we will study her recommendations closely and will develop detailed proposals to make a real difference. This work will support our wider challenge of ensuring that the NHS becomes more than just a treatment service for patients who are ill, but helps to keep people healthy and prevent ill-health from occurring too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="80317m0004.htm_para9"><a name="0803178000462">While it will take some time to develop this package of measures, I can today set out the immediate steps we are taking to ensure that 2008 marks a step change in the way we approach the health of the working age population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="80317m0004.htm_para10"><a name="0803178000463">Dame Carol has flagged up that employee access to occupational health is often poor and there needs to be increased support for smaller employers. We can today announce that we are taking a next small step to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). An &#163;11 million capital fund is being established to allow us to set up six new NHS Plus demonstration sites to look at innovative ways of supporting SMEs with occupational health services, adding to the five demonstration sites we established last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="80317m0004.htm_para11"><a name="0803178000464">Meanwhile, we recognise that early intervention is crucial to helping people with health conditions stay in work and preventing milder health conditions from worsening. Therefore we will also be looking at the best way of exploring Dame Carol&#146;s suggestion of a &#147;Fit for Work&#148; service for people in the early stages of sickness absence. Any such pilot will be evaluated to assess the benefits to individuals and businesses and the level of potential savings which could support the costs. There may also be the opportunity for employers to contribute to such a service if it were found to be effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="80317m0004.htm_para12"><a name="0803178000465">We are also committed to improving the support for those people who do fall out of work on to benefits. The new employment and support allowance and the significant investment we are making in Pathways to Work will help many new benefit recipients to return to work and fulfil their potential. I am also committed to helping those people who are currently on incapacity benefit. While they can already volunteer for the support available through Pathways, it is my ambition that, over time and as resources permit, we transfer everyone on incapacity benefit to the employment and support allowance. We will also look to apply a more active approach to existing incapacity benefit claimants as well as new ones, starting with those under 25. We will explore using a new funding mechanism to reward private and voluntary sector specialist providers for investing in helping long-term incapacity benefits claimants to return to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="80317m0005.htm_para0"><a name="0803178000466">We will also ensure that, from 2010, all existing incapacity benefit customers will have the new work  <br>

capability assessment applied when their entitlement to benefit is due to be reassessed. The new test will be a more accurate assessment of functional ability, reflecting the activities needed in today&#146;s workplace, and looking at what people can do, as well as what they cannot do. In particular the new test will include a more extensive and fairer assessment of mental function.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="80317m0005.htm_para1"><a name="0803178000467">Dame Carol rightly points out that mental ill-health represents a key challenge for Government. As such, supporting people with mental health conditions will be a central element of the Government response, with our proposed national strategy on mental health and work forming part of the package. The development of the strategy will be led in part by Dame Carol herself, working closely with stakeholders in this area. As we develop this strategy we will assess the effectiveness of existing programmes and treatments on people with mental health conditions. We will also consider the findings of the Royal College of Psychiatrists report, &#147;Mental Health and Work&#148;, commissioned to support Dame Carol&#146;s review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="80317m0005.htm_para2"><a name="0803178000468">We are also committed to ensuring that our &#147;Pathways to Work&#148; and &#147;Improving Access to Psychological Therapies&#148; (IAPT) programmes are aligned as they are rolled out across the country, ensuring that people receive mental health and employment support in a joined-up fashion. I can today also announce that DWP will provide funding to test placing private or voluntary sector advisers in the IAPT programme, offering employment advice to working age people receiving therapy, whether in employment or not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="80317m0005.htm_para3"><a name="0803178000469">The measures I have set out today are our first steps in the journey set out by Dame Carol. We are committed to making this journey and radically improving the health of working age people. We want to help more people to enter or remain in work and establish healthier workplaces as the norm, with an ultimate ambition of good jobs for all. Success in this agenda will benefit individuals, families, communities, businesses and the economy as a whole.</p>
