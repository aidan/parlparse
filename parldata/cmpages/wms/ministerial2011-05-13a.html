               <b>The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Mrs Caroline Spelman):</b>
 The protection of the welfare of performing wild animals in circuses is a matter that the Government take very seriously. Rigorous standards for the protection of animals kept by man are already set in the Animal Welfare Act 2006 but there are a few areas—including the use of wild animals in travelling circuses—where additional safeguards are necessary.</p>

               <a name="11051345000021"> The Austrian Government have recently been taken to court for their attempt to ban wild animals in circuses. This Government want to take action as soon as possible to protect wild animals in circuses without waiting for the outcome of that judgment. For this reason we propose to introduce a strict licensing regime using powers provided under the 2006 Act.</p>

            <p>corporate hospitality services for the whole Government, and has done so for over 80 years. It is administered by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. As part of its functions it includes a wine cellar. On 18 June 2010 my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs instituted a thorough review of the cellar’s functions to ensure that the purchase, retention and use of wines and spirits for official Government events hosted by senior members of Government was appropriate to the contemporary environment and would provide value for money for the taxpayer.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_14"> 
               <a name="110513m0001.htm_para14"> 
               <a name="11051345000031"> That review has now finished. It concluded that retaining a Government wine cellar remains the most cost-effective way to supply wine for Government hospitality functions and state banquets, but that substantial reform was needed.</p>

               <a name="11051345000032"> The management of the cellar will be reformed in the following ways, ensuring that the provision of wine for Government hospitality is entirely self-financing for the lifetime of this Parliament:</p>

            <p class="tabletext">We will conduct targeted sales of high-value stock in order to pay for future purchases.</p>
            <a name="11051345000052"> 
            <p class="tabletext">There will be an annual statement to Parliament on the use of the wine cellar, covering consumption, stock purchases, costs, and value for money. I am arranging to have placed in the Library of the House such a report for the financial year 2009-2010. A report on the cellar’s operations in 2010-2011 and subsequent years will be placed in the Library of the House during the month of May following the end of the appropriate financial year.</p>
            <a name="11051345000053"> 
            <p class="tabletext">The former Government Hospitality Advisory Committee for the Purchase of Wine, ceased to be a non-departmental public body in October 2010. We have agreed with its members that Government Hospitality will continue to benefit from the expertise of the Committee on an ad hoc basis. I should like to record my thanks to the members of the Committee for their agreement to continue this unpaid expert advice.</p>

It will help us to work more closely together on sharing information and formulating our policy towards Libya. This arrangement does not affect our position on the legal status of the NTC: the British Government will continue to recognise States, not Governments. The UK will also strengthen its presence in eastern Libya when our new Permanent Head of Office in Benghazi John Jenkins arrives in the near future.</p>

               <a name="11051345000041"> As the law currently stands, section 9 of the Race Relations Act 1976 provides that it is not unlawful for seafarers to be paid different rates of pay on the basis of their nationality if they were recruited outside Great Britain. This includes seafarers from EEA states and designated states, which are states with particular bilateral agreements with the European Union. The European Commission has been investigating a complaint that UK law does not comply with European Law and in January this year it issued a reasoned opinion on that basis. In order to meet its treaty obligations, the Government are obliged to bring UK law into line with European law.</p>

The Government are already committed to the Equality Act, most of which, including part 5, was commenced on 1 October 2010. The international nature of the shipping industry requires further clarity in specifying to which seafarers, working on which vessels, operating in which waters, part 5 of the Act applies. The relevant provisions legislate in respect of employment, offering protection from discrimination, harassment and victimisation in relation to certain protected characteristics,  <br/>

The regulations will, if approved, provide that it is not unlawful to offer to pay or pay different rates of pay to seafarers (applicants, employees and contract workers), other than those from EEA or designated states, if a person applies for work as a seafarer or is recruited as a seafarer outside Great Britain.</p>

If differential pay were challenged by a seafarer from an EEA or  <br/>
