               <b>The Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Mr David Gauke):</b>
 Sir Richard Scott undertook an inquiry following the collapse, in 1992, of the trial of a UK company known as Matrix Churchill for the alleged supply of prohibited weapons components to Iraq. In the course of his studies Sir Richard identified an instance where a visit to a company by HM Customs and Excise (HMCE), ostensibly for a VAT audit, had been used to see if the company was involved in the supply of components for weapons. Sir Richard thought this covert action amounted to unlawful trespassing, as the primary concern of the visit was a non-VAT matter, and recommended against its use. HMCE accepted the recommendation and reported this to Parliament on 25 June 1996. This voluntary forbearance is known as the “Scott undertaking” and it has been the HMCE, now HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), policy position ever since.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_0"> 
               <a name="110905m0001.htm_para0"> 
               <a name="1109051000022"> The Scott undertaking, restricting certain covert activity by HMCE and now HMRC criminal investigators, was made at a time when there was no human rights compliant legislation allowing covert entry on to property. This changed with the enactment of the Police Act 1997.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_1"> 
               <a name="110905m0001.htm_para1"> 
               <a name="1109051000023"> The Police Act 1997 regulatory regime now in place provides a legal framework for the type of covert activity identified by Sir Richard. The process is sufficiently robust to ensure that such covert investigation activity is only used in the most serious cases when the tests of necessity and proportionality are met. The action is authorised by a designated authorising officer and the activity then approved by the Office of Surveillance Commissioners.</p>
            <br/>

               <a name="1109051000025"> As a result, the undertaking given by HMCE following the Scott report has been overtaken by the Police Act 1997 and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. But because HMRC continues to observe the Scott undertaking, legitimate investigation activity is not being used.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_4">

               <a name="1109051000026"> In September 2009 this issue was raised with the inspectors of the Office of Surveillance Commissioners during their annual inspection of HMRC. The chief surveillance commissioner, Sir Christopher Rose, subsequently considered the issue and concluded that HMRC’s adherence to the Scott undertaking served no useful purpose and was likely to inhibit otherwise proper, human rights compliant, investigative processes. Sir Christopher wrote to the director of criminal investigation on 6 January 2010 setting out this position and expressing his support for steps to release HMRC from its undertaking to adhere to the Scott recommendation.</p>

The UK continues to be at the forefront of the world’s response—I can report that Britain was one of the first donors to step forward with significant funds. Following my announcement on 17 August of an additional £29 million for Somalia, our contribution across the horn stands at £124.29 million, which we estimate will provide assistance to over 3 million people. We are the second largest bilateral donor behind the US. These funds have been reallocated from elsewhere in Britain’s development budget. The British public, too, is showing incredible compassion and commitment, raising more than £57 million through the Disasters Emergency Committee East Africa appeal.</p>

Many of those who are still strong enough have fled—to Mogadishu, where I witnessed at first hand the depth of the crisis a few weeks ago—and to camps in Ethiopia and Kenya. When I visited Dadaab in north-eastern Kenya in July, I saw how agencies have struggled to keep up with the flow of new arrivals. The camps there represent the biggest concentration of refugees anywhere in the world.</p>

               <a name="1109051000101"> While Somalia remains our chief concern, the situation in Ethiopia and Kenya is also deeply worrying. More people are affected by the crisis in Ethiopia than any other country in the region; according to Government figures, 4.56 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. Ethiopia hosts 240,000 refugees—over 75,000 from Somalia arriving this year. In Kenya, the worst affected areas are in the northern and eastern arid and semi-arid lands; over 500,000 children and pregnant and breastfeeding women are suffering from acute malnutrition.</p>

Over the weekend, 20,000 Sudanese refugees crossed into Ethiopia fleeing violence in eastern Sudan. And in the worst affected parts of Somalia, insecurity means that many of those in most need cannot be reached. Officials in my Department are working closely with a small number of well-established and trusted agencies that can deliver effectively on the ground, ensuring aid reaches those it is intended for.</p>

Relief efforts are now reaching more people every week, but although donor support and the volume of assistance in the pipeline have increased significantly, there remain serious gaps.
