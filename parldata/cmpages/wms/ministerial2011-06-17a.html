               <a name="11061736000045"> The General Affairs Council will help prepare the June European Council, which takes place in Brussels on 23-24 June 2011. The agenda will cover migration, Croatian accession and economic policy. On the latter point there will be an update by the Commission about the national reform programmes, submitted by member states in April. In this context there may also be a discussion about growth-enhancing structural reforms, following the commitments made by member states at the March European Council. There may also be discussion on the eurozone crisis and the latest situation in the middle east and north Africa. The Council is expected to approve conclusions about the Danube strategy and the integration of Roma communities.</p>

The Foreign Affairs Council adopted conclusions in May (see link below) which set out actual performances against EU aid targets (0.7% of EU gross national income by 2015).</p>

               <a name="11061736000054"> CQC is the independent regulator of health and adult social care in England. All providers of a regulated activity are required to register with the CQC. In order to be registered and to remain registered, providers are required to comply with a set of registration requirements that establish the essential levels of safety and quality.</p>

               <a name="11061736000055"> Where a registered provider fails to meet these registration requirements the CQC has a range of enforcement powers that it can use to bring about improvements. In the case of persistent and/or serious failings, the CQC has the power to stop providers operating.</p>

               <a name="11061736000058"> In April 2012, providers of primary medical care are due to enter the registration system. This covers providers of primary medical care services for the NHS including GP practices, out-of-hours primary care services and NHS walk-in centres. This final wave comprises registration of around 8,000 providers.</p>

               <a name="11061736000059"> We have reconsidered the timing of the registration of primary medical services providers for the NHS and believe there are strong reasons to move the start date for the registration for most of these providers to April 2013.</p>

               <a name="11061736000060"> Postponing the registration of most primary medical services providers for the NHS will afford the opportunity to ensure that, when it does go ahead, the CQC’s systems, tools and processes will have been refined in the light of the experience of the earlier registration rounds and piloting with primary medical services providers.</p>

               <a name="11061736000063"> The Government have made a commitment to bring out-of-hours providers into registration at the earliest opportunity. I am therefore proposing that the registration of dedicated providers of out-of-hours care should go ahead as planned, in April 2012, together with registration of NHS walk-in centres which do not provide primary care to a list of registered patients.</p>

               <a name="11061736000067"> There will be two round-table discussions at this meeting. The first will be a policy debate on the Commission’s proposal for Council recommendations on member states’ employment policies. I will stress that the United Kingdom wishes to strike the right balance, between acknowledging the Commission’s right to propose these recommendations to all member states, and ensuring Council’s input to the final text. Ownership by Council, with recommendations reflecting national priorities, will best secure the commitment of member states to deliver, and challenge each other, on the pace and depth of our labour market and welfare reforms.</p>

I will highlight the UK’s policy approaches and stress that while European Union level-discussion can help to inform national decisions, this is not an area of policy that will ever lend itself to a “one-size-fits-all” approach. Discussion at European Union level needs to take account of the individual contexts in different member states and member state competence in this area.</p>

Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 on the co-ordination of social security systems (Miscellaneous Amendments) is also on the agenda for a progress report. I will acknowledge progress made on this dossier, and make a statement about the importance of clarifying the interaction between the social security co-ordination and the free movement directive.
