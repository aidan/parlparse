<p><a name="st_105"><a name="08061893000020"><a name="80618m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="08061893000086"><b>The Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):</b>
 My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business and Competitiveness (Baroness Vadera) has made the following statement:</p>
<a name="80618m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08061893000021"><ul><p class="tabletext">Further to the written statement concerning the positions I intended to take at the Telecommunications Council held on 12 June 2008, I am pleased to be able to report back on the main conclusions and topics of discussion.</p>
</ul><a name="80618m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="08061893000022"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Telecommunications Council took place on 12 June 2008 under the chair of the Slovenian presidency, where I represented the United Kingdom. As expected, the Commission review of the electronic telecommunications framework was the main focus and the discussion was based around three questions, set by the presidency, on next generation networks (NGN), institutional arrangements and spectrum.</p>
</ul><a name="80618m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="08061893000023"><ul><p class="tabletext">After an introduction from Commissioner Reding, there was a full exchange of views on the review with nearly all member states participating. There was a general acceptance on a need to embrace market mechanisms on spectrum, and also that functional separation is a useful remedy of last resort to encourage competition. There were, however, some negative views being expressed about Commission powers and the need for a single European Electronic Communications Market Authority. On next generation networks, there was general support for a predictable regulatory framework that would encourage investments by operators.</p>
</ul><a name="80618m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="08061893000024"><ul><p class="tabletext">I intervened to support the Commissioner&#146;s aim of reaching early agreement on the review amongst member states and with the European Parliament. I noted the importance of NGN, and stressed the importance of competition in ensuring successful introduction. I emphasised that the UK did not support regulatory holidays to promote the introduction of new services, and that there was clear evidence of the success of functional separation in the UK. I supported the Commission having new powers of last resort to veto decisions made by national regulators where these have not followed best practice. On spectrum, I said that we do not want enforced harmonisation and that a market-led approach is the best way to ensure both that spectrum is used and also to encourage the development of innovative services.</p>
</ul><a name="80618m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="08061893000025"><ul><p class="tabletext">Council conclusions on the digital dividend were adopted with very little discussion. These conclusions were endorsed by Commissioner Reding who believes that there is a &#145;win-win&#146; situation for both broadcasters and for new players providing innovative products.</p>
</ul><a name="80618m0001.htm_brev5"><a name="08061893000026"><ul><p class="tabletext">Over lunch, I and other Ministers in attendance discussed the proposed European Electronic Communications Market Authority. The majority supported either an enhanced European Regulators&#146; Group (ERG) as an advisory body or nothing at all. I supported the enhanced ERG provided it was an independent advisory body as part of the revised legal framework with a scope limited to giving economic market advice to the Commission. The consensus was for a simple body that would be accountable to stakeholders. It would not be involved with information security or spectrum matters, but rather concentrate of advising on matters of economic regulation.</p>

</ul><a name="80618m0001.htm_brev9"><a name="08061893000030"><ul><p class="tabletext">Portugal produced a paper on broadband indicators stating the importance of mobile technologies when compiling statistics for broadband availability.

</ul><a name="80618m0001.htm_brev10"><a name="08061893000031"><ul><p class="tabletext">The presidency gave an update on the procedure for the selection of mobile satellite services (MSS) operators. Some states are unhappy with the proposed procedure as it could result in 50 per cent. of the EU not being provided with coverage. The proposed MSS decision will, however, be agreed at a Council in the next few weeks.</p>

A number of member states shared the UK view that new business models should be allowed to develop naturally through the market, and that new EU legislation risked stifling innovation. However, there was broad support for EU action to address piracy and illegal downloads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="80618m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08061893000038">A number of smaller member states were keen to prevent the loss of cultural diversity which they felt resulted from monopoly distributors.

Council conclusions on the 3rd work plan for culture 2008-2010 were also agreed by the Council. This followed on from discussion at the November 2007 Culture Council that established the priorities for 2008-2010. The presidency reported back on the establishment of an open method of co-ordination for culture and proposed a timetable for future work. This was unanimously agreed: only Cyprus and Greece called for greater emphasis on the return of stolen goods.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="80618m0001.htm_para17"><a name="08061893000064">On 10 June I was informed that there were conflicting reports over the destination of 9,000 plastic sheets that DFID had delivered to Save the Children for distribution to victims of the cyclone. These reports indicated that the Burmese Ministry of Social Welfare had requested these sheets from Save the Children. I immediately asked officials to make enquiries to ascertain the facts. The permanent secretary of the Department for International Development concluded these enquiries and updated me on 17 June. The permanent secretary also expressed our strong concern to the chief executive of Save the Children on the same day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="80618m0001.htm_para18"><a name="08061893000065">These enquiries confirmed that on 6 June, Save the Children was approached through the Burmese Ministry of Home Affairs for plastic sheets to repair schools. After discussion with the UN humanitarian co-ordinator and despite attempts to negotiate alternative arrangements, Save the Children handed the remaining 9,000 sheets in their warehouse to the Ministry of Social Welfare on 7 June.</p>

Save the Children was not involved in the distribution, although they have been able to monitor how the sheeting has been used. The remaining sheets are in the warehouse of the Laputta township Co-ordination Committee and Save the Children plan to monitor their distribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="80618m0001.htm_para20"><a name="08061893000067">These 9,000 sheets were part of an overall consignment of 131,000 sheets that had been delivered by DFID to international NGOs, the Red Cross and the UN to assist the victims of the cyclone. The 9,000 sheets represent around 0.25 per cent. of the total &#163;27.5 million committed by the UK for humanitarian assistance in Burma.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="80618m0001.htm_para21"><a name="08061893000068">On 17 June the permanent secretary wrote to the chief executive of Save the Children expressing concern over this episode and noting that Save the Children would secure replacement of the 9,000 sheets and distribute these through their own independent channels as soon as possible, as originally agreed with DFID.

The charter makes it clear that the needs of bereaved people will be at the centre of the reformed system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="80618m0001.htm_para26"><a name="08061893000075">Public consultation on the charter was previously undertaken in 2006 when it was published alongside the draft Coroners Bill. There were further informal consultations with those who work within the current system, and several voluntary sector groups which interact with it, during 2007. Changes were made as a result and are reflected in this new draft, together with the changes made as a result of consultation on the Bill, which I announced in March. I am publishing the charter now to provide a further opportunity for comments in advance of the planned introduction of a Coroners and Death Certification Bill in the next Session of Parliament. As with the draft Bill, it is my intention to publish an updated version when the Bill proper is introduced.</p>

 My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath), has made the following written ministerial statement:</p>
<a name="80618m0002.htm_brev1"><a name="08061893000081"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;On 18 June, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the Legal Services Commission (LSC) published a consultation document containing proposals for changes to the Family Graduated Fees Scheme (FGFS), which governs payments to barristers for family legal aid work. This is a full consultation which will run for 12 weeks, until 10 September 2008.</p>
</ul><a name="80618m0002.htm_brev2"><a name="08061893000082"><ul><p class="tabletext">Currently, there is a significant difference between the rates for advocacy paid to solicitors and those paid to barristers under the FGFS. The Government seek to ensure value for money in the legal services it purchases by moving to a system where the same fee is paid for the same service to the client, regardless of the type of advocate who delivers it. To that end, the LSC had planned to introduce a single harmonised family advocacy scheme for solicitors and barristers in April 2008. However, the implementation of the new scheme has been deferred until April 2010 as a condition of the agreement between the MoJ, the LSC and the Law Society, following judgment on the unified contract dispute. The LSC will instead be conducting a consultation from September 2008 on proposals for family advocacy payments to both solicitors and barristers from April 2010. These proposals are likely to suggest the restructuring or  <br>

removal of the FGFS, and removal of some or all of the differentials in payments between solicitors and barristers conducting family advocacy.</p>
</ul><a name="80618m0002.htm_brev3"><a name="08061893000083"><ul><p class="tabletext">In the interim, the proposals set out in today&#146;s consultation paper will pave the way for the April 2010 changes by narrowing the gap between payments to barristers and solicitors. The Government consider that if reductions are in fact made to the Family Graduated Fees Scheme following this consultation, barristers will still continue to be remunerated fairly.</p>
</ul><a name="80618m0002.htm_brev4"><a name="08061893000084"><ul><p class="tabletext">Legal aid operates within a fixed budget and the Department is obliged to take action to remain within that budget. Expenditure on legal aid barrister family advocacy has risen from &#163;74 million to nearly &#163;100 million in the last five years, and currently payments to family barristers form over 10 per cent. of the overall civil legal aid budget. The consultation proposals set out different options for reducing FGFS expenditure in order to live within budget, while ensuring the provision of services by sufficient numbers of competent advocates. Controlling family advocacy costs is essential so that services to people needing help with civil and family problems are not threatened.</p>
</ul><a name="80618m0002.htm_brev5"><a name="08061893000085"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Government value the input of practitioners and interested parties on the ongoing reform of civil and family legal aid. We encourage all those with an interest to contribute fully to the current consultation. The consultation document &#147;Reforming the Legal Aid Family Barrister Fee Scheme&#148; is available on the MoJ website at www.justice.gov.uk/publications/cp1208.htm, and copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.&#148;</p>
