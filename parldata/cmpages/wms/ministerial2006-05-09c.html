Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs represented
the United Kingdom at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting in
Brussels on 25 April
2006.</p><p><a name="06050965000098">The
Council adopted a proposal to broaden the scope of the current
provision for exceptional measures in the poultry meat and eggs sectors
to help them through a drop in sales caused by consumer fears about
avian influenza. I supported the proposals but stressed that the
measures should be limited in time and in budget. The Commission tabled
a declaration saying that measures already adopted by member states
would be considered for co-financing on a case-by-case basis, and that
serious market disturbance would be defined at EU, not member state
level.</p><p><a name="06050965000099">The
Council held an exchange of views on a Commission Communication on
improving the economic situation in the fishing industry which proposed
a range of short and long term measures. I led calls from several
member states that measures should deliver a profitable industry which
can pay for its own investments and which was characterised by fleet
capacity to match available
resources.</p><p><a name="06050965000100">The
Council also held an exchange of views on the Commission's action plan
for simplifying the Common Fisheries Policy. The action plan focuses on
efforts including process changes to improve the quality of the annual
quota
decision.</p><p><a name="06050965000101">The
Council held a policy debate on Commission proposals for a management
plan for plaice and sole in the North sea, on the basis of a
questionnaire drawn up by the presidency. The proposal aims to manage
the fisheries exploiting the stocks of North sea plaice and sole so
that they are rebuilt to&#151;and then maintained&#151;within safe
biological limits. UK Government views have been submitted to the
Commission in
writing.</p><p><a name="06050965000102">Under

Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Mr. David
Miliband):</b> On 19 April,<i> Official Report</i> column 13WS
my right hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett)
reported on progress in making full payments under the 2005 Single
Payment Scheme (SPS) in England and announced that partial payments
under the scheme would start as soon as operationally
possible.</p><p><a name="06050965000105">By
close on 4 May, over 58,000 claimants, representing 48.5 per cent. of
the customer population, had been paid a total of &#163;552 million
in full payments. A test run of partial payments to 1,000 claimants was
undertaken, successfully, at the end of last week. The Rural Payments
Agency (RPA) then moved immediately to process the remaining partial
payments. As a result, RPA has now made transfers to the BAGS system,
and drawn up payable orders, for &#163;730 million in partial
payments. This means the money should reach farmers over the coming
week. In total, 85 per cent. of the &#163;1,500 million worth of
expected payments for the 2005 SPS scheme year will have been
distributed.</p><p><a name="06050965000106">The
task now is to ensure that the residual element of payments are made as
soon as possible to those who have received a partial payment, and that
a plan is in place to deal with those who to date have not yet received
either a full or a partial payment under the 2005 scheme. 31,000
claimants were not included in the partial payments system, 26,000
because their claim amounted to less than &#8364;1,000 and 5,000
because of a diverse range of other factors which made their cases
particularly complex. Making full payments to this group of 5,000 will
now be given the highest priority by the Rural Payments Agency.
Increased priority will also be given to making outstanding payments
under the 
<br></br><notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>9 May 2006 : Column 11WS</b><br></br>Hill Farm Allowance (HFA) scheme in recognition of the importance of HFA
payments to those concerned. I will make a further statement in due
course on the 26,000 small claimants and those with HFA
claims.</p><p><a name="06050965000107">I
am acutely conscious of the difficulties endured so far, and the
magnitude of the challenge that still lies ahead to
complete delivery of the 2005 SPS scheme year. The fact that previous
estimates of payment timetables were missed, and the problems this has
caused for farmers up and down the country, are a matter of deep
regret. I am determined that the right lessons are learned from our
experience this year, first to prepare for the undoubted challenges
that will exist in the delivery of the 2006 scheme, and second to move
to a more stable position for the 2007 scheme year. This will require a
concentrated and sustained effort from both RPA and DEFRA, and I hope
that industry stakeholders will also continue to work closely with us
to that
end.</p><p><a name="06050965000108">At
a practical level, it is important for farmers to aim to submit their
applications by the 15 May deadline wherever possible for the 2006
year. However, in recognition of the real problems this year with the
distribution of application forms, my noble friend Lord Bach announced
last week that late claim penalties will not be applied to claims
received between 16 and 31
May.</p><p><a name="06050965000109">In
order to progress matters in this crucial next phase of SPS delivery I
am pleased to announce that Tony Cooper will join the RPA on 15 May as
interim chief executive in succession to Mark Addison. Mr. Addison
accepted the post at short notice in March in order to address the
immediate challenges facing the RPA and has, I know, made a real
impression over the last couple of months. However, his was always
intended to be a short term appointment and he will leave the RPA at
the end of the
month.</p><p><a name="06050965000110">Mr.
Cooper joins the RPA with 15 years experience of business and IT change
within the public sector and a proven track record in successful
programmes and business change. My permanent secretary recruited him on
the basis that he has the skills and experiences needed by the Agency
at this stage of their recovery programme. Arrangements for a permanent
appointment to the RPA chief executive post will be put in hand at the
end of the year once the fundamental review referred to in the written
statement made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South on
