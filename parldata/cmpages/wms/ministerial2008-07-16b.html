<p><a name="st_96"><a name="08071691000030"><a name="80716m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="08071691000204"><b>The Minister for Housing (Caroline Flint):</b>
 I am today launching a document entitled &#147;Facing the Housing Challenge: Action today, innovation for tomorrow&#148;. A copy will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08071691000031">We know that the vast majority of people aspire to home ownership. This is more than an economic calculation&#151;it represents their hopes and dreams for their families. Across Government, we value and support these aspirations. We are absolutely committed to making sure that everyone can find the housing that meets their needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08071691000032">So this time last year, we published a housing Green Paper, setting out our plans for the biggest housebuilding programme in decades. It set out our long-term plans to meet the housing needs of our aging, growing population, with a major increase in supply to address increasing demand, helping those families and first time buyers priced out of the property market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08071691000033">More recently, however, the international housing market has experienced significant challenges as a result of turbulence in the global financial markets. People are finding it harder to get a mortgage; we have seen falls in house prices and house builders are now experiencing difficult business conditions after years of extremely favourable circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para3"><a name="08071691000034">But the long-term demographic trends remain the same. And without action now, we risk frustrating many more potential first time buyers and growing families in the future. Our target to achieve a rate of 240,000 new homes per year by 2016 was set to address these long-term trends and we remain absolutely committed to increasing supply to this level to respond to this long-term demand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08071691000035">The signs are that current market conditions will lead to a fall in housing completions this year, which makes our targets of two million homes by 2016 and three million by 2020 challenging, particularly if the current conditions are protracted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08071691000036">However, the development industry has shown before it is capable of responding and delivering substantial increases in new homes over a short period&#151;from around 130,000 net additions in 2001-02 to approaching 200,000 in 2006-07. We therefore remain committed to our overall target of three million homes by 2020 as the right long-term goal, whilst recognising the scale of the challenge this entails.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08071691000037">We need now to retain our focus on stimulating market conditions, seeking new ways to deliver the housing this country urgently needs and ensuring there is a planning framework that will support a rapid market recovery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para7"><a name="08071691000038">So we are publishing this document to set out our next steps in this housing delivery programme, helping  <br>

to strike the right balance in responding to both current conditions and long-term challenges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para8"><a name="08071691000039">We invest around &#163;6 billion per year in housing and regeneration programmes. Our priorities for these resources are to:</p>
<a name="80716m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08071691000175"><ul><p class="tabletext">provide greater help for first time buyers;</p>
</ul><a name="80716m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="08071691000176"><ul><p class="tabletext">help existing homeowners facing difficulties due to problems in the international financial markets;</p>
</ul><a name="80716m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="08071691000177"><ul><p class="tabletext">keep housing supply, particularly affordable housing supply, as high as possible during the current difficulties, in order to keep on track to meet our targets; and</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para9"><a name="08071691000040">We are therefore setting out a package of measures in this document to achieve these objectives. These include:</p>
<a name="80716m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="08071691000179"><ul><p class="tabletext">The pilot of a &#145;Rent to HomeBuy&#146; scheme, led by the Housing Corporation, which will aim to help prospective buyers who are unable to take advantage of current shared ownership schemes, perhaps because they cannot find a suitable mortgage. The scheme will enable eligible households to rent a new build property, at less than market rates, for a pre-specified period, with the option to buy a share in the home at the end of that time.</p>
</ul><a name="80716m0001.htm_brev5"><a name="08071691000180"><ul><p class="tabletext">Plans from the London borough of Barking and Dagenham, Newcastle city council, Nottingham city council and Manchester city council to launch the first pilot local housing companies. These have the potential to deliver up to 10,000 new homes. They represent a new model of working which combines local authority land assets with private sector investment, enhancing delivery of new homes and communities. This represents just one of the ways that local authorities will play a central role in delivering the housing the country needs.</p>
</ul><a name="80716m0001.htm_brev6"><a name="08071691000181"><ul><p class="tabletext">Confirmation that more funding, beyond the &#163;200 million already allocated from the affordable housing budget, could be made available to purchase high quality unsold stock, in the right locations, for the right price. This would help deliver our demanding affordable housing targets, while also supporting house builders.</p>
</ul><a name="80716m0001.htm_brev7"><a name="08071691000182"><ul><p class="tabletext">Proposals to support delivery of up to 75,000 homes in 20 more towns and cities in the next stage of the growth points programme. These will combine increased housing with new jobs, town centre regeneration, and higher design and environmental standards. We will invest &#163;100 million in helping these areas to realise their ambitions for sustainable growth. Further details of the new growth points can be found in the &#147;Partnership for Growth&#148; document, being published today, which will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
</ul><a name="80716m0001.htm_brev8"><a name="08071691000183"><ul><p class="tabletext">Provisional allocations of the &#163;510 million housing and planning delivery grant, to support those local authorities who are taking action to meet housing needs, and reward those who are preparing plans and identifying land supply for delivery. We will keep this under review for the next three years to ensure that it remains an effective incentive for delivery. We will also develop proposals for specific incentives to deliver affordable housing from 2010-11. Further details are set out in &#147;Housing and Planning Delivery Grant: Allocation mechanism and summary of consultation responses&#148;. A copy will be placed in the Library of the House, along with the schedule of provisional allocations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para10"><a name="08071691000041">Alongside this document, I am publishing an open letter which sets out our response to the Calcutt review of housing supply. We have accepted a number of the recommendations from John Calcutt. These include the creation of a zero-carbon unit to co-ordinate and guide the programme of work to deliver zero-carbon housing from 2016, and further work to develop skills within the house building industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para11"><a name="08071691000042">I am also publishing a summary of the Pomeroy review of private sector shared equity. Brian Pomeroy was tasked with examining how the private sector shared equity market is developing and what the private and public sector might do to facilitate its development. The review found that there were no major institutional barriers which were preventing a shared equity market from developing and there remains an interest in developing suitable shared equity products when conditions improve. The full text has not been published as it contains confidential information, but the summary sets out the main findings. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para12"><a name="08071691000043">Finally, effective regional and local planning for the medium and long term is essential if we are to reach the target of 240,000 homes per year from 2016. We will now work with regional partners on a flexible basis to agree the work programmes and timetables with each regional planning body. The National Housing and Planning Advice Unit recently provided the Government with advice on the numbers it felt should be considered in regional strategy reviews. I am today writing to all regional assembly chairs, the North West regional leaders&#146; forum, and the Mayor of London with guidance on how we expect the advice from the National Housing and Planning Advice Unit to be used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para13"><a name="08071691000044">The document &#147;Facing the Housing Challenge: Action today, innovation for tomorrow&#148; outlines a broad response to the impact of the disruption in international financial markets on the housing market. This package will both help people facing difficulties today, and lay the foundations to help meet the long-term housing needs of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para14"><a name="08071691000045">However, it is not the end of the process. We will review progress and reflect on new approaches, incentives or support mechanisms which will both help address the current difficulties and deliver our longer-term programme. We will take a proactive approach wherever it is clear that we can do more to support consumers and industry.</p>

<p><a name="st_97"><a name="08071691000046"><a name="80716m0001.htm_spmin1"><a name="08071691000205"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe):</b>
 In recent months my Department has received representations from the Lotteries Council and the Hospice Lotteries Association, seeking changes to the regulatory regime for non-commercial society lotteries established by section 99 of the Gambling Act 2005 (&#147;the Act&#148;). Societies under the Act are typically national and local charities, sporting and social clubs that run lottery draws in order to raise funds for local good causes such as hospices or air ambulances. Societies which operate lotteries that raise more than &#163;20,000 in a single draw or over &#163;250,000 in a year must be licensed by the Gambling Commission.</p>
<br>


<meta name="Date" content="16 July 2008">

<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>16 July 2008 : Column 20WS</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para15"><a name="08071691000047">The aim of the representations I have received has been to persuade the Government to increase the present limit on the maximum proceeds that are permitted to be raised by society lotteries in a single draw, from the present limit of &#163;2 million. This would also allow a larger top prize to be offered, since the Act provides that a person buying a society lottery ticket cannot win more than 10 per cent. of the overall proceeds of the draw.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para16"><a name="08071691000048">These representations have been echoed in Parliament. Through signing early-day motion 1570 tabled by the hon. Member for Bolton North-East (Mr. Crausby) in May this year, some 70 hon. Members on all sides have expressed support for an increase in proceeds limits under the Act, specifically in relation to hospice lotteries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para17"><a name="08071691000049">While very few societies currently reach the present limits, some have argued that the limits hold them back, for example by preventing a number of societies coming together to promote a larger one-off annual draw.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para18"><a name="08071691000050">The Government have always been willing to consider representations made on behalf of the good causes which benefit from society lotteries, as we showed when we doubled the then society lottery limits in 2002. The 2005 Act also introduced a range of deregulatory measures designed to assist society lotteries. I have considered the arguments now put by the Lotteries Council and Hospice Lotteries Council, as well as the views of hon. Members. I have also taken into account the view of the Gambling Commission, which as the Government&#146;s principal adviser on gambling matters has also recommended an increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para19"><a name="08071691000051">I have had to balance these arguments for increasing the amount that society lotteries can raise for projects, with my responsibility for ensuring that the licensing objectives of the Gambling Act are observed. There is a significant risk that increasing the limit on proceeds of lottery draws, and hence the top prize available, by too great an amount could significantly change the character of a society lottery by appealing to players for whom winning such a prize would be a greater attraction than supporting the charitable cause in question. Very high prizes also bring with them an increased risk of fraud and other criminal activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para20"><a name="08071691000052">Having weighed these considerations, I have concluded that there is a reasonable justification for a limited increase in the maximum proceeds that society lotteries may raise in a single lottery draw. I am now able to inform the House how the Government intend to proceed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para21"><a name="08071691000053">I will tomorrow publish a three-month consultation paper on a proposal to increase to &#163;4 million the maximum proceeds for each individual society lottery draw. This will entail a top prize of up to &#163;400,000 for each draw. There will be no increase to the annual maximum proceeds per society lottery of &#163;10 million since no society lotteries presently reach that limit. The maximum &#163;25,000 prize for society lotteries whose proceeds are below &#163;250,000 will also remain unaltered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para22"><a name="08071691000054">If in the light of public consultation we decide to proceed, either with this proposal or another that suggests itself in the light of responses to the consultation, we will bring forward the necessary order. This will be for Parliament to approve by means of an affirmative resolution, requiring a debate and potentially a vote in both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="80716m0001.htm_para23"><a name="08071691000055">This measure would benefit around 630 societies that are presently licensed by the Gambling Commission to operate society lotteries. I believe that it would provide  <br>

 On 10 October 2006, <i>Official Report</i>, column 13-14WS, my predecessor announced the formation of Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S) and that elements of the new organisation were to be co-located in the Bath/Bristol area. DE&amp;S was established on 1 April 2007 and in March this year a major business improvement programme, PACE (Performance, Agility, Confidence, Efficiency), was launched to drive forward the changes required to continue to improve support to the armed forces both now and in the future.</p>

I am therefore announcing today, subject to consultation with the trade unions, the co-location of further elements of DE&amp;S at Abbey Wood in Bristol. This will involve DE&amp;S withdrawing in its entirety from Andover, Wyton, Caversfield and from both the Ensleigh and Foxhill sites in Bath, in a phased programme through to 2012. Those sites vacated by DE&amp;S are being considered for further defence use. Under the DE&amp;S programme, around 2,800 posts will move to Bristol, in addition to the 1,000 transfers already in hand. It will produce estimated savings of around &#163;560 million over a 25 year period, is a key enabler for the PACE programme and is also part of a wider departmental estates rationalisation programme, reflecting the Department&#146;s commitment to maximising the funds available to support the front line.</p>

 EU Environment Ministers and Energy Ministers, MEPs and representatives from the European Commission attended an informal ministerial meeting in Paris, France, to discuss the 2020 climate-energy package and the international climate negotiations. I attended on 3 July and my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy attended from 4 to 5 July.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="80716m0002.htm_para0"><a name="08071691000076">The first working session, in the presence of representatives from civil society and industry, examined the role that the EU should play in reaching a global agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The UK emphasised the importance of reaching agreement on the energy-climate package so that the EU can be a real force in the international negotiations. Over lunch, member states discussed what they consider is the key for the success of the 2020 package. During the debate the UK highlighted the importance of the EU delivering the 30 per cent. reduction in EU emissions as part of a global international agreement, the need to agree incentive mechanisms for encouraging the carbon capture and storage demonstration projects and our concerns regarding any proposal for the EU to earmark EU ETS auction revenues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="80716m0002.htm_para1"><a name="08071691000077">In the second working session, Ministers met with members of the European Parliament for in-depth discussions on the issues concerning the implementation of the energy-climate package. The UK acknowledged that to progress efficiently in the negotiations and obtain a definitive agreement on the package before the Conference of the Parties in Copenhagen at the end of 2009, the framework for discussion should continue to be what was proposed by the Commission. Amendments to the Commission&#146;s proposals were suggested offering flexibilities to encourage the reduction of emissions where they are cheapest. Many Ministers expressed concerns about the need to ensure solidarity between the member states to meet the significant costs of a transition to a low carbon EU economy. Ministers agreed that determining which sectors were at risk of carbon leakage should be evidence based and timely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="80716m0002.htm_para2"><a name="08071691000078">The informal meeting also examined EU GMOs policy and established a working group to undertake further analysis of the issues. The work of this group should be concluded in time for the Council of Environment Ministers on 4 to 5 December and will form the basis for discussions on interim guidelines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="80716m0002.htm_para3"><a name="08071691000079">Finally, the informal ended with a joint lunch with the European Ministers for energy, which was also attended by Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, Nobel prize winner and chairman of the IPCC, who spoke about the urgent need to fight climate change.</p>

sector organisations. The scheme will place an emissions cap on up to 5,000 large business and public sector organisations responsible for around 14 million tonnes of carbon (MtC) emissions each year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="80716m0002.htm_para4"><a name="08071691000081">In March this year we published a Government response to our consultation on the implementation proposals for CRC. I am able to announce today progress on a number of CRC scheme design issues. We propose to operate the CRC on a financial rather than calendar year and propose to permit participants to use allowances from the fixed-price sale in the second year to cover their first year emissions. This will reduce the gap between allowance sales and the recycling of allowance revenue to just six months. There are a number of other proposed CRC scheme wide amendments to improve the operation of the scheme. We will invite views in the consultation on the scheme regulations later this year on these proposed amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="80716m0002.htm_para5"><a name="08071691000082">We also said in the Government response to our consultation that we would review whether to include schools in the scheme. Respondents to the consultation highlighted the wide potential for energy efficiency in schools and so urged us to require local authorities to include schools as part of their estate for the purposes of CRC, rather than taking the voluntary approach we proposed. The Government, the Scottish Government and the Welsh Assembly Government have decided to include schools in Great Britain in the scheme. All state-funded schools will be included under the umbrella of their local authority; qualifying local authorities will participate on their behalf in CRC. In this way schools will not be required to participate directly in emissions trading as this will be the responsibility of the local authority. Schools will have to report annual energy use data to their local authority and will be able to share the benefits of CRC in the form of improved energy efficiency and reduced energy bills. It will also give schools the opportunity to involve children in delivering energy efficiency improvements and carbon reductions and in safeguarding the future of the environment. In Northern Ireland, where schools are not overseen by local authorities, the Executive are considering whether and how best to include schools in the scheme.</p>

 The House will wish to know that Sir Ian Magee&#146;s independent review of criminality information is being published today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="80716m0002.htm_para9"><a name="08071691000088">I am grateful to Sir Ian for his work on the review. He has presented us with a substantial report with wide ranging implications for all organisations which collect information that may be relevant to the prevention, investigation, prosecution, or penalising of crime. This is a complex area and there are no quick fixes. Sir Ian&#146;s package of recommendations will require sustained attention. I will therefore be consulting widely and I intend to publish a full, Government-wide action plan in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="80716m0002.htm_para10"><a name="08071691000089">The Government are keen to develop work quickly across a range of Sir Ian&#146;s recommendations and my Department will continue to take the lead in driving this work forward as part of our primary focus on public protection. We intend now to proceed with the following.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="80716m0002.htm_para11"><a name="08071691000090">First, we will continue with the complex and difficult work which the Home Office has been leading to enhance the information we have about the criminal histories of foreign nationals and UK citizens who have spent time abroad. We will do this both by making better use of existing information channels and by leading a process of improvement within Europe and more widely. This work will significantly improve the way we protect the public by ensuring relevant overseas data are available to inform the criminal justice process and key systems such as those used to vet and bar people seeking to work with children and vulnerable adults.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="80716m0002.htm_para12"><a name="08071691000091">Secondly, we will build on, extend and strengthen existing streams of work, such as the programme the Home Office has led to implement the recommendations from the Bichard inquiry, to develop a clear strategic direction for the improvement of criminality information management across what Sir Ian is calling the public protection network. That will provide the framework for positive changes to sharing of criminality information, training for leaders and front line staff and the ways in which we identify and respond to information-related risks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="80716m0002.htm_para13"><a name="08071691000092">Thirdly, the Home Office will be involved in an in-depth review of the way technology supports information flows between public protection organisations, drawing on the expertise of other Departments and key organisations such as the National Policing Improvement Agency.

information handling within policing and the broader criminal justice system, but we recognise the need to join up even more and sharpen the focus on public protection. There is also significant potential to save taxpayers&#146; money through the re-use of existing technology and through reducing the amount of duplicate data held by various organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="80716m0002.htm_para14"><a name="08071691000093">Fourthly, Sir Ian has conducted some detailed work in specific areas of public protection and made recommendations that directly affect front line operations. We intend to implement these recommendations. Their focus is improving the way information is captured, stored and accessed, shared, analysed and acted upon, and managed. Full implementation of these recommendations will improve the quality of criminality information available to front line staff who are making very difficult decisions on a day-to-day basis. In all these areas we will be building on the foundations of positive work which is already underway between the Home Office and its partners within the public protection network. For example, I anticipate we can:</p>
<a name="80716m0002.htm_brev0"><a name="08071691000187"><ul><p class="tabletext">work with the UK Border Agency to improve the use of criminality information to assist in deporting people in a timely and fair way; and</p>

personnel who have died overseas. All fatalities suffered by our armed forces continue to be a source of profound regret. Our sympathies are with their families. It is particularly regrettable that this statement comes at a time when in recent weeks we have experienced an unusually high rate of fatalities in Afghanistan. Our service personnel risk their lives in helping to build strong, stable and democratic nations, and to protect the interests of the United Kingdom. We cannot pay high enough tribute to the job that they do, or to the ultimate sacrifice that some of them have made. We are, as ever, strongly committed to minimising the effect on their families and loved ones.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para0"><a name="08071691000122">Today, we are announcing the progress that has been made since the written ministerial statement on 30 April 2008, <i>Official Report</i>, column 12WS with information about the conduct of inquests by the Oxfordshire, Wiltshire and Swindon and other coroners. This statement gives the position at 8 July.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para1"><a name="08071691000123">For the first time, the tables that accompany this statement include information about those ongoing cases in which there has been a Board of Inquiry (BoI) report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para2"><a name="08071691000124">The purpose of a BoI is to examine the circumstances surrounding an incident resulting in death or serious injury, to learn lessons and to make recommendations to the chain of command for the improvement of working practices, procedures or equipment, which could help to reduce the likelihood of a similar incident happening again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para3"><a name="08071691000125">In some cases, the initial review of an incident will highlight any lessons to be learned or actions that could be taken to prevent a similar incident happening again. Dispensation from holding a BoI may be given if there are no further lessons to be learned. This is often the case for incidents occurring on operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para4"><a name="08071691000126">Ministers and the military chain of command attach considerable importance to the timely completion of BoIs but the overriding requirement is that a thorough investigation identifies the right lessons. It should also be noted that a BoI (and the coroner&#146;s inquest) cannot conclude until the completion of any police investigations. The coroner&#146;s inquest may take place before completion of a BoI although this rarely happens in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para5"><a name="08071691000127"><i>Progress with inquests</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para6"><a name="08071691000128">At the time of the last statement, we reported that since additional funding had been provided by the Government to assist the Oxfordshire coroner, 155 inquests had been held: 141 into the overseas deaths of service personnel and 14 into the deaths of civilians in Iraq whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para7"><a name="08071691000129">Since April, a further 25 inquests have been held into the deaths of service personnel who died in operations overseas whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton or RAF Lyneham. This makes a total of 180 inquests held since June 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para8"><a name="08071691000130">Since operations commenced there have been a total of 201 inquests into the deaths of service personnel who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, including one serviceman who died in the UK of his injuries. In two further cases, no formal inquest was held, but the deaths were taken into consideration during inquest proceedings for those who died in the same incident.</p>

As at 8 July, there are nine such inquests. The Oxfordshire coroner has retained jurisdiction in six of these cases; three have been transferred to coroners closer to the deceased&#146;s next of kin. Hearing dates have been set in four cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para12"><a name="08071691000134">The oldest individual inquest for which no date has yet been set is that into the death of Private Reeves who was killed on 9 August 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para15"><a name="08071691000137">Since October 2007, additional resources have been provided by the Government to ensure that a backlog of inquests will not build up in the Wiltshire and Swindon jurisdiction, now that fatalities are being repatriated via RAF Lyneham. The coroner, Mr. Masters, is continuing the practice of transferring military inquests to a coroner closer to the bereaved family, where possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para16"><a name="08071691000138">There are 57 inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel who died in Iraq and Afghanistan whose bodies were repatriated after 1 April 2007. Of these, Mr. Masters has retained 34 inquests, while 23 inquests are being conducted by coroners closer to the next of kin. Inquest hearing dates have been set in 12 of these cases. Inquests into the two latest fatalities are yet to be opened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para23"><a name="08071691000145">We remain committed to providing better support to bereaved military families. The written ministerial statement issued on 7 June 2007 by my right hon. Friend, the then Minister of State, Ministry of Defence, gave details of the support that was then being provided. Since then, we have increased the number of family members who can travel and stay overnight if necessary, at public expense, to attend the repatriation ceremony; and two family members may attend any pre-inquest hearings, as well as the inquest itself, again at public expense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para25"><a name="08071691000147">On 1 June the Ministry of Defence established the Defence Inquests Unit. This unit acts as the focal point for all coroners&#146; inquests into the deaths of service and Ministry of Defence civilian personnel who die on, or as a result of injuries sustained while on operations; and those who die as a result of training activity. The unit&#146;s key role is to assist coroners so that they can complete inquests satisfactorily and as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para26"><a name="08071691000148">The unit&#146;s main function is to establish early contact with the coroner for each inquest, and to ensure that they are provided with all relevant paperwork, including reports from the Special Investigation Branch and Board of Inquiry (if convened). The unit will also help advise on subject matter experts for inquests. While the relevant service will, rightly, remain the focal point for liaising with the bereaved families, the unit will work closely with the services to ensure that there is a consistent approach, particularly in terms of providing information to families, coroners and welfare officers.</p>

 Roads are vital to our way of life, connecting people with jobs, schools, shops, family and friends. We must ensure that road users have reliable journeys on safe, well-managed roads. So today I am publishing the Command Paper &#147;Roads&#151;Delivering Choice and Reliability&#148;, which sets out how we aim to get the best out of the road network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para35"><a name="08071691000160">The greatest barrier to reliable journeys is congestion. It is frustrating for motorists and has serious consequences for the economy and the environment. So we are taking   <br>

<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>16 July 2008 : Column 33WS</b><br>
a number of important steps to tackle it, focusing our efforts over the next decade on where congestion is worst&#151;on our urban roads and motorways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_378"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para36"><a name="08071691000161">I am today announcing that &#163;6 billion is available to fund improvements to national strategic roads in England in the period up to 2014. These improvements could include an innovative mix of road widening, opening up the hard shoulder, and junction improvements. In the Command Paper I set out which national schemes are being considered for this funding, which is in addition to that for strategic regional roads provided through the regional funding allocation process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para37"><a name="08071691000162">While some road building is needed to provide extra capacity, we must also consider how to add capacity to existing roads. That is why I am exploring where the hard shoulder could be used to provide extra space on the motorway network. Where we add new capacity either by using the hard shoulder, or by widening roads, I am particularly interested to see what role tolled or car-share lanes could play to give motorists a more reliable journey. Further work will be done on this in the coming months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_380"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para38"><a name="08071691000163">I am also today publishing cost estimates for the Highways Agency major roads programme. Since the Nichols review last year, the Highways Agency has made some important changes to its management of the roads programme. These changes are outlined in the Command Paper. The revised cost estimates for regional schemes will help the regions plan their programmes more effectively over the coming regional funding allocation period. I am placing a copy of the estimates in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_381"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para39"><a name="08071691000164">The majority of congestion is in our towns and cities so we have allocated an extra &#163;200 million per year from the transport innovation fund to help local authorities manage congestion in innovative ways. I am announcing today that further pump priming funding will go to Cambridgeshire, Reading and Leeds to help them take forward their ideas. I have also previously announced that, to help local authorities with their thinking on congestion charging, we will run a demonstrations project to trial the technology and processes that could underpin a more sophisticated future congestion charging system. My Department will today tell all those companies who formally expressed an interest in participating in the project the names of the successful bidders. The trials are due to start in the Autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para40"><a name="08071691000165">I am also today announcing that eight of the 10 largest urban areas in England, who all have congestion targets, will receive the first tranche of the performance-related payments from the urban congestion performance fund. The fund is worth &#163;60 million over four years and, based on their 2006-07 target performance data, &#163;6 million will be shared between Bristol, Greater Manchester, Leicester, London, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear and the West Midlands.</p>

 My Department, in conjunction with the Home Office, has today begun a consultation on aspects of the Transport Security Bill designed to deliver more effective policing and security planning arrangements at airports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"><a name="80716m0003.htm_para43"><a name="08071691000169">The consultation sets out a new security planning process that:</p>

<a name="80716m0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08071691000203"><ul><p class="tabletext">allows any policing element of this plan to be charged to the airport operator.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_386"><a name="80716m0004.htm_para0"><a name="08071691000170">As a consequence, the activities of the police, aviation industry and control authorities will be better co-ordinated to enhance and strengthen security planning. The process of security planning will provide a greater level of understanding to all security stakeholders at an airport as to why they are carrying out certain functions and what resources are required. It is also important that we create a level playing field whereby all airport operators pay for any dedicated police presence required at their airports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_387"><a name="80716m0004.htm_para1"><a name="08071691000171">Given the importance of strong policing and security planning in the current climate, we are using the opportunity of introducing a Transport Security Bill into Parliament next session to deliver these objectives as well as including provisions to combat terrorist acts at sea.</p>
