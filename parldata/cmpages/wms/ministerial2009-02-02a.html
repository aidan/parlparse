 A Treasury Minute dated 6 November 2008 informed Parliament that the Bank of England had provided a short term loan facility to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) to enable the FSCS to pay out to eligible UK retail depositors in Icesave, the internet product made available by the UK branch of Landsbanki.</p>

Prior to Lord Sutherland&#146;s December report I established an expert group to advise on future testing and assessment arrangements and their delivery. I have taken steps to clarify further the reporting lines, information sharing and risk escalation arrangements between the QCA and my department and the role of DCSF observers. My Department will ensure that the legislation that establishes Ofqual and the QCDA gives Ofqual the powers to regulate national curriculum assessments effectively. In the interim, my Department is developing and agreeing a protocol on the reporting arrangements for Ofqual. My officials will discuss with QCA possible technological advances, such as on-screen marking and data capture, for possible use from 2010 onwards.</p>

OGC have identified some areas where aspects of current guidance and practice can be improved, and these are included in our detailed response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="90202m0001.htm_para11"><a name="0902023000035">On 16 December I wrote to the new chair of the QCA board, Chris Trinick, asking him to implement all Lord Sutherland&#146;s recommendations relating to the QCA in full, and to provide me with a full report on progress by 16 January. He has done this, and I have laid a copy of his letter to me including the QCA&#146;s action plan and update on implementation in the Libraries of the House, together with my reply to him.

I am very grateful to Lord Sutherland for his detailed and comprehensive work, which will significantly strengthen the future delivery of national curriculum tests. His report, and the measures set out in this statement and accompanying action plans, will help ensure that we achieve this in 2009 and in future years, so that children and young people, and their parents and teachers, all benefit from the testing and assessment system they deserve.</p>

The unauthorised leak to the media of this story went directly against our intention that this House should be the first to hear of the issue. Following the delay to the Armed Forces Personnel debate, we should have reviewed the timing of this statement. It was certainly not our intent in any way to fail to give this House the proper opportunity to learn of and consider this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="90202m0001.htm_para15"><a name="0902023000040">We have concluded that in the interests of operational effectiveness, a 15 per cent. limit on foreign and Commonwealth nationals in these areas of the Army is both necessary and proportionate. The three Corps are the only ones where the current proportion of foreign and Commonwealth personnel is at or approaching that level. There will be an option to apply the same limit to other parts of the Armed Forces if, at any time in the future, the percentages merit it. The purpose of the measure is to limit the number of personnel whose foreign citizenship could leave them potentially subject to legislation contrary to our own decisions&#151;on, for example, operational deployments. We have also borne in mind the importance of ensuring that the Armed Forces continue to be identified with and representative of the UK. These arrangements do not extend to Gurkhas who serve as a discrete formed unit to which only Nepalese nationals can apply.</p>

These arrangements are made having due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination and to promote racial equality of opportunity. In this case, the restriction is based on nationality and not race. The MOD and the Armed Forces remain whole-heartedly committed to removing unlawful discrimination and promoting equality.</p>

 My right hon. Friend, the Minister for the Armed Forces and I wish to make the following statement to the House about the inquests of service personnel who have died overseas. We recognise that every inquest represents the death of someone fighting for this country, and a story of great pain for a bereaved family. We cannot praise enough the job that our personnel do nor pay high enough tribute to the sacrifice which some of them have made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="90202m0002.htm_para0"><a name="0902023000069">Today, we are announcing the progress that has been made since the written ministerial statement on 30 October 2008, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 36-38WS, with information about the conduct of inquests by the Wiltshire and Swindon and other coroners. This statement gives the position at 27 January, but does not reflect the 17 January death on operations in Afghanistan of acting Corporal Robinson as the inquest has not yet been opened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="90202m0002.htm_para1"><a name="0902023000070">The tables which accompany this statement again include information about those cases which involve a board of inquiry or a service inquiry (boards of inquiry were replaced on 1 October 2008 by a new system of service inquiries).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="90202m0002.htm_para2"><a name="0902023000071"><i>Progress with inquests</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="90202m0002.htm_para3"><a name="0902023000072">At the time of the last statement, our Departments reported that 209 inquests had been held since June 2006: 195 into the overseas deaths of service personnel and 14 into the deaths of civilians in Iraq whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton or RAF Lyneham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="90202m0002.htm_para4"><a name="0902023000073">Since October, a further 11 inquests have been held into the deaths of service personnel who died in operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. This makes a total of 220 inquests held since June 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="90202m0002.htm_para5"><a name="0902023000074">Since operations commenced in 2001 there have been a total of 244 inquests into the deaths of service personnel who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, including four service men who died in the UK of their injuries. In two further cases, no formal inquest was held, but the deaths were taken into consideration during inquest proceedings for those who died in the same incident.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="90202m0002.htm_para6"><a name="0902023000075">We remain very grateful for the efforts of all the coroners involved in conducting these inquests and unswerving in our support of the independent coronial system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="90202m0002.htm_para7"><a name="0902023000076">The Coroners and Justice Bill will make additional provisions for the transfer of cases from one coroner to another in England and Wales&#151;with the chief coroner having a power to transfer cases without the agreement of the coroners concerned&#151;although the approach will remain that only single deaths are subject to transfer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="90202m0002.htm_para8"><a name="0902023000077">The improvements to the coroner system contained in the Bill will lead to a better service for all bereaved families, including service families. Improvements include the charter for bereaved families, which sets out the services they should receive from coroners; and a new appeal system to which families will have access.</p>
