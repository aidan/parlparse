Following the Communication Hub relocation in 2006 to RAF Leeming instead of RAF Scampton the decision regarding the future basing of ASACS units needed to be reconsidered. This included the proposed future location of all ASACS elements currently based at RAF Boulmer, RAF Kirton-in-Lindsey and RAF Scampton.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="80110m0001.htm_para9"><a name="08011061000043">During the course of the ASACS Basing Study it became clear that the retention of RAF Boulmer as a core site for the ASACS Hub was the best option in financial and operational terms. Therefore, I have decided that, subject to TU consultation, RAF Boulmer should not draw down in 2012 and should instead remain the ASACS Hub. Service and civilian personnel at RAF Boulmer will be briefed on the progress of the study.</p>

 Today we are publishing &#147;Think Family: Improving the Life Chances of Families at Risk&#148;. This forms the next stage of the &#147;Families at Risk Review&#148; led by the Social Exclusion Task Force and follows on from the publication of &#147;Reaching Out: Think Family&#148; in June 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="80110m0001.htm_para18"><a name="08011061000072">&#147;Think Family&#148; argues that excellent children&#146;s services, and excellent adults&#146; services, are not enough in isolation. To transform life chances and break the cycle of disadvantage, services must go further. Today&#146;s report builds on the review&#146;s earlier analytical work by setting out a vision of an integrated system that &#145;thinks family&#146; at every level. The goal is to extend the logic of integration behind &#147;Every Child Matters&#148; beyond children&#146;s services to include adults&#146; services and promote collaboration and co-ordination around the needs of the family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="80110m0001.htm_para19"><a name="08011061000073">There are four key principles that underpin a system that &#145;thinks family&#146;. First, there is no &#145;wrong door&#146; to effective support and contact with any service opens a door into a system of joined up support. Secondly, services take a &#145;whole family&#146; approach, responding to clients as family members and supporting parental responsibilities. Thirdly, professionals start with a family&#146;s strengths and build on a family&#146;s capacity to take responsibility for their own lives. Fourthly, the system provides support tailored to need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="80110m0001.htm_para20"><a name="08011061000074">The system design is based upon findings from extensive research and consultation with practitioners, local policy makers and families themselves. To take this vision forward DCSF has launched an invitation to local authorities to apply to become one of the &#163;13 million Family Pathfinders set out in &#147;Think Family&#148; and the &#147;Children&#146;s Plan&#148;. The Family Pathfinders will improve service delivery to families at risk through change at all levels of the system; from strategy and governance through to the delivery of front line services. The pathfinders will build on the learning from innovative family-based services such as the Family Intervention Projects. Working alongside the network of local authorities involved in the &#147;Narrowing the Gap&#148; project, these pathfinders will help to generate learning about how local areas can transform outcomes by &#145;thinking family&#146;.

This follows a public consultation published on 21 June 2007: &#147;Carbon and Sustainability Reporting Within the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation, Requirements and Guidance, Draft Government Recommendation to RTFO Administrator&#148;. I have also published today a summary of responses to the consultation. Copies of these documents have been placed in the Library of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="80110m0001.htm_para24"><a name="08011061000079">The Government are committed to ensuring that the biofuels that are supplied under the RTFO are sustainable and deliver genuine greenhouse gas savings. This reporting mechanism will provide a strong incentive to road transport fuel suppliers to source sustainable biofuels, and is an essential first step towards the development and introduction of mandatory carbon and sustainability standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="80110m0001.htm_para25"><a name="08011061000080">I can confirm that, in the light of the comments received during the consultation exercise, the Government are setting the following targets for key aspects of the biofuel reporting scheme to illustrate the level of performance expected from all road transport fuel suppliers:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="80110m0002.htm_para0"><a name="08011061000093">The Government announced on 21 June 2007 their aim of rewarding biofuels according to their carbon savings from 2010-11 onwards, subject to a number of very important provisos. I can confirm today that the Government will aim to design such a scheme so that it delivers a level of carbon savings consistent with the greenhouse gas saving target for 2010-11. We will consult in due course on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="80110m0002.htm_para1"><a name="08011061000094">The Government will keep all of these targets under review in the light of suppliers&#146; performance in meeting them and other developments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="80110m0002.htm_para2"><a name="08011061000095">The Government&#146;s recommendation to the RFA includes a number of detailed changes that have been made in the light of the responses to the consultation. The key changes are set out in the summary of responses document.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="80110m0002.htm_para3"><a name="08011061000096">Further developments in this area will be affected by the forthcoming EU Directives on Renewable Energy and Fuel Quality. The UK will continue to work closely with the European Commission and other member states to ensure that a robust sustainability framework for biofuels underpins both EU and UK biofuel targets.</p>
