<p><a name="st_23"><a name="06110297000014"><a name="61102m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="06110297000050"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Gordon Brown):</b>
 The security and safety of the British people is the first task of Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="61102m0001.htm_para0"><a name="06110297000015">Earlier in the year I announced that the Government's comprehensive spending review (CSR) would review security and counter-terrorism activity across Government, as a key foundation for the investment decisions we will make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="61102m0001.htm_para1"><a name="06110297000016">The Chief Secretary has today written to Cabinet colleagues setting out how this review will be taken forward within the wider comprehensive spending review framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="61102m0001.htm_para2"><a name="06110297000017">It is already clear from the work under way that we face a new type of threat that erodes traditional distinctions between homeland and international security and between those traditionally tasked with security policy and other areas of Government. This demands new approaches from Government. No Department of Government can any longer simply leave security to others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="61102m0001.htm_para3"><a name="06110297000018">This review must rise to the challenge to take a comprehensive approach drawing on an overarching assessment of the threat and the response required across Government, to inform how we can further strengthen and integrate our strategic security capability, including the case for a single security budget. This will ensure that by working beyond departmental boundaries we can enhance the effectiveness of our structures for protecting Britain's security and set out the part each Department can play.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="61102m0001.htm_para4"><a name="06110297000019">The review will look beyond the immediate security situation to consider the long-term requirements for winning hearts and minds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="61102m0001.htm_para5"><a name="06110297000020">It will also consider how best to harness new technology for security to prevent terrorists and criminals from exploiting multiple identities to escape the law and bypass border security. Sir James Crosby held his first meeting of his public private forum on identity on 30 October. This is investigating how common standards can enhance our ability to protect identities and how identity management can be used to increase the security of individuals as consumers, employees and international passengers. The forum is due to report by spring 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="61102m0001.htm_para6"><a name="06110297000024">The publication of these papers follows a review commissioned in the light of continuing parliamentary and public interest in the findings of the report into the ship&#146;s loss. The board&#146;s terms of reference, the then Commander-in-Chief, fleet&#146;s advice on the report and the Admiralty Board&#146;s response are also being published. Some information has been redacted to ensure the Department&#146;s compliance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA 98). Certain other information has also been withheld as its provision would, or would be likely to prejudice the capability, effectiveness and security of the armed forces.</p>

However, we will be withholding from publication copies of the witness statements that were taken by the board, as we believe that the disclosure of this personal data would be unfair to the individuals concerned and would be contrary to DPA 98.</p>

 The House will be aware that my predecessor made a written statement on 11 July 2006 about the discovery of an error affecting about 1,800 armed forces invaliding pensions. My predecessor advised that he would put in place a new project named &#147;Project Collins&#148; to identify and correct the pension awards, with the payment of any interest due, and consider whether additional recompense is appropriate.</p>

and the Government have every intention that they should remain so in the future. The Ombudsman has, and will continue to have, the total and unqualified respect of the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="61102m0001.htm_para12"><a name="06110297000041">The Government agree with the Committee that there should be a significant package of support and believe that the financial assistance scheme, as extended, constitutes such a package. The Government have, however, looked again, in the light of the Committee's report, at what extra support can be made available within the existing framework. One option, which is not being widely taken up currently, is deemed buy-back. This is a facility that, provided certain conditions are met, reinstates a member of an underfunded contracted-out pension scheme into the state additional pension for the period they were in an underfunded scheme, at less than cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="61102m0001.htm_para13"><a name="06110297000043">Deemed buy-back needs to be carefully considered on an individual basis but, despite this, we believe that this facility could provide useful help. While the pensions industry should already be aware of deemed buy-back, the Government are planning to publicise these arrangements more widely and propose to work with interested parties to investigate what more should be done in this respect. We also intend to examine whether the Department can produce a tailored forecast for each person who qualifies for deemed buy-back of the additional pension they could receive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="61102m0001.htm_para14"><a name="06110297000045">We note and accept the Committee's view that the Government's response should not be defensive and we have approached the Committee's report in that spirit. However, we continue to believe that the information issued by the Government was not misleading and that the Government are not responsible for the losses in question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="61102m0001.htm_para16"><a name="06110297000049">The Government have accepted the Ombudsman's recommendation to review the time taken to wind up a final-salary pension scheme. I have also placed today in both Libraries a report &#147;Speeding Up Winding Up of Occupational Pension Schemes&#148; setting out our belief that it is reasonable to expect a scheme&#151;in the normal course of events&#151;to complete the key activities of winding up in two years; and containing proposals for a series of measures&#151;legislative, regulatory and administrative&#151;to help schemes achieve this target.</p>
