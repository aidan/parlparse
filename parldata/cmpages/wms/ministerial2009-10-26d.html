 The following statement provides information on the EU Informal Competitiveness Council that took place in Ume√•, Sweden on 14 and 16 October. My officials Andrew van der Lem, head of EU strategy (at the industry and internal market sessions on 14 and 15 October) and Professor Adrian Smith, director general of Science and Research (at the Research Council sessions on 15 and 16 October) represented the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="91026m0001.htm_para0"><a name="0910264000018">At the internal market session on 14 October, priorities for future EU single market policy were discussed. The Commission is planning to make proposals by 2012 on a new single market package. In discussion, member states prioritised recovery from the economic crisis and financial stability, focusing on external (i.e. outside EU) competitiveness, improving the business environment and boosting consumer confidence. The importance of implementation of the EU services directive was also stressed. The UK emphasised the need for a joined up approach to EU single market, industry and research policy, with a focus on outcomes, the evidence base and external competitiveness. The UK also stressed the need to make the EU single market more accessible. The presidency concluded there was broad support for a new Commission package on the single market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="91026m0001.htm_para1"><a name="0910264000019">At the industry session on 15 October, the presidency hosted a discussion on eco-efficiency from a competitiveness perspective, which included presentations by two businesses and a policy think-tank. The EU presidency suggested that EU member states should take a global lead in promoting growth and jobs through an eco-efficient economy. There was general support among member states that economic growth and environmental protection can be mutually reinforcing, not conflicting. However member states also stressed the need for a global "level playing field" and the importance of agreeing a global deal at the United Nations climate change conference at Copenhagen in December. In the informal breakout sessions, the UK stressed the need for the EU to be a good place to do business, for EU companies to have access to global markets, for a global carbon price to be agreed and for targeted EU funding and EU public procurement to help develop a low carbon economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="91026m0001.htm_para2"><a name="0910264000020">At the research Council sessions on 15 and 16 October, on the afternoon of the first day research ministers held discussions in break out groups on the future governance structures of the European Research Area (ERA); the outcome of these discussions was considered in a plenary session in the morning of the second day. While there was little support for the idea of establishing regular  <br>

"ERA Ministerial" meetings, there was agreement that links between research, innovation and education policies needed to be strengthened and that the mandate of the Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology (CREST) advisory committee needed to give that body a more strategic role. Ministers also discussed expected cost overruns on the international ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) nuclear fusion facility. The UK stressed the need to find an acceptable solution to the funding issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="91026m0001.htm_para4"><a name="0910264000023">The correct answer was:</p>

We therefore propose, subject to the agreement of vehicle manufacturers, that where a bereaved spouse or civil partner shares the same address as the person who was the former keeper of the car, that the requirement that the old vehicle must have been registered to the keeper continuously for 12 months before the order date of the new vehicle should be cut to six months (on a rolling basis).</p>

In line with our plans to raise the participation age to 18 our strategy will set out our ambition for every young person to receive careers education to 18. The reforms we are setting out today will make sure every young person, whatever their background, can aim for the top.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="91026m0001.htm_para7"><a name="0910264000027">Raising the quality of IAG requires a new approach, one that brings together young people, those working in business and older peers, because they are often best placed to provide an understanding of all the different types of jobs young people might aspire to and the qualifications they will need to fulfil their ambitions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="91026m0001.htm_para8"><a name="0910264000028">Children begin to think about their future careers at an early age, so our strategy will support schools and parents working together to nurture the aspirations of children and develop their strengths, whether they are practical, academic or both.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="91026m0001.htm_para9"><a name="0910264000029">This generation of young people look to the internet for knowledge in most areas. So this strategy signals a step change in online advice and guidance so young people are able to access IAG on Facebook, YouTube, blogs and other social networking sites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="91026m0001.htm_para10"><a name="0910264000030">Reflecting our approach to 21st century IAG, the strategy will include a number of new proposals:</p>
<a name="91026m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="0910264000059"><ul><p class="tabletext">piloting approaches to teaching about careers in primary school and plans for primary schools to work with universities to give younger pupils an experience of higher education and the wider world of work;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="91026m0001.htm_para11"><a name="0910264000031">This strategy has been informed and influenced by the important report "Fair Access to the Professions" by my right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) and his panel, published this summer. The plans outlined today build on my right hon. Friend's report and take forward the majority of the recommendations relevant to IAG.</p>

It puts in place the building blocks for an IAG system which gives every young person the high-quality support they need to release their talents, thus setting them on the path to success.</p>

The guidance introduced new guidance on managing terrorist offenders, improved guidance on the particular demands of managing children and young persons within MAPPA, detailed guidance on the vital issue of disclosure of information about offenders, and the use of a new national documents set. The guidance represents a significant step forward in terms of establishing a detailed MAPPA framework with agreed good practice and performance standards to ensure consistent application of MAPPA across the country.</p>
