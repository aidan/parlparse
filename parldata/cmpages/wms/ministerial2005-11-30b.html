<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51130m01.html_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport  (Tessa Jowell): </b> 
 The Informal EU Gender Equality Council hosted by the UK presidency took place in Birmingham on 8&#150;9 November. Together with ministerial colleagues, my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn) and Baroness Crawley, I chaired this meeting which included visits to innovative community projects from across the west midlands tackling the problems of gender inequality.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m01.html_para2"><a name="stpa_2">In addition to 15 Ministers from across Europe with responsibility for gender equality, I was delighted to welcome Rachel Mayanja, the UN Secretary General&#039;s Special Adviser on Gender Equality and the Advancement of Women, Anna Zaborska, Chair of the European Parliament&#039;s Women&#039;s Committee and Vladimir Spidla, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m01.html_para3"><a name="stpa_3">On Tuesday 8 November, Ministers were divided into groups to visit community projects brought together in two venues in Birmingham. My colleague Meg Munn, visited a community arts centre called &quot;The Custard Factory&quot; and I hosted the other group of Ministers who visited a converted pub in Balsall Heath, now a thriving centre of education as part of South Birmingham College. At each venue we had the opportunity to talk to a number of women about their projects and to learn about good practice in the United Kingdom. The areas covered by the projects included rural enterprise, education and training, business start-ups, confidence-raising, gender equality in the business world and the promotion of technology and enterprise for young girls.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m01.html_para4">A number of Ministers commented that they found this part of the Informal to be the most innovative as it gave them a chance to speak to individual women who had experienced various forms of disadvantage and to hear their stories.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m01.html_para5"><a name="stpa_4">On the second day, after a short welcome speech from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, Ministers broke into three small groups chaired by the UK, Austria and Finland (the current and two succeeding Presidencies) for detailed discussions and an exchange of good practice. These discussions were based on questions prepared by the Presidency and sent to the Ministers in advance. The three themes flowed from the preceding Gender Equality Conference. These were:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;Breaking the Barriers&quot;, which included issues such as breaking down traditional stereotypes of women&#039;s work and occupational segregation, the kind of support needed for women entrepreneurs and using taxation and incentive policies to break employment barriers;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;Making work work&quot; covering successful work-life balance initiative, childcare and how women can achieve economic security in retirement, and</p>

</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m01.html_para6"><a name="stpa_5">Discussions in these groups were lively and informative, aided in part by the smaller numbers of participants. In the subsequent Plenary session, each chair reported back on some of the key issues discussed and highlighted examples of good practice that were shared in their group. In discussion, Ministers agreed that the key issues affecting gender equality include:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">The demographic challenge, meaning that people were living longer and having fewer children;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">The gender pay gap;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">Occupational segregation;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">The need for increased involvement of men in caring responsibilities and domestic tasks;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">The low status and consequent lower pay of many women&#039;s jobs;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">Women&#039;s lower pensions caused by interrupted working patterns and lower pay;</p>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m01.html_para7"><a name="stpa_6">During the Ministerial meeting a number of speakers also identified the need to increase the number of women in the labour market if Europe is to increase economic growth, productivity and competitiveness. The links between this and the EU &quot;Lisbon Strategy&quot; were made with particular reference to retaining women in the labour market.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m01.html_para8"><a name="stpa_7">Ministers agreed that the opportunity to share and exchange practical examples of good practice, which worked in their Member States, with other colleagues, had been extremely useful and hoped that it could be built on in the future.

<p>
<a name="51130m01.html_para9"><a name="stpa_8">At the end of the meeting, a presidency statement was issued which will be formally presented to the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council on 8&#150;9 December. I attach a copy to this Statement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m01.html_para10"><a name="stpa_9">Presidency Statement
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m01.html_para11"><a name="stpa_10"><i>Statement made by the UK Presidency at the Conclusion of the Ministerial Meeting on Gender Equality in Birmingham on 9 November 2005</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m01.html_para12"><a name="stpa_11">1. Ten years ago in Beijing the United Nations drew up a Declaration and a Platform for Action that has been the template for progress on gender equality ever since. The enthusiasm and commitment of the national delegates and representatives of civil society, who worked day and night on the text, helped to inspire the development within the European Union of a strong legislative base for gender equality and innovative policies for women&#039;s empowerment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m01.html_para13"><a name="stpa_12">2. Together the Luxembourg and United Kingdom Presidencies were determined to lead the EU to a strong reaffirmation of the Declaration and Platform for Action to mark their tenth anniversary. This began with a Conference and Informal Ministerial meeting in Luxembourg in February, that reviewed progress in all EU Member States towards the goals in the Platform for Action, and provided a comparative review of the institutional mechanisms for promoting gender equality within Member States. The Luxembourg Conference report provides an important basis for future comparative EU study, and the Common Ministerial Declaration (adopted by Ministers of EU Member States responsible for gender equality on 4 February) provides a strong statement of support for the Beijing Platform for Action.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m01.html_para14"><a name="stpa_13">3. In March the Luxembourg Presidency led a very strong EU delegation to the 49th session of the Commission on the Status of Women at the United Nations, where, in no small part due to the determination of the EU, we secured a full and universal reaffirmation of the Beijing Declaration with a renewed emphasis on the importance of gender equality for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. These goals were reviewed at the Millennium Review Summit in September, where the UK led the EU delegation. The Outcome Document of the Summit makes even stronger linkages between the Beijing Declaration and the MDGs, including a reference to making the goals of full and productive employment and decent work for all, including women, a central objective of relevant international policies as well as national development strategies, including those aimed at poverty reduction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m01.html_para15"><a name="stpa_14">4. Education and economic empowerment are key to promoting women&#039;s advancement in all of the areas identified in the Beijing Platform for Action. An educated woman who has marketable skills and equal rights in the workplace can better resist discrimination in other arenas. Women, as 50 per cent. of the EU population offer great economic and social resources of creativity, entrepreneurship and community cohesion. But economic empowerment, and gender equality, requires an effective legislative base and a wide range of policies, at national and local levels, and in business, for success. Within the EU we now have a strong legislative base, with the conclusion of negotiations on the 





<br>&nbsp;<br>30 Nov 2005 : Column 22WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

extension of protection against discrimination on the grounds of gender into the field of goods and services. Therefore at the UK Presidency Gender Equality Conference and Ministerial Meeting in Birmingham we concentrated on sharing our experience of practical interventions and policy initiatives that deliver economic empowerment for women and gender equality for women and men.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m01.html_para16"><a name="stpa_15">5. Alongside practical examples from many EU Member States, generously shared by representatives from governments, business, trade unions, academics and civil society, we also considered ideas that have been successful in the developing world. And Ministers, prior to their own very valuable discussions, visited community projects based in the West Midlands&#151;several funded by the EU&#151;to see how local initiatives can make a significant difference to the economic chances of disadvantaged women, particularly to those experiencing multiple discrimination. These projects working with the specific needs of Minority Ethnic women, women in business, training and education of women, young female entrepreneurs, women facing social exclusion and support for women in rural enterprise, represent a microcosm of the complexity and diversity of issues facing women in their everyday lives across Europe, and, highlight the challenges faced by policy and decision makers to achieving full gender equality.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m01.html_para17"><a name="stpa_16">6. We were strongly influenced in our work by the mid-term review of the EU Lisbon Strategy. This strategy recognises overtly that gender equality and the advancement of women are fundamental to the achievement of full employment, sustained economic growth and social cohesion, as well as the promotion of knowledge and innovation in Europe, the reinforcement of social protection and the eradication of poverty. We encourage all Member States to ensure that their future annual Lisbon implementation reports, (which will report on their National Reform Programmes for 2005&#150;08), are fully mainstreamed&#151;in particular that; any targets and data are disaggregated by gender; that the goals of women&#039;s employment and the provision of good childcare are properly resourced; and, that the Integrated Guidelines on Growth and Jobs for 2005&#150;08, are heeded, (with particular reference to Guideline No 18 &quot;promoting a lifecycle approach to work&quot;). The EU Lisbon Strategy must be achieved by full acknowledgement of the importance of gender equality.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m01.html_para18"><a name="stpa_17">7. The EU made a firm commitment, renewed in Luxembourg in February, to continue its work on different aspects of the Beijing Platform for Action by the development and collection of helpful and relevant indicators. It was also agreed that this year no new specific indicators would be developed, so that Member States could focus on implementation of the Platform in its entirety. In 2006 this work will recommence under the leadership of the Austrian and Finnish Presidencies, including a focus on gender equality health indicators. However, in due course, this will be greatly assisted as a result of work done under Luxembourg and the UK this year on the establishment of the European Gender Institute. This, and the Recast Directive that simplifies and streamlines the existing gender equality acquis, have been the primary focus of our work in Council.






<br>&nbsp;<br>30 Nov 2005 : Column 23WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m01.html_para19">8. The Presidency is proud of the EU&#039;s record of achievements in the field of gender equality but is all too well aware of the work that remains to be done. We believe that our emphasis at the Presidency Conference and Ministerial in Birmingham, on women&#039;s economic empowerment, in the context of the Beijing Declaration and the Lisbon Strategy, is an important one, and has provided the opportunity for significant and purposeful conversations between practitioners from across the EU, and more widely. We are pleased that the European Commission plans to reprise the theme of women&#039;s employment and work-life balance as the central part of its Third Annual Report to Heads of State and Government, (to be presented at the Spring Council in March 2006). This UK Presidency Statement will be presented to the Employment, Health and Social Affairs Council for consideration on 8&#150;9 December.

The Commission stressed the importance of better co-coordination of work between Justice and Home Affairs, External Relations and Development and of increasing partnership with countries of origin and transit on migration issues. They particularly highlighted the need to improve engagement with sub-Saharan countries and to reinforce dialogue with Neighbouring countries. The Commission also hoped that the reform of the financial instruments would enable them to respond more quickly and effectively to urgent migration related situations.

White Paper &quot;Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century&quot; (Cm 5086) and comments on the National Director for Learning Disabilities report &quot;The Story So Far&#151;A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century&quot; which was published in March this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m03.html_para0"><a name="stpa_80">Valuing People is a cross-Government strategy. In last year&#039;s annual report, &quot;Valuing People: Moving Forward Together&quot;, we described areas where Government Departments worked with learning disabled people to ensure that they could be more fully included in society. It recorded a wide range of activity covering many aspects of daily life. In this year&#039;s annual report &quot;Valuing People: Making things better&quot; we have described:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">the work of the Learning Disability Task Force &#151;which has changed the way it works in order to focus on the things that are really important for people with a learning disability;</p>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">policies set up by the Department for Education and Skills such as &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;, the Early Support programme and &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot; to look at how children with learning disabilities and their families can have services that meet their specific needs. Through encouraging more joined up working, DfES have also been addressing the issues faced by young people during the transition period when leaving school and becoming an adult;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">issues around choice and control for people with learning disabilities and how individual budgets can help increase people&#039;s choices. In the Department of Health, the Valuing People Support team&#039;s &quot;In Control&quot; project has been testing out how to make individual budgets happen for certain groups of people and we aim to learn from this; and</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">the work being done to make people with learning disabilities&#039; day to day lives better: such as improving transport services and, under new laws such as the Disability Discrimination Act, helping make information about transport easier to understand.</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m03.html_para1"><a name="stpa_81">Today&#039;s report, like last year&#039;s, is written in an accessible form, using pictures and straightforward, jargon-free language. It is important that people with learning disabilities can see for themselves what is being done to improve the services they use and to increase the opportunities available to them to lead the type of life the rest of us take for granted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m03.html_para2"><a name="stpa_82">Valuing People said that it would take a minimum of five years for its programme to be implemented.

I am also hopeful that the Council will be able to agree the draft Strategy and Action Plan on Radicalisation and Recruitment, looking at the contributing factors involved and how they can be addressed.

To reflect this, I hope to achieve agreement to the draft Strategy on External Relations at the Council.

This reflects the priority which we as a presidency have given civil justice. Our citizens live increasingly cross-border lives: they live, work, buy and sell across Europe&#039;s borders. EU co-operation in civil judicial matters can bring practical benefits to the lives of citizens across Europe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m03.html_para12"><a name="stpa_92">At the Council, I hope that we can reach a general approach on the European Order for Payment. On the European Small Claims regulation, I hope to confirm the emerging consensus on the key principles of an effective European small claims procedure. Our aim is to achieve an accelerated and simplified procedure, as contemplated in the Tampere conclusions and re-stated in the Hague programme, based on the principle of proportionality. Lastly we intend to use the Council to reach a broad agreement on the text of the draft Directive on Mediation, subject to outstanding questions of scope and subsidiarity and pending the opinion of the European Parliament.

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51130m04.html_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for International Development  (Hilary Benn): </b> 
 I am placing in the Libraries of both Houses copies of the new Government paper &quot;Harm Reduction: Tackling Drug use and HIV in the Developing world.&quot; This paper is published by DFID today in conjunction with seven other Government Departments: the Cabinet Office, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department of Health, HM Treasury, the Home Office and the Department for Work and Pensions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m04.html_para0"><a name="stpa_96">Drug injection with contaminated needles and syringes is one of the major means of transmission of HIV and hepatitis C in Europe, Asia and Latin America. It is also driving HIV transmission in North Africa and the Middle East and is becoming an increasing problem in Africa. <sup>1</sup>  For example, in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa, injecting drug use appears to be higher than has previously been realised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m04.html_para1"><a name="stpa_97">The paper primarily focuses on the prevention of drug-related harm, rather than the prevention of drug use per se. This includes reducing different kinds of harm whether health, social and economic. In the context of HIV and other blood borne diseases, harm reduction aims to reduce the health and social consequences of injecting drugs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m04.html_para2"><a name="stpa_98">There is substantial evidence about the effectiveness of harm reduction in preventing HIV infection among Injecting Drug Users (IDUs), especially needle and syringe exchange programmes from many countries. For example in the UK and Australia HIV infection rates among Injecting Drug Users are much lower (less than 2 per cent.) than in countries without or with insufficient programmes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m04.html_para3"><a name="stpa_99">Harm reduction programmes as part of a comprehensive plan for HIV prevention, treatment and care could save millions of lives every year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m04.html_para4"><a name="stpa_100">The Government view harm reduction as an important part of the overall HIV prevention strategy in countries with serious HIV epidemics among Injecting Drug Users, as well as in countries without serious HIV epidemics where harm reduction helps maintain low prevalence rates. We are working across Government to address this issue and have jointly agreed next steps. These are outlined in the paper, and cover: 1) the UK Government&#039;s understanding of harm reduction in the context of HIV; 2) the international approach for harm reduction; and 3) DFID&#039;s support and approach for harm reduction in developing countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m04.html_para5"><a name="stpa_101">DFID&#039;s approach focuses on piloting, or assisting in the national implementation of harm reduction including needle and syringe programmes, safer injecting, substitution therapy, social marketing of condoms, and peer education through government partners, and international and local NGOs.

It will be the first high speed commuter service this country has seen. In 2012 Govia will provide the flagship Olympic Javelin rail service that helped London secure the Olympic games. This will link St. Pancras and Stratford in less than eight minutes.

The franchise contract is for eight years with the final two years dependent on service performance achieving preset targets.

<p>
<a name="51130m04.html_para11"><a name="stpa_105">There has been significant investment in the franchise region in recent years. The taxpayer has invested more than &#163;600 million in new rolling stock in Kent in the last three years. In addition, Kent has seen &#163;93 million of investment in power supply, stations, depots and related infrastructure. Some &#163;250 million will be invested in the new high speed trains.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m04.html_para12"><a name="stpa_106">The total subsidy for IKF is &#163;585 million over the eight years. It is therefore justifiable for the new operator to increase fares by 3 per cent. above inflation from January 2007 for five years to ensure there is fair balance between the taxpayer and fare paying passenger.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51130m04.html_para13"><a name="stpa_107">I am satisfied that the competition for the franchise has resulted in a contract that represents very good value for taxpayer. It is a tough contract on which Govia will be expected to deliver. It will help support the new housing and economic opportunities in the Thames Gateway area and region beyond.
