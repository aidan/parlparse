<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51215m01.html_spmin1"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Ms Harriet Harman): </b> 
 My right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor has made the following written ministerial statement.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;The judicial pension schemes are mainly governed by the Judicial Pensions Act 1981 and the Judicial Pensions Act 1993.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">I have concluded that, as administrator of the judicial pension schemes, it would be in the best interests of the members that, for the future, the schemes should not be registered schemes for the purposes of the Finance Act 2004.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">The principal effect will be that lump sum benefits payable from, and members contributions payable to, the schemes will cease to attract tax relief from 6 April 2006. Income tax will, of course, also continue to be payable on pension benefits. Judicial pension benefits will consequentially not be taken into account for the purposes of the registered pension schemes provisions of the Finance Act 2004 as they will not receive the preferential tax treatment afforded to such schemes.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">I also propose to make provision for judges to receive a long service award which will become payable when they near retirement. The level of the award, which will be a proportion of the lump sum, will reflect their years of service and their judicial grade and will ensure their net position is maintained. I will amend judicial terms and conditions to reflect this proposal.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">There will be an adjustment to the rate of contributions for dependants&#039; benefits and certain technical changes to the schemes needed to reflect the terms of the Finance Act will be made under powers contained in that Act.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">I am satisfied that these proposals are in accordance with the terms of the Finance Act 2004. They serve to maintain but not improve the overall remuneration package for the serving judiciary and to protect the principle of judicial independence in so doing. There will be no net cost to the Exchequer. In these circumstances, it is not necessary for me to introduce separate legislation for judicial pensions and I do not therefore propose to proceed with the Bill which was announced in May this year.&quot;</p>

<a name="subhd_2">
<a name="51215m01.html_sbhd2"><h4 align=center>Compulsory Purchase Law</h4>












<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51215m01.html_spmin2"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Yvette Cooper): </b> 
 The Deputy Prime Minister has today placed copies of his response to the Law Commission&#039;s report: &quot;Towards a Compulsory Purchase Code&quot; in both Libraries of the House and has also placed the response on the ODPM website www.odpm.gov.uk/planning-information. The Commission presented their report to Parliament in two parts: on Compensation (Law Com No 286) in December 2003 and on Procedures (Law Com No 291) in December 2004.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m01.html_para2"><a name="stpa_2">In 2000 the Compulsory Purchase Policy Review Advisory Group (CPPRAG) had recommended changing the compulsory purchase of land powers, procedures and compensation arrangements. The most pressing changes were put in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and included strengthening local authority powers to acquire land for the creation of sustainable communities as well as making the compensation fairer to those losing their land.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m01.html_para3"><a name="stpa_3">CPPRAG also proposed the Government should work with the Law Commission on how to replace the whole of the current raft of statute and case law on compulsory purchase and compensation by a single statute expressed in modern language. ODPM and its predecessor Departments (DETR and DTLR), along with the Welsh Assembly Government, have been working on this with the Commission since 2000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m01.html_para4"><a name="stpa_4">Although the Commission&#039;s recommendations identify a basic framework for reforming the structure of the law, they do not set out the detailed provisions needed to ensure fairness to those affected, as well as speed and simplicity. The ever-evolving complexity of the statute and case law has shown that these aims cannot always easily be reconciled. As the Law Commission has demonstrated, there are no quick and easy solutions and moving towards a simpler and more readily accessible set of laws would still require substantial further work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m01.html_para5"><a name="stpa_5">The Government would like to have a single simple compulsory purchase code expressed in modern English. But finding further legislative time for this needs to be balanced against the Government&#039;s many other priorities. Given the changes providing immediate and tangible improvements were in the 2004 Act, implementing the Law Commission&#039;s proposals is not a practicable proposition for the foreseeable future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m01.html_para6"><a name="stpa_6">The Government consider it more important to maintain a stable legislative framework providing certainty both for acquiring authorities and for those whose properties may need to be acquired. This should encourage acquiring authorities to exercise their compulsory purchase powers wherever this makes sense in the public interest to further their wider policy objectives.
</p>

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51215m01.html_spmin3"><b>The Minister for Local Government  (Mr. Phil Woolas): </b> 
 The Government have today published a Discussion Paper about standards of conduct in English local government. It sets out our vision for a future comprehensive conduct regime for local authority members and employees. Such a regime would need to 





<br>&nbsp;<br>15 Dec 2005 : Column 163WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

be part of our future strategy for local government, and hence this is published as part of the ongoing local vision debate begun by the Government last year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m01.html_para7"><a name="stpa_7">The paper incorporates the Government&#039;s response to the recommendations on conduct in local government in Chapter three of the 10th report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life (Graham Committee). It also incorporates our response to the report of the ODPM Select Committee on the role and effectiveness of the Standards Board for England, as well as a response to the recommendations of the Board itself following its review of the code of conduct for members.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m01.html_para8"><a name="stpa_8">We have largely accepted the recommendations of the Graham Committee; in particular its central recommendation for a more locally based decision-making process for the conduct regime. Accordingly, we have not accepted the recommendation of the ODPM Select Committee to maintain the present centralised regime for handling allegations of misconduct by members. We have, however, largely accepted the other recommendations made by the Select Committee.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m01.html_para9"><a name="stpa_9">The paper also indicates the approach the Government are minded to follow on the conduct of employees, in particular on the political restrictions which apply to local government employees, the pay of political assistants and a code of conduct for employees. In reaching these views, the Government have had regard to the responses received to the consultation that the Office undertook on these issues last year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m01.html_para10"><a name="stpa_10">We believe that the approach set out in the paper would both deliver a clearer and more proportionate conduct regime for local government members and employees, and ensure that the public can continue to have confidence in those who serve them. We now intend to work with the Standards Board and other stakeholders to carry forward the changes identified in the paper, having regard to any comments and debate the paper itself generates. The Government recognise that certain of these changes would require primary legislation and it intends to seek this at the next convenient opportunity Parliamentary time allows.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m01.html_para11"><a name="stpa_11">Copies of the paper have been placed in the Libraries of the House.

<a name="subhd_5">
<a name="51215m02.html_sbhd0"><h4 align=center>Reducing Reoffending through Skills and Employment</h4>












<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51215m02.html_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Ruth Kelly): </b> 
 I am today, with my right hon. friends the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, presenting to the House a document setting out our strategy to help reduce re-offending through improved skills and employment opportunities for offenders.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m02.html_para0"><a name="stpa_13">The Government will publish in the new year a five-year strategy for reducing re-offending and protecting the public. This will emphasise the importance of punishment and deterrence in preventing offending. But it will also recognise the need to deal with the range of factors which lead some offenders into a cycle of repeat offending. This cycle carries a considerable cost to the Exchequer: a re-offending former prisoner costs the criminal justice system an average of &#163;65,000 up to the point of re-imprisonment and &#163;37,500 each year in prison. On top of this, there are often unquantifiable costs to the victims of crime and their communities.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m02.html_para1"><a name="stpa_14">An important part of the Government strategy is a concerted drive to transform the skills and employment prospects of offenders. The challenge is stark. A majority of offenders have poor skills, with over half having no qualifications at all. Nearly half have experienced exclusion from school. Two thirds were unemployed before prison.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m02.html_para2"><a name="stpa_15">Evidence suggests that employment and a reduction in re-offending are linked, and that stability and quality of employment are key factors. Accordingly, there is a strong case, as part of our wider strategy, for seeking to get more offenders into jobs, and to raise their skill levels in order to improve their chances of becoming more productive and successful in employment, to the benefit of individuals, their families, and the wider society that would be damaged by continued offending.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m02.html_para3"><a name="stpa_16">A great deal of progress has been made in recent years. Increased investment has raised the capacity of the prison education service, and improved basic skills training for offenders in the community. Achievement of qualifications in literacy, language and numeracy has more than doubled since 2001. Prisons are subject to the same demanding standards of external inspection as other education providers, and this is driving up quality. Jobcentre Plus offers employment and training advice to offenders in prisons and, with the help of additional Prison Service investment, in 2004&#150;05 there were over 41,000 cases in which an offender leaving prison went directly into employment, training or education.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m02.html_para4"><a name="stpa_17">But there is more to do. Inspection evidence tells us that the quality of learning and skills in prisons is still too often inadequate, and unresponsive to individual needs. We need more coherence in assessment, planning and continuity between different settings, for example when prisoners are moved at short notice, or released into the community. We also need to do better in engaging and motivating particular groups of offenders to improve their skills. Opportunities for education and training must lead to skills and qualifications that are meaningful for employers and to real job opportunities.






<br>&nbsp;<br>15 Dec 2005 : Column 165WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m02.html_para5"><a name="stpa_18">We intend to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the sentencing reforms of the Criminal Justice Act 2003&#151;which make rehabilitation one of the statutory purposes of sentence&#151;together with the creation of the National Offender Management Service, to build a new approach. The strategy is set out in the document, &quot;Reducing Re-offending Through Skills and Employment&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m02.html_para6"><a name="stpa_19">The document sets out the case for action and outlines a radical vision to make a step change in four main areas:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">to focus strongly on jobs for offenders, with employers driving the design and delivery of programmes, and new approaches to get offenders into work;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">to ensure that training providers and colleges are better able to provide the skills offenders need to get a job;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">to promote a new emphasis on skills and jobs for offenders across prisons and probation services; and</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">to motivate and engage offenders, through a new &quot;employability contract&quot;, with a strong emphasis on rights and responsibilities.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m02.html_para7"><a name="stpa_20">Some action can begin at once. In other areas we propose to test new approaches in order to make the best use of the resources and capacity within the system. We look forward to the widest possible debate&#151;with employers, with the learning and skills sector, and with colleagues working in prisons, probation and in jobcentres.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m02.html_para8"><a name="stpa_21">This may in the past have been an area of education and training that has had a low profile. Along with my right honourable friends I am determined that we should set a new ambition: to provide more offenders with the tools and motivation to turn away from crime and become employable and productive members of society.

 On 26 October, I announced an independent review of the UK&#039;s avian quarantine system. The review panel, chaired by Professor Nigel Dimmock, Emeritus Professor of Virology at Warwick University, examined the avian quarantine system as a whole.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m02.html_para13"><a name="stpa_26">The independent review group has concentrated on the principles of the system, assessed how effective it is and given recommendations about how it might be improved.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">Imports of captive birds should be permitted to continue. However, existing quarantine procedures should be improved to further reduce the risk, and should be kept under review.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">Because imports into the EU are governed by EU rules, and movements within the Community are less rigorously controlled, the health protection provided by avian quarantine of imported captive birds can only be achieved if action is taken at EU level.</p>

In total we estimate they will result in payment to miners and their estates of up to &#163;5 billion in compensation. We are about halfway through the schemes and more than &#163;2.8 billion has been paid out in compensation so far. As the report notes, and as Members in coal mining constituencies will be aware, significant sums have been paid out in the coal areas equivalent to around 3.5 per cent. of local annual income. Current expenditure is nearly &#163;2 million a day.






<br>&nbsp;<br>15 Dec 2005 : Column 174WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para16">In short, I think that the Government are fully facing up to their obligations to discharge these liabilities. Given the scale of the task, it is important that there is confidence that the schemes are being well run. I am therefore pleased to take from the report the assurance that:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">the administration of the schemes is basically sound although there are lessons to be learned about how the schemes were put into operation;</p>

<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">that, aside from continuing efficiency improvements, no major changes are needed to improve the running of the schemes; and</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">that the fraud procedures in place are appropriate.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para17"><a name="stpa_86">The report also rejects the argument that the Union of Democratic Mineworkers were granted more favourable terms over other parties and confirms that arrangements with the UDM effectively provided identical compensation to that under the &quot;Agreements with the Claimants Group&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para18"><a name="stpa_87">The report also makes a number of specific recommendations. The Department fully accepts those recommendations which are directed at it and will follow them through in the months ahead. I will report to the House as appropriate on this.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para19"><a name="stpa_88">I wish to comment at this point, however, on the report&#039;s specific conclusions and recommendations in three areas, namely the initial design of the scheme; the issue of the costs of administering the scheme, including legal costs; and the issue of transparency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para20"><a name="stpa_89">On the basic design of the schemes, the report concludes that the arrangements put in place in the late 1990s were not the best way to administer compensation for so many people; and it goes on to recommend that, were a similar case to arise in future, the Government &quot;should very carefully examine alternative ways of proceeding&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para21"><a name="stpa_90">I agree with this recommendation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para22"><a name="stpa_91">When the basic groundwork for the current schemes was put in place in the late 1990s, no one knew that we would have anything like as many as 700,000 claims under the schemes; and, in particular, that we would have so many relatively low value claims. The existing schemes are now well established and we have introduced radical changes to the lung disease scheme in the last twelve months to speed up the processing of significant numbers of claims.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para23"><a name="stpa_92">Any further substantive changes to the existing schemes would run the risk of delaying the payment of claims which would be to no one&#039;s benefit. Moreover, given that we are in the last few years of the current schemes now is not the time for further redesign. But were we to face such circumstances again, we would undoubtedly want to think long and hard about whether there are better alternatives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para24"><a name="stpa_93">The second key issue which the report raises is the question of costs and solicitors&#039; costs in particular.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para25"><a name="stpa_94">In commenting on this, I should first make clear the considerable contribution to the running of the scheme that has been made by the various firms of solicitors involved. The schemes are complex; and it is entirely right and proper that miners and their families should have professional legal support through this process, funded by the Government under the legal obligations we inherited from British Coal.






<br>&nbsp;<br>15 Dec 2005 : Column 175WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para26">But the report nonetheless points out that the legal cost structures were largely negotiated, along with the agreements themselves, at a time when the anticipated volumes of cases under the schemes were considerably lower than has proved to be the case. It would be wrong not to recognise that higher than anticipated volumes of cases undoubtedly bring opportunities for batch processing and reduced costs per case. The report also notes that not every claim will always require the assistance of qualified legal professionals and that the cost to public funds &quot;does not now necessarily reflect the more routine nature of the work&quot;. The report recommends, therefore, that we consider whether there is more to be done in this area, with the aim of ensuring that legal costs more accurately reflect the nature of the work actually undertaken.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para27"><a name="stpa_95">This is an issue the Department is already actively pursuing. In particular, we believe that the new &quot;fast-track&quot; approach we have implemented this year for the lung disease scheme should require significantly less input by solicitors and should therefore incur considerably reduced costs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para28"><a name="stpa_96">We have argued that case with the solicitors&#039; representatives and, indeed, before the High Court. We have now taken the issue to the Court of Appeal. I do not think it appropriate to comment in detail at this stage. But significant sums in legal costs&#151;perhaps up to &#163;200 million of taxpayers money&#151;are at stake.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para29"><a name="stpa_97">There are also other areas where we have yet to reach agreement with the claimants&#039; solicitors on costs and we will be pursuing these equally vigorously to ensure they reflect work done and a reasonable level of return.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para30"><a name="stpa_98">More generally, I regret that legal costs have become the source of such contention. It is right that solicitors are properly rewarded for the work they have done. But claimants representatives will recognise that it does no good whatsoever to the reputation of themselves or their profession if they are perceived in the press and elsewhere, rightly or wrongly, as being primarily motivated by fee earning opportunities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para31"><a name="stpa_99">In this context, the report also discusses the concern that in some cases solicitors have taken money from claimants&#039; compensation to cover costs even though legal costs are met by the Government, and that, again in some cases, union fees have been deducted from compensation. Both issues are discussed in the report in some detail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para32"><a name="stpa_100">Clearly, it would be wholly unacceptable for deductions to be made from any compensation payment without the claimant&#039;s agreement, though the report notes that, as far as they were aware, there were no examples of that happening. But the report equally suggests that in some cases, claimants appear to have been invited to agree to make such contributions without it being crystal clear to them that such donations were a matter for their choice and that other solicitors would not seek to make them. That would strike me, to say the least, as questionable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para33"><a name="stpa_101">These are essentially matters about conduct within the legal profession and the Department has no direct role. We have, however, raised the issues with the Law Society in the past and will continue to make clear to them the importance of taking these issues forward rigorously and proactively. There is again legal action in prospect, though not involving the Department. The 





<br>&nbsp;<br>15 Dec 2005 : Column 176WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

report does however make a specific recommendation that, subject to the outcome of any legal action in this area, the legal profession should take forward the issue of claimants who were not made fully aware that they were free to use solicitors who did not make any deductions. The report calls on the legal profession to take this forward. I urge them to do so&#151;and I will follow up this issue with the Law Society.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m04.html_para34"><a name="stpa_102">Third, we have also taken steps immediately to address the recommendation about greater availably of information about the schemes.

 On 10 June 2005 I launched stage 2 of a two-stage consultation process about setting the night restrictions regime at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted to run to October 2012, The consultation paper explained that we intended to continue the present night restrictions regime for a further year from 30 October 2005 until 29 October 2006.

</p>

<a name="51215m05.html_sbhd2"><h4 align=center>Road Safety Cameras</h4>












<p><a name="st_19"><a name="51215m05.html_spmin2"><b>The Secretary of State for Transport  (Mr. Alistair Darling): </b> 
 I am today publishing an independent research report which confirms the effectiveness of the national safety camera programme over the four years from April 2000 to March 2004. I am also announcing changes which will end the current ring-fencing of funding for safety cameras, and will give much more local flexibility and accountability, both on funding and in other respects, to local authorities, the police and the other agencies who are involved in improving road safety at the local level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m05.html_para14"><a name="stpa_117">The four-year research report, prepared by PA Consulting and University College London, examines over 4,000 camera sites in 38 safety camera partnership areas, covering virtually the whole of Great Britain. The report finds that safety cameras continue to be highly effective in reducing speeding, accidents and casualties at camera sites:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">The number of vehicles exceeding the speed limit fell by 70 per cent. at fixed camera sites;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">After allowing for the general trend of improving road safety, there was a 22 per cent. reduction in personal injury collisions (PICs)&#151;around 4,230 fewer per annum; and</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">Again after allowing for the general trend, there was a 42 per cent. reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured (KSIs)&#151;around 1,745 fewer per annum, including over 100 fewer deaths.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m05.html_para15"><a name="stpa_118">The report also considers the &quot;regression-to-mean&quot; effect. This effect arises because the number of PICs and KSIs in the period before installation of a camera may be higher than the long-term average for that location. The report finds that, at the very small number of sites where it was possible to examine this effect, a proportion of the observed reduction in PICs and KSIs could be attributable to regression-to-mean. The report concludes that, even after allowing for this finding, safety cameras are achieving substantial and valuable reductions in collisions and casualties.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m05.html_para16"><a name="stpa_119">I have placed a copy of the PA-UCL report in the Library. It will also be available on my Department&#039;s website.






<br>&nbsp;<br>15 Dec 2005 : Column 179WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m05.html_para17">I am also announcing today important changes to the national safety camera programme in England and Wales. Taking account of the findings of the four year report, we have concluded that:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">Safety cameras are delivering substantial and valuable reductions in accidents and casualties;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">The current netting-off funding arrangements have enabled a rapid programme of investment in safety cameras;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">The safety camera programme is now more mature, with some camera partnerships seeking few or no additional camera sites, as many of the worst casualty sites where a camera is the right solution have now been dealt with.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m05.html_para18"><a name="stpa_120">It is therefore now timely that camera activity and partnerships are integrated into the wider road safety delivery process. For the future we are going to give greater flexibility to local authorities, the police and the other agencies who work with them to improve road safety, so that they can pursue whichever locally agreed mix of road safety measures will make the greatest contribution to reducing road casualties in their area. As part of this process the responsibility for safety cameras in Wales will transfer to the National Assembly for Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m05.html_para19"><a name="stpa_121">Therefore, 2006&#150;07 will be the last year of the netting-off funding arrangements for safety cameras in England and Wales. I understand that the Scottish Ministers are also considering the future of the hypothecated Safety Camera Programme in Scotland, and will announce their decision in due course.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m05.html_para20"><a name="stpa_122">For 2007&#150;08 and beyond, my department will enhance the overall level of funding for road safety provided to local highway authorities in England through the Local Transport Plan (LTP) process. For the first time a proportion of this funding will be revenue based.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m05.html_para21"><a name="stpa_123">The enhanced funding will be allocated to authorities in accordance with their road safety needs (using the existing LTP road safety formula) and with the quality of their second round LTP submissions and delivery record. We will also provide enhanced funding to Transport for London. My Department is writing to all highway authorities in England to provide details of this change, and inviting them to reflect this new flexibility in their LTP submissions due in March 2006.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m05.html_para22"><a name="stpa_124">We propose to allocate some &#163;110 million a year for this enhanced funding over the period 2007&#150;08 to 2010&#150;11. As well as the greater flexibility, this will provide financial stability and facilitate long term planning. It is also a substantial increase in funding for road safety, by comparison with the latest projection of 2005&#150;06 expenditure by safety camera partnerships in England which is some &#163;93 million.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m05.html_para23"><a name="stpa_125">In considering the quality of LTP submissions, we will have regard to, among other factors, the degree of cooperation and wider collaboration between the local authority, the police force and the other relevant agencies in the area, in respect of their road safety strategy, linkages with other areas of work and their approach to tackling individual problematic locations. We want local strategies and decisions to be well-founded, taking account of the combined knowledge and expertise of all the agencies concerned, and to avoid duplication of effort. My Department will work closely with local road safety partnerships to help them produce high quality bids, and to deliver 





<br>&nbsp;<br>15 Dec 2005 : Column 180WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

substantial casualty reductions. We will also encourage road safety partnerships to include a wider range of other organisations in local decision-making, and not restrict themselves only to police and local authorities.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m05.html_para24"><a name="stpa_126">For the final year of safety camera netting-off funding in 2006&#150;07 we are amending the handbook of &quot;Rules and Guidance&quot; to reflect the findings of the four-year report. The criteria on the location of safety cameras are being changed to ensure that cameras can be used where there is a strong road safety need. The deployment criteria will take account of all injury accidents as well as the level of KSIs, look back five years rather than three; and allow camera enforcement on routes where there is a serious problem of speeding and casualties, without the problem necessarily being concentrated at one particular location. A copy of the updated handbook will be placed in the Library and on my Department&#039;s website in due course.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m05.html_para25"><a name="stpa_127">The handbook will also make improvements to the signing of cameras, to further assist drivers to recognise and comply with the speed limit:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">Speed limit and camera signs will be co-located where possible.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">Signs will be placed to allow the sign and camera to be visible to the driver in the same view.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m05.html_para26"><a name="stpa_128">We also intend to publish shortly revised guidance to Traffic Authorities on setting local speed limits, which will request authorities to review the speed limits on their A and B roads by 2011, and to give priority to reviewing the limit on any road [not just A and B roads) on which there are poor casualty histories or there is a widespread disregard for the current speed limit, especially where safety cameras are being considered. By undertaking this review, which may lead to inappropriately low speed limits being raised as well as inappropriately high speed limits being lowered, we wish to encourage motorists to have greater respect for speed limits generally.

<a name="51215m06.html_sbhd0"><h4 align=center>Regional Air Access to London</h4>












<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51215m06.html_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Transport  (Mr Alistair Darling): </b> 
 The Government have today published guidance on the Protection of Regional Air Access to London, copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House. This guidance was foreshadowed in &quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot; White Paper (December 2003) and follows extensive consultation with stakeholders.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m06.html_para0"><a name="stpa_129">The aim of the guidance is to clarify how the Government will interpret the criteria in the relevant European Regulation (EC 2408/92) when assessing applications for Public Service Obligations (PSOs) to protect existing regional air services to London. A more precise definition of the criteria will provide a firmer basis for the discussion of individual cases with both airlines and regional bodies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m06.html_para1"><a name="stpa_130">&quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot; White Paper recognised the concern of regional stakeholders about the availability of landing and take-off slots at major London airports. It stated that the Government were prepared to intervene in well defined circumstances to protect slots at the London airports for regional services through imposing PSOs. Where services already exist from UK regional airports to London (defined as City, 





<br>&nbsp;<br>15 Dec 2005 : Column 181WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

Gatwick, Heathrow, Luton and Stansted airports), this intervention would guarantee a minimum level of scheduled air services on these routes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m06.html_para2"><a name="stpa_131">The criteria for PSO imposition are set out, but not precisely defined in EC Regulation 2408/92. In 2004, The Government consulted on interpretations of these criteria and the agreed definitions are set out in the guidance. The Government consider that in order to justify intervention in the market, a PSO application must illustrate the benefits to the regional and national economy that would otherwise be lost if a service was withdrawn. It will be the responsibility of regional bodies to make a case for a PSO against the criteria. In order to assist regional bodies in assembling the evidence required to demonstrate wider benefits, the guidance contains an Annex which provides a common methodology for assessing the economic benefits of maintaining an adequate air service to London, so as to ensure transparency and comparability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m06.html_para3"><a name="stpa_132">Final judgment on the eligibility of a route for PSO imposition rests with me, as Secretary of State for Transport, and would be based on the merits of each case set against the criteria in Regulation 2408/92. If an application is supported, the Department would notify the European Commission and air carriers operating the route, and a PSO would be imposed to the extent necessary to ensure on that route the adequate provision of scheduled air services satisfying fixed standards of continuity, regularity, capacity and pricing. After a PSO has been imposed on a route, European Law (Regulation 95/93 as amended) allows Member States to reserve slots at airports on that route so that an airline cannot use them for a service to an alternative destination. The reservation of slots is at the discretion of the Member State and can only take place at airports designated as &quot;co-ordinated&quot;, which in London are Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m06.html_para4"><a name="stpa_133">The Government think it unlikely that the imposition of a PSO on a route to London would require subsidy. All regional routes to London are currently commercially viable. Should subsidy be required, however, it would be the responsibility of the relevant regional body to reimburse the Department for these funds. PSOs will be reviewed every three years to ensure that their imposition is still appropriate and the obligations set out are being met.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m06.html_para5"><a name="stpa_134">In addition to clarifying the interpretation of the European Regulation, the guidance also supports a voluntary early warning system for airlines operating regional routes to London. This invites airlines to provide as much notice as possible, preferably at least four months, of their intention to withdraw from, or reduce services on routes to London. Whilst I recognise that airlines operate within a competitive commercial environment, I believe that the early warning system strikes a good balance between the need to maintain an adequate level of regional services to London, and limiting the Government intervention in the market. 





<br>&nbsp;<br>15 Dec 2005 : Column 182WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

The system offers regional partners together with the Government the time and opportunity to explore all potential solutions to ensure continuity of regional services into London.

 I would like to expand upon the Pre-Budget Report 2005 announcements on the treatment of capital in the discretionary Social Fund.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m06.html_para7"><a name="stpa_136">The Government have already announced a number of significant improvements to the budgeting loan scheme to take effect from April 2006, which will amount to an increase in finding of &#163;210 million over three years. There will be further publicity about these for customers and advisers nearer April.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m06.html_para8"><a name="stpa_137">In addition, to ensure that budgeting loan recipients are not penalised for having small amounts of savings, Pre-Budget Report 2005 announced that the capital allowances available to budgeting loan applicants would be increased from April 2006. The current rules mean that capital of up to &#163;500 (for people of working age) or up to &#163;1,000 (for pensioners) is ignored when deciding whether a budgeting loan should be awarded and the amount of the loan. Capital in excess of &#163;500/&#163;1,000 will be offset against the amount of loan sought. From April 2006 the allowances will increase to &#163;1,000 (people of working age) and &#163;2,000 (pensioners).

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m06.html_para9"><a name="stpa_138">The crisis loan scheme works differently from the budgeting loan scheme, with all resources available to the applicant taken into account when deciding whether a loan can be made. There is no capital allowance and one will not be introduced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215m06.html_para10"><a name="stpa_139">The Government are also currently exploring the scope to make early improvements to the community care grant scheme, to tighten its focus on the cases with the strongest case for help. This currently operates the same capital allowances as the budgeting loan scheme and we will consider whether the same change or any other change should be made to the treatment of capital as part of this work.
