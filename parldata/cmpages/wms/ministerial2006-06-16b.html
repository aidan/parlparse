 I have today laid before the House a statutory instrument, the Local Government (Assistants for Political Groups) (Remuneration) (England) Order 2006, which provides for a rise in the maximum ceiling for the pay of political assistants employed by local authorities. The revised pay ceiling is &#163;34,986. Local authorities have discretion to set their political assistants&#146; pay up to this limit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="60616m0001.htm_para0"><a name="06061624000017">The order restores the upper limit on what local authorities may pay their political assistants to the level on the local authority pay scale which is equivalent in real terms to the limit imposed by the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 and two subsequent orders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="60616m0001.htm_para1"><a name="06061624000018">The Government's intention to make this order was stated in our discussion paper, &#147;Standards of Conduct in English Local Government&#148;, which was published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on 15 December 2005. In future, we intend that primary legislation will fix permanently the ceiling on political assistants&#146; pay to the relevant local government pay scale.</p>

 Tripartite discussions have recently taken place at the International Labour Conference convened in Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office to consider a draft recommendation relating to the employment relationship. The recommendation considered such issues as disguised employment relationships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="60616m0001.htm_para65"><a name="06061624000088">Unfortunately it was not possible to find an agreement, despite considerable efforts, that was acceptable to all parties&#151;employers, workers and Governments. Throughout the discussions, it was stressed that the recommendation was meant to be a flexible instrument, containing options for consideration by member states. Clearly national conditions and law and practice differ considerably amongst ILO members and therefore a &#147;one size fits all&#148; approach was never the intention. However, the Government fully understood the concerns of the employers that the recommendation was overly prescriptive and detailed. Given that all three parties to it were not able to agree the recommendation, the UK Government abstained in the vote on the recommendation.</p>

A command paper will be laid in Parliament in due course.</p>

Most of the final UK positions were adopted but we agreed to a longer transition period as part of the compromise. I was able to agree to the final compromise text, which does offer a satisfactory balance. An important consequence of the regulation will be that much needed transparency will be introduced into the process of awarding contracts. The agreed text is expected to go to the European Parliament for second reading under the German presidency early next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="60616m0002.htm_para1"><a name="06061624000092">The Council adopted conclusions on the mid-term review of the EU road safety action programme. Among other things, the conclusions noted that the number of fatalities on European roads had fallen by 17.5 per cent. between 2001 and 2005, welcomed the positive effects of the member states&#146; national campaigns, and agreed on the need to strengthen road safety measures and initiatives at community or member state level.</p>

While the UK is prepared in principle to support the signature, I supported the view expressed by a number of Ministers that the Council should take account of the views of a member state which is directly affected and has yet to take a view on signature, following the recent appointment of a new Government. The presidency postponed a decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="60616m0002.htm_para4"><a name="06061624000095">The Commissioner reported to the Council on a number of aspects of the Galileo satellite navigation project. He reported that the main elements of the concession contract would be in place by the end of this year, ahead of signature at the start of 2007. Further consideration of the financial details and due diligence by lenders would then take place in 2007. During a discussion, I called for the Commission to speed up decision making so we could make faster progress on the participation of third countries in Galileo. Member states were agreed that it would be desirable to have a transparent process to decide the future location of the Galileo Supervisory Authority (GSA). I put forward the case for Cardiff, the UK bid, on which the Welsh Assembly Government are leading.</p>
