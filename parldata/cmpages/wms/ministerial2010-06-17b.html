 I am pleased to inform Parliament that the Government are announcing today a series of measures aimed at boosting economic recovery. These measures will give further education colleges and training organisations greater freedom to deliver the education and training that employers and individuals need, and to raise opportunities for lifelong learning through a system that is freed of unnecessary bureaucracy, and driven by empowered, informed learners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="100617m0001.htm_para0"><a name="100617121000018">The main measures are:</p>
<a name="100617m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="100617121000062"><ul><p class="tabletext">All colleges, except those which are performing poorly, to be given new freedoms to move money between budgets. This will allow them to respond quickly to local demand.</p>

</ul><a name="100617m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="100617121000065"><ul><p class="tabletext">Giving learners the information they need to drive the system, through the publication of clear and consistent information about performance, quality and standards.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="100617m0001.htm_para1"><a name="100617121000019">I will be writing today to all colleges and training organisations about these and other changes, which will help them to focus on meeting the demands of employers and learners in their areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="100617m0001.htm_para2"><a name="100617121000020">The Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills will also be writing to the chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency-the body responsible for funding colleges and training organisations-confirming his priorities for the adult education and skills budget in 2010-11, including the refocusing of £150 million to pay for 50,000 extra apprenticeship places this year, and £50 million for new capital grants to colleges. A key goal will be to strengthen the supply of qualifications that are valued by employers; and to secure high-quality training opportunities to help unemployed people get the skills they need for work-readiness and sustainable employment; as well as encouraging an increasing number of people to participate in adult and community learning, both to re-engage those disenchanted by previous educational experience and to offer people opportunities to enrich their lives through learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="100617m0001.htm_para3"><a name="100617121000021">Underpinning these changes, we are seeking to empower learners so that they can drive the learning and skills delivered by colleges and training organisations. A professional and impartial advice and guidance service will be available to support learners. Publication of clear information about the performance of colleges and training organisations will allow learners and employers to make well-informed choices. This will include information about learner success rates, learner and employer satisfaction, and the destinations of those who leave learning. As a result of the freedoms that we are announcing  <br>

today, colleges and training organisations will be able to respond quickly and flexibly to their choices, offering a wide range of programmes that drive both high-tech innovation and new enterprise and support adult recreational learning.</p>

<p><a name="st_41"><a name="100617121000023"><a name="100617m0001.htm_spmin1"><a name="100617121000086"><b>The Minister for Housing (Grant Shapps):</b>
 Today I am announcing the Government's intention to amend the planning rules for houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) which were introduced on 6 April 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="100617m0001.htm_para5"><a name="100617121000024">I understand the concerns of local people who see their neighbourhoods being damaged by undue concentrations of HMOs and the significant impact this is having on their quality of life. However there are also many areas where HMOs are not causing problems and indeed provide an important supply of low cost housing. I believe that the planning system needs to take account of both these differing circumstances and allow for local solutions rather than continue with the present "one size fits all" approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="100617m0001.htm_para6"><a name="100617121000025">The current rules impose a blanket requirement for planning permission in order to change use from a domestic house to a HMO. When introduced, it was estimated that these rules could result in an additional 8,500 planning applications per year and could lead to a reduction in supply. This goes against the recommendations in successive reports on the planning system that Government should reduce the number of planning applications for minor development. It also runs the risk of losing low cost housing in areas where it is needed most.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="100617m0001.htm_para7"><a name="100617121000026">I believe that we need to move away from this kind of centralised, regulatory approach which has dominated planning in recent years and create a system which encourages local people to take responsibility for shaping their communities. Decisions should reflect local priorities expressed through the local plan, rather than nationally imposed rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="100617m0001.htm_para8"><a name="100617121000027">I therefore intend to amend the HMO rules to allow changes of use between family houses and small, shared houses to take place freely without the need for planning applications. However, in those areas experiencing problems with uncontrolled HMO development, local authorities will be able to use their existing direction-making powers to restrict this freedom of movement by requiring planning applications. This change will allow the free development of smaller shared housing, which is a vital component of our private rented sector, unless there is a serious threat to the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="100617m0001.htm_para9"><a name="100617121000028">My officials will work through the detail of the proposed changes with interested partners to ensure that the new rules work for local people without placing an unnecessary burden on businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="100617m0001.htm_para10"><a name="100617121000029">My aim is to have the revised arrangements in place by 1 October 2010.</p>

preparing forests for climate change, and the presidency highlighted the need to reconcile increasing water scarcity with rising demand. Ministers also agreed conclusions setting out the EU position for the forthcoming meeting of the parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety in October, and conclusions in support of the "Rio+20" UN conference on sustainable development. Lord Henley stressed the importance of concrete outputs from the conference which recognised the need for sustainability, the importance of ecosystems services and international governance in line with future climate change arrangements.</p>

In the policy debate that followed, member states welcomed the communication as providing a solid evidence base for further discussions on this issue. I intervened to underline the key message of the communication that the costs of moving to a 30% target are significant but manageable, and that they have reduced since 2008. I expressed my hope that the EU would show leadership by increasing our target to 30%, and insisted that unless we do so it is very hard to imagine that we will be able to remain on the trajectory of keeping global temperature increase to within 2°C. While a number of other member states' interventions supported these arguments, others highlighted the reduced capacity in the European economy for the investment which would be required to meet a higher target. The Council agreed conclusions on the communication which noted the need to return to the issues no later than October 2010 and welcomed the Commission's intention to conduct more detailed analysis.</p>

 The Department for Transport will shortly begin a consultation exercise on the future of rail franchising policy. This consultation will provide industry partners with the opportunity to comment on the Government's approach to rail franchising and whether bidders for longer franchises would be able to offer investment in improvements to trains and services. It will also allow the industry to set out its proposals for improving the efficiency and value for money of rail franchises, for both taxpayers and fare payers. I will set out further details to the House in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="100617m0001.htm_para36"><a name="100617121000060">It is currently expected that a new competition for the Greater Anglia franchise will be advertised by the end of the year, after the consultation responses have been considered, with the Essex Thameside franchise following in autumn 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="100617m0001.htm_para37"><a name="100617121000061">It is also expected that there will be some consequent changes to the procurement time scales previously published for the InterCity East Coast franchise. Rail services will continue to run as normal on all affected franchises. A prior information notice (PIN) setting out the Department's proposed future rail franchising programme will be issued in due course.</p>
