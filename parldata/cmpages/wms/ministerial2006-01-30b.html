<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60130m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport  (Tessa Jowell): </b> 
 The masterplan for the Olympic Park was largely developed in the second half of 2003 by the EDAW consortium and outline planning permissions were secured in autumn 2004. The candidate file submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in November 2004 and subsequently presented to the Evaluation Commission in February 2005 presented the concept of a compact games with the Olympic Park at its heart.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130m01.html_para0"><a name="stpa_0">Since winning the right to stage the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games on 6 July 2005, the masterplan has been reviewed, as part of the normal development process for a major project. This review has resulted in changes that will deliver a more compact Olympic Park, while meeting the technical specifications of the IOC. In summary, the revised masterplan will:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">Free up some land that previously had been required for the Olympic Park</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60130m01.html_para2"><a name="stpa_2">The revised plan therefore proposes realigning the village to locate approximately 80 per cent. of it on the Stratford rail lands immediately to the north of the channel tunnel rail link (CTRL).
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130m01.html_para3"><a name="stpa_3">The proposed building envelope and mix of uses complies with Stratford City&#039;s existing planning permissions and will provide a village of a similar high standard to that proposed in the original masterplan.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130m01.html_para4"><a name="stpa_4">This move will enable an earlier start on the village, allowing building work on almost half of it to begin before power lines have been placed underground.

 In my statement on 12 December 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1119&#150;21, following my appearance at the Public Administration Select Committee oral evidence session on the operation of the FEPOW scheme, I told the House that I had commissioned a review into the extent to which inconsistent eligibility criteria had been used for deciding claims before and after the introduction of the birth-link criterion; this work is well-advanced. In addition, I said that a separate, independent investigation would be conducted into how the use of inconsistent criteria had arisen and why it had not been exposed earlier. I said that this work would be undertaken by a retired senior official from outside of the Departments involved. I am pleased to announce that Mr. David Watkins, a retired senior civil

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">whether there are any lessons to be learned for the future from such shortcomings as are identified in the development of the scheme and in its administration.</p>

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60130m01.html_spmin2"><b>The Secretary of State for Defence  (John Reid): </b> 
 My predecessor announced to the House on 16 December 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1795, that under the future Army structures, we intend to re-role an Armoured Brigade to a Mechanised Brigade and a Mechanised Brigade to a Light Brigade.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130m01.html_para14"><a name="stpa_13">I am now in a position to confirm that 4th Armoured Brigade will re-role to a mechanised brigade in 2006 and will move from its current base in Osnabruck garrison in Germany to Catterick in 2008&#150;09. A number of other minor adjustments will also be made. I have notified the German Government of our plans. 19 Brigade will re-role to a Light Brigade and will subsequently relocate away from Catterick to Scotland and Northern Ireland, although decisions on the final location of individual units have yet to be taken. We hope to be in a position to announce this later in the year. The net effect will be a reduction of our forces in Germany by roughly 2,200 personnel.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130m01.html_para15"><a name="stpa_14">While there may be further modest adjustments to our force levels in Germany in the coming years where this makes sense, I would envisage sizeable forces remaining there for the long-term, where they will continue to enjoy excellent relations with the local population and contribute to our strong bilateral relationship with the German Government.
