<p><a name="st_6"><a name="50720m01.html_spmin6"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Don Touhig): </b> 
 The amount of low flying training carried out in the UK Low Flying System (UKLFS) during the training year April 2004 to March 2005 was the minimum required for aircrew to reach and maintain their ability to fly at low level. The number of low flying training hours booked in the UKLFS (excluding the Rotary Wing Dedicated user Areas, where different booking arrangements apply) was 46,678 hours, a slight increase of 1,616 hours in comparison with the previous training year. This increase can be mostly attributed to the need by helicopter aircrew to convert to use of the Apache Attack helicopter, and the Merlin helicopter. The level of Operational Low Flying by fixed wing aircraft reduced by over 25 per cent. when compared to the last training year.

<p>
<a name="50720m01.html_para20"><a name="stpa_19">The Ministry of Defence is committed to ensuring that low flying training across the UK is spread as widely as is practically possible across the UK so that no single area is too burdened. However, due to a variety of

 Networked enabled capability is the way we intend to improve our operational effectiveness on the battlefield through more efficient and effective sharing and exploitation of information by our armed forces, both with each other and with our coalition partners. We have recognised that unmanned aerial vehicles&#151;UAVs&#151;have the potential to contribute significantly though their ability to provide persistent surveillance of the battlefield, providing UK commanders with accurate, timely and high quality imagery to support decision making.

Thales have confirmed their intention to complete the bulk of production in the UK, so this announcement is very good news for UK industry. The company estimates that up to 2,000 UK jobs, in Crawley, Leicester and across the UK, will be created or sustained and with export success this could rise further.

 As required under the Animal Health Act 1981 (as amended by the Animal Health Act 2002) the Government will publish today a review of controls on the import of animal products for the financial year 2004&#150;05. We welcome the opportunity to report on progress made in the past year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m02.html_para30"><a name="stpa_59">This has been delivered by continuing to follow the three key principles of: investment in enforcement; securing better public engagement and awareness; and gaining a greater understanding of the risks.

There continues to be a significant increase in seizures of illegally imported animal products when compared to previous years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m02.html_para32"><a name="stpa_61">Successful specific targeted phases of publicity activity to raise awareness of the restrictions on the import of products of animal origin, both at home and abroad, have been undertaken as part of our overall ongoing campaign.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m02.html_para33"><a name="stpa_62">The Government continue to develop their approach to managing the risk posed by illegal imports, and examine risk across the board, including legal and illegal imports, EU and third country trade, and live animals to get a picture of relative risk, to help determine future enforcement strategy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m02.html_para34"><a name="stpa_63">Copies of the review will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses and on the DEFRA &quot;personal food imports&quot; website at: www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/illegali. Hard copies will be available on request.

 Further to the statements made to the House by the then Secretary of State my right hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid), on 17 December 2003 and 16 March 2004 (and the written statements of 22 July 2004 and 9 September 2004) concerning variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and blood, I wish to provide a further update on this subject.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m03.html_para9"><a name="stpa_73">Following cases of possible transmission of vCJD by blood transfusion, we have already put in place a series of precautionary public health measures.
</p>

<p>

<a name="50720m03.html_para12"><a name="stpa_76">In September 2004 we announced arrangements to identify and notify patients who had received certain batches of UK manufactured plasma products.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m03.html_para13"><a name="stpa_77">In the light of further advice I have received from two of my Department&#039;s expert committees, the CJD Incidents Panel (CJDIP) and the Committee on Microbiological Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (MSBTO), I am now announcing further public health precautions in relation to a small group of blood donors whose blood has been transfused to people who later developed vCJD.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m03.html_para14"><a name="stpa_78">The Chief Medical Officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, had asked the expert committees to consider the implications for donors where a recipient of their blood had developed vCJD. The recommendations of the committees are based on an assessment of risk undertaken by the Department of Health&#039;s analysts. The risk assessment is being published on the Department&#039;s website.
</p>

<p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>20 Jul 2005 : Column 92WS

infection. The advice of the committees is that, although we do not know whether these cases of vCJD could be related to the blood that they received, we should take precautionary steps to inform and support the individual blood donors concerned and to safeguard public health.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m03.html_para16"><a name="stpa_80">As an extension to the current precautionary measures, these people are being contacted by the National Blood Service and advised not to donate blood, tissues or organs. Current donors from this group of 110 are being contacted today and offered expert advice and support. The National Blood Service will contact the GPs of lapsed donors, that is those who have not donated blood during the last five years, and make arrangements to contact these people as soon as practicable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m03.html_para17"><a name="stpa_81">The committees have also advised that the donors in question should be considered at risk of vCJD for wider public health purposes and that the donors and their clinicians should be informed of their risk status and asked to implement the public health precautions currently specified by the CJD Incidents Panel. This means that they should inform doctors, nurses and dentists of their status if they present for surgery or other invasive medical procedures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m03.html_para18"><a name="stpa_82">These public health precautionary measures are the same as those applied to any patients considered by the CJDIP to be at risk of vCJD, including the individuals notified following the previous statements to the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m03.html_para19"><a name="stpa_83">There is another group of people for whom further public health precautions may need to be considered. This group is all the other recipients of blood from the currently identified group of 110 donors (estimated to be up to 3,000 individuals). At present, these people are already excluded from blood donation themselves by the measures implemented in April 2004. I have asked for additional expert advice on this group and I will take further action if necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m03.html_para20"><a name="stpa_84">Blood donors should be assured that it is not possible to contract vCJD by giving blood. Blood donors are highly committed to helping others and we greatly value their contribution. The NHS depends on their continued commitment to donating blood which saves lives every day in this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m03.html_para21"><a name="stpa_85">The vast majority of the over two million current blood donors will not be involved in this new safety measure and need take no action. However, current and past blood donors who are concerned can contact the National Blood Service helpline on 0845 7711711. People who have received blood donations and other members of the public who are concerned should contact NHS Direct on 0845 850 9850.
</p>

From 2006 national health service accredited health trainers will be giving support to people who want it in areas of highest need.

There is a great deal of advice and information available and exhortations to change often from distant national bodies and others, but equally often with little recognition of the realities of everyday life. There is support but it is patchy, fragmented and does not fit with their lives. It may be available at the wrong time of day or only accessible to people who speak and read English well, and access is unequal and erratic. Health trainers are designed to address these problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m04.html_para1"><a name="stpa_88">Heath trainers will be visible and accessible to local people through living and working in the communities they serve providing &quot;support from next door&quot;. They will engage local people where they are to be found, for example, mothers at the children&#039;s centre, customers at the local pharmacy, members of the tenants&#039; association. Their task is to motivate individuals to set personal goals for improving their health, by developing personal health plans using a core set of skills based on health psychology and a good understanding of what works. They will support people to carry out their plans, for example, accompanying a woman to a breast screening appointment; encouraging a teenage mother to go to the children&#039;s centre by arranging to meet her; planning a walking route with a 50 year old man. They will identify barriers with individuals to healthier choices and help find individual solutions by listening, empathising and sharing experiences. They will be able to &quot;signpost&quot; people to local services that can support their healthier choices, through their detailed knowledge of the local area. Health trainers may refer individuals on, but will also encourage, motivate and support them to use what is available, for example information about the local smoking cessation service, and then go with them to the first session.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m04.html_para3"><a name="stpa_90">Those in greatest need were also allocated more money.

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="50720m06.html_spmin4"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Transport  (Dr Stephen Ladyman): </b> 
 Plans to upgrade the A303 trunk road passing Stonehenge and to improve the setting of this outstanding World Heritage Site have a long history. In July 1998, after extensive assessment of alternative options, the Government announced the inclusion in the targeted programme of trunk road improvements of the A303 Stonehenge improvement as an &quot;exceptional environmental scheme&quot;. Following further studies and consultations, a preferred route was announced in June 1999 for improvements to 12.4 km of the A303 running from the countess roundabout in the east to Berwick Downs in the West. The scheme provided for dualling of the route and included a bypass of the village of Winterbourne Stoke and a 2km cut-and-cover tunnel past Stonehenge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m06.html_para15"><a name="stpa_121">Following further consultations with English Heritage and the National Trust, a number of alternative tunnel options were evaluated and on 10 December 2002 the Government announced that they would proceed with further consideration of a 2.1 km tunnel (extending the tunnel by 100 metres compared with the preferred route announcement) and that the tunnel would be bored rather than cut-and-cover, thereby providing significant additional environmental benefits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m06.html_para16"><a name="stpa_122">The public inquiry into this proposed scheme was held between 17 February and 11 May 2004. The inspector&#039;s report was received in January 2005 and the Government have been considering it carefully. The inspector, having considered all the representations and submissions from objectors, was satisfied that the case for the scheme had been made and has recommended 





<br>&nbsp;<br>20 Jul 2005 : Column 102WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

that the scheme orders should be made, subject to a number of minor modifications. In particular, he was satisfied with:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">the line of the published scheme;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">all the proposed slip and side road changes required to implement the scheme;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">the requirements of the traffic prohibition orders restricting certain classes of traffic from using the tunnel and some of the new roads; and</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">the acquisition of all the land and interests necessary to carry out the published scheme.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m06.html_para17"><a name="stpa_123">However, there has been a material change in the estimated scheme costs since the scheme went to public inquiry and which was not part of the inspector&#039;s considerations. The Highways Agency&#039;s evidence to the public inquiry indicated that the construction cost of the scheme would be &#163;192 million. After allowing for additional factors including land, preparation and supervision costs this translates into a total outturn scheme cost of &#163;284 million, assuming a construction start date of spring 2005.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m06.html_para18"><a name="stpa_124">In addition, following the completion of the public inquiry, the Highways Agency has carried out further detailed assessments of the ground conditions through which the tunnel would be bored. These have confirmed the scale of two significant factors along the line of the proposed tunnel:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">very large quantities of phosphatic (soft, weak) chalk;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">a high water table, with the groundwater potentially rising to the surface at times of heavy rainfall where the tunnel passes below a shallow valley to the south of Stonehenge.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m06.html_para19"><a name="stpa_125">These factors would significantly complicate the tunnelling process and extend the overall construction period of the scheme. Together with certain other factors which serve to increase tunnel costs, including more rapid increases in construction cost inflation than had previously been anticipated, the Highways Agency&#039;s latest estimate of the outturn cost of the scheme has now risen to some &#163;470 million. For consistency with earlier estimates, this figure also assumes a construction start date of spring 2005. Slippage in the start date beyond spring 2005 will have further increased the estimated cost in line with continuing inflation in construction costs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m06.html_para20"><a name="stpa_126">This represents a significant change to the basis on which the Government originally decided to progress this scheme. Our recognition of the importance of Stonehenge as a World Heritage Site remains unchanged but given the scale of the cost increase we have to re-examine whether the scheme still represents value for money and the best option for delivering improvements to the A303 and the setting of Stonehenge. The Government therefore plan to carry out a detailed review of the options, consulting relevant environmental interests including, in particular, English Heritage and the National Trust, before taking a final decision on the inspector&#039;s report. The review will also consider the implications of delaying the Stonehenge scheme for the delivery of improvements proposed for other single carriageway sections of the A303 further to the west.

<a name="50720m07.html_para4"><a name="stpa_132">During the period March 2005 to June 2005 overall Agency case compliance remained stable at 70 per cent. This is also the case for old scheme compliance at 72 per cent. New scheme compliance, at 66 per cent. in June 2005, has risen from 61 per cent. in June 2004.

The overall new scheme compliance rate was 66 per cent in June 2005, and, for those new cases calculated in February 2005 (the latest month for which compliance has begun to stabilise for new cases), compliance had reached 78 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m07.html_para6"><a name="stpa_134">Trends in cash compliance performance are broadly flat over the period, with overall Agency performance at 69 per cent. in June 2005. Old and new scheme performance was 72 per cent and 62 per cent respectively with new scheme performance having improved from 50 per cent in June 2004.

Performance across the quarter has remained unchanged for the old scheme at 40 per cent, with new scheme performance demonstrating further improvement from 22 per cent to 27 per cent (having already risen from 15 per cent in June 2004).
</p>

<p>
<a name="50720m07.html_para8"><a name="stpa_136">Accuracy performance is measured cumulatively month-on-month throughout the year. Figures based on the first results of 2005&#150;06 show performance to June of 82 per cent for new scheme and 75 per cent for old scheme.

A new chief executive was appointed in April this year and he has initiated a strategic review of the Agency&#039;s objectives and operational arrangements. He will report to Ministers in the coming months and we will report to the House in due course.

<br>
Notes:
<br>
1. Compliance is measured over a quarterly period as opposed to monthly, as it is a less volatile measure of performance in that it smoothes out the impact of events such as bank holidays, late payments and processing details. These figures may be subject to change as more reliable information becomes available.
<br>
2. There are no figures for new scheme for June 2004 or for new and old scheme in April 2005 because no accuracy checks were performed during that month. Accuracy across old scheme cases on both systems has been recorded only since May 2005. Prior to May 2005, accuracy was measured only against those old scheme cases on the old computer system.
