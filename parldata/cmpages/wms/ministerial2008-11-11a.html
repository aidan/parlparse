<p><a name="st_116"><a name="08111153000077"><a name="81111m0002.htm_spmin0"><a name="08111153000180"><b>The Minister for Borders and Immigration (Mr. Phil Woolas):</b>
 Throughout this year, the Government have been delivering the biggest shake-up of the immigration system for a generation. We are delivering a stronger border that maximises the use of new technology, a selective Australian-style points system to control migration and a clear expectation that newcomers earn the right to stay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"><a name="81111m0002.htm_para5"><a name="08111153000078">Already this year, we have made sweeping changes to our border protection, including checking fingerprints before we issue a visa, screening all travellers against watch-lists and introducing a single border force with police-like powers. Last week we laid immigration rules making a number of changes, including to implement the skilled and temporary worker tiers of the points-based system (PBS), simplify the route for business visitors, and to increase the minimum age for obtaining a marriage visa from 18 to 21.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"><a name="81111m0002.htm_para6"><a name="08111153000079">The Government are making an unprecedented investment in skills and training to ensure that UK residents do not lose out to overseas workers or see jobs go abroad because of a lack of skills. We have recently made a number of funding agreements with employers, worth &#163;630 million over three years, to give them greater access to flexible, bespoke training aimed at tackling skills shortages in their sectors. These agreements cover sectors such as catering and hospitality, the nuclear industry and construction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"><a name="81111m0002.htm_para7"><a name="08111153000080">A fundamental part of the skilled worker tier of the points-based system is the shortage occupation lists, for the United Kingdom and Scotland. These are skilled occupations where the Government consider there are shortages so that it is sensible for vacancies to be filled by migrant workers from outside the European economic area. Migrant workers seeking to come to work in the UK score points if they are applying to work in one of these occupations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_386"><a name="81111m0002.htm_para8"><a name="08111153000081">In setting these lists, I have carefully considered the advice from the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), which reported to Government on this matter in September. I am very grateful to the MAC for their independent advice. The lists are shown below.</p>
