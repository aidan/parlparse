 The Government are today publishing two consultation documents on implementation of aspects of the Banking Act 2009, as part of their programme to protect depositors and maintain financial stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09072146000050">The Banking Act established a permanent special resolution regime (SRR) to provide the authorities with the tools to deal with banks and building societies that fail. Many of the detailed provisions are set out in statutory instruments, and the Government have committed to consulting on a number of these. The consultation documents that have been published today are:</p>
<a name="90721m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="09072146000392"><ul><p class="tabletext">Consultation on the Building Societies (Insolvency and Special Administration) Order 2009 and related insolvency rules, and on financial assistance to building societies; and</p>
</ul><a name="90721m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="09072146000393"><ul><p class="tabletext">Consultation on the FSMA 2000 (Contribution to Costs of Special Resolution Regime) Regulations 2009.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09072146000051">Some of the secondary legislation included in these two documents has already been made on an urgent basis to enable the effective resolution of the Dunfermline Building Society. For these statutory instruments, the Government will consider whether to bring forward amending instruments in the light of consultation responses. The other instruments will be revised as appropriate in the light of consultation responses before being made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09072146000052">The first document, "Consultation on the Building Societies (Insolvency and Special Administration) Order 2009 and related insolvency rules, and on financial assistance to building societies", sets out detailed proposals for supporting building societies and protecting their customers in the event of failure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09072146000053">The first part of the consultation concerns applying the bank insolvency procedure and the bank administration procedure to building societies UK-wide. The bank insolvency procedure is designed to ensure that in the event of a bank failure depositors eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) receive their payments quickly, or have their accounts transferred to another institution, and that  <br>

<notus-date day="21" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>21 July 2009 : Column 112WS</b><br>
the affairs of the failed institution are wound up in the interests of creditors as a whole. The bank administration procedure is designed to support a partial transfer, which is an important tool available to the authorities under the SRR to enable them to split up a failing bank by transferring part of its property to a commercial purchaser or a Bank of England-controlled bridge bank. Applying these procedures to building societies will ensure that building societies, their members and creditors are treated in the appropriate way corresponding to the treatment of banks, their depositors and other creditors in the event of insolvency or administration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para4"><a name="09072146000054">The second aspect of the consultation deals with the provision of financial assistance to building societies. Section 9B of the Building Societies Act prohibits building societies from creating floating charges on the whole or part of their undertaking or property. This may make it difficult for societies to offer appropriate security to the Bank of England, or any other provider of necessary financial assistance. An interim measure, made under the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, enables societies to grant floating charges to the Bank of England in connection with the provision of financial assistance. The Government are now consulting on legislation to replace this interim measure and on a further measure that would make it easier for building societies to convert financial assistance given in the form of Treasury bills or other securities into cash.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para5"><a name="09072146000055">The second document is entitled "Consultation on the FSMA 2000 (Contribution to Costs of Special Resolution Regime) Regulations 2009". A principle of the SRR is that the FSCS should contribute to the costs of the operation of the SRR. This contribution is capped at the amount of compensation the FSCS would have paid, less the recoveries it would have made if the institution were in default and the FSCS were engaged in the normal way under FSMA. The regulations were made on 29 March 2009 in order to enable the Treasury to require the FSCS to make payments in connection with the resolution of the Dunfermline Building Society. The consultation document seeks views on the regulations.</p>

 The Government remain determined to lead global efforts to tackle poverty in the world's poorest countries. As part of that, they are fully committed to delivering on their international debt relief commitments to ensure the poorest countries are not faced with an unsustainable debt burden.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para6"><a name="09072146000057">To support these efforts, I am today publishing a consultation on legislation designed to tackle creditor non-participation in the "Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative". By opting out of international debt relief efforts, and pursuing the full value of claims through the courts, this minority of private creditors can negate the benefits of debt relief. This is at the expense of poor countries and British taxpayers. The proposed legislation would limit the scope for creditors to recover their debts above a set level, unless the courts consider it just and equitable for them to do otherwise.</p>

<p><a name="st_110"><a name="09072146000069"><a name="90721m0001.htm_spmin5"><a name="09072146000473"><b>The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Mr. John Denham):</b>
 I am today announcing a consultation on local democratic renewal. This follows the commitment set out in "Building Britain's Future" to explore ways of increasing both the powers and the accountability of councils and city regions. Local democratic renewal forms a major part of the Government's proposals for constitutional reform, alongside other strands for debate including reforming the House of Lords; considering a written constitution; reviewing the electoral system; and increasing public engagement in politics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para16"><a name="09072146000070">The founding principle of local government is that citizens have the right to influence the decisions that affect their lives and their communities. A key way in which local citizens are able to exercise that right is their ability to elect a strong local council which can lead and shape their area. That is why the role of councillors and councils, with their unique democratic mandate, is critical to making sure that local services are responsive to the needs of their local communities. Citizens have a right to have their voices heard, and to expect those delivering services to care what they think.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para17"><a name="09072146000071">Citizens rightly expect that councils should be the centre of local decision making, and the one place that they can go in order to influence and challenge what local services are doing. In order to do this, councils must be fully equipped to act on behalf of local residents, with the powers to scrutinise and shape local public services, and respond to local need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para18"><a name="09072146000072">There is a large and untapped pool of people who would like more say in what happens in their area, and it is right that both central and local government do more to give them greater direct control over the decisions that affect their lives and their community. But we must also recognise that in today's time-poor society, citizens have only limited time to give.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para19"><a name="09072146000073">There are other imperatives driving the need for stronger local government. First, it is to increase democratic accountability, since councils, uniquely among local services, have a direct democratic mandate from residents. Secondly, it is a way of promoting greater value for money. Local government has already saved £4.5 billion through efficiency measures since 2004. By giving them greater powers to oversee and co-ordinate all the money coming into their area, they will better be able to drive change and improvement, cutting out duplication and waste. Thirdly, councils have a vital role to play in promoting economic development. They are best placed to bring together partners from across their area to support residents and prepare for future prosperity. And finally, delivering personalised services. As the drive continues to deliver personalised services and enforceable entitlements it will become ever more important to ensure that local services are delivered flexibly and in response to local needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para20"><a name="09072146000074">Recent reform has gone some way to giving councils the powers they need to play this stronger role. The three year financial settlement means that councils have much greater certainty to plan ahead. They have powers to promote the economic, social, and environmental wellbeing of their area. And they have powers of scrutiny to challenge and hold to account some of those who provide public services and serve their local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para21"><a name="09072146000075">This consultation sets out proposals to radically reform and strengthen local government so that it is even more able to take on a new role in serving residents by strengthening public service delivery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para22"><a name="09072146000076"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para23"><a name="09072146000077">It contains proposals to:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para24"><a name="09072146000078"><i>Put local authorities at the centre of local decision making.</i> Our aspiration is that they should be the one place where citizens, through their councillors, can hold local services to account. This would mean that when citizens go to vote, they are electing someone who can act on their behalf in relation to every aspect of public spending in their area. We propose to achieve this by enhancing local authorities' power to scrutinise other bodies, and extending the range of bodies that these powers can be applied to. This builds on the concept of the total place initiative, which gives councils a unique role in scrutinising all the money that comes into their area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para25"><a name="09072146000079"><i>Strengthen local government</i><i>'</i><i>s ability to act in the local interest.</i> We ask whether councils have the powers that they need to respond effectively to local challenges, or whether there are barriers which prevent them using the powers they already have. This will be essential to enable local authorities to deliver the minimum entitlements set out in Building Britain's Future. We also set out our response to the recent LAML judgement: proposing to introduce a specific power enabling councils to engage in mutual insurance and exploring what other arrangements councils may want to engage in but which may fall beyond the existing power to promote well being. We also ask whether more could be done to further reduce the burden of inspection and clarify when and where central Government should intervene in local government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para26"><a name="09072146000080"><i>Strengthen local authorities' ability to tackle climate change.</i> We propose to give councils more direct responsibility for fighting climate change, perhaps through introducing local carbon budgets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para27"><a name="09072146000081"><i>Support sub-regional working.</i> We set out a range of options to make sure that the greater powers being devolved to city-regions and other sub-regional partnerships are matched by greater transparency and accountability for local residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para28"><a name="09072146000082"><i>Achieve a clearer relationship between central and local government.</i> We set out the principles in which central and local government broadly operate and ask whether these should be more formally articulated, in order to give citizens greater clarity and certainty about our respective roles and functions. We also explore the possibilities for overseeing these more formal arrangements-potentially through an ombudsman or a joint select committee, subject to the outcomes of the consultation and the views of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="90721m0001.htm_para29"><a name="09072146000083">The consultation seeks views on these proposals and will run from 21 July until 2 October 2009. Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

 On the 8 May my right hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (John Healey), the then Minister for Local Government, announced to the House that, as part of a programme of action to help the people of Stoke-on-Trent restore to the city good city governance, the Government were minded to make an Order under section 86 of the Local Government Act 2000 specifying a scheme of whole council elections from 2011. He also announced that to enable the focus of all to be on this 2011 new start, and while an electoral review is being undertaken, the Government were minded to include in the Order provision to cancel the 2010 elections for the city council. He explained that before taking final decisions there would be a short 'soundings' period until the 18 June to provide an opportunity for interested parties to make representations to us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="90721m0002.htm_para4"><a name="09072146000097">That soundings period is now complete and I am today announcing that, having regard to the representations we have received, we have decided to go ahead with a scheme of whole council elections for Stoke-on-Trent city council from 2011. We intend to lay the necessary Order before Parliament as soon as practicable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="90721m0002.htm_para5"><a name="09072146000098">We have, however, concluded that there is not a sufficiently strong case for cancelling the 2010 elections for the city council, and hence the Order will not include provision to cancel these elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="90721m0002.htm_para6"><a name="09072146000099">We reached these conclusions having regard to the 11 representations we received during the soundings period. There was broad support for whole council elections, but a number of concerns were raised about cancelling the 2010 elections to the city council, including from the Electoral Commission which considered that on the available evidence, a clear case for cancelling the elections had not been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="90721m0002.htm_para7"><a name="09072146000100">In his 8 May announcement my right hon. Friend also indicated that he was asking the Electoral Commission to undertake an electoral review of Stoke-on-Trent which would consider the size of the council and the warding arrangements for the City. The Electoral Commission has now directed the Boundary Committee to undertake this review, which we understand will begin shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="90721m0002.htm_para8"><a name="09072146000101">We are confident that these measures to reform the electoral arrangements of Stoke-on-Trent will help provide for the people of Stoke-on-Trent the opportunity they  <br>

 The Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS) highlighted the need for restructuring in the maritime industry to reduce overcapacity in the UK warship build and support industry after the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers (QE Class) have been built, and to ensure in the future a sustainable world-class industrial base. It is paramount that we balance supply and demand in the future, primarily to sustain key maritime skills and jobs that will, in turn, ensure our key industrial capabilities (KICs) are preserved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="90721m0002.htm_para15"><a name="09072146000152">As part of the response to the DIS, the shipbuilding and support activities of BAE Systems and VT Shipbuilding came together last year to form a new single company-BVT Surface Fleet Limited (BVT). The company, which is integral to the QE Class and Type 45 programmes, was established as MOD's strategic complex warship design and build partner, and to work collaboratively with Babcock on surface warship support.</p>

In order to achieve this, we have been negotiating a long-term business agreement with BVT. Known as the terms of business agreement (TOBA), I am pleased to announce to the House today that we have now concluded these discussions and signed a 15 year commercial deal with the company. Worth around £230 million per year to BVT to sustain KICs required for essential operational sovereignty, the TOBA gives an unambiguous commitment to the company for a certain minimum level of workload in the areas of warship design and build work, and elements of warship support covering all surface warships. In return, BVT has committed to the transformation of the sector into a sustainable entity for the future. This will generate major financial benefits to the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and the Royal Navy worth a minimum of £350 million over the duration of the contract, with an aim to double this figure over the duration of the contract.</p>

Finally, it demonstrates that we continue to make best use of UK taxpayers' money in seeking opportunities for transformation and the delivery of efficiencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_386"><a name="90721m0004.htm_para0"><a name="09072146000321">It is important that this is swift so as not to unduly distract the new management and staff at the hospital from improving services for patients today. The inquiry is therefore planned to report to me by the end of 2009. Should the chair of the inquiry consider that it is necessary to have the power to require witnesses to attend, as Secretary of State I have the power to convert the inquiry into an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_387"><a name="90721m0004.htm_para1"><a name="09072146000322">There are also national lessons to learn from the investigation at Mid Staffordshire. Dr. David Colin-Thomé's report contained some important recommendations on this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"><a name="90721m0004.htm_para2"><a name="09072146000323">Many of these are already being addressed, for example through the implementation of Lord Darzi's vision High Quality Care for All and our World Class Commissioning programme. In addition, the new National Quality Board will report to me by the end of the year with recommendations on how best to ensure any early signs that something is going wrong in the NHS are picked up immediately, that the right organisations are alerted, and action is taken quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_389"><a name="90721m0004.htm_para3"><a name="09072146000324">The Mid Staffordshire case has also illustrated that the current regulatory framework for foundation trusts (FTs) needs updating. The FT model is a key plank of reform in the NHS, successfully rewarding high performance with greater freedom and autonomy. The policy is based on the premise that FT status is a privilege to be earned and valued-an incentive to drive up quality, innovation, productivity and local accountability. However, it is clear that in some exceptional circumstances, where an FT has failed to live up to this standard and public confidence has been damaged, it may be right for the privileges of FT status to be withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_390"><a name="90721m0004.htm_para4"><a name="09072146000325"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_391"><a name="90721m0004.htm_para5"><a name="09072146000326">This is why I intend to consult on legislative proposals to enable Monitor to "de-authorise" a foundation trust, subject to agreement by the Secretary of State, where it is clear an organisation has forfeited its right to the freedoms and flexibilities afforded by FT status. It is also important that where there is public concern, the Secretary of State is able to express his views and request that Monitor considers intervention in a particular way. I will also consult on legislative proposals so that, in these circumstances, if Monitor disagrees with the approach suggested by Ministers, they should be obliged to justify this position publicly. The Government will issue a consultation on both these issues in the next few days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_393"><a name="90721m0004.htm_para7"><a name="09072146000328">By focusing on the powers and actions of Monitor to intervene, I believe we achieve the appropriate balance between ensuring fundamental failure is addressed and maintaining the significant benefits of the FT model, which gives FTs greater freedom in return for high quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_394"><a name="90721m0004.htm_para8"><a name="09072146000329"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"><a name="90721m0004.htm_para9"><a name="09072146000330">All of us who care passionately about the health service were appalled by the events at Mid Staffordshire, which are in stark contrast to the dedication and professionalism shown by NHS staff every day up and down the country. The measures I have announced today, building on those already taken, demonstrate the collective commitment in all parts of the system, to ensure there will be no repeat.</p>

 On 24 February the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, supported by the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), held a conference to mark the 10th anniversary of the publication of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report.

There have been many positive changes in relation to race equality and the fact that the overwhelming majority of the recommendations of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report have been addressed is a measure of this. However, we must, as the conference proceedings and the reports also demonstrate, not become complacent. Much has been achieved, but there is still considerably more to do. That is why we have published an action plan with the conference report, setting out areas for particular focus, building on existing work, as we move forward from the anniversary.

Guidance published by the Home Office both at the time of commencement and in December 2008 emphasised the point that ADZs should be used only in tightly defined areas and as a last resort, when all other tools and measures have failed to solve the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_411"><a name="90721m0004.htm_para25"><a name="09072146000351">Our discussions with local authorities have confirmed that no local authority has as yet implemented an ADZ.

<p><a name="stpa_413"><a name="90721m0004.htm_para27"><a name="09072146000354">This annual statistical report meets the requirement in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to inform Parliament about the licensed use of animals for experimental or other scientific purposes. It also forms the basis for meeting periodic reporting requirements at EU level. A hard copy is available and supplementary information with additional tables is also available on the Home Office website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_414"><a name="90721m0004.htm_para28"><a name="09072146000355">The statistical report shows an overall increase over the previous year of 14 per cent. in the number of procedures undertaken. The total number of procedures was just under 3.7 million, an increase of 454,000 over the previous year. There has now been an increase for the seventh year running and is the highest total since 1992. A number of factors, such as investment in research and development and strategic funding priorities, determine the overall level of scientific procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_415"><a name="90721m0004.htm_para29"><a name="09072146000356">Non-toxicological procedures accounted for about 87 per cent. of the procedures carried out. These included fundamental research in human and veterinary medicine to improve understanding of disease mechanisms and possible therapeutic options, and development of vaccines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_416"><a name="90721m0004.htm_para30"><a name="09072146000357">Most toxicological studies (79 per cent.) were for the safety and efficacy testing of new drugs and medicines and the majority of all toxicological procedures (71 per cent.) were performed in order to carry out legal or statutory requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_417"><a name="90721m0004.htm_para31"><a name="09072146000358">In line with previous years, those procedures that used mice or rats (or other rodents) were the great majority at 77 per cent. Those using fish amounted to 17 per cent. and those using birds, 3 per cent. The total of all procedures using dogs, cats, horses and non-human primates, that is those species offered special protection by the Act, was less than 1 per cent. of the total.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_418"><a name="90721m0004.htm_para32"><a name="09072146000359">Genetically normal animals were used in about 1.9 million regulated procedures, (up 160,000 (9 per cent.) on 2007 figures, largely as a result of the use offish and mice in fundamental biological research and applied studies. Genetically modified animals and those with a harmful genetic mutation (nearly all were rodents, fish or amphibians) were used in 1.76 million regulated procedures representing, 48 per cent. of all procedures for 2008 (compared with 46 per cent in 2007 and 16 per cent. in 1995).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_419"><a name="90721m0004.htm_para33"><a name="09072146000360">Advances in the opportunities to use genetically altered animals for new areas of biomedical research means that the trend of increased production and use of genetically altered animals has continued. It allows a more precise and often less invasive study of physiological studies and disease mechanisms that was previously possible. Most of the animals concerned are mice, which appear and live as normal. Many are only used in breeding programmes. In fact nearly two fifths of all procedures in 2008 were accounted for by breeding procedures (38 per cent.) for the production of harmful mutant and genetically modified animals. Mice (89 per cent.) and fish (9 per cent.) were used in most of these procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_420"><a name="90721m0004.htm_para34"><a name="09072146000361">I should point out in relation to the statistics, that the Home Office, as regulatory authority under the 1986 Act, does have an effect on the overall amount of animal research and testing that takes place. This is done by ensuring, as part of our licensing function, that the provisions of the Act are rigorously applied in each programme of work and that only work that is scientifically justified, minimises the numbers of animals used and animal suffering that may be caused, is authorised.</p>
