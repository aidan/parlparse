Friend the Foreign Secretary, the presidency explained that there would not be a substantive discussion of the common agricultural policy (CAP); the European Council would be invited to take note of the Agriculture Council&#146;s decisions on the CAP health check. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary also noted that the EU&#146;s leadership in the global financial crisis now needed to be followed up by leadership on the &#147;real economy&#148;. On that basis, it was important to note the need for appropriate regulation, and transparency, of economic issues; that the EU should continue to promote the millennium development goals and international development; and that there was no contradiction between a strong economy and strong action to combat climate change.</p>

on the ground and the need for urgent diplomatic and humanitarian action. The Council agreed conclusions that expressed concern at the intensified fighting in North Kivu; welcomed increased humanitarian aid from the Commission and member states to those affected and called upon all parties to allow access for aid; condemned human rights violations in eastern DRC; supported the UN mission in the DRC (MONUC) and stressed the importance of forthcoming discussions of its mandate and capabilities; emphasised the urgency of finding a political solution, as the only way to restore long-term stability to the region; and reaffirmed the EU&#146;s role in contributing to international diplomatic efforts to consolidate the ceasefire and ease tensions in the long term.</p>

Foreign Minister prior to the Council. The statement expressed deep concern about Russia&#146;s actions and failure to withdraw to pre-7 August conflict positions and expressed support for Georgia&#146;s territorial integrity. It makes clear that a resumption of negotiations will not be a return to business as usual, nor will the EU be turning the page on the conflict in Georgia. The EU would stick to the tough mandate that had been agreed for the negotiations.

The Council adopted conclusions reaffirming its full support for the HR/EUSR, Mr. Miroslav Lajcák; expressing deep concern at recent developments, particularly Bosnian leaders use of nationalist rhetoric and actions challenging state competences; and calling upon the Bosnian authorities to renew their efforts on reforms. The conclusions reiterate the EU&#146;s willingness to the transition from the OHR to a stronger European Union presence; but they also call on Bosnian authorities to intensify efforts to fulfil the five objectives and two conditions agreed by the Peace Implementation Council for closure of the OHR.</p>

Friend the Foreign Secretary underlined the UK&#146;s concern over the current situation in BiH and that OHR closure should only take place once the conditions had been met. In terms of a strengthened EU presence, we needed to think about arrangements which increased the incentives for Bosnian politicians to engage with Brussels, while discouraging them from reneging on the Dayton-Paris agreements.</p>

In addition, the importance of forthcoming elections and further efforts to help strengthen the position of women were also discussed. My hon.

 On 20 September 2007, I announced that I had asked the organ donation taskforce to look at the complex issue of an opt-out or presumed consent system of organ donation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="81117m0001.htm_para49"><a name="08111712000058">I am grateful to the chair of the taskforce, Mrs Elisabeth Buggins, and all the members for their careful and thorough examination of this subject and for producing such an authoritative piece of work.

the potential to deliver benefits, would present significant challenges on a number of fronts, and may not be necessary to deliver the improvement in donation rates we all want to see. The taskforce has therefore recommended not changing to an opt-out system at this time, but monitoring progress of implementing the recommendations of the taskforce&#146;s first report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="81117m0001.htm_para51"><a name="08111712000060">The taskforce has given a clear indication that donation rates can be optimised successfully without a change in the legal framework. I therefore accept its recommendation that we should aim to raise donation rates without the added complications associated with a change in legislation, only revisiting the question of a change to opt-out if the implementation of those recommendations does not deliver the projected increase in donations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="81117m0001.htm_para52"><a name="08111712000061">However, I want to see more progress more quickly, to ensure that UK patients have the best possible chance of getting the treatment they need. I have therefore set a further challenge as part of the implementation of the taskforce&#146;s second report. I would like to see 20 million people registered on the organ donor register by 2010 working towards 25 million on the register by 2013.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="81117m0001.htm_para53"><a name="08111712000062">I also want to see our donor rates match those in many parts of Europe and rise to 1,400 donors per year by March 2013&#151;nearly twice current levels. On average each donor can help three people in need, so this could mean an extra 1,800 people get the chance of the transplant they so desperately need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="81117m0001.htm_para54"><a name="08111712000063">To support this, in addition to the extra &#163;11 million made available this year to implement the taskforce's first report we have made &#163;4.5 million extra funding available over the two years 2008-10 for a major multimedia campaign from March 2009 to make people aware of the importance of organ donation, with further funding agreed for future years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="81117m0001.htm_para55"><a name="08111712000064">However, it is not all about money or setting Government targets. Achieving these ambitious aims will require not only the support of Government and the NHS, but also widespread public support. We as a society need to change the way we view organ donation. Professionals can play their part by ensuring that all potential donors are identified and donation is discussed at the right time with families. Most importantly, we all need to talk about donation with our family and friends, make our wishes known and register on the organ donor register. We may then all give someone the opportunity to benefit from a transplant after our death.</p>
