 I would like to provide an update on the recommendations of the Preventing Extremism Together working groups.</p>

Our central policy on cohesion and faith will continue to be a key contributor to national debates and engagement, but we will be able to combine this with an extended reach into local authorities and communities to make a real difference at the local level. We will continue to work to tackle disadvantage experienced by Muslim communities, but will combine this with a greater focus on enabling them (and other communities) to challenge extremism directly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="60717m0001.htm_para3"><a name="0607179000022">Part of this work will be delivered by close engagement and partnership working with representatives of a broad range of Muslim individuals and organisations.

progress update on that project, which will be available later today on the Department&#146;s website at: http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1500185.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="60717m0001.htm_para5"><a name="0607179000024">The update shows that we have made clear progress on the recommendations from Preventing Extremism Together that were for Government to take forward and that much of it has been made by supporting Muslim communities to deliver change for themselves. We will update the website on a regular basis as progress develops.</p>

But they are not the only part. By continuing to support interfaith activity, by funding grassroots projects through our &#163;5 million faith communities capacity building fund, and by continuing our local outreach, we will be able to empower communities to tackle these challenges head on.

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="60717m0001.htm_para10"><a name="0607179000030">Responses to the consultation raised concerns about joint authorisation for deposit repayment where either landlord or tenant cannot contact the other party to obtain agreement.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="0607179000034"><a name="60717m0001.htm_spmin3"><a name="0607179000060"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. Tom Watson):</b>
 As foreshadowed by my predecessor in his statement in March 2005, I am announcing today the outcome of the study to explore whether there is scope for further service improvement through the greater integration of services delivered by the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency and the Veterans Agency. The study has included consultation of trade unions and veterans&#146; groups and has recommended that the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency and the Veterans Agency are integrated on 1 April 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="60717m0001.htm_para13"><a name="0607179000035">I have decided that the integration of these two agencies should take place as it will enable improvements to the service received by both veterans and serving members of our armed forces. It is my intention that each of these two groups should be able to access the whole range of services and benefits currently provided by the two agencies, simply by going to their own single dedicated contact point where their different needs will be understood and valued. Bringing together these agencies will enable the creation of an organisation with separate front office customer contact for veterans and serving personnel supported by a single back office and unified corporate services and strategy, with one person accountable for overall service delivery. This chief executive will be supported by directors with responsibility respectively for services to veterans and services to those currently serving. The new structure will enable more joined up and hence more accurate assessments of total entitlements that currently span two agencies. It will also facilitate the development of integrated business processes and IT, leading in due course to further improvements in services for serving and retired members of the armed forces and their beneficiaries, thus providing excellent and efficient service from &#145;cradle to grave&#146;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="60717m0001.htm_para14"><a name="0607179000037">Integrating these two agencies does not of itself imply an intention to collocate or further outsource services. These are separate issues to be considered on their merits as and when opportunities arise or existing contracts expire. Integration is designed to improve the administrative support we provide to the armed forces and veterans; and robust key targets will be set to ensure no erosion in the quality of service provided. Bringing together the agencies is consistent with the pan-Government initiative for more coherent, &#147;joined up&#148; approaches to service delivery. To retain a sharp focus on the quality of veterans services and to reassure elderly customers through a sense of continuity, the veterans agency name for the veterans contact point will be retained with a director dedicated to veterans services. As Minister for Veterans, I am committed to ensuring that the quality of service to veterans and their dependants as well as the serving population is continued and improved even further under the new arrangements.</p>

 Today, the Department of Health publishes a consultation on proposed regulations for smoke-free premises and vehicles to be made under part 1 of the Health Bill. The medical and scientific evidence of the risks to health from exposure to second-hand smoke is well established and is set out in the 1998 and 2004 reports of the independent Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health, as well as in the World Health Organisation&#146;s International Agency for Research on Cancer Report of 2004.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="60717m0001.htm_para19"><a name="0607179000050">This exercise confirmed that access to HER2 testing facilities was patchy and few networks were testing all women with early breast cancer to determine their HER2 status.

 I have today published a consultation paper, &#147;New Powers for Organised and Financial Crime&#148;, which will make the UK the least desirable place for organised criminals to operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="60717m0002.htm_para0"><a name="0607182000015">The proposals build on the plans set out in March 2004 in the Government&#146;s White Paper: &#147;One Step Ahead: A 21st Century Strategy to Defeat Organised Crime&#148;. Those plans have been brought into being by the passing of the Serious and Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 and the establishment of the Serious Organised Crime Agency from April this year. The proposals on which we are now consulting would:</p>
<a name="60717m0002.htm_brev0"><a name="0607182000016"><ul><p class="tabletext">Improve the sharing of data within the public sector and between both the public and the private sectors in order to help prevent crime;</p>
</ul><a name="60717m0002.htm_brev1"><a name="0607182000017"><ul><p class="tabletext">introducing new offences of encouraging or assisting a criminal act to strengthen the current law and make it easier to bring to justice those involved in the margins of organised crime;</p>
</ul><a name="60717m0002.htm_brev2"><a name="0607182000018"><ul><p class="tabletext">establish a new civil crime prevention order to prevent organised criminal activity by individuals or organisations by imposing conditions on them;</p>
</ul><a name="60717m0002.htm_brev3"><a name="0607182000019"><ul><p class="tabletext">strengthen the working of proceeds of crime legislation.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="60717m0002.htm_para1"><a name="0607182000021">We believe that these additional measures would provide important new means for tackling organised criminality still more effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="60717m0002.htm_para2"><a name="0607182000023">Copies of the consultation document are available in the House Library and on the Home Office website at: www.homeoffice.gov.uk. We should be glad to receive views by 17 October 2006.</p>

 The Department for Transport has, today, issued a consultation document for the attention of stakeholders seeking views on the proposed review of the maximum level of MOT fee due for implementation later this year. The letter proposes an increase in the maximum level of fee for a car (MOT test Class IV) from &#163;44.15 to &#163;50.35 from October 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="60717m0002.htm_para3"><a name="0607182000026">This represents an increase of &#163;6.20. The Government do not intend to increase the maximum price again until April 2008 at the earliest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="60717m0002.htm_para4"><a name="0607182000027">The increase in the maximum fee level follows an analysis of how long garages actually spend performing the test which shows it now takes nearly an hour on average to fully MOT a car. This includes a check of up to 26 systems and components, including safety critical ones such as tyres and brakes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="60717m0002.htm_para5"><a name="0607182000028">Prescribed MOT fee levels are a maximum&#151;some garages do not charge the full fee. Some garages simply charge less than maximum; some offer free retests; and, some even make no charge for the test provided it is combined with a full service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="60717m0002.htm_para6"><a name="0607182000029">The increase in fees will go to the garages to cover the costs of their time, with a small amount&#151;27p&#151;going to the Vehicle Operator Service Agency to cover the costs of running the system, which will in turn be passed to the service provider.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="60717m0002.htm_para7"><a name="0607182000030">A copy of the letter is available in the Libraries of both Houses. The proposed new fee levels have already been subject to informal consultation with interested parties and so there is a shortened consultation period which expires on 1 September 2006.</p>

This could include flexicurity, effective social protection and consistent action on health. The flexibility needed to embrace social change should include action on work-life balance, gender equality, lifelong learning and health and safety to make work more attractive and increase productivity. Social partners and civil society must be fully engaged. All actions should be tailored to the needs of women and men.</p>
