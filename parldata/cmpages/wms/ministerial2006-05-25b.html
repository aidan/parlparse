The consultation paper also included other proposals to modernise civil registration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="60525m0001.htm_para0"><a name="06052536000029">Around 150 responses were received to the consultation paper from local authorities, registration officers, specific interest groups, national and regional groups, and representative organisations. There was overwhelming agreement from the full range of respondents that a new governance framework is long overdue and almost unanimous support from local authorities and regional local authority groups to the proposed revised framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="60525m0001.htm_para1"><a name="06052536000030">The Government intend to push ahead with the new governance arrangements and other changes which can be taken forward under existing legislation. The General Register Office will work with the Local Authority Coordinators of Regulatory Services and the Society of Registration Officers to agree national standards and over the next two months aim to finalise the guidance to be issued to local authorities. The guidance will also seek to deal with the concerns about the employment position of registration officers raised in response to the consultation. The Government will keep under review the need for legislation on other aspects civil registration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="60525m0001.htm_para3"><a name="06052536000038">To inform the action plan, MOD commissioned independent research into the nature and extent of sexual harassment in the Armed Forces, including a survey of all service women.

We have also been able to introduce national insurance contribution records for Gurkhas, so that they can qualify for the associated benefits, and they now pay food and accommodation charges, and are eligible for refunds, on the same basis as British soldiers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="60525m0001.htm_para6"><a name="06052536000045">But the then Secretary of State for Defence warned that the review would be a major piece of work, and it has raised some very substantial and complex issues which I do not intend to press to hasty conclusions. Therefore, although at the time of the last statement it was hoped that the review could be completed by late autumn 2005, it is now unlikely that I will be able to make any further announcement until later this year.</p>

<p><a name="st_22"><a name="06052536000047"><a name="60525m0001.htm_spmin5"><a name="06052536000176"><b>The Minister for Climate Change and the Environment (Ian Pearson):</b> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, on the application by the companies concerned, has today granted drought orders that empower Mid Kent Water and Southern Water to limit or prohibit the uses set out in the Drought Direction 1991 (as modified in the Orders). The Mid Kent Water order affects its entire supply area. The two Orders granted to Southern Water apply to the company's Medway, Thanet, Hastings and Sussex Coast/Sussex North supply areas but not to the company's Hampshire and Isle of Wight supply areas. These follow the Order granted last week to Sutton and East Surrey Water.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="60525m0001.htm_para7"><a name="06052536000048">We have seen 18 months of below average rainfall. In these circumstances, the Government's priority is the protection of consumers and of the environment during this exceptional drought. By reducing non-essential uses, through the sensible implementation of this type of drought order, essential supplies to communities can be better maintained should the drought continue. Taking precautionary action now is the responsible thing to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="60525m0001.htm_para8"><a name="06052536000049">In taking these decisions, we have carefully considered the reports by the independent Inspectors. The reports concluded that there has been an exceptional shortage of rain and that without the proposed non-essential use bans there is a substantial threat to water supplies in the companies' supply areas. In reaching their conclusions the Inspectors examined the companies' performance in terms of leakage, and noted that both are meeting the long-term targets set by the economic regulator, Ofwat. I am persuaded that the restrictions allowed by these Orders are necessary over and above any further improvements on leakage they are able to make in the short term. I have made clear that we expect to see continued efforts from all the companies to improve leakage. But reducing leakage alone does not solve the problems of low rainfall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="60525m0001.htm_para9"><a name="06052536000050">We are granting these Orders as a precautionary measure, to allow the companies to take the actions proportionate to the evolving threat to supplies. While the exercise and use of the powers conferred through the Orders is a matter for each company concerned, I expect each company to implement the restrictions in a manner that achieves the most in the way of water savings with as little impact as possible on businesses and in the light of changing circumstances. I have asked each company to keep me informed about the  <br>

way that they are implementing those restrictions that prove necessary and their overall position on supplies. In addition to this my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I will be meeting next week with both the Regulator, Ofwat, and all of the water companies to discuss the management of water resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="60525m0001.htm_para10"><a name="06052536000051">Many people have reacted positively to the message that in addition to action by the companies, we have collective responsibility for managing water as a shared resource. I hope that today's decisions will help everyone focus on the key message that in the areas affected it is their actions now, and in the months to come, which will help all of us to avoid more extreme sanctions should the drought continue into the summer and beyond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="60525m0001.htm_para11"><a name="06052536000052">Recent rainfall will temporarily boost river flows and help to maintain reservoir stocks, but will do little for overall supplies because the region relies heavily on groundwater (water that seeps through the soil into porous rocks, such as chalk) for 70 per cent. of its supply; in the case of Mid Kent Water that rises to85 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="60525m0001.htm_para12"><a name="06052536000053">In its report to Ministers last week, the Environment Agency advised that the winter recharge season for groundwater is now over, yet groundwater levels remain critically low. The rain we are seeing now and any we see over the rest of the summer will have little impact on groundwater levels, because at this time of year the effects of evaporation and the uptake of water by growing plants and trees means that most of the rain does not reach the aquifers. In winter we usually get more rain than in other seasons, and a higher proportion gets down to the aquifers. But even though we have passed the recharge season we are still taking hundreds of thousands of tons of water every day from the aquifers in the areas concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="60525m0001.htm_para13"><a name="06052536000054">There are no further drought orders under consideration. I will keep the House informed of any further decisions, should more applications for drought orders be made.</p>

Friend the Member for Liverpool and Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), informed the House of progress made by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in investigating the incident that occurred with the phase 1 clinical trial for a drug in development known as TGN1412, 19 April 2006, <i>Official Report,</i> cols 13-14WS. The MHRA is today publishing the final report of its investigations. A copy of the report has been placed in the Library and copies are available for hon. Members in the Vote Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="60525m0001.htm_para14"><a name="06052536000057">The report indicates that the adverse incidents did not involve errors in the manufacture of TGN1412 or in its formulation, dilution or administration to trial participants.

the MHRA's inspection. None of these was judged to have led to the adverse incidents suffered by the volunteers in this trial, but they are being followed up in the normal way through regulatory action with the company.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="60525m0001.htm_para15"><a name="06052536000059">The MHRA therefore confirms its conclusion set out in its interim report of 5 April that an unpredicted biological action of the drug in humans is the most likely cause of the adverse reactions in the trial participants. Monoclonal antibodies are a relatively new type of biological drug, although there are a number of them already licensed and in use. However, TGN1412 is a new class of monoclonal antibody which has a stimulatory mode of action affecting certain types of cell in the immune system. In this case the resulting activity seen in humans was not predicted from apparently adequate pre-clinical testing. This is a complex scientific issue which raises important scientific and medical questions about the potential risks associated with this type of drug and how to make the transition from pre-clinical testing to trials in humans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="60525m0001.htm_para16"><a name="06052536000061">In the earlier written ministerial statement it was also announced that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State had agreed to the establishment of an expert working group to consider what this incident reveals about the underlying science, and how clinical trials involving these types of products should be managed and authorised in the future. My right hon. Friend has appointed Professor Gordon Duff to chair the expert group. Professor Duff has now identified, and appointed on behalf of the Secretary of State, the members of his group which have today been announced.</p>

Sir Michael&#146;s 31 recommendations have been substantially delivered and clear work plans are being taken forward in relation to those which remain outstanding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="60525m0002.htm_para0"><a name="06052536000113">The IMPACT programme is at the heart of achieving fundamental improvements in police information management. It is delivering against Sir Michael&#146;s recommendations in this area as one aspect of ensuring the police have the facilities, procedures and skills to make best use of information to safeguard the vulnerable and combat all forms of crime. This latest reporting period has seen the introduction of the Impact Nominal Index, which is facilitating the sharing of information across all forces. A statutory code of practice on police information management has come into force, together with extensive operational guidance and a programme of training and support to ensure improved national standards are embedded in day-to-day policing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="60525m0002.htm_para1"><a name="06052536000115">Sir Michael rightly emphasised the importance of sharing information between the relevant delivery agencies and once again there is much positive progress to report. In particular, the recent publication of the revised &#147;Working Together to Safeguard Children&#148; provides the national guidance recommended by Sir Michael on notifying the police and children&#146;s social care, and sharing information among agencies, where there are suspected criminal offences against children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="60525m0002.htm_para2"><a name="06052536000117">Our intensive programme of work to develop a central vetting and barring scheme covering all those wishing to work with children or vulnerable adults is continuing. The introduction of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill at the end of February was a very important milestone. In parallel with the legislative process, we are pressing on with a set of interim changes to systems to help ensure those unsuitable to work with vulnerable persons are prevented from doing so. The Criminal Records Bureau has made a key contribution to this work by putting in place a number of specific changes which Sir Michael highlighted as necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="60525m0002.htm_para3"><a name="06052536000119">We are giving increasing emphasis to the new online training for head teachers and school governors which focuses on the critical importance of being aware of safeguarding issues when recruiting staff. We are also exploring ways to extend the safer recruitment training more widely in schools and other sectors of education, the wider children&#146;s workforce, the voluntary sector, and other work sectors such as healthcare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="60525m0002.htm_para4"><a name="06052536000121">Finally, and in addition to all the work to implement its specific recommendations, the Bichard Inquiry continues to provide all of us with a strengthened focus on protecting children and those adult members of our society who are especially vulnerable. The safeguarding agenda is becoming increasingly coherent and prominent and that is a process which must and will continue.</p>

I was subsequently informed that of these one murderer, one rapist and one child sex offender who had been detained have in fact since been released on bail by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. In addition, I have been informed of eight other cases where the individual has been bailed, including four in the &#147;more serious&#148; category.

The consultation period closed in March. There were 56 responses from a range of organisations and individuals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="60525m0002.htm_para7"><a name="06052536000128">The issues raised in the consultation merit careful consideration. Any guidelines which eventually emerge must deal effectively with the concerns many have reflected to me in their submissions and in meetings on this issue. It is important that any relationship which the schemes may develop with the criminal justice system helps to promote and not undermine public confidence in the system. I regard it as essential that the guidelines should set the necessary high standards expected of any organisations seeking to play a role within the criminal justice system.</p>
