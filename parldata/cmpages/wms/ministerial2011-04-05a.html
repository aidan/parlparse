Strategy for Social Mobility". This has been overseen by the informal ministerial group on social mobility, which I chair, and in close collaboration with key Departments. I am placing copies in the Libraries of both Houses and making it available on the Cabinet Office website (www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para13"><a name="11040558000048">Fairness is a fundamental value of the coalition Government. A fair society is an open society, in which everyone is free to flourish and rise, regardless of the circumstances of their birth. This strategy sets out our vision for a socially mobile society-the principal objective of the coalition Government's social policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para14"><a name="11040558000049">In Britain today, the income and social class of parents continues to have a huge bearing on a child's chances. Gaps in development between children from different backgrounds can be detected even at birth. These gaps grow rapidly during the early years, and widen throughout school, such that only one in five young people from the poorest families achieve five good GCSEs, including English and maths, compared with three quarters from the richest families. This has a major impact on participation in further and higher education, and success in the labour market. These cycles of disadvantage are repeated across generations. This is not only a source of great unfairness, but also hinders our national prosperity as talented individuals are denied the opportunity to develop their full potential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para15"><a name="11040558000050">This strategy takes a comprehensive life cycle approach. A person's fortunes should not be determined by the age of five, 15 or 30. By providing help and support at every stage we aim to narrow the gaps and provide second chances. The strategy seeks to improve social mobility at each life stage: the foundation years (ages 0-5), school years (ages 5-16), transition years (ages 16-24) and adulthood (ages 24 and over).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para16"><a name="11040558000051">In the foundation years, we welcome the independent reviews carried out by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field), the hon. Member for Nottingham North (Mr Allen) and Dame Clare Tickell. Our approach puts supporting parents and providing affordable, high-quality early education and care centre stage. We are maintaining Sure Start children's centres, recruiting thousands more health visitors, expanding family nurse partnerships, and investing in free pre-school education for all disadvantaged two-year-olds, on top of existing provision for all three and four-year-olds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para17"><a name="11040558000052">During the school years, our school reforms-giving schools greater freedom, raising the status and quality of teaching, improving accountability and transparency-will raise standards in all schools, while the pupil premium will provide an extra £2.5 billion a year to radically improve educational outcomes for the most disadvantaged pupils. We will also raise aspiration through high-quality advice and guidance, much greater engagement between schools, businesses, and universities and wider society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para18"><a name="11040558000053">For young people we will look to narrow gaps in educational attainment, raising the participation age and increasing funding for apprenticeships, while ensuring fairer access to higher education and developing a new strategy to increase participation in education and training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para19"><a name="11040558000054">During adulthood, we will continue to encourage fair access to jobs, with the civil service leading by example and a new business compact on social mobility, asking business to do their bit. At the same time, we will maintain second chances to train and lifelong learning  <br>

opportunities, improve work incentives through our welfare reforms, support lower and middle-income earners through our goal of raising the personal allowance to £10,000, and help people to build up assets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para20"><a name="11040558000055">Crucially, our strategy sets out a clear framework for holding the Government to account on our ambitious proposals. We are creating a new statutory Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, to assess progress on child poverty and social mobility, hold Government and others to account and act as an advocate for change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para21"><a name="11040558000056">We have developed a set of high-level indicators which will be used to track progress. And for the first time, as Departments develop new policies, they will need to consider the impact on social mobility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para22"><a name="11040558000057">I will continue to chair a group of key Ministers to maintain the momentum for change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para23"><a name="11040558000058">We recognise that Government alone cannot single-handedly create a fairer society-this is a task for parents, communities, businesses, professions, and voluntary organisations too. However, the coalition Government will help to create a fair and open society where opportunity is shared and everyone can flourish.</p>

 I am pleased to announce that DEFRA has today published its consultation on measures to assist households who face water affordability pressures and households in areas with particularly high water bills, such as the south-west.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para24"><a name="11040558000060">The consultation follows publication of Anna Walker's independent review of charging for household water and sewerage services and the pledge made in the Budget to consult on proposals to address water affordability around reforms to the existing WaterSure scheme, the approach to company social tariffs and options for additional Government spending to provide further support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para25"><a name="11040558000061">The consultation invites views on replacing the current cap on bills under WaterSure with the lower of the company average metered bill or the national average metered bill. This would deliver substantial reductions in the bills of WaterSure recipients in areas where water bills are relatively high. In addition, it invites views on meeting the cost of WaterSure in the future from public expenditure rather than the current system of meeting WaterSure through the bills of individual water customers. It also paves the way for the introduction of company social tariffs to assist households who would struggle to pay their bills in full by asking a number of questions to help shape the Government's forthcoming guidance on company social tariffs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para26"><a name="11040558000062">The consultation also invites views on options that could reduce the bills of all household customers of South West Water and options that could target assistance towards low-income households in the region.

sewerage charges to reduce all household bills or to fund a company social tariff (although this would be a decision for South West Water). Other options include an annual payment from the Government to reduce household bills in recognition of the disproportionately high bills paid by South West Water customers as a result of unforeseen infrastructure expenditure at the time of privatisation and an option of match funding from the Government for any company social tariff that South West Water chooses to bring forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para27"><a name="11040558000063">Given that there is only a limited amount of public expenditure available to fund water affordability options, there is a balance to be struck when allocating this expenditure between assisting all household customers of South West Water on fairness grounds and helping low-income households in the region with acute water affordability problems. The Government will explore options to use additional public expenditure to deliver a modest reduction in bills for all households in the region alongside options to target households with specific affordability problems, both inside and outside the south-west.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para28"><a name="11040558000064">The consultation covers England only and the deadline for responses is 17 June. The consultation is available at: www.defra.gov.uk/consult/water-affordability-1104/</p>

However a number of countries, including the UK, retained serious reservations on the draft conclusions for a variety of different, and sometimes conflicting, reasons; in the UK's case, because of concerns that the text did not make sufficiently clear the need for budgetary restraint and was insufficiently ambitious on the need for reform of direct payments. The presidency attempted to find further compromise text changes, but disappointingly focused only on the issue of allocation of resources between the older and newer member states. The presidency concluded that it could not find consensus in the Council and adopted the amended text as presidency conclusions, supported by a majority of member states. The conclusions were not supported by the UK, Sweden, Latvia, Denmark, Estonia, Malta, Greece and Lithuania.</p>

 I, together with my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and the Secretary of State for Defence, wish to inform the House about our plans for funding conflict prevention, stabilisation, and peacekeeping activities for financial year 2011-12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para41"><a name="11040558000080">The strategic defence and security review (SDSR) announced that we will increase significantly our support to conflict prevention and poverty reduction, focusing on tackling threats at source in those fragile and conflict-affected countries where the risks are high, our interests are most at stake, and where we know we can have an impact. We have therefore agreed to an increase in the size of the conflict pool over the course of the next spending review period. The conflict pool is the mechanism by which the Government allocate resources for discretionary conflict prevention, stabilisation, and peacekeeping activities and is managed jointly by the Department for International Development, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and Ministry of Defence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para42"><a name="11040558000081">We will increase the conflict pool's programme resources from £229 million this financial year to £256 million in FY 2011-12 and annually thereafter to £309 million  in FY 2014-15. This excludes the net additional cost of military operations in Afghanistan where separate arrangements are in place to draw on the Treasury reserve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para43"><a name="11040558000082">As usual, the settlement provides a mix of official development assistance (ODA) funding and non-ODA resources. This will enable the conflict pool to bring together HMG's development, defence, and diplomacy capabilities in an integrated approach to tackling instability and conflict overseas.</p>

The conflict pool is the first port of call should these obligatory costs exceed this figure. We have agreed to earmark £76 million from the conflict pool in FY 2011-12 for assessed peacekeeping costs in FY 2011-12 making a total provision of £450 million from which we will meet our obligations on international peacekeeping. We will keep allocations under review and will adjust the balance of resources allocated to the peacekeeping budget and the conflict pool if this is necessary. We will advise the House of any such adjustments to allocations on an annual basis.</p>

The conflict pool will also operate a reserve of £7 million to cope with in-year pressures such as the rising costs of international peacekeeping missions and exchange rate fluctuations. The reserve will allow the Government the flexibility to respond to emerging issues. These additional costs in 2011-12, which were not covered by the conflict pool in 2010-11, mean that we have had to make some reductions compared with 2010-11 programme allocations.</p>

orders and supervision on licence. The standards cover relevant services to victims and courts, the assessment, planning and implementation of community sentences and licences in order to reduce reoffending, giving priority to reducing the risk of reoffending likely to cause serious harm to the public</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para55"><a name="11040558000150">In a concise format, each of the new standards is supported by NOMS guidance on any minimum mandatory requirements, indications of what is expected from high-quality work by probation practitioners, guidance on effective practice and on the source of more detailed instructions and guidance. I expect practitioners to manage their work with offenders as the risks of each case demands, using their knowledge of the individual case and drawing on their professional training and experience. Local managers will have a significant role to play in assuring the continuing quality of the work within the scope of these standards. When fully implemented alongside quality assurance methods, we expect these changes to drive the active management of offenders to reduce reoffending thereby protecting the public, moving away from a defensive, tick-box approach to following standard processes.</p>

We are considering the responses to the Green Paper, "Breaking the Cycle: Effective Punishment, Rehabilitation and Sentencing of Offenders", and Parliament will have the opportunity to examine further the potential for professional discretion for offender managers later in the year.</p>

<p><a name="st_126"><a name="11040558000165"><a name="110405m0001.htm_spmin12"><a name="11040558000439"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):</b>
 I wish to inform the House that the Government have decided not to opt in to the proposed directive facilitating cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para67"><a name="11040558000166">The draft directive intends to improve enforcement of certain road traffic offences committed using vehicles registered in another member state. It aims to facilitate the exchange of registered keeper data between member states' registration authorities, to help identify offenders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para68"><a name="11040558000167">While broadly supportive of the objectives behind this measure, the UK did not opt in to the directive because, on balance, it did not appear to be in the UK's interests to do so at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para69"><a name="11040558000168">In the UK we prosecute drivers for road traffic offences, rather than vehicle keepers. Given that the directive only provides for the exchange of vehicle keeper information, we had concerns around our ability to effectively pursue fines against the drivers of the vehicles, in the absence of effective provision to compel foreign registered keepers to disclose who was driving the vehicle when the offence was committed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_378"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para70"><a name="11040558000169">We questioned the interaction of the directive with the Prüm Council decisions, which the UK has signed up to, but not yet implemented, ("Prüm" provides for the exchange of keeper data between member states in relation to criminal offences) and were concerned about how the necessary data protection mechanisms could be enforced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para71"><a name="11040558000170">Additionally, we did not consider that a fine would have enough of a deterrent effect to bring about increased behavioural change, since domestically, research shows that it is the fear of points on a licence, or losing the licence altogether which have the main effect on increasing compliance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_380"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para72"><a name="11040558000171">We also had concerns around affordability. There would be significant start-up and running costs were our police to use keeper information obtained under the proposed directive for enforcement purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_381"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para73"><a name="11040558000172">Not opting in at this stage will give us the opportunity to carefully scrutinise the actual costs for set up and implementation of this directive across member states, informing any future decision on a possible post-adoption opt in, which the Government will look at longer-term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para74"><a name="11040558000173">A decision not to opt in to this particular directive does not prevent the UK from engaging with the EU on other matters relating to road safety nor co-operating on enforcement and exchanging data where there are strong, mutual interests for this. The UK continues to play a prominent part in developing EU strategy in these areas. We also expect that we will be able to continue to play a part in negotiating the final text of the directive.</p>

 Today, the Government are publishing their first child poverty strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para76"><a name="11040558000176">The strategy follows one year on from Royal Assent of the Child Poverty Act 2010 and embodies our determination to tackle child poverty. This strategy, which covers the first strategy period 2011 to 2014, sets out how our radical reform programme will transform people's lives and break cycles of disadvantage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para77"><a name="11040558000177">Our strategy will protect the most vulnerable, reform welfare to make work pay and help those who are struggling to enter the labour market. For those who are able to work, we will provide help to get the best outcomes for them and their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_386"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para78"><a name="11040558000178">The facts are that despite spending millions of pounds on addressing the issue, in the last several years progress against the child poverty targets has effectively stalled, while contributory factors, like worklessness, were left unchallenged meaning 5.8 million adults are still in poverty. Our strategy will bring together the work of several Departments to help improve children's life chances. Through the universal credit alone, we expect to lift 350,000 children out of poverty and 200,000 children out of the severest poverty. Overall universal credit will help nearly 1 million people out of poverty and with the Work programme we will see more people break out of the cycle of worklessness and benefit dependency.</p>

By increasing standards in education we will raise children's aspirations and narrow the gaps in attainment, which play such a crucial role in defining children's future lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"><a name="110405m0001.htm_para80"><a name="11040558000180">As part of the strategy, we are announcing that we will establish a child poverty commission with an improved remit, wider and more effective than previously legislated for by the last Government. We have consulted widely to ensure that we get the power of the commission right and we have decided to increase the effectiveness of this body, further strengthening its role in holding the Government to account, while amending its advisory functions. This will be a broader commission which will monitor and drive progress towards ending child poverty, improving life chances, and increasing social mobility. Until the new commission is in place, we will be broadening the current remit of the Government's independent reviewer on social mobility (Alan Milburn) to include child poverty. Alan Milburn will then be appointed acting chair of the new commission while an open appointment process for the commission takes place. It is our intention to use the Welfare Reform Bill to make the necessary changes to the Child Poverty Act.</p>
