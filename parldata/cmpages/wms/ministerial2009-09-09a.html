Ministers agreed to increase European resources available to the IMF, building on commitments made in the European Council conclusions in June.

partner nations, and by the chief executives of the programme&#146;s co-ordinating industrial consortia, Eurofighter GmbH and Eurojet Turbo GmbH. This is excellent news for defence and for United Kingdom industry and represents the achievement of another major milestone for the Typhoon programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="90909m0001.htm_para2"><a name="0909094000028">This order builds upon the success of the in-service tranche 1 fleet and the ongoing introduction into service of tranche 2 Typhoon aircraft, which are demonstrating outstanding performance in operation with the RAF. The tranche 3 contracts will provide an additional 16 aircraft as part of a UK order for 40 aircraft, 24 of which are replacements for aircraft being diverted to satisfy exports to Saudi Arabia. The contracts form part of what is thought to be the largest defence order ever placed in Europe, reflecting the successful and continuing co-operation between the four-partner nations and European industry. The contracts have also enabled partner nations to programme significant through-life support savings. For the UK this is of the order of &#163;900 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="90909m0001.htm_para3"><a name="0909094000029">Typhoon is an outstandingly capable, state-of-the-art aircraft which is providing a significant enhancement to our defence capability. The aircraft has the flexibility to contribute across a wide range of operations delivering air superiority and precision ground attack capabilities. Additionally, the aircraft will be built with sufficient capability to allow the embodiment of upgrades to systems now and in the future. The tranche 3 aircraft will be an essential part of our defence capability to be retained until at least the 2030&#146;s as they will be delivered with sufficient incremental development capacity to be able to exploit nascent systems and weapons technology to ensure that we can continue to meet emerging defence challenges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="90909m0001.htm_para4"><a name="0909094000030">The order will provide major benefits for industry across the United Kingdom and is expected to sustain upwards of 15,000 direct jobs with defence manufacturers, many in high-technology positions, and a significant number in supporting industries across the economy more widely.</p>

 Further to the announcement on 19 July 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, column 59WS, volume 436, regarding the continuing programme of investment at the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), I should like to provide an update to the House. This is the first opportunity I have had to announce that, on 30 July 2009, agreement was reached between the Department and AWE Management Ltd (AWEML) to extend the priced period of work, within the existing overarching 25-year contract, with AWEML to 31 March 2013.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="90909m0001.htm_para7"><a name="0909094000034">This work, providing important investment in skills and facilities at AWE, is valued at an average of around &#163;1 billion per annum and represents the next period of priced work within the nuclear warhead capability sustainment programme. It is fully in accordance with the December 2006 White Paper &#147;The Future of the United Kingdom&#146;s Nuclear Deterrent&#148; (Cm 6994).</p>

 Part one of the Marine and Coastal Access Bill, currently before Parliament, seeks to establish a new executive non-departmental public body called the Marine Management Organisation (MMO). The MMO will subsume DEFRA&#146;s Marine and Fisheries Agency, take on further functions from the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Department for Transport and deliver a range of new functions, as set out in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="90909m0001.htm_para8"><a name="0909094000036">In order to become a legal entity, the MMO must have a chair and a board of at least five and no more than eight ordinary members. However, if recruitment of the board is delayed until after Royal Assent, it is highly likely that vesting of the MMO would have to be delayed. We have therefore sought HM Treasury approval for a Contingencies Fund advance to begin the recruitment of the board of the MMO prior to Royal Assent. Should Royal Assent not be granted, the recruitment process will be terminated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="90909m0001.htm_para9"><a name="0909094000037">Parliamentary approval for additional resources of &#163;50,000 for this new service will be sought in a supplementary estimate for DEFRA. Pending that approval, urgent expenditure, estimated at &#163;50,000, is being met by a repayable cash advance from the Contingencies Fund.</p>
