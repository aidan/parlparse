               <b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Robert Neill):</b>
  The public bodies review (20 October 2010) concluded  that the functions of the London Thames Gateway Development Corporation (LTGDC) should be transferred to the relevant local authority or other London bodies. I am today announcing the first stage of that localisation. From 1 April 2011, LTGDC’s planning functions in the London riverside area will be returned to the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Havering, and for part of Newham. This important first step towards complete localisation will be effected by the London Thames Gateway Development Corporation (Planning Functions) (Amendment) Order 2011 which I am laying before Parliament today. The order reflects the coalition commitment to cutting the costs of quangos and increasing accountability, and also chimes with our approach to the Thames Gateway generally, where we have decentralised strategic oversight to local political leaders.</p>

               <b>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mrs Cheryl Gillan):</b>
 On behalf of the Government, I welcome the result of the referendum on enhanced law-making powers for  the National Assembly for Wales, which took place on 3 March.</p>

               <a name="1103073000047"> The Government have fulfilled their commitment to hold a referendum—requested by Assembly Members—set out in the coalition’s programme for Government. The referendum has enabled the people of Wales to have their say in determining the powers the National Assembly should have.</p>

               <a name="1103073000048"> The “yes” vote will mean that the Welsh Assembly Government can get on with the job of delivering better public services, and bring forward legislation in devolved areas without reference to Parliament. The Assembly will be able to legislate on subjects in the 20 areas covered by the original devolution settlement, and set out in schedule 7 to the Government of Wales Act 2006. All the areas previously non-devolved remain non-devolved, and are the responsibility of the Government and Parliament. There is no change in this respect.</p>

               <a name="1103073000049"> It is now for the Welsh Assembly Government and the National Assembly to decide when to bring the Assembly’s enhanced powers into force.</p>
