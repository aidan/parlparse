<p><a name="st_56"><a name="08050856000009"><a name="80508m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="08050856000041"><b>The Minister for Housing (Caroline Flint):</b>
 I am today laying amendments to the home information pack regulations to extend the temporary first day marketing provision, and to extend the temporary provision requiring HIPs to include the &#147;lease&#148; only and to &#147;authorise&#148; other leasehold documents, from 1 June to 31 December 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="80508m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08050856000010">The temporary first day marketing provision allows a property to be marketed without a HIP where the documents required for inclusion in the HIP have been commissioned and paid for, or arrangement for payment been made and are expected to arrive within 28 days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="80508m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08050856000011">We introduced the temporary first day marketing provision in order to help smooth the implementation of HIPs, and our evidence shows that it has been effective in doing this. However, we believe that a further period of the flexibility provided by the measure would be prudent. I am, therefore, laying an order to amend the home information packs regulations to extend the provision from 1 June to 31 December 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="80508m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08050856000012">The temporary provision requiring HIPs to include the &#147;lease&#148; only, and to &#147;authorise&#148; other leasehold documents was introduced in response to concerns about delays and additional costs in obtaining leasehold information. This provision is also due to expire on 31 May 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="80508m0001.htm_para3"><a name="08050856000013">At the time the provision was introduced we also commissioned Ted Beardsall, deputy chief executive of the Land Registry, to undertake a short assessment of the scale and nature of the problems with leasehold information and to advise on possible solutions. Ted Beardsall&#146;s assessment confirms that there are a number of longstanding issues in the provision and cost of leasehold information, which HIPs have thrown the spotlight on. It agrees that the inclusion of all leasehold information prior to marketing would cause serious difficulties; and recommends further work to resolve them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="80508m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08050856000014">What is clear from the assessment is that it would be premature to lift the current temporary requirement for the lease only, before carrying out the further work it recommends. I am also, therefore, laying an order to amend the home information pack regulations to extend the temporary provision for leasehold requirements from 1 June until 31 December 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="80508m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08050856000015">In the interim period, I have asked Ted Beardsall to convene a working group of key industry representatives to develop the options identified in his assessment into practical solutions in respect of:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="80508m0001.htm_para9"><a name="08050856000026">However, it is clear from our area trials and analysis of our monitoring that more needs to be done to ensure that consumers realise the full benefits of HIPs.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="80508m0001.htm_para10"><a name="08050856000029">Consumers want more general information about the property they are looking to buy&#151;information they can relate to. Although the current HIP contains information that can be helpful to consumers and professionals alike, it is clear that we can go further in providing consumers with easily accessible information that will help in their decision to buy a home. Information on access, boundaries, changes made to the property and fixtures and fittings are currently authorised for inclusion in the HIP. However, this information is not currently being provided as part of the majority of HIPs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="80508m0001.htm_para11"><a name="08050856000030">In order to maximise the potential of HIPs in providing consumers with the information they want, we will develop in partnership with the property professionals means for capturing consumer-friendly information for inclusion within the HIP. This will draw on the lessons learnt from our area trials and consumer focus groups. Industry stakeholders are also actively developing complementary initiatives to build on the content of the HIP, including an &#147;exchange-ready pack&#148;&#151;a pack with consumer-facing documents and legal information, including a draft contract to enable swift exchange and  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="80508m0001.htm_para12"><a name="08050856000031">We recognise that many agents are not showing prospective buyers the HIP and that consumers are not requesting to see it. We have asked the industry to respond to this consumer need by working with us to promote higher and consistent standards of practice that delivers better services to consumers, and to raise consumer awareness of the service standards they should expect and what they can do if things go wrong. In particular we will:</p>

FRES is an incremental programme to replace parts of the Army&#146;s Saxon, FV 430 and CVR(T) vehicle fleets and deliver a new medium weight capability.
