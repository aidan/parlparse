So a key part of the implementation programme is to work closely with stakeholders, in a range of ways, including the formation of a stakeholder sounding board, in addition to full public consultation on draft proposals, where appropriate.</p>

 The Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council was held in Brussels on 26 and 27 February 2009. My right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary, my noble Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Ministry of Justice, Lord Bach, and the Scottish Solicitor-General, Frank Mulholland QC, attended on behalf of the United Kingdom. The following issues were discussed at the Council:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="90305m0002.htm_para5"><a name="09030551000178">During the Mixed Committee with Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Lichtenstein, Ministers discussed progress in implementing the second generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS II) in the light of the analysis which had identified problems in the central system. Both the Commission and the presidency recognised the importance of the SIS II programme and the presidency reiterated that the repair phase would consist of two aspects, to be developed in parallel: an analysis and repair plan to resolve known bugs in the current SIS II programme and a contingency plan. The presidency also stressed the need for agreement on a set of common criteria against which both of these aspects could be assessed in the first half of 2009. The Council subsequently adopted Council conclusions confirming the action required in relation to the central SIS II project and a set of criteria against which the SIS II based scenario and an alternative scenario, based on a SIS I platform, would be assessed. They confirmed that a decision regarding the future of the project would be taken by June 2009 at the latest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="90305m0002.htm_para6"><a name="09030551000179">During the Interior Ministers&#146; meeting the Commission outlined the plans for implementation of the Visa Information System (VIS), notifying member states that the final phase had been pushed back to December 2009. The UK does not participate in the VIS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="90305m0002.htm_para7"><a name="09030551000180">The Council was presented with the draft report on the outcome of the Swiss air borders evaluation which will be considered by experts in March. Switzerland thanked the Commission and presidency for the help they had given in the months before the evaluation and indicated that it was happy with the conclusions of the draft report, taking note of its recommendations and undertaking to report regularly on progress. The presidency concluded by looking forward to 29 March when the Swiss were expected to join the Schengen area in full.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="90305m0002.htm_para8"><a name="09030551000181">The Commission presented its proposal for a European Asylum Support Office (EASO) to the Council. The Commission explained that the EASO&#146;s aims would be to enhance practical cooperation; help member states under particular pressures; and ensure a common European asylum regime. It would not make case decisions and would be part-financed through changes to the European Refugee Fund. The Commission hoped that the proposal would receive political agreement by the summer and be implemented in 2010. The proposal was broadly welcomed by a number of member states. The UK thanked the Commission for its proposal, noting that it went to the heart of what European co-operation was about: making a difference on the ground. It emphasised its support for practical co-operation on asylum in order to provide  <br>

protection for those who needed it. The UK stated that systems should be streamlined, to deliver fair decisions quickly and tackle abuse. The UK also argued for more work with countries outside the EU in order to stop asylum being the weak point in immigration systems and to stop refugees having to travel to the EU to find safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="90305m0002.htm_para9"><a name="09030551000182">The presidency presented the Commission&#146;s report on implementation of the free movement directive. The Commission said it hoped to adopt guidelines on application of the directive by the summer. They confirmed that the guidelines would cover abuses of free movement rights, including marriages of convenience and persistent criminality: moving to another member state carried responsibilities as well as rights. A number of member states highlighted their concerns about abuses of free movement. The UK welcomed the Commission&#146;s work on guidelines and asked that they should set out consequences when these responsibilities are not met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="90305m0002.htm_para10"><a name="09030551000183">The Council briefly discussed the issue of combating illegal immigration in the Mediterranean. The discussion highlighted the role of Frontex (the European Border Agency), readmission agreements and the need for further development of the EU&#146;s Global Approach to Migration.</p>

The Commission welcomed the fact that member states had notified their intention to resettle 5,100 refugees so far, improving the situation of refugees in Syria and Jordan. The Commission stated that additional funds (&#8364;20 million) would be made available to support member states&#146; efforts.</p>

Ministers agreed that there was a need to obtain more information and study all aspects of the issue. Following the previous discussion in the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) there was agreement that further discussion with the United States would be a good idea.</p>

Judge Jean-Louis Bruguière commented that the US Administration had set up a particularly robust programme to ensure the protection of personal data for counter terrorism purposes, though there was still room for improvement. The Commission would be making available a report on state of play on SWIFT. On the EU&#146;s anti-drug policy, the presidency and Commission stressed the need for more and better supply side indicators. A report would need to go to Council in June on this subject.</p>

practice and welcomed the four strategic objectives for the new period identified by the Commission. These focus on:</p>

These would build on existing benchmarks for the period up to 2010 that measure low achievers in reading, early school leavers, completion of secondary education, numbers of maths, science and technology graduates, and participation in lifelong learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="90305m0002.htm_para23"><a name="09030551000197">Most member states were content with the extension of existing benchmarks but were reluctant to establish many new ones. There was some support for a benchmark on pre-school learning and some opposition to &#145;input based&#146; benchmarks on language learning and higher education investment. It was also generally felt that further work was needed to develop helpful and measurable benchmarks on mobility, employability, and innovation and creativity. Netherlands was the most negative member state on benchmarking in general. I and some other member state Ministers feel we can accept a few of the new topics proposed if there is further refinement of the measurement of the benchmarks. Further work will be required before agreement can be reached on this issue, expected at the next Education Council in May.</p>

A key messages paper will be adopted following a public debate on the economic crisis and the European economic recovery plan. The key messages paper identifies the main messages emerging from the various other reports for adoption at the March Council.
