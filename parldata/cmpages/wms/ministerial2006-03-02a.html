<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60302m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 I attended a conference in Paris this week on innovative financing for development. At this conference, France and the UK set out their commitment to move forward on these issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302m01.html_para0"><a name="stpa_0">In 2005, significant progress was made in delivering 100 per cent. multilateral debt relief and a significant increase in resources for development to help countries to meet the MDGs. The international community committed to increase aid by $50 billion and the European Union committed to double aid by 2010, reaching 0.7 per cent. by 2015.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302m01.html_para1"><a name="stpa_1">In order to deliver and bring forward these commitments, there is a clear need for innovative forms of finance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302m01.html_para2"><a name="stpa_2">In September last year, the IFF for Immunisation (IFFIm) was launched with contributions from France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and now Norway, as well as the UK. By frontloading aid and investing an extra $4 billion in vaccination now, the IFFIm is expected to save a total of 10 million lives, including 5 million children before 2015. France has reiterated its support for this important initiative and will contribute an average of $100 million a year over 20 years. The IFFIm is now so advanced that the first bonds will be issued within a matter of weeks, and the IFFm will begin purchasing vaccines and delivering these to the poorest countries in the first half of 2006.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302m01.html_para3"><a name="stpa_3">Last year, the G8 agreed to provide universal access to HIV/AIDS by 2010. The UK is committed to spend &#163;1.5 billion on HIV/AIDS over the next three years, including on the purchase of drugs, and expects at least this level of spending to continue over the long term. It has agreed to support the French proposal for an International Drug Purchase Facility, which will provide greater access to those in developing countries to much-needed drugs to tackle HIV/AIDS and malaria.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302m01.html_para4"><a name="stpa_4">Given the scale of the challenge for reaching the MDGs by 2015, France and the UK have agreed to work on a larger initiative&#151;an International Finance Facility (IFF)&#151;not just focused on vaccination, but on the achievement of all the MDGs including on health and education.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302m01.html_para5"><a name="stpa_5">The UK and France have agreed to jointly establish a working group to consider the implementation of an IFF going to health and education, among other sectors, which will be partly funded by an air ticket levy. The UK will hypothecate part of its Air Passenger Duty to provide a long-term stream of finance to the IFFIm and IFF. This working group will report back in advance of the September meetings of the IMF and the World Bank meetings.

 In response to recommendations made in reports by the Directorate of Operational Capability, House of Commons Defence Committee and the Adult Learning Inspectorate, and as part of the MOD&#039;s continuing drive to improve its standard of care towards its recruits and trainees, I have decided to create a single Army Training and Recruiting Agency Staff Leadership School (ASLS) within the Army Training and Recruiting Agency&#039;s Initial Training Group in order to improve the preparation of training and supervisory staff. I am minded to place this within an existing Army Training Regiment (ATR) site at Pirbright as this location not only meets the key business requirements for the creation of an ASLS, but also provides the best value for money option for defence. Additionally, in order to contribute to meeting overall departmental funding priorities, I am minded to transfer Army training functions currently undertaken at ATR Lichfield to the expanded ATR Pirbright site. This transfer would take place subject to finding an alternate Defence use for the Lichfield site. These moves would also afford an opportunity, within work considering possible future Army Command structures, to transfer out of that Command the Headquarters of the Initial Training Group. I am minded to move this Headquarters to the improved accommodation at Pirbright since the expanded ATR site would constitute a natural focal point for the headquarters. Trades union consultation on these proposals will be undertaken.

 The Defence Training Review (DTR) Rationalisation Programme aims to improve, modernise and rationalise the delivery of phase 2 and phase 3 specialist training. It is a PFI/PPP solution, over 25 years, designed to deliver training on a defence rather than single service basis, bringing about the necessary modernisation and flexibility required to accommodate the Department&#039;s changing training requirements. The chosen solution will involve rationalising the existing training estate and providing significant investment in key sites to create nationally recognised centres of training excellence.

 Today the Government are publishing the report of the study team from the University of Reading and Arup who were commissioned by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and Welsh Assembly Government to review the operation and effectiveness of the Code of Best Practice on Mobile Phone Network Development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302m02.html_para2"><a name="stpa_26">The ODPM published the Code of Best Practice on Mobile Phone Network Development in November 2002. The Code was produced jointly by central and local government and the mobile phone industry. It provides advice on consultation procedures between operators, local authorities and local people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302m02.html_para3"><a name="stpa_27">The key conclusions of the review are that the introduction of the Code of Best Practice has significantly improved the process of planning for mobile network development and where operators and their agents comply with the code, it is considered to be working well. The review found that local planning authority involvement varies considerably in terms of their compliance with the code and involvement in planning for mobile network development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302m02.html_para4"><a name="stpa_28">The researchers also found that community representatives feel that the code as currently drafted does not offer them assurance that their responses to any consultation undertaken will actually be taken on board by the operators.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302m02.html_para5"><a name="stpa_29">These findings led the researchers to recommend that the Code of Best Practice should be revised to build upon many of the positive aspects to improve it. The report also recommends the code should be strengthened and that the status of some of the guidance in the code should be made more formal, in the context of a revision of planning policy guidance on telecommunications and that there should be an independent adjudication body to consider complaints.

The Council adopted the joint report, along with a short key messages document based on this report to forward to the Spring European Council. Ministers stressed in particular the importance of education and training in the Lisbon Strategy, while noting the need to maintain a balance between the social and economic objectives of education policies. In discussion, Ministers warned against setting input targets for investment in education and training, which would not by themselves improve the effectiveness of spending. They also noted the importance of increasing private investment in higher education, where Europe currently lags behind its main competitors.

<a name="60302m02.html_para10"><a name="stpa_34">Ministers had an exchange of views on the basis of the Commission&#039;s proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on key competences for lifelong learning, on which the Presidency hopes for general agreement at the May Council. Ministers were asked to comment on the proposed framework of key competences, and on how they are addressing the acquisition of key competences at national level. The UK tabled a position paper on the recommendation, setting out UK policy on skills development. In general, Ministers welcomed the key competences framework as a useful voluntary reference tool for member states to use when developing their curricula and strategies for lifelong learning. Ministers emphasised the importance of giving special attention to disadvantaged groups, and stressed the need to continue to share good practice on developing key competences within their lifelong learning strategies.

<a name="60302m02.html_para11"><a name="stpa_35">There followed a policy debate on the establishment of a European Indicator of Language Competence. The presidency noted that conclusions on this issue would be tabled at the May Council. All delegations welcomed the Commission&#039;s initiative of taking forward the commitment made by Heads of State and Government in Barcelona in 2002 to establishing the indicator and agreed to set up an advisory board composed of member states&#039; representatives and experts (including from the Council of Europe) in order to take forward developmental work. UK (Anne Lambert) agreed that more information on practical and financial implications is needed before member states can work on implementation. Ministers were also asked to give their views about the level of testing and the languages to be tested. There was a consensus towards testing at the end of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) Level 2 (lower secondary education, equivalent to age 14 in the UK), which is favoured by the UK. Most member states agreed with the presidency&#039;s suggestion of testing only those official languages of the Union most widely taught in the first survey round, but the majority took the view that member states should be free to choose which of those languages to test in their country. The UK tabled a position paper in reply to the Presidency questions, which also stated a preference of a flexible window 2009&#150;11 to be agreed for when the first tests would take place.

Ministers emphasised the importance of the youth pact in developing a coordinated approach to policies for young people in the context of the Lisbon Strategy.

 The Phoenix Development Fund is a time-limited initiative designed to explore good practice in delivering business support and to find innovative ways to reach out to communities considered hard to reach by mainstream providers. It was not designed to provide long term or core funding for business support organisations. The Small Business Service (SBS, an agency of the DTI) will not be contracting for any new activities under this programme when existing contracts end in March 2006. We are currently discussing with RDAs the arrangements for local management of the fund.

In addition, the Government have introduced the Local Enterprise Grant Initiative that will provide &#163;300 million over three years to local councils in the most deprived areas to encourage the development of more enterprising communities and this programme will benefit from the lessons learned through the Phoenix Development Fund as well as being joined up with the continuing work of the Phoenix Challenge Fund and the Community Development Finance Institutions that it supports.

<a name="60302m04.html_sbhd0"><h4 align=center>Statutory Redundancy Payments Scheme</h4>





<p><a name="st_12"><a name="60302m04.html_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe): </b> 
 The Government have been considering what amendments might be needed to the statutory redundancy payments scheme to bring it into line with the EU Employment Directive, which requires Member States to outlaw discrimination on the grounds of age, among other things, in the employment field. The current scheme contains three age bands and directs greatest financial support to older workers and those with long service.






<br>&nbsp;<br>2 Mar 2006 : Column 40WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60302m04.html_para0">We have been discussing the way forward with key stakeholders over the last few months, including the CBI, EEF and TUC. In the course of those discussions the Government became concerned that a system using a single multiplier might not meet our overall policy aims. We have therefore carefully examined the rationale for the current scheme, and come to the conclusion that this provides the best fit with our aims.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302m04.html_para1"><a name="stpa_62">Evidence the Government have gathered demonstrates that younger, prime age and older workers fall into three distinct economic categories, with older workers facing a particularly difficult position in the employment market. Young workers tend not to be out of work for long, and see only a small fall in pay when switching jobs. Older workers are much more likely to become long-term unemployed, and to experience a substantial fall in pay when finding a new job. Prime age workers fall into the middle. We therefore believe that it is sensible for the level of support provided through the scheme to reflect these three categories. A system using a single multiplier would leave a significant group of older workers substantially worse off than at present, and we believe this would be unacceptable. Even if a substantial amount of money were injected into the scheme so as to leave older workers no worse off, the enhanced benefits to younger workers are not justified by their position in the employment market.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302m04.html_para2"><a name="stpa_63">The Directive provides for the possibility of Member States providing for different treatment on the grounds of age, where this difference of treatment is objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim, including employment policy. We have looked at this question very closely and are confident that retaining the age bands is permitted by the Directive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60302m04.html_para3"><a name="stpa_64">The Government have however decided to remove the lower and upper age limits in the redundancy scheme (at 18 and 65 respectively) and the taper at the age of 64 because we believe, as employees are living and working longer, these cannot be justified under the Directive. A small group of amendments to the scheme will be set out in the forthcoming age regulations, which will be laid before Parliament shortly.
