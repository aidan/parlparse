 Section 5 of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993 requires the Government to report to Parliament for its approval an assessment of the UK's medium-term economic and budgetary position. This assessment is comprised of the Budget report and the Office of Budget Responsibility's (OBR's) "Economic and fiscal outlook". This then forms the basis of the UK's convergence programme, which is therefore based entirely on information already presented to Parliament. The UK is obliged to submit a convergence programme annually to the European Commission under article 126 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union (the "Lisbon" treaty).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="110426m0001.htm_para0"><a name="1104263000015">Article 126 is the legal basis for the stability and growth pact, which is the co-ordination mechanism for EU fiscal policies and requires member states to avoid excessive Government deficits, although the UK, by virtue of its protocol to the treaty opting out of the euro, is only required to "endeavour to avoid" excessive deficits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="110426m0001.htm_para1"><a name="1104263000016">The Budget report and the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR's) "Economic and fiscal outlook" were deposited in the Library of the House on 23 March 2011. A small proportion of the content of the convergence programme may be drawn from other material that has already been presented to Parliament, such as last year's spending review. All of the information it contains has therefore already been published and made available to Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="110426m0001.htm_para2"><a name="1104263000017">A debate in this House has been scheduled for 27 April in order for the House to approve this assessment.</p>

Copies have been deposited in the Library of the House and the document is available electronically via the HM Treasury website. It will be submitted to the EU by 30 April as required by the European Commission. While the convergence programme itself is not subject to parliamentary approval or amendment, a small supply of advance copies was made available to Members through the Vote Office on 21 April.</p>

<a name="110426m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="1104263000048"><ul><p class="tabletext">Ministers acknowledged the Portuguese authorities' request for financial assistance.

</ul><a name="110426m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="1104263000051"><ul><p class="tabletext">The programme will be based on three pillars:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="110426m0001.htm_para7"><a name="1104263000023">On the second day, discussions focused on commodity markets, a forward look to the G20, IMF and World Bank spring meetings, and the comprehensive response to the crisis.</p>

 I am pleased to announce that the Government are setting up a new Animal Health and Welfare Board for England. This is an important step in sharing responsibility for animal health and welfare with animal keepers and other interested parties. The aim is to build trust between Government and animal keepers and strengthen arrangements for working together to develop a true partnership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="110426m0001.htm_para8"><a name="1104263000025">Animal diseases, whether outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, avian influenza, or bluetongue, or current ones such as bovine TB, or salmonella, can be costly to animal keepers and Government alike. It is in everyone's interests to reduce the risk and costs of disease outbreaks relating to all kept animals, including farmed animals, horses and pets, and to maintain our reputation for high welfare standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="110426m0001.htm_para9"><a name="1104263000026">Since the 2001 foot and mouth disease outbreak, industry and Government have worked more closely together to agree disease control strategies, and there has been a series of proposals and consultations about what respective responsibilities should be in future. Most recently the report of the independently chaired advisory group on responsibility and cost-sharing was published on 13 December 2010. I record here my thanks to the chair and all the members of the advisory group for their work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="110426m0001.htm_para10"><a name="1104263000027">In developing our proposals for the board we have carefully considered the group's recommendations, and listened to the views expressed about them since the report's publication.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="110426m0001.htm_para11"><a name="1104263000028">The new board will have responsibility for strategic animal health and welfare policy and oversight of its delivery in relation to England. It will be composed of around 12 members, who will be the senior DEFRA officials with responsibility for animal health and welfare (currently five people including the chief veterinary officer in his England role) and around seven to eight external non-executive members. The board will be the principal source of departmental advice to DEFRA Ministers on strategic animal health and welfare policy in relation to England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="110426m0001.htm_para12"><a name="1104263000029">We will seek external members (including the chair) who between them, have the skills, knowledge and experience to understand the whole range of strategic policy matters.

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="110426m0001.htm_para13"><a name="1104263000030">Each external member of the board will have responsibility for engaging with a set of stakeholder groups and ensuring that the views of those groups are articulated in the board's decision-making processes.

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="110426m0001.htm_para15"><a name="1104263000032">I expect the board to be appointed in the second half of 2011, and its views will shape the way DEFRA does business in the future and how it manages key relationships with delivery bodies, particularly the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="110426m0001.htm_para16"><a name="1104263000033">This is an innovative and exciting approach to bringing those affected by Government decisions into the heart of the process in order to create a more direct link between those making DEFRA policy and those experiencing the delivery of that policy. Its success will depend on the support of animal keepers and stakeholder organisations for the board and its members. I look forward to continuing the constructive dialogue already evident in the responses to the advisory group report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="110426m0001.htm_para17"><a name="1104263000034">The board will not deliver results overnight. This is a new way of working for both Government and stakeholders. I expect it gradually to strengthen joint working and lead to a greater understanding by all of the practices that collectively and cost-effectively reduce disease risk and maintain high welfare. Agreement on how best to achieve them should lead to greater adherence to responsible practices and thence to reduced animal disease risk and improved standards of health and welfare. This will benefit the Government, the public and animal keepers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="110426m0001.htm_para18"><a name="1104263000035">The advisory group recommended that cost-sharing should be taken forward in a staged approach once responsibility sharing arrangements were in place.

 The Special Court for Sierra Leone is the first international criminal tribunal to be funded entirely from voluntary contributions from Governments. Since its creation in 2002, the United Kingdom has been a strong and steady contributor of funds to the Special Court. As a demonstration of our continued support, I am informing the House that the Government have recently contributed an additional £3 million; the United Kingdom has now contributed around £27 million overall. Our contributions have helped the Special Court successfully to investigate and prosecute eight of those who bore the greatest responsibility for serious violations of international humanitarian law and Sierra Leonean law committed during its bloody civil war. The Government's latest donation will also help allow the Special Court to complete the trial of Charles Taylor, former President of Liberia, the first former head of state to be brought  <br>

This enables the Department to achieve better value for money by enabling a more rapid take-up of online claims with lower operational delivery costs. Parliamentary approval for additional resource and capital of £50 million for this new service will be sought in the main estimate for the Department for Work and Pensions. Pending that approval, urgent expenditure estimated at £18 million will be met by repayable cash advances from the Contingencies Fund.</p>
