<a name="40429m01.html_sbhd5"><h4 align=center>International Development Association</h4>












<p><a name="40429m01.html_spmin5"><b>The Secretary of State for International Development  (Hilary Benn): </b> 
 In 2002, the UK agreed to contribute &#163;900 million to the thirteenth replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank&#039;s concessional lending arm which is designed to meet the needs of the world&#039;s poorest countries. In addition to this contribution, the UK set aside another &#163;100 million to be provided on condition that a satisfactory framework was agreed to compensate IDA for the costs of introducing grants under its thirteenth replenishment (IDA 13). Both the initial &#163;900 million contribution and the additional provisional contribution of &#163;100 million were approved by Parliament on 3 December 2002.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40429m01.html_para2">I am pleased to announce that a satisfactory framework for compensating IDA 13 for the introduction of grants has now been agreed. Under this framework, donors will compensate IDA upfront for the administrative costs associated with providing grants, through making additional contributions to the next replenishment (IDA 14). (These are costs which arise early in the project cycle and, in the case of loans, would be covered by recipient countries.) Meanwhile, donors will compensate for the lost re-flows from recipient countries as and when these would have fallen due. Given the 10-year grace period provided under IDA on repayment of loans, this would not have happened until 2013 at the earliest. Compensation payments will not therefore be required until this time, and the exact means of compensation will be discussed as part of future IDA replenishments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40429m01.html_para3">An essential and fundamental principle of the agreed grants compensation framework is that donors should contribute to the cost of compensation in line with their share of IDA 13 (their &#039;burden share&#039;). If the UK were to contribute the full &#163;100 million set aside to cover the costs of upfront compensation, we would effectively displace the contributions of other donors. We have therefore decided to cover both our burden share under IDA 13, and the structural financing gap inherent in this replenishment (equivalent to 9.37 per cent. of total resource needs from donors), making a total UK contribution for upfront IDA 13 grants compensation of &#163;64.8 million.

<p><a name="40429m01.html_spmin8"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Ivor Caplin): </b> 
 Our armed forces have an enviable reputation throughout the world for their professional delivery of operational military capability in a vast spectrum of roles. These range from war fighting to the complex and often subtle requirements of peace support operations and counter-terrorism; besides turning their hand, as they have done in recent years, to providing support to the civil community assisting with fire-fighting, flood-relief and the foot and mouth outbreak. Most who come across Service personnel acknowledge that they have sound essential military skills and operate within an ethos that differs from that generally found within the sphere of civilian employment. Yet those who join the services are not fundamentally different from the rest of society. What turns a young man or woman into a service person, capable of taking on successfully the variety of challenging roles which our country demands of them, is the training and education undertaken by servicemen and women throughout their careers.






<br>&nbsp;<br>29 Apr 2004 : Column 54WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="40429m01.html_para8">The Ministry of Defence is one of the largest providers of training and education to the 16 plus age group in the UK. The initial training delivered to new recruits is geared to provide them with the essential skills and knowledge to be capable of operating effectively in often unpredictable, violent, dangerous and stressful environments from the outset of their careers. MOD seeks to develop each individual to his or her maximum potential. Service personnel are given training and education to improve upon their latent ability; some who join may lack basic skills whilst others have graduate qualifications. The scope and scale of the training and education provision is considerable, and spans the whole length of a career in the forces. Not only does this help to recruit and retain people, but, equally importantly, when service personnel return to civilian employment, they take with them skills of value to society.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40429m01.html_para9">I am therefore pleased to announce that today I have placed in the Library of the House a Policy Paper, entitled &quot;Individual Training and Education in the Armed Forces&quot;. The paper provides information on MOD&#039;s wide spectrum of training and education and explains the skills agenda to which this operates. At its core lies the fundamental requirement to prepare servicemen and women to deliver operational capability. It includes insights into the key stages of initial training and the training environment, and highlights the MOD&#039;s determination to remain at the forefront of developing skills for the 21st Century.

<p><a name="40429m02.html_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration  (Mr. Desmond Browne): </b> 
 I have today laid before the House a statement of changes to the immigration rules. From 1 May 2004, as a result of the accession of 10 new states to the European Union, nationals of those EU accession states will not require immigration leave to enter or stay in the UK. Consequently it is necessary to remove all references to the individual EU accession states in the immigration rules with effect from the date of accession.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40429m02.html_para1">We have also decided to amend the European economic area (EEA) national settlement requirements to enable those currently in immigration categories leading to settlement to aggregate time spent here under the immigration rules with that as an EEA national in the UK when making an application to settle. This ensures that new EU nationals will not have to spend a 





<br>&nbsp;<br>29 Apr 2004 : Column 55WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

longer time in the UK to qualify for settlement than they would if accession had not occurred. This mirrors the practice followed in previous accessions.

<p><a name="40429m02.html_spmin3"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs  (Mr. Bill Rammell): </b> 
 The Government have issued an open licence for the export to Iran of goods that will be listed in the United Kingdom strategic export controls annual report as &quot;Components for Military Aero Engines&quot;. The goods will be used by the oil and gas industry overhaul turbines that power pumps for oil and gas pipelines. The goods are military listed because they were originally designed and used for military aircraft engines. In this instance, the Government are satisfied that there is a minimal risk of diversion to a military end use, and are prepared to make an exception to the UK national arms embargo. Other aspects of the application were considered against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria.

<p><a name="40429m03.html_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Mr. David Jamieson): </b> 
 On 21 October 2003, the Department for Transport launched a consultation exercise to consider the options for implementing the road transport (working time) directive&#151;2002/15/EC (RTD) into UK legislation. This directive provides extra protection for drivers and crew of heavy goods and public service vehicles, who carry out road transport activities covered by the EU drivers&#039; hours rules&#151;regulation (EEC) 3820/85.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40429m03.html_para0">This exercise has now finished. In the light of responses received the Government has decided that the UK regulations should:
</p>

<p>
<a name="40429m03.html_para1"><i>Implement the two derogations available under the RTD. This means that:</i>

</p>
<ul>

</p>

<p>
<a name="40429m03.html_para2">To take advantage of the derogations, there will need to be either a collective agreement, or a workforce agreement at company level between the employer and employees. In addition, drivers will still be subject to the limits under EU drivers&#039; hours rules (regulation 3820/85/EEC)

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">define &quot;night time&quot; as a period between 00.00&#150;04.00 for drivers and crew of goods vehicles, but as 01.00&#150;05.00 for drivers and crew of passenger vehicles.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>
