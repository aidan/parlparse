<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60118m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Trade  (Ian Pearson): </b> 
 During Foreign and Commonwealth Office oral questions on Tuesday 10 January, in response to a supplementary question from my hon. Friend for Northampton, North (Ms. Keeble), I said that &quot;the United Kingdom is providing &#163;10 million in support for the emergency housing programme&quot;&#151;<i>Official Report,</i> column 144. I should have said that the United Kingdom has disbursed over &#163;1 million in support to the international response to Operation Murambatsvina, which has included support for basic supplies, water and sanitation. The &#163;10 million figure actually refers to HMG&#039;s commitment to the UN World Food Programme for food distribution. I apologise to my hon. Friend and to the House for this inadvertent error.

 As a result of intelligence received in 2001 and July 2004 suggesting systematic fraud in applications for UK Ancestry from Zimbabwean nationals, consideration of such applications was suspended pending further investigation.

This authorisation enables staff in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate to subject these applications to more rigorous investigation than applications from persons of other nationalities, for the purpose of detecting fraudulent applications.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118m01.html_para29"><a name="stpa_28">We will review the continued need for this authorisation before its expiry.
