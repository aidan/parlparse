<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50315m01.html_spmin2"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs  (Mr. Christopher Leslie): </b> 
 My noble Friend the Secretary of State has made the following written ministerial statement:

</p>

<p>
<a name="50315m01.html_para13"><a name="stpa_13">&quot;I am pleased to announce today plans for the introduction of a national enforcement service to take forward my commitment to ensuring the fullest possible compliance with court orders. For too long enforcement of court orders has been patchy and flawed. We have made real improvements in enforcement. The payment rate of fines now at 80 per cent. compared with just over 50 per cent. two years ago. But there is more to be done. The time has come for the next stage of reform.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50315m01.html_para14"><a name="stpa_14">My proposals involve the introduction of a robust national framework to deliver a single consistent enforcement process for the whole of England and Wales, and to deal robustly with offenders who fail to attend court, default on fine payments and breach community penalty orders. The launch of the new unified Her Majesty&#039;s Court Service next month, will allow us to put in place a cross-criminal justice system enforcement team that is more distinct, professional and better skilled. The specific remit of the national enforcement service will be to bear down on the hard core of offenders who consistently attempt to flout their obligations to the courts. This does not mean a new agency or department, but a better, more collaborative approach to tackling enforcement, which builds on the lessons learned from national initiatives including the recent &quot;Operation Payback&quot;. Enforcement staff in the magistrates courts together with the police, the national probation service and other criminal justice agencies will form the core of the service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50315m01.html_para15"><a name="stpa_15">Improving sentence compliance is key to building public confidence in the criminal justice system and the national enforcement service will do just that. The national enforcement service framework will be tested first across a region from April 2006 with the aim of full national rollout in 2007&#150;08&quot;.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50315m01.html_spmin4"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Yvette Cooper): </b> 
 Further to my statement of 24 February about Reading 





<br>&nbsp;<br>15 Mar 2005 : Column 12WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

University&#039;s final report on the impact of the property industry&#039;s 2002 code of practice for commercial leases, I wish to announce our conclusions following the completion of the research and our own consultation exercise last year on upward only rent review clauses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50315m01.html_para33"><a name="stpa_33">The Government continue to be concerned about flexibility in the commercial property market. The Reading report shows that the property market has become more flexible, notably with continuing trends towards shorter leases and break clauses, and I welcome these. However, there are still areas of inflexibility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50315m01.html_para34"><a name="stpa_34">The Reading report indicates that the major problems are now inflexible assignment and subletting provisions in leases. These can make it difficult for tenants to dispose of properties they no longer need for their business. We intend to undertake a review of the law of assignment and subletting, with the aim of easing the position for tenants while not jeopardising property investment, including looking at legislative options.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50315m01.html_para35"><a name="stpa_35">We continue to have concerns about the prevalence of upward only rent review clauses in longer leases. The Reading report shows that their impact has been diminishing, as fewer leases contain any form of rent review provisions, and that tenants are currently more concerned about inflexible assignment and subletting provisions than they are about upward only rent reviews. We do however believe that further progress in this area is necessary to improve the flexibility of the market. We will therefore continue to monitor the situation and retain the option to legislate in future if necessary. But we do not propose to legislate against upward only rent review clauses at present.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50315m01.html_para36"><a name="stpa_36">The other major area of concern is the continuing lack of awareness of property issues among small businesses. The Reading report shows that many small businesses fail to obtain the best leasing terms available because they lack essential information about the leasing environment and the local market. There is a need for action by both the Government and the property industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50315m01.html_para37"><a name="stpa_37">We are asking the property industry to undertake a joint review of the code of practice, to carry out a renewed campaign to disseminate the code and provide an effective mechanism for dealing with complaints. We want to make sure that everyone negotiating a lease adopts the code.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50315m01.html_para38"><a name="stpa_38">We will be undertaking a further monitoring exercise over the next three years, and we will be looking for further movement on flexibility. We believe that achieving greater flexibility in the market is extremely important and that further market reform is essential.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50315m01.html_para39"><a name="stpa_39">We shall be inviting the property industry to join us in practical steps to improve small business knowledge of property matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50315m01.html_para40"><a name="stpa_40">We will shortly be making available on our website a summary of the responses to the consultation paper on upward only rent reviews. We will be placing copies of individual responses in the Library of the House while copies will also be available for public inspection in the ODPM Library.

 In March 2005, after consultation with the Ministry of Defence and the export control organisations, DTI, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office donated armoured vests and body armour plates to the Iranian Anti-Narcotics Police (ANP). This gift was to provide an element of protection for the ANP in their work of countering drugs smuggling from Afghanistan. We are satisfied that these goods would only be used for anti-narcotics operations and are therefore prepared to make an exception to the UK national embargo announced in 1993, as amended in 1998.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50315m02.html_para3"><a name="stpa_44">We are fully committed to implementing the UK embargo on Iran. However, we are, in limited circumstances, prepared to make exceptions where denying an export or a gift would be contrary to the intention of the embargo. As the UK has been active in encouraging and assisting Iran with combating the smuggling of drugs from Afghanistan, I am confident that granting this exception is fully consistent with this responsible approach of supporting the ANP whilst respecting the aims of the embargo.

of the programme, and that appropriate budget allocations must be made to ensure effective implementation. I also accept the need for closer working between the United Kingdom jurisdictions to ensure that there are no loopholes to be exploited between the systems operating in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This co-operation has featured as an important element of the implementation work so far. I will also look to strengthen the work being undertaken with foreign jurisdictions from which large numbers of staff come to the United Kingdom to work with children and vulnerable adults.

<a name="50315m02.html_para14"><a name="stpa_54">The pathways to work pilots are a major step forward in the reform of incapacity benefits and in the way people with a health condition or disability are helped back to work. Under the pathways pilots Jobcentre Plus and the NHS work positively together to re-focus people on their remaining abilities and their own aspirations for a return to work. The pilots offer all claimants access to:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">support from a highly skilled Jobcentre Plus personal adviser offering support and contact especially in the early stages of a claim when people can be most readily helped back to work;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">groundbreaking rehabilitation support offered jointly with the NHS in each pilot area so that claimants can be supported to manage and cope with their health condition (e.g. back pain, angina, mental illness) so they can get back to work;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">strong local partnerships with the New Deal for Disabled People&#151;voluntary and private sector employment advisers;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">a &#163;40 a week return to work credit for a year once they get jobs so that it pays to get back to work;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">work with local GPs and employers to ensure people on IB are not discouraged from working again.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50315m02.html_para15"><a name="stpa_55">The pathways pilots have targeted new IB claimants and existing claimants who volunteer. From last month the mandatory elements of the pathways approach have been tested with some existing claimants.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50315m02.html_para16"><a name="stpa_56">The latest figures from the pathways to work pilots (including data up to the end of December) continue to be very encouraging. I am placing a copy of the findings in the Library. In particular they show that:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">well over 10,000 people have now been placed into work in pathways pilot areas&#151;these numbers include over 2,000 existing claimants for whom participation in this pilot has been entirely voluntary;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">the number of recorded job entries for people with a health condition or disability has almost doubled compared with same period last year;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">the proportion of people leaving IB for work within six months of a claim starting appears to be significantly higher in pathways than non-pathways areas. Benefit off-flow rates are up to 10 percentage points higher compared to the rest of the country;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">performance appears very positive in both Phase 1 (the three areas that started in October 2003) and Phase 2 locations (the four areas that started in April 2004);</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">between 20 and 25 per cent. of those attending an initial WFI are taking up Jobcentre Plus, New Deal or NHS back to work support. This is around six times higher than the proportions accessing back to work support in the rest of the country. In Jobcentre Plus Pathfinder areas the figures are closer to around 4 per cent. and in the rest of the country 2 per cent.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50315m02.html_para17"><a name="stpa_57">These continuing, positive findings have formed the backdrop to the announcement made on 2 December 2004 by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In the pre-Budget report he announced a plan to expand pathways to work to cover the Jobcentre Plus districts that contained the 30 local authority districts with the greatest proportions of the working age population on incapacity benefits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50315m02.html_para18"><a name="stpa_58">The positive response of claimants and advisers and NHS staff to this radical initiative have also firmly shaped the detail of the DWP&#039;s five-year strategy and our plans to abolish incapacity benefit for new claimants and replace it with payments that more actively incentivise and support all those with the potential to get back to work to realise their own aspirations for doing so. I aim to publish a Green Paper setting out more details on these proposals in July.
