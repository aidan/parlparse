Minister of State, Ministry of Defence (Mr. Adam
Ingram):</b> The Ministry of Defence has today launched the
Defence Technology Strategy (DTS) setting out the technologies that are
most important to the future provision of military capability for our
Armed Forces. The DTS builds on the Defence Industrial Strategy White
Paper published in December last year and has been developed in close
collaboration with industry and academia. It outlines the research and
development priorities on which we must work together to encourage
innovation in support of the UK&#146;s front line
forces.</p><p><a name="06101747000032">This
strategy will help MOD and Industry plan future investment in research
and development (R&amp;D). It identifies clear R&amp;D priorities,
including those areas in which we believe it is important to maintain
sovereign control. It highlights opportunities for collaboration and
addresses long-term support to the UK&#146;s science and technology
skill
base.</p><p><a name="06101747000034">Included
in the strategy are several initiatives to support and encourage
innovation and the science and engineering skill base in the UK. These
include a competition of ideas, which will provide rapid funding for
innovative research proposals from industry and academia in areas of
particular importance to defence, and a grand challenge to produce an
autonomous or semi autonomous system designed to detect, identify,
monitor and report a comprehensive range of physical threats in a
complex urban environment. Both have been designed to stimulate
free-ranging innovation from the widest possible science and technology
base.</p><p><a name="06101747000036">The
Defence Technology Strategy sets clear direction for the future and is
the foundation for a vibrant and innovative research and development
relationship between MOD, industry and academia. It will ensure that
the UK Armed Forces continue to benefit from the highest level of
technological research and
innovation.</p><p><a name="06101747000038">Copies
of the Defence Technology Strategy have been placed in the Library of

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Derek
Twigg):</b> The Ministry of Defence (MOD) welcomes the
court&#146;s judgment that the scheme&#146;s criteria do not
directly discriminate on the grounds of race and that it was legitimate
to limit payments to those with a close link to the United
Kingdom.</p><br>

the court&#146;s finding that the way the Government chose
to define that close link&#151;introducing the
&#145;birthlink&#146; criteria&#151;involved unjustified indirect
discrimination against those of non-United Kingdom national origins. We
will not be seeking leave to
appeal.</p><p><a name="06101747000043">The
purpose of the birthlink criteria was to provide an administratively
manageable way of paying more British subjects, not fewer. It was never
the MOD&#146;s intention to discriminate against Mrs.
Elias or anyone else on grounds of race. Nonetheless, in the light of
the court&#146;s judgment, which the MOD accepts, the Department
recognises the hurt unintentionally caused to Mrs. Elias
personally and will pay her the compensation that the court ordered,
plus interest. Mrs. Elias had already received an ex-gratia
payment of &#163;10,000 under the scheme pursuant to changes to the
scheme&#146;s eligibility criteria that were announced in March of
this year. Those changes meant that those who have resided in the UK
for at least 20 years between the end of the second world war and
November 2000, when the scheme was introduced, qualify for a
payment.</p><p><a name="06101747000045">Civilian
claims submitted after the High Court judgment on 7 July 2005 have
been, and will continue to be, decided only on the basis of the other,
residence-based, criteria, based either on normal residence in the
United Kingdom before the war and return to United Kingdom shortly
afterwards, or at least 20 years&#146; residence in the United
Kingdom between 1945 and November
2000.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="61017m0001.htmdpthd_4"><a name="06101747000004">Foreign

Trilateral
Forum</h4><p><a name="06101747000046"><b><a name="61017m0001.htm_spnew421"><a name="06101747000094">The
Minister for Europe (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</b> I wish
to make a statement to the House on the Gibraltar Trilateral Forum,
following the successful ministerial meeting in Cordoba, Spain on 18
September
2006.</p><p><a name="06101747000047">In
consultation with the Government of Gibraltar the Trilateral Forum was
established in December 2004 by my right hon. Friend the former Foreign
Secretary (Mr. Jack Straw), and Spanish Foreign Minister
Señor Miguel Ángel Moratinos. It was hailed at the time
as a major breakthrough for relations between the UK, Spain and
Gibraltar. It gave rise to genuine optimism that we could set our
historic differences aside and discuss practical issues that affect the
people of Spain and
Gibraltar.</p><p><a name="06101747000048">I
am delighted that, after almost two years of intense
negotiations, the trilateral forum has borne fruit. For the first time
the UK, Spain and Gibraltar have negotiated together a three-way
package of agreements. These demonstrate that we can work together to
make a real difference to the quality of lives of people in the region
despite our well-known differences on the question of
sovereignty.</p><p><a name="06101747000049">A
key feature in the forum is the full and equal role the Government of
Gibraltar plays. Chief Minister Peter Caruana has shown considerable
leadership and vision and has shaped the direction of the talks and
negotiated constructively throughout, including on 
<br>

<meta name="Date" content="17 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 48WS</b><br>issues that were particularly sensitive for Gibraltar. It would also be
remiss of me not to pay a particular tribute to Señor Moratinos
and the Spanish Government. He and Prime Minister Zapatero have, I
believe, shown courage and foresight in pursuing a more constructive
policy towards
Gibraltar.</p><p><a name="06101747000050">The
substance of the agreements we have reached in September is ground
breaking. They will deliver practical benefits to the people of
Gibraltar and the surrounding region in the short
term.</p><p><a name="06101747000051"><i>The
airport agreement</i> will benefit the people and businesses of
Gibraltar. Gibraltar&#146;s exclusion from EU aviation legislation is
to be lifted and Spanish airspace restrictions will end; there will be
a new terminal; and a greater choice of flights from Gibraltar,
including to Spain and other European destinations. This will be a huge
economic boost to Gibraltar. All sides are agreed that the arrangements
on the airport have no implications for sovereignty, jurisdiction, or
control.</p><p><a name="06101747000052">On
<i>the border crossing</i> the introduction of red and green channels
into Spain and two-lane access into Gibraltar should improve pedestrian
and traffic flows. This is potentially a key development for the many
people who cross the frontier for work, business and leisure
reasons.</p><p><a name="06101747000053">On
<i>telecoms</i>, Spain&#146;s recognition of Gibraltar&#146;s
international dialling code +350 will improve cross border
communications. And Gibraltarian mobile phone users will shortly be
able to use their mobiles to dial home when travelling in
Spain.</p><p><a name="06101747000054">Finally,
a settlement to the long-running question of pensions payments for
former Spanish workers in Gibraltar will, I believe, bring to an end a
dispute which has been a priority for the current Spanish Government.
As part of this settlement Spain has agreed not to charge the
pensioners&#146; healthcare costs to the UK (as they were entitled to
do under EC directives). This agreement therefore represents good value
for money to the UK
taxpayer.</p><p><a name="06101747000055">The
next step is of course to make the trilateral agreement work. The full
and timely implementation of the agreement is vital as people will not
judge the forum by its statements, but by what happens on the ground. I
can promise that the UK Government will spare no effort to deliver the
agreements we have reached. I am entirely confident that the
Governments of Spain and Gibraltar will also implement the Cordoba
agreements. They are a package and all sides are agreed that they must
be implemented as a whole: there can be no
cherry-picking.</p><p><a name="06101747000056">We
will now look to build on these agreements to explore future areas of
practical cooperation. With continued commitment from all sides, I
believe we can make the tensions that have for far too long
characterised cross-border relations a thing of the
past.</p><p><a name="06101747000057">I

other key documents, setting out how we will achieve both our short and

cross-Government strategy which will deliver on our aim to halve and
eradicate child poverty and to ensure all children have the best start
