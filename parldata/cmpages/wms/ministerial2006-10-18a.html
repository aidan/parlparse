Minister for Housing and Planning (Yvette Cooper):</b> The
Government are today announcing 49 schemes, involving 38 local
authorities, that will ensure social rented homes meet and maintain
minimum standards of decency. These schemes should deliver around
&#163;3 billion of investment, of which at least &#163;1.8
billion will be levered in from the private sector. They will tackle
over 80,000 non-decent homes, and ensure that a further 100,000 are
maintained at the standard that tenants have a right to
expect.</p><p><a name="06101858000011">These
new schemes, which are subject to continuing consultation with tenants,
will establish arrangements to transfer local authority social housing
to registered social
landlords.</p><p><a name="06101858000012">Some
29 schemes have been awarded places on the disposals programme. These
schemes are in Blaby, Braintree, Bracknell, Brighton, Castle Morpeth,
Castle Point, Daventry, Fenland, Gedling, Gravesham, Harborough,
Lewisham (two schemes), Mole Valley, North Shropshire, Oswestry,
Rochford, Salisbury, Sheffield (five schemes), South Kesteven, South
Northamptonshire, Sutton, Three Rivers, Watford, and
Wellingborough.</p><p><a name="06101858000013">A
further 18 schemes have had places on the transfer programme held open
primarily for further discussions to take place over covering funding
gaps arising from negative housing stock valuations. These schemes are
in Berwick-upon-Tweed, Cannock, Chester le Street, Crawley, LB
Havering, Manchester (4 schemes), NW Leicestershire, Plymouth, Ribble
Valley, Salford, Tamworth, Torridge, LB Tower Hamlets (four schemes)
and Wansbeck. I expect all these schemes to gain programme places over
the coming
months.</p><p><a name="06101858000014">These
schemes mark our continuing commitment to ensuring that all social
sector tenants have the decent homes that they deserve, and keeps the
decent homes strategy firmly at the heart of the sustainable and mixed
communities agenda. Many of the schemes will encompass works outside
the properties to ensure that it is both homes and local neighbourhoods
that receive investment to ensure they are both good places to live
in.</p><p><a name="06101858000015">The
results of the Round six ALMO Programme will be announced later in the
year.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="61018m0001.htmdpthd_3"><a name="06101858000003">Foreign

<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 54WS</b><br>and Government will be held on 20 October in Lahti, Finland. My right
hon. Friend the Prime Minister will represent the
UK.</p><p><a name="06101858000017">The
Government welcome the opportunity the Lahti summit provides for EU
leaders to take forward the &#147;delivery agenda&#148; agreed at
the Hampton Court summit last October, during the United Kingdom's
Presidency of the EU. This will help the EU respond to the challenges
of the 21st century: improving European innovation and research;
ensuring Europe's universities can compete globally; tackling the
energy challenges all member states face; addressing citizens' concerns
on security and on
migration.</p><p><a name="06101858000018">In
particular Lahti will concentrate on EU external energy policy and
innovation. There will also be discussion of immigration and of Darfur,
as well as dinner with President
Putin.</p><p><a name="06101858000019">At
Lahti we will underline the importance of climate security in the EU's
discussion of energy; for example through the extension of the
Emissions Trading Scheme and developing clean coal technology.
Delivering our climate change goals is bound up with improving our
competitiveness and fostering jobs, growth and innovation. Lahti will
be an opportunity to set a clear political framework for future
work.</p><p><a name="06101858000020">The
discussion of external energy issues will also ensure we maintain the
momentum of the Hampton Court agenda, for example by mainstreaming
energy into the EU's relations with third countries. Energy will also
feature in the discussions with President Putin over dinner. This will
also be an opportunity to consider the future of the strategic
relationship between Russia and the
EU.</p><p><a name="06101858000021">The
other main theme at Lahti will be
innovation.</p><p><a name="06101858000022">The
Government believe there are two major challenges for the EU in this
area. Firstly a fragmentation of effort in research, and secondly
Europe's relative weakness in getting to market the high quality
research and innovation carried out by their research base and
universities. Lahti should make progress on the key aspects of
improving the EU's innovation performance, such as Intellectual
Property rights and the links between business and
education.</p><p><a name="06101858000023">Heads
of Government will also discuss the situation in Darfur, at the request
of the Prime Minister. It is important that EU Heads send a clear
message underlining the urgent need to implement the peace deal agreed
in
May.</p><p><a name="06101858000024">We
also expect a discussion of migration issues, bearing in mind recent
experience in Spain. Member states agreed at Hampton Court to a series
of commitments as part of the Global Approach to Migration. It is
important that the EU continues to prioritise delivery of those
actions.</p><p><a name="06101858000025">The
Government will provide a written statement to the House next week on
the outcome of the Lahti
summit.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="61018m0001.htmdpthd_4"><a name="06101858000004">Transport</h3><h4 align="center"><a name="61018m0001.htmstpa_2"><a name="06101858000008">EU

<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 55WS</b><br>Energy Council, held in Luxembourg on 12 October. The Finnish Minister
for Transport and Communications, Mrs Susanna Huovinen, was in the
chair.</p><p><a name="06101858000027">The
Council held a debate on the Communication &#147;Keep Europe
Moving&#151;Sustainable Mobility for our Continent&#148;, the
Commission's mid-term review of the 2001 Transport White Paper.
Ministers generally welcomed the new focus on co-modality (getting the
best from each transport mode) and other themes included better
regulation, road safety, tackling environmental impacts, efficient
logistics and financing of infrastructure. I was among Ministers who
spoke in favour of aviation emissions trading and continuing rail
liberalisation.</p><p><a name="06101858000028">The
Commission introduced its Communication &#147;Freight Transport
Logistics in Europe&#151;the key to sustainable mobility&#148;, and
reaffirmed its commitment to bring forward an action plan in the autumn
of 2007. The presidency aim is for council conclusions on the
Communication to be agreed at the December
Council.</p><p><a name="06101858000029">The
Council reached a general approach on two regulations providing for the
Galileo Joint Undertaking (GJU) to be closed and for its
responsibilities to be transferred to the European GNSS Supervisory
Authority (GSA). The GJU is to be wound up by amending Council
Regulation (EC) No 876/2002 which set it up, and its responsibilities
are to be transferred to the GSA by amending Council Regulation (EC) No
1321/2004 which had established and defined the responsibilities of the
GSA. In response to the Commission's report on the progress of Galileo
in its Communication: &#145;Taking stock of the Galileo programme,'
the Council also adopted a set of Council Conclusions which urged more
tangible progress. The texts of the two Regulations and the Council
Conclusions were acceptable to the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06101858000030">During
debate on wider aspects of the programme including the concession
contract, I reiterated the UK's position that Galileo was a civil
programme under civil control. In discussions on third country
participation in Galileo, the Commission said it was essential to
define the roles and terms for third country participation and that it
was reflecting further on these issues before bringing forward a draft
mandate for relations with international partners. The Commission
announced that a Green Paper on applications for the programme will be
published by the end of the
year.</p><p><a name="06101858000031">The
Council reached Political Agreement on the Regulation on common rules
in the field of civil aviation security, which will replace the 2002
Regulation. The agreed text was acceptable to the UK. The Commission
noted that the events in August in London demonstrated the importance
of agreeing this legislation as soon as possible.</p><p><a name="06101858000032">The presidency
will continue its contact with the European Parliament, to work towards
agreement on the
text.</p><p><a name="06101858000033">I
provided a summary of the UK response to the August security events and
lessons learnt. I thanked the Commission and other Member States for
their work in reaching a prompt agreement on new security
measures.</p><p><a name="06101858000034">The
Commission gave a progress report on EU-US air transport negotiations:
they reported that no

<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 56WS</b><br>progress had been made since the previous Council, due to the political
situation in Washington. However, they reaffirmed their commitment to
delivering a balanced deal. Movement from the US would be needed in
order to achieve this. They were ready to continue their efforts to
encourage the US to move forward, so that the target date of 31
December, as agreed at the last EU-US summit, might be respected. While
understanding the frustration expressed at the lack of progress, I
pointed out that we were still some way from reaching a balanced deal.
But without significant progress from the US side, we were in danger of
getting nothing. The presidency summed up the discussion with
presidency
conclusions.</p><p><a name="06101858000035">The
Commission provided Council with an update on discussions with Russia
about payments for Siberian overflights. The Commission is aiming to
reach agreement in time for the EU-Russia Summit in Helsinki on 24
November.</p><p><a name="06101858000036">Under
AOB, the presidency gave a report on the EU-Russia Permanent
Partnership Council (PPC) meeting on transport on 8
September.</p><p><a name="06101858000037">Agreed
without debate were: a Council Decision on signature of the Transport
Protocol of the Alpine Convention; and adoption of the Regulation
establishing the second &#147;Marco Polo&#148; programme for the
granting of Community financial assistance to improve the environmental
performance of the freight transport system (&#147;Marco Polo

Minister of State, Department for Transport(Dr. Stephen
Ladyman):</b> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for
Transport and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government have decided to grant legal powers and planning consents to
Network Rail in respect of its Thameslink 2000 rail enhancement
scheme.</p><p><a name="06101858000039">The
scheme involves extending and upgrading the existing Thameslink
network, by providing for more frequent and longer trains to serve 121
more stations than at present. Planning permission and statutory powers
for the scheme are being given, together with listed building and
conservation area consents and consents for consequential rail
closures.</p><p><a name="06101858000040">These
decisions accord with the recommendations of the Inspector who held a
public inquiry last year into the scheme. My right hon. Friends are
satisfied that earlier deficiencies in the design of the scheme that
were identified following the initial inquiry held in 2000-01 have been
satisfactorily
addressed.</p><p><a name="06101858000041">It
is important to note that these decisions do not amount to a final
go-ahead for the project. They are made without prejudice to a decision
on funding for the scheme, which the Department for Transport is
currently considering separately. Furthermore, none of the authorised
rail closures can take place unless the Thameslink scheme is
implemented.</p><p><a name="06101858000042">The
decisions, and the reasons for them, are explained in full in three
separate decision letters, copies of which have been placed in the
Libraries of the House with a copy of the Inspector's report of the
public inquiry. These documents are also being placed on the
Department's
website.</p>
