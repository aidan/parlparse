Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform (Mr. Jim
Murphy):</b> I am pleased to announce today my plans to
rollout the successful Pathways to Work service in order to provide
substantially more support for all new and repeat incapacity benefits
(IB) customers to return to work. This is a significant step in our
plans to help 1 million people move off IB over the next 10 years as
outlined in our Green Paper,&#147;A New Deal for Welfare:
Empowering People to
Work&#148;.</p><p><a name="06070461000011">To
date Pathways to Work has helped around 25,000 IB customers in just 17
districts return to work. Wewill build on those successes as
we roll out the pathways service nationally to all new and repeat IB
customers.</p><p><a name="06070461000013">Rollout
will start on 30 October 2006 when we will introduce the pathways
service in three more Jobcentre Plus districts giving access to a third
of all new and repeat IB customers. The new districts are Greater
Mersey, Staffordshire, and Eastern Valleys (part of South Wales
Valleys).</p><p><a name="06070461000015">In
December, we will extend the Jobcentre Plus pathways service to the
remaining areas of the five, recently enlarged, existing Pathways
districts to give 40 per cent. of all new and repeat IB customers
access. The areas in the five enlarged districts are Ayrshire Dumfries
and Galloway, Northumbria (other than Gateshead), remaining parts of
Highland Islands, Clyde Coast and Grampian, Dorset and Somerset, and
Sheffield.</p><br><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>4 July 2006 : Column 34WS</b><br><p><a name="06070461000017">In October 2007,
private and voluntary sector providers will start to help to deliver
the pathways service, extending to the remaining 60 per cent. of new
and repeat IB customers by April 2008. We will use providers because
our good partnership working with them on other initiatives has shown
to be very effective, particularly when we offer them outcome-based
contracts and payment by results. Providers will engage with customers
after their initial work-focused
interview.</p><p><a name="06070461000019">Providers
will start delivering the pathways service to customers in 15 Jobcentre
Plus districts in October 2007. The 15 districts are Greater Manchester
east and west, Cardiff and Vale/south-east Wales, Forth Valley Fife
Tayside, north Wales and Powys, Black Country, City and East London,
Birmingham and Solihull, Nottinghamshire, west Yorkshire, Edinburgh
Lothian and Borders, Cornwall and Devon, central London, Lincolnshire
and Rutland, Lambeth, Southwark and Wandsworth, and
Norfolk.</p><p><a name="06070461000021">In
April 2008, providers will complete the rollout of the pathways service
to customers in the remaining sixteen Jobcentre Plus districts so that
the service is available nationally to all new and repeat IB customers.
The final 16 districts arenorth and north-east London, Cheshire and
Warrington, west of England, Coventry and Warwickshire, north-east
Yorkshire and the Humber, Brent Harrow and Hillingdon west London,
Marches, Kent, Leicester/Northants, south and south-east London,
Cambridge and Suffolk, Gloucestershire Wiltshire and Swindon, Surrey
and Sussex, Hampshire and Isle of Wight, Bedfordshire and
Hertfordshire, and Berks, Bucks and
Oxfordshire.</p><p><a name="06070461000023">Jobcentre
Plus will continue to deliver the pathways service in the following 19
districts; Derbyshire, Ayrshire Dumfries Galloway and Inverclyde,
Highland Islands, Clyde Coast and Grampian, south Wales Valleys,
Northumbria, south Tyne and Wear Valley, Essex, Dorset and Somerset,
Lancashire, Cumbria, Glasgow, Tees Valley, south Yorkshire, Lanarkshire
and east Dumbartonshire, Liverpool and Wirral, Greater Manchester
Central, south-west Wales, Greater Mersey, and

details about provider-led pathways will be available as we finalise
our procurement plans over the next few
weeks.</p><p><a name="06070461000025"><i>Additional
Information</i></p><p><a name="06070461000027">Pathways
to Work support was first introduced in three Jobcentre Plus districts
in October
2003.</p><p><a name="06070461000029">It
provides additional help to new and repeat incapacity benefits
customers via five, additional, mandatory, monthly work-focused
interviews in the first eight months of the incapacity benefits claim;
and via the &#145;Choices&#146; programme of employment support
and, the new return to work credit. Customers who are expected to
return to work within nine months of their claim and those who are
exempt from the personal capability assessment because they are so
severely disabled, are not be required to take part in the five
additional work-focused interviews. However, they may participate in
any part of the pathways service at any time on a voluntary
basis.</p><br><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>4 July 2006 : Column 35WS</b><br><p><a name="06070461000031">Using private and
voluntary sector providers to deliver support for customers is not new,
and this will build on existing work-focused support already delivered
through engagement with
providers.</p><p><a name="06070461000033">As
well as the national rollout of the Pathways to Work service, the Green
Paper, &#147;A New Deal for Welfare: Empowering People to
Work&#148;, sets out other welfare reforms that we are committed to
delivering to help more people move in to work and to end social
exclusion. These include: introducing a new employment and support
allowance (ESA) to replace IB for new customers in 2008 and improving
the gateway to the benefit; piloting employment advisers in GP
surgeries to support GPs and primary care teams, revising the format of
the medical certificate, and simplifying statutory sick pay; piloting
the new cities strategy which will provide a leadership role for cities
in tackling worklessness; increasing the frequency of work-focused
interviews for lone parents claiming benefits; piloting a new premium
for lone parents in exchange for undertaking serious steps towards
work; requiring people aged 50-59 to take up the additional jobseeking
support available through New Deal 25 plus; piloting face-to-face
guidance sessions with people approaching 50 or over 50 to deliver
tailored and relevant information on working, training and planning for
retirement; and introducing local housing allowance (currently being
tested) and developing proposals for national
rollout.</p><p><a name="06070461000035">The
19 Jobcentre Plus-led pathways districts will continue to make a
substantial contribution to the national rollout of the pathways
service to all new and repeat IB
customers.</p><br><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>4 July 2006 : Column 36WS</b><br><h4 align="center"><a name="06070461000007">Benefits System (Decision

is the third report under the decision making and appeals system
introduced by the Social Security Act 1998. It covers the two-year
period from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2003. The Department
apologises for the delay in producing the report which was caused by
the need to validate the results it contains in the light of a number
of changes to the underlying methodology. While this has provided
greater confidence in those results, the Comptroller and Auditor
General have not been able to validate all the data in the report. The
Department&#146;s aim is to ensure that in future such reports are
both produced much more swiftly and that they are able to secure
thefull assurance of the Comptroller and Auditor
General.</p><p><a name="06070461000042">Copies
