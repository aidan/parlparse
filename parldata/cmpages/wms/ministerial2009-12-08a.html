<p><a name="st_148"><a name="09120857000018"><a name="91208m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="09120857000095"><b>The Minister for Higher Education and Intellectual Property (Mr. David Lammy):</b>
 This year Government are spending more than Â£5 billion on student support in England, underpinning our commitment that finance should not be a barrier to higher education. The number of undergraduate entrants to higher education has increased by 19 per cent. since 1997, and the 20 most deprived constituencies have shown higher than average growth in student numbers over that period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09120857000019">Students need a simple and straightforward application service when they are applying for student support. As I said to the House on 14 October, this year's problems have had an unacceptable effect on individual students and their families. Even when they have not led to financial hardship, they have undoubtedly caused worry and frustration. It is clear that there were serious lapses in the customer service provided by the Student Loans Company (SLC).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09120857000020">At the beginning of September I became aware that, in this first year of operating the new service, there were delays in processing, customers were unable to speak to the company, and some documentary evidence could not be traced. I ordered that a number of actions be undertaken to enable the company to accelerate the processing of applications and to increase the number of calls being answered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09120857000021">These issues are why, together with the recently appointed chair of the Student Loans Company, I commissioned Professor Sir Deian Hopkin to provide external scrutiny to the review of lessons to be learned from this year's processing problems. Professor Sir Hopkin has now provided his report and I am very grateful to him for carrying out his work so swiftly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09120857000022">While at the time of this statement the Student Loans Company has paid 801,000 students, it is clear that this year the service has fallen short of expectations. The report says that:</p>
<a name="91208m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="09120857000085"><ul><p class="tabletext">"While some aspects of the programme have been realised and some progress made on others, there has been a conspicuous failure in key areas of its delivery which has had a far-reaching impact on applicants and stakeholders".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para4"><a name="09120857000023">The Department accepts in full all the recommendations in Professor Sir Hopkin's report and, as I would expect, the board of the Student Loans Company has also accepted the recommendations in their entirety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para5"><a name="09120857000024">I am now clear that decisive action is required to change the service and that the key to this is strengthening the leadership of the company and ensuring that the customer is at the heart of everything the company does. The chair of the Student Loans  <br>

Company has confirmed that the senior management team of the company will be strengthened and reorganised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para6"><a name="09120857000025">I expect the chair to ensure that the company transforms how it communicates with its customers so that they know what to expect from the service, what is expected of them, and that risk management, contingency planning and staff training are all significantly improved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para7"><a name="09120857000026">I have asked my officials to consider the best practice in other public sector organisations to enable us to better challenge and scrutinise the company's performance. But there must be no confusion about roles: it is for the Student Loans Company board to hold the executive to account and to ensure it has the capacity and capability to deliver the service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09120857000027">Key to moving forward and improving the service next year is early engagement with customers and stakeholders in the higher education sector. I have therefore asked the company to establish a stakeholder forum which will include representation from the National Union of Students, Higher Education Institutions and UCAS. This will help the company to develop Student Finance England, including implementation of the recommendations in Professor Sir Hopkin's report and should mean, with stakeholders more closely involved in the company, that many of the issues experienced this year can be identified earlier and swift action be taken to avoid them in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para9"><a name="09120857000028">We have invested significantly in a substantial programme of improvements which are designed to transform the way the student support service works for customers. Over the next few years, the centralised service-which takes over from applications to local authorities where the level of service was variable-will allow students to apply online; they will no longer need to send in their passports to verify their identity; and their sponsors will not need to send paper evidence of family income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09120857000029">I acknowledge that some of the improvements will take time to implement, but I have received assurance from the chair that improvements in the way the service is managed will be made quickly. As the report says, the highest priority at the moment is to successfully complete this year's application cycle. There remain problems with disabled students' allowances and I have asked the Student Loans Company to engage directly with universities and assessment centres to speed up the process, and to increase staffing resource for these activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para11"><a name="09120857000030">The chief executive and chair of the Student Loans Company have publicly apologised for the difficulties customers have suffered. As the Minister responsible for higher education, I too have expressed regret for the unacceptable service parents and students have experienced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para12"><a name="09120857000031">Customers must also play their part, and take responsibility for applying for their student support in good time if we are to ensure the service has the best chance of operating efficiently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para13"><a name="09120857000032">A copy of the report and a letter from the chair of the Student Loans Company are being deposited in the Libraries of the House and paper copies of the report will be placed in the Vote Office and Printed Paper Office.</p>

Member for Wentworth (John Healey) told the House on 6 February 2008, <i>Official Report</i>, column 66-68WS, that we were requesting the Boundary Committee under section 4 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 to advise on certain matters respectively relating to the unitary proposals made by Exeter city council, Ipswich borough council, and Norwich city council.

Before taking his statutory decisions he will consider carefully the Boundary Committee's advice, all the representations he receives, and all other relevant information available to him.

2009 in Brussels. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Justice, the Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Lord Bach), the Scottish Lord Advocate, Elish Angiolini, and I attended on behalf of the United Kingdom. The following issues were discussed at the Council:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para31"><a name="09120857000055">The Council, in Mixed Committee with non-EU Schengen states, received an update from the presidency on the current state of play on the implementation of the regulation establishing the Visa Information System (VIS). As a result of testing delays in both the central and national databases the roll-out of VIS will now take place, subject to no further problems, in December 2010. The UK does not participate in the regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para32"><a name="09120857000056">The presidency then updated Ministers on arrangements for the first milestone test for the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) noting that the test should take place by 29 January 2010. If the Council deemed the first milestone test to have failed it would then have two months to decide whether to switch to the contingency plan. The UK stressed the need to distinguish between technical and contractual elements of the project highlighting the importance of the milestone test in this respect. The UK could not accept a delayed milestone test being equated with non-compliance; if the test could not happen in January then the Council should be consulted on the next steps. This was reflected in Council conclusions adopted following the Mixed Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para33"><a name="09120857000057">The presidency sought the Council's views on the need for an IT agency and its potential scope, inviting applications from those wishing to host it before the end of the year. It concluded that there was broad support for the agency, which would manage SIS, VIS and the Eurodac systems, and the details would be further discussed at working level. The UK supported the need for an agency and wishes to take part in the adoption and application of this proposal to the extent we participate in the relevant IT systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para34"><a name="09120857000058">The Council adopted amendments to the common visa list lifting visa requirements for Serbia, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Their citizens will no longer require a visa to enter the Schengen area. Albania and Bosnia Herzegovina were urged to work towards full completion of the benchmarks required for visa liberalisation. While the UK does not participate in the EU visa regime, we maintain an interest in all visa issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para35"><a name="09120857000059">Under any other business Switzerland gave an update on the national referendum on the building of minarets and asked Schengen partners for their support to help free two Swiss businessmen detained in Libya since 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="91208m0001.htm_para36"><a name="09120857000060">Following Mixed Committee, the Council approved the A points list. Of note the Council endorsed the suspension of negotiations on the Council regulation and Council decision on the establishment of an evaluation mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis. The Commission has been invited to review the texts and devise next steps, due to the European Parliament's rejection of the text and the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="91208m0002.htm_para1"><a name="09120857000062">The presidency presented the draft future JHA work programme (the Stockholm programme). The Council considered interior issues on the first day and justice on the second. All delegations welcomed the draft text, although points on mutual recognition of asylum decisions and training targets for police and judges remained contentious. On asylum, the Commission insisted on mutual recognition of asylum decisions as a long-term objective. The UK along with a number of other member states supported a text reflecting that beneficiaries of international protection should not have an automatic right to move throughout the European Union. In addition the UK secured language limiting ambitious targets for providing training in European law to police and judiciary to those who were concerned with European co-operation. The UK also secured acceptable language on the "Roadmap" on criminal procedural rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="91208m0002.htm_para2"><a name="09120857000063">Overall, the Government welcome the Stockholm programme, which will allow the EU to build upon the many successes of EU collaboration in this area. The programme will now go to the December European Council for final agreement. An action plan for implementation of this JHA work programme will be presented by the Commission as soon as possible in 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="91208m0002.htm_para3"><a name="09120857000064">Over lunch Interior Ministers held a discussion on the location of the European Asylum Support Office. The Council agreed that the office should be located in Valletta, Malta.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="91208m0002.htm_para4"><a name="09120857000065">After lunch, the Commission introduced its proposals to revise directives on asylum procedures and qualification. The UK fully supported the objectives to streamline standards, simplify the law and combat abuse, but not the draft directives, which would go in the opposite direction. Restrictions on accelerated procedures would stop member states making fast, fair decisions on asylum applications. Lengthening the process and unnecessary burdens (like new rules on translation) would result in additional costs. Changes to who qualifies could actually result in member states granting asylum to those not in need of EU protection. Measures on unaccompanied minors would have negative effects and could undermine efforts to reduce human trafficking. These concerns were supported by other member states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="91208m0002.htm_para5"><a name="09120857000066">The presidency presented its paper on external relations to the Council and updated the Council on the recent global migration forum, held in Athens in early November.</p>

Priorities would be: victims; prevention; information management; co-operation with the private sector; and development and security. The UK supports efforts made by the CTC to continue to drive forward EU co-operation on CT, and is particularly appreciative of his efforts with priority third countries, such as Pakistan. The Commission looked forward to further work with the private sector, such as follow up by future presidencies of the recent seminar organised by the  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="91208m0002.htm_para7"><a name="09120857000068">The Council agreed the EU-US agreement on the processing and transfer of financial messaging data for the purposes of the US terrorist finance tracking programme (TFTP). This agreement, supported by the UK, was required due to a restructure of the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank financial Telecommunications) system used by the TFTP to identify and trace terrorist finance and facilitators. The presidency concluded that the interim agreement would be signed and, though temporary, did contain strengthened data protection provisions. It will come into force on 1 February 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="91208m0002.htm_para8"><a name="09120857000069">Under any other business, the Commission noted the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty on 1 December: any third pillar proposals not adopted would become void and would need to be re-negotiated; new proposals would be brought forward under the new Commission, as soon as possible in 2010. Spain outlined its presidency priorities and, in the margins of the Council, the UK joined other member states in signing a mobility partnership agreement with Georgia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="91208m0002.htm_para9"><a name="09120857000070">On day two, the presidency outlined the progress made during negotiations on the framework decision on combating sexual abuse, exploitation of children and child pornography. A new proposal will be needed, following the coming into force of the Lisbon treaty. The Commission said it would table one as soon as possible. The UK welcomed the progress made and looked forward to a new Commission proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="91208m0002.htm_para10"><a name="09120857000071">Justice Ministers then debated transfer of proceedings in criminal matters. This covered, among other things, the extent to which EU action could add value to the 1972 Council of Europe convention on transfer of proceedings, in particular in relation to jurisdiction. The UK congratulated the presidency on its efforts to try to reach agreement on this complicated issue. It is not clear whether, or when, a new proposal on this subject will be brought forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="91208m0002.htm_para11"><a name="09120857000072">The presidency updated the Council on the way forward on negotiations to update the framework decision on combating trafficking of human beings and, following the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty, looked forward to a new Commission proposal. The UK supported this view for an updated framework decision, drawing on the good work done by the Swedish presidency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="91208m0002.htm_para12"><a name="09120857000073">The presidency also updated the Council on the adoption of the action-oriented paper (AOP) and the human trafficking conference held in October. The UK highlighted that the implementation of the AOP should focus on how existing measures, instruments, and mechanisms could be best utilised. The UK welcomed the presidency's efforts to link JHA work with the external dimension, but also needed to address the internal EU dimension of trafficking, as the EU contained source, transit and destination countries.</p>

It is hoped that the launch can be rescheduled for the first half of 2010.</p>

by 2025. Since then we have come a long way but, as many disabled people know, we still have further to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="91208m0002.htm_para18"><a name="09120857000081">To help achieve this ambition, on 11 June 2009 we launched a national consultation on the Right to Control by publishing the consultation paper, "Making choice and control a reality for disabled people: consultation on the Right to Control". We have also legislated for a Right to Control for disabled people in the Welfare Reform Act 2009, which recognises that disabled people are the experts in their own lives. We have worked closely with disabled people and their organisations to develop this right, including with our advisory group, chaired by Baroness Jane Campbell, and will test it in our Trailblazers, which will start in late 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="91208m0002.htm_para19"><a name="09120857000082">The consultation concluded on 30 September 2009 and 176 responses were submitted from individual disabled people, user-led organisations, service providers and local authorities, amongst others. These responses have helped us understand what areas we need to focus on and develop in order to offer a right that will be truly transformative for disabled people. Today, with the publication of the Government Response, "Making choice and control a reality for disabled people: Government Response to the consultation on the Right to Control", we can take another step towards delivering the Right to Control and improve the life chances of disabled people by giving them more choice and control over how public money is spent to meet their individual care and support needs.</p>
