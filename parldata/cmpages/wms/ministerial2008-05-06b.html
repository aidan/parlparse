 In a written statement on 9 January 2008, <i>Official </i>Report, column 9WS, I summarised the remit of Sir Jim Rose&#146;s independent review of the primary curriculum. Among other things, his remit includes making recommendations on introducing greater flexibility to help schools narrow the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="80506m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08050611000026">In the Children&#146;s Plan, the Government acknowledged that more needs to be done to improve outcomes and provision for children with special educational needs, to increase parental confidence that children&#146;s educational needs are being met, including for children with dyslexia.</p>

<p><a name="st_75"><a name="08050611000040"><a name="80506m0001.htm_spmin1"><a name="08050611000204"><b>The Minister for Local Government (John Healey):</b>
 Last summer&#146;s exceptional floods caused widespread damage and misery for thousands of people. But the response was equally exceptional&#151;from local authorities and other local agencies, the police, fire and rescue services, the military and neighbours helping each other. Government have been committed to playing our part and we have already made up to &#163;88 million available so far to flood-hit communities to support their efforts to get back on their feet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="80506m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08050611000041">The costs of the floods to the country were significant. That is why in August we submitted an application to the European Union solidarity fund, which was set up specifically to help countries that have experienced extensive damage from natural disasters such as floods. We have worked closely with the Commission on this application and I can confirm that the European Commission gave clearance for the funding to be paid to the UK when it approved the amended EU budget on 7 April. I welcome this clearance and recognise the key role played by Commissioner HÃ1/4bner in the EU&#146;s decision to approve our UK application.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="80506m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08050611000042">The European Commission&#146;s clearance was for payment of around &#163;110 million as a contribution to the cost of recovery from last summer&#146;s floods. However, the UK&#146;s special &#147;abatement mechanism&#148;, agreed between Government and the EU and in place since 1984, means that the net value to the UK of this allocation is an extra &#163;31 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="80506m0001.htm_para7"><a name="08050611000043">I therefore announce today that all this extra funding will be paid to flood-affected local areas. The money will be distributed through a new one-off &#163;30.6 million restoration fund to local authorities, police authorities and fire authorities in England, with the balance allocated to the Northern Irish and Welsh devolved Administrations. I propose that eligibility for payments from the new fund will be based on the costs incurred in dealing with the flood problems since the summer and that local authorities will be free to spend this money according to the local priorities they determine. I am starting a short consultation on this basis today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="80506m0001.htm_para8"><a name="08050611000044">The restoration fund will mean the Government have made up to &#163;118 million available so far to local areas hit by last summer&#146;s floods.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="80506m0001.htm_para9"><a name="08050611000045">The Government will account for the spending of the EUSF payment directly to the European Commission so that local authorities eligible for payments from the new fund will not have to deal with the strict rules that govern EUSF and can concentrate on the job of leading the full recovery efforts in their communities.</p>

 I am pleased to inform the House of the outcomes of our review of Defence Medical Rehabilitation. The review concluded that Defence Medical Rehabilitation is a success story, returning service personnel, whenever possible, to full fitness faster than in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="80506m0001.htm_para17"><a name="08050611000061">In the light of the review we have now decided to invest an additional &#163;24 million in the Headley Court site over the next four years to maintain and enhance DMRC&#146;s capabilities. This will enable us to:</p>

The estate is owned by a charitable trust, which has itself contributed generously to the improvement of facilities on the site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="80506m0001.htm_para20"><a name="08050611000066">Last year a new charity, Help for Heroes, generously offered to raise funds for a swimming pool and gym, which would together form a new rehabilitation complex, with additional space for rehabilitation and assessment.

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="80506m0001.htm_para21"><a name="08050611000067">We warmly welcome the contributions of charities to the welfare of the services. Support for them enables the public to demonstrate their appreciation for the work of the armed forces in tangible ways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="80506m0001.htm_para23"><a name="08050611000069">Our review also looked at the Services&#146; Primary Care Rehabilitation Facilities (PCRFs) and Regional Rehabilitation Units (RRUs). The review recommended enhancements to the permanent capability of RRUs, and improvements to the referrals process. The roles and locations of some of the RRUs should be adjusted to align better with current and future population centres. I have agreed that we should provide an additional  &#163;1.5 million per year from financial year 2009-10 to establish the necessary permanent manning uplifts at the RRUs, and commissioned further work to take forward the other recommendations.</p>

I intervened to stress the importance of full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia remaining a condition in Serbia&#146;s EU accession process. The requirement for full co-operation was fully recognised in the Council&#146;s conclusions, which make clear that ratification of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and implementation of the Interim Agreement will be dependent on a Council decision that Serbia is fully co-operating with the ICTY.</p>

<a name="subhd_9"><a name="80506m0002.htm_sbhd0"><a name="08050611000018"><h4 align="center">Zimbabwe</h4>

<p><a name="st_79"><a name="08050611000096"><a name="80506m0002.htm_spmin0"><a name="08050611000208"><b>The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (David Miliband):</b>
 In the five weeks since the elections in Zimbabwe, 7,000 people have been displaced, 500 beaten, 120 hospitalised and at least two murdered. Many more were unable to access medical treatment. In addition, the police have arrested scores of people who they associate with the opposition in Zimbabwe and have raided their offices. The announcement of the result of the presidential election should be seen against that background. Violence has been commonplace in Zimbabwe but those figures and these acts show the brutality of the regime in its quest to hold on to power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="80506m0002.htm_para0"><a name="08050611000097">Very soon after the election it was clear that the majority of the electorate had rejected President Mugabe. But ZANU-PF chose to delay the results, rather than face the truth. That delay has simply allowed the Zimbabwean authorities to contaminate the results. We can have little faith that the figures announced accurately reflect the will of the people. Significantly, the MDC opposition have not endorsed those published figures, even though they show that a clear majority of voters want change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="80506m0002.htm_para1"><a name="08050611000098">The first round of voting in Zimbabwe suffered from significant structural deficiencies. The electoral roll was and is still grossly inaccurate. The majority of the 3 million to 4 million people who have fled Zimbabwe were and will still be prevented from registering as voters. Within Zimbabwe media coverage of the election was already biased towards Mugabe and ZANU-PF. And the Government of Zimbabwe, at its own admission, did not invite anyone to monitor the election whom they thought might point out its flaws&#151;including the EU and the UN. For a second round to be considered free and fair, there must at least be an immediate end to violence, and international observers must be put in place now, well ahead of the vote itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="80506m0002.htm_para2"><a name="08050611000099">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, my noble Friend Lord Malloch-Brown and I continue to engage regional leaders. They are feeling the destabilising effects of the crisis. They know it is in their interests for the SADC principles and guidelines on elections to be enforced and the rule of law in Zimbabwe established. Both SADC and the AU have a pivotal role to play now in ensuring an end to the violence, and by introducing observers to prevent further reprisals by ZANU-PF to punish voters for the choices they made in the first round.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"><a name="80506m0002.htm_para3"><a name="08050611000100">International concern about the situation in Zimbabwe remains high. The UN Security Council briefing held in New York last week exposed the humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe and the need for the UN to be more engaged to resolve it. We will continue to press for a human rights mission or envoy to visit and for arms sales to cease until there is a return to democratic Government in Zimbabwe. We will also call again for UN backed monitors to go to Zimbabwe to observe any second round, and for the Government of Zimbabwe to allow EU and other observers in now to oversee preparations for the elections, as well as the voting itself.</p>

We all share the wish of the Zimbabwean people to secure their democratic rights. We commend civil society groups in Zimbabwe who continue to fight for democracy and good governance in increasingly impossible circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"><a name="80506m0002.htm_para5"><a name="08050611000102">We continue to respond to the humanitarian crisis on the ground. We are the second largest bilateral donor to Zimbabwe, giving around &#163;49 million in 2007 and more than &#163;200 million since 2000. UK aid currently keeps over 1.5 million people alive. The UK, along with the international community, is committed to supporting recovery in Zimbabwe when conditions on the ground allow it. This cannot happen until the will of the people is respected and democracy returned to Zimbabwe. But when that happens we will be ready to respond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="80506m0002.htm_para6"><a name="08050611000103">It is clear to all, including many in ZANU-PF, that this situation is unsustainable. Economically, Zimbabwe has been in decline for many years: total economic collapse, with the massive humanitarian cost that will bring, is inevitable unless there is a radical change in policy and approach in Zimbabwe. We still believe that the solution to the crisis must be an African solution supported by the international community. For the sake of all the people of Zimbabwe, this solution must  come soon.</p>

<p><a name="st_84"><a name="08050611000182"><a name="80506m0003.htm_spmin0"><a name="08050611000213"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Jim Fitzpatrick):</b>
 I am today publishing a draft Marine Navigation Bill, for public consultation and parliamentary pre-legislative scrutiny. The draft Bill contains legislative proposals to help to improve safety at sea and in our ports, to deal with wrecks if they do occur and to update the powers of the bodies responsible for maritime safety. Copies of the draft Bill, a consultation paper and other accompanying documents are available in the Libraries of both Houses and the Vote Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_413"><a name="80506m0003.htm_para1"><a name="08050611000183">The issues dealt with in this Bill have been identified in a number of reviews, accident reports and the IMO international convention on the removal of wrecks 2007. In bringing forward this draft Bill I hope to address these issues as far as can reasonably be done.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="6 May 2008">

<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>6 May 2008 : Column 29WS</b><br>
Any statutory safety measures need to offer a balance between excessive controls and prudent management. The changes that I am proposing in this draft Bill are not fundamental but they do represent a considered approach to the issues that have been identified and they will provide the responsible authorities with useful enhancements to their powers where necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_414"><a name="80506m0003.htm_para2"><a name="08050611000184">There are also measures in the draft Bill that will help to reduce costs to the shipping industry through the better management of the general lighthouse fund. When the IMO convention comes into force there will be significant improvements in our ability to recoup the costs of dealing with pollution and the aftermath of maritime accidents as it will introduce a strict liability regime and compulsory insurance for shipping operators, meaning that these costs will no longer be picked up by the authorities responsible for safety and the environment which can now happen when the operators or owners of the ship fail to accept responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_415"><a name="80506m0003.htm_para3"><a name="08050611000185">The draft Bill sets out our legislative proposals to:</p>
<a name="80506m0003.htm_brev6"><a name="08050611000186"><ul><p class="tabletext">allow the ratification of the IMO convention in the UK so that the Government can compel ship owners to remove wrecks or, if emergency works are carried out by the Government or general lighthouse authorities, facilitate recovery of their costs from the ship owner or its insurers;</p>
</ul><a name="80506m0003.htm_brev7"><a name="08050611000187"><ul><p class="tabletext">enable the Secretary of State to direct a harbour authority which is exercising its functions unsafely;</p>
</ul><a name="80506m0003.htm_brev8"><a name="08050611000188"><ul><p class="tabletext">give all harbour authorities access to a power to give general directions to shipping;</p>
</ul><a name="80506m0003.htm_brev9"><a name="08050611000189"><ul><p class="tabletext">allow a competent harbour authority to relinquish its unwanted pilotage powers;</p>
</ul><a name="80506m0003.htm_brev10"><a name="08050611000190"><ul><p class="tabletext">provide a simple way for the duties of a harbour authority to be extinguished where it no longer serves a useful purpose and to ensure any residual duties are carried out appropriately;</p>
</ul><a name="80506m0003.htm_brev11"><a name="08050611000191"><ul><p class="tabletext">permit the introduction of compulsory national occupational standards for harbourmasters and pilots;</p>
</ul><a name="80506m0003.htm_brev12"><a name="08050611000192"><ul><p class="tabletext">improve the regulation of pilotage exemption certificates; and</p>
</ul><a name="80506m0003.htm_brev13"><a name="08050611000193"><ul><p class="tabletext">modernise some of the powers of the general lighthouse authorities.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_416"><a name="80506m0003.htm_para4"><a name="08050611000194">Publication of the draft Bill provides an important opportunity to ensure we get our proposals right through public consultation, and for Parliament to scrutinise the legislation in draft. We need to learn from and build on the diversity of experience of professionals in the ports and shipping industries and all who are concerned about the safety of shipping and the protection of the marine and coastal environment, so I encourage all interested parties to participate in the consultation process.</p>

 Today the Government have responded to the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Human Rights in its report &#147;A Life Like Any Other?

<p><a name="stpa_417"><a name="80506m0003.htm_para5"><a name="08050611000196">The response makes it clear that the UK does not ratify any international treaty until it is in a position to ensure that it can implement the provisions and therefore comply with its obligations. In addition, the European Community is, for the first time, a party to an international human rights convention and this will inevitably affect the ratification timetable. Given the duty on member states to co-operate with the Community, the UK would wish to take into account the European Commission&#146;s proposal for Community conclusion of the convention, which is still awaited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_418"><a name="80506m0003.htm_para6"><a name="08050611000197">Article 33 of the convention on disability rights is an unusual provision in UN human rights conventions. Article 33 requires states party to the convention to establish national monitoring arrangements, and the Government have wished to properly consult the equality and human rights commission and the devolved Administrations about these arrangements. These consultations are continuing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_419"><a name="80506m0003.htm_para7"><a name="08050611000198">Ratification will be in respect of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Part of this process has required the devolved Administrations and Government Departments to check their legislation, policies, practices and procedures against the convention&#146;s provisions. This has inevitably taken some time. However, this phase of the work is now over and we are considering carefully the emerging findings. Our aim remains to ratify the convention by the end of this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_420"><a name="80506m0003.htm_para8"><a name="08050611000199">The current position is that the Ministry of Defence has indicated that there is a need to enter a reservation in respect of service in the armed forces, consistent with the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 as amended (DDA) and Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. Service in any of the naval, military or air forces of the Crown are excluded from the DDA&#146;s employment provisions to preserve their combat effectiveness. The Department for Children, Schools and Families has indicated that there is a need to recognise that the general education system in the UK includes a range of provision, including mainstream and special schools which will require an interpretative declaration, and that there will also need to be a reservation in respect of disabled children whose needs are best met through specialist provision, which may be some way from their home. The Home Office has indicated that there may be a need to enter one or more reservations or declarations in respect of immigration, nationality and citizenship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_421"><a name="80506m0003.htm_para9"><a name="08050611000201">There are also a number of areas where we are continuing to explore whether there are any compatibility issues which may result in the need for an interpretative declaration or reservation. These are: measures relating to the exercise of legal capacity; aspects of mental health legislation; choice of place of residence; and cultural services (interpretive measures). </p>

<p><a name="stpa_422"><a name="80506m0003.htm_para10"><a name="08050611000202">With regard to the optional protocol, the Government are aware of the importance that many disabled people and the Committee attach to this issue. The Government is carefully considering its position as part of the convention ratification process in the light of the ongoing review by the Ministry of Justice of a similar optional protocol relating to the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.</p>
