<p><a name="st_111"><a name="11021645000026"><a name="110216m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="11021645000158"><b>The Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport (Mr Jeremy Hunt):</b>
 On 1 November 2010 the Chairman of the Horserace Betting Levy Board ("the HBLB") informed me that the HBLB had been unable to approve a recommendation from the Bookmakers' Committee as to the terms of the 50th levy scheme. Under section 1(2) of the Horserace Betting Levy Act 1969, therefore, it falls to me to determine those terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para0"><a name="11021645000027">I have considered the parties' submissions, taking into account their representations on what target amount would reflect the capacity of bookmakers to pay, what it is reasonable to expect bookmakers to pay and what the reasonable needs of horseracing are in all the circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para1"><a name="11021645000028">Under section l(3)(a) of the Act, I have decided to determine a new levy scheme for the 50th levy period (running from April 2011 to March 2012), under which the following terms will apply:</p>
<a name="11021645000147"><ul><p class="tabletext">The headline rate of levy will increase by 7.5% from 10% to 10.75% for licensed betting offices ("LBOs") as well as for telephone and internet betting operators (including betting exchanges).</p>
</ul><a name="11021645000148"><ul><p class="tabletext">The "threshold" level beneath which LBOs pay an abated rate of levy will be reduced to £50,000.</p>
</ul><a name="11021645000149"><ul><p class="tabletext">The levy will continue to be payable only in respect of profits arising on bets placed in relation to British horseracing.</p>
</ul><a name="11021645000150"><ul><p class="tabletext">The rate of levy for bookmakers who derive their gross profit from spread betting businesses will increase by 7.5% from 2% to 2.15%</p>
</ul><a name="11021645000151"><ul><p class="tabletext">The flat fee for on-course bookmakers will increase (in line with RPI) to £210, whereas those bookmakers standing solely at point-to-point events, harness racing and/or trotting the flat fee will increase (in line with RPI) to £166.</p>
</ul><a name="11021645000152"><ul><p class="tabletext">The amount payable in advance by LBOs, telephone and internet betting operators will continue to be calculated on the basis of their liability under previous schemes-subject to an uplift of 7.5%.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para2"><a name="11021645000029">I estimate that this will produce levy proceeds of between £73.7 million-£80.8 million (with a mid-range figure of £77.25 million), and believe that terms outlined above represent a fair deal for bookmakers and horseracing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para3"><a name="11021645000030">I am today writing to the Bookmakers' Committee, British horseracing and the Government-appointed Members of the HBLB to thank them for their submissions and explain my decision in more detail. I will also ask that the HBLB finalise the operational details of the scheme as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para4"><a name="11021645000031">With the determination concluded, I would like to re-state my disappointment that the relevant parties were not themselves able to come to terms and I would strongly encourage them to develop a less adversarial relationship going forward. I have tried to be fair by listening to the advice of the independent members of  <br>

 The UK's chemical protection programme is designed to protect against the use of chemical weapons. Such a programme is permitted by the chemical weapons convention, with which the United Kingdom is fully compliant. Under the terms of the convention, we  are required to provide information annually to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para6"><a name="11021645000035">By making these changes we expect to save about 2,500 posts by 2014 and some £1.2 billion over the first four years alone, without reducing the effectiveness or reliability of the service we deliver. This measure will make a significant contribution to the civilian staff reductions and efficiency measures set out last October in the strategic defence and security review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para7"><a name="11021645000036">This is the first such change emerging from the work of the defence reform unit under Lord Levene designed to overhaul the structure of the Department. It is a significant change, and demonstrates the radical approach to reorganisation and resourcing which we are taking to ensure that we maximise the amount of the defence budget made available for the front line. I hope to announce further such changes in the near future.</p>

The Government agree that there should be a reinforced EU presence in BiH, able to deploy deterrents as well as the incentives inherent in the EU accession process. We will therefore support proposals for the development of an "EU toolbox" of positive and negative measures. We believe that in parallel, the civilian executive ("Bonn") powers need to be retained, that the conditionality for eventual closure of the Office of the High Representative continue to apply, and that the executive mandate of the EU military force, EUFOR Operation Althea, should be upheld. We will continue to insist on these points in EU and wider international negotiation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para45"><a name="11021645000083">This was an historic visit, as the first ever official visit by a Pope to the UK, and an important milestone in the relationship between the UK and the Holy See. It was on a far bigger scale than a normal state visit: police estimates suggest that 500,000 people saw the Pope either during events or along the Pope mobile routes. Approximately 3,000 media representatives were accredited to cover the visit. The combination of official events, pastoral events, through which the Pope engaged with Britain's Roman Catholics, and meetings with the Church of England and with people of other faiths, made this a visit that was out of the ordinary in every way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para46"><a name="11021645000084">The visit programme included both state and pastoral elements. HM Government agreed with the Catholic Church that costs would be shared accordingly, with all the costs of the pastoral elements of the programme met by the church. HM Government met the costs of events which were entirely part of the state visit programme and contributed to the costs of other events in relation to measures necessary to meet HM Government's responsibility for the safety and security of the public and of the Pope. The Scottish Government also contributed in relation to these measures for the Scottish part of the programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para47"><a name="11021645000085">The report consists of:</p>
<a name="11021645000155"><ul><p class="tabletext">An exchange of letters and an agreement on division of costs for public events signed by Lord Patten of Barnes and Archbishop Nichols prior to the visit. The second appendix is not attached as it is a draft budget which is superseded by the summary of expenditure attached to this statement (referenced below)</p>
</ul><a name="11021645000156"><ul><p class="tabletext">A summary of expenditure made by the FCO on behalf of HM Government and the Catholic Church. To date, all these costs have been met by the FCO.

</ul><a name="11021645000157"><ul><p class="tabletext">This report does not include the estimated £3,800,000 for costs paid direct by the Catholic Church. Neither does it cover any expenditure met by local authorities nor staffing costs incurred by other Government Departments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para50"><a name="11021645000088">The visit paved the way for further co-operation between the UK and the Holy See on a number of international issues where we share a common goal, including addressing the challenge of climate change, promoting multi-faith dialogue, as a means of working for peace in the world, and fighting poverty and disease. These were among the issues discussed both in bilateral meetings during the visit and at the working dinner with the papal delegation hosted by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para51"><a name="11021645000089">The success of the visit was a testament to the close co-operation and effective joint working by the Catholic Church, HM Government and many other organisations  <br>

 The EU has announced today its decision to roll over the Zimbabwe restrictive and appropriate measures. Following an in-depth assessment the UK and its EU partners have unanimously agreed to the renewal of the measures for a further 12 months, while removing 35 people from the list of those subject to an EU visa ban and asset freeze on the grounds that they are no longer involved in human rights abuses or undermining democracy or the rule of law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para52"><a name="11021645000091">Although this amendment reflects the progress made by the Government of Zimbabwe on economic issues and in delivering public services it also reflects our strong concern that this has not been matched by equivalent political and democratic reform. Essential reforms to promote the rule of law, human rights and democracy, as agreed under the global political agreement, have not yet been implemented. We are particularly concerned at the upsurge in political violence and intimidation in recent weeks. We have, therefore, extended the travel restrictions and asset freeze applicable to the remaining 163 people and 31 economic entities for a further 12 months. The arms' embargo remains in place and EU and UK bilateral development aid will continue to be channelled directly to the people of Zimbabwe through the UN and non-state actors, rather than through the Government of Zimbabwe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para53"><a name="11021645000092">The UK and our EU partners emphasise our willingness to revisit the measures at any time should there be further concrete developments on the ground in Zimbabwe. In this context, we fully support the Southern African Development Community and its member states in their effort to facilitate agreement amongst the parties in Zimbabwe on creating an environment conducive to the holding of free and fair elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para55"><a name="11021645000095">We have today published an analysis of the 2009 consultation by the four United Kingdom Health Departments which sought views on the possible regulation of practitioners of acupuncture, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. This factual report has been placed in the Library and can be found on the Department of Health's website at:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para56"><a name="11021645000096">www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Responsestoconsultations/DH_124337</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para58"><a name="11021645000098">I can now set out how we intend to take forward the regulation of herbal medicine practitioners and traditional Chinese medicines practitioners, specifically with regard to the use of unlicensed herbal medicines within their practice. As this matter is a devolved matter in Scotland and Northern Ireland we have had discussions with Health Departments in the three devolved Administrations which have been constructive and we are committed to a unified UK-wide approach to the regulation of these practitioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para59"><a name="11021645000099">When the European Directive 2004/24/EC takes full effect in April 2011 it will no longer be legal for herbal practitioners in the UK to source unlicensed manufactured herbal medicines for their patients. This Government wish to ensure that the public can continue to have access to these products.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para60"><a name="11021645000100">In order to achieve this, while at the same time complying with EU law, some form of statutory regulation will be necessary and I have therefore decided to ask the Health Professions Council to establish a statutory register for practitioners supplying unlicensed herbal medicines. This will ensure that practitioners meet specified registration standards. Practitioner regulation will be underpinned by a strengthened system for regulating medicinal products. This approach will give practitioners and consumers continuing access to herbal medicines. It will do this by allowing us to use a derogation in the European legislation to set up a UK scheme to permit and regulate the supply, via practitioners, of unlicensed manufactured herbal medicines to meet individual patient needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para61"><a name="11021645000101">The Health Professions Council is an established and experienced statutory regulatory body which has the necessary experience to be able to successfully establish and maintain a statutory register for practitioners wishing to supply unlicensed herbal medicines. Subject to parliamentary approval, such practitioners who wish to supply unlicensed herbal products will be required by law to register with the HPC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para62"><a name="11021645000102">The four UK Health Departments will consult jointly on the draft legislation once it is prepared. This will give practitioners and the public the opportunity to comment. Subject to parliamentary procedures we will aim to have the legislation in place in 2012.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para63"><a name="11021645000103">Until the new arrangements are in place the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will continue to take appropriate compliance and enforcement action where products are in breach of the regulatory requirements. In line with the MHRA's normal approach, the action taken will be proportionate and will target products which pose a public health risk. Guidance issued by the MHRA makes clear their view that, where practitioners hold stocks of unlicensed products on 30 April 2011 that legally benefited from transitional  <br>

arrangements under the European directive, the practitioner can continue to sell those existing supplies to their patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para64"><a name="11021645000104">The 2009 consultation also looked at practitioners of acupuncture. The practice of acupuncture is not affected by the EU directive and, therefore, compliance is not required. I am confident that acupuncturists have their own voluntary regulatory measures in place which are sufficiently robust. Additionally, local authorities in England have powers to regulate the hygiene of the practice of acupuncture to protect against the risk of transmission of certain infectious diseases. Similar measures are also in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para65"><a name="11021645000105">I am pleased to say that this decision resolves a long-standing issue, to the benefit of both practitioners and the public who use herbal medicines.</p>

The current system of professional regulation helps to ensure this by setting high standards of education, training, conduct and ethics and by taking action to remove unsuitable workers in the rare cases when things go wrong. Regulation of health care workers and social workers therefore makes an important contribution to safeguarding the public, including vulnerable children and adults.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para68"><a name="11021645000109">However, the regulatory framework is also complex, expensive and requires continuous Government intervention to keep it up to date. More generally, reducing regulation is a key priority for the coalition Government. By freeing society from unnecessary laws, the Government aim to create a better balance of responsibilities between the state, business, civil society and individuals, and to encourage people to take greater personal responsibility for their actions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para69"><a name="11021645000110">While regulation of some professionals is vital to ensure high standards of care, it is only one component of a wider system of safeguards, controls and clinical governance and ultimate responsibility for the provision of high quality services must rest with employers and those contracting with health and social care workers. We believe that the approach to professional regulation  <br>

This agreement stated that Berkeley Homes would build the basic box structure of a station at Woolwich and subsequently construct their own extensive mixed-use development above it. This would be done at Berkeley Homes' cost and risk, to the specification laid down by Crossrail Ltd, in a way that ensured that the Woolwich station box did not add to the current cost of Crossrail.

<p><a name="stpa_386"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para85"><a name="11021645000130">In the plenary debates, I put forward the UK view that the future TEN-T budget should take account of the aftermath of the financial crisis and the need to put recovery on a strong footing. EU funding will be limited and should be focused on projects that deliver real benefits to the network. Cost benefit analysis should inform funding decisions. Member states should aim to do more with less, concentrating on projects that deliver the best value for money. We think that the current model should be followed, focusing funding on the core network, with some funding also available for the comprehensive network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_387"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para86"><a name="11021645000131">In the debate on the role of PPPs, I pointed out that PPP is only appropriate in selected circumstances, implementation can present challenges and requires a high level of commercial skills, and particular attention needs to be paid to the long-term budgetary consequences of its use. I cited the M6 toll road and River Severn crossings as good examples of private investment enabling major pieces of infrastructure to be constructed and the cost returned through tolling. I said that the UK Government are open to tolling as an option for brand new alignments, with potential private sector investment, but noted that we have ruled out the introduction of a national road-user charging scheme (except in relation to heavy goods vehicles).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para87"><a name="11021645000132">In the margins of the event I was pleased to be able to have a meeting with the vice president of the European Commission responsible for transport, Mr Siim Kallas, to discuss a range of current issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_389"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para88"><a name="11021645000133">During my discussion of airport security scanners with Mr Kallas, I welcomed the Commission's general approach to the deployment of scanners. We now need to move quickly to amend existing European legislation to give airports the flexibility to deploy scanners effectively and efficiently. The decision on whether to deploy security scanners should be for member states. We acknowledge health, data protection and privacy concerns and believe that these can be addressed through existing European and national laws.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_390"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para89"><a name="11021645000134">I also discussed the transport aspects of transposition of the air quality directive with Mr Kallas. I pointed out that, although we are fully committed to improving air quality, and we recognise the part that transport has to play, we are keen to ensure that the air quality targets are properly targeted at improvements in health, and are consistent with our ambitious goals to reduce carbon and to create growth.</p>

 To complement the local transport White Paper "Creating Growth, Cutting Carbon", my Department has been working on a basic carbon tool for local authorities to assist them in demonstrating the carbon benefits of transport interventions in their areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_391"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para90"><a name="11021645000136">Today, I am pleased to announce the publication of the draft basic carbon tool for local authorities on my Department's website<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_392"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para91"><a name="11021645000137">The tool fully supports local authorities in making their own decisions about the carbon benefits of small-scale interventions and enables them to input their own assumptions and data from best estimates of take-up and effects for their areas. The tool also brings together in one place central research on local transport and carbon, improves access to national transport data which can impact on emissions and simplifies carbon appraisal guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_393"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para92"><a name="11021645000138">The tool can assist authorities in demonstrating the carbon benefits of bids to the local sustainable transport fund, but it is for local authorities to decide what tools and evidence best meet the criteria and objectives of the fund in the context of their overall bids.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_394"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para93"><a name="11021645000139">My Department plans to publish the final tool in the summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"><a name="110216m0001.htm_para94"><a name="11021645000140">My officials have sent a letter to all local authority chief executives inviting views on the tool. A copy of this letter has been placed in the House Library.</p>
