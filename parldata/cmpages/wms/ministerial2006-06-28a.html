Following the annual review, the Secretary of State
will today lay regulations to update the home loss payment thresholds
in section 30 of the Land Compensation Act 1973 (as amended). Home loss
payments are paid at a rate of 10 per cent. of the market value to
owner-occupiers who are displaced from their homes as a result of
compulsory purchase or certain housing orders. These are subject to
maximum and minimum payments. Tenants receive a flat rate equal to the
minimum payment to owner-occupiers.</p><br><notus-date day="28" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>28 Jun 2006 : Column 10WS</b><br><p><a name="06062867000022">With effect from

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs (Vera
Baird):</b> My right hon. and noble Friend
the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor (Lord Falconer of Thoroton)
has made the following written ministerial
statement:</p><a name="06062867000025"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I
have today laid before Parliament the Constitutional Reform Act 2005
(Supplementary Provisions) Order 2006 (&#145;the order&#146;) under
section 143 Constitutional Reform Act 2005. The order relates to
section 13A (&#145;section 13A&#146;) of the Local Land Charges Act
1975 (&#145;the 1975
Act&#146;).</p></ul><a name="06062867000026"><ul><p class="tabletext">Section
13A transfers the Lord Chancellor&#146;s responsibility with the
consent of HM Treasury under the 1975 Act for setting local land
charges search fees, except fees for personal searches, to registering
authorities (usually local authorities) in England.</p></ul><a name="06062867000028"><ul><p class="tabletext">Section
13A requires registering authorities to set fees for local land charge
services. It also provides that before setting fees local authorities
must have regard to such guidance as the Lord Chancellor may have
issued.</p></ul><a name="06062867000029"><ul><p class="tabletext">Section
13A was inadvertently and prematurelybrought into force by the
Constitutional Reform Act (Commencement No 5) Order 2006 on 3 April
2006. The commencement of section 13A revoked the previous rules
specifying fees under the 1975 Act without notice and before any
guidance had been issued to registering authorities. This was a serious
error for which I apologise to the
House.</p></ul><a name="06062867000030"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
order corrects this error. It provides that for the period 3 April 2006
until 1 April 2007 each registering authority will, in the exercise of
its duty under section 13A, be treated as having specified the fees
that were chargeable before 3 April. This period will allow sufficient
time for the Department for Constitutional Affairs to prepare and
consult on guidance to registering authorities on the exercise of their
duty under section 13A and for those authorities to prepare properly
for setting their own fees. The order does not invalidate any fees that
may have been specified and collected by a registering authority under
section 13A before 28 June 2006.&#148;</p></ul><h4 align="center"><a name="06062867000011">Freedom of Information
