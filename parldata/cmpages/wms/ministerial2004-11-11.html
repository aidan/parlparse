<p><a name="st_0"><a name="41111m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon): </b> 
) The UK places the utmost priority on protecting its citizens, whether at home or abroad. We are always prepared to deploy British forces to evacuate UK nationals should their lives be placed in jeopardy. In the light of the deteriorating security situation in C&#244;te D&#039;Ivoire, a military reconnaissance team deployed earlier this week to assess the requirement to evacuate UK nationals. I wish to inform the House that, following this reconnaissance, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has requested British forces to undertake an evacuation of UK nationals and others over the next few days. Some 400 people are entitled to our protection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111m01.html_para0"><a name="stpa_0">While I cannot give the House precise details of the mission for reasons of operational security, we have now established liaison teams in Abidjan, and at Accra in Ghana. Concurrently, we have ordered the deployment of the Spearhead lead company group comprising Royal Gurkha Rifles personnel to assist with this evacuation. The company group is pre-positioning in Accra and will be on immediate notice to be called forward to support the evacuation in Abidjan. It is intended to support this evacuation with a number of RAF transport aircraft. In total this equates to a deployment of around 300 personnel.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111m01.html_para1"><a name="stpa_1">As an additional contingency we have redirected the landing platform dock HMS Albion towards C&#244;te D&#039;Ivoire, and reduced the notice to move for other force elements should they be required. We would expect the operation to last days, not weeks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111m01.html_para2"><a name="stpa_2">Our ability to react quickly to the situation on C&#244;te D&#039;Ivoire is testament to the flexibility and capability of Britain&#039;s armed forces, and to the professionalism of British servicemen and women. The UK is working in close co-operation with international partners to monitor and respond to the situation in C&#244;te D&#039;Ivoire as it develops. In particular, we are working with the French and Ghanaians, who have offered significant enabling support to British forces.

 The Ministry of Defence police operational report for the year 2003&#150;04 is published today. After the introduction of the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001, which gave the Ministry of Defence Police extended jurisdiction, recommendations were made by the House of Commons Defence Committee that an operational report should be presented annually to Parliament.

 The contract for project Aquatrine package B, which covers the Ministry of Defence&#039;s estate in Scotland, has been awarded to Thames Water Nevis Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Thames Water whose major partner will be Scottish Water.

<a name="41111m01.html_para4"><a name="stpa_3">Project Aquatrine is one of the Government&#039;s leading and most significant public-private partnership (PPP) projects and will transfer the responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the Department&#039;s water and wastewater assets and infrastructure throughout Great Britain to private sector providers. This project will enable the transfer of environmental risk to those in the private sector who are best placed to manage it and enable the Ministry of Defence to focus on its core activities. It is a 25-year arrangement worth &#163;2.3billion across three packages that cover the MOD&#039;s estate in Great Britain.

 I am pleased to announce that the Department for Transport (DfT) will be making a contribution towards the funding of GoSkills, the new sector skills council for passenger transport. The DfT funding, which amounts to &#163;780,000 over three years, is particularly intended to reflect GoSkills1 input into skills and training initiatives for the taxi/private hire sector and the community and voluntary transport sector.

<p>
<a name="41111m02.html_para6"><a name="stpa_33">In April 2004 BFI carried out a second inspection of Eastbourne borough council and found that many of the issues highlighted in the 1999 inspection were still outstanding. For example, claims verification was still weak in some areas, there was a lack of management assurance checking, comprehensive guidance for staff was not available and the management of counter-fraud activity was poor. The review of the entire overpayments process that BFI recommended in 1999 had not been carried out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111m02.html_para7"><a name="stpa_34">The report notes that performance in administering benefits does not meet key best value performance indicators, and management information is not analysed or used to manage processes or identify staff training requirements. Comprehensive policies relating to benefits are not in place and there has been no dedicated counter-fraud manager since August 2003, resulting in a lack of effective counter-fraud measures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111m02.html_para8"><a name="stpa_35">The council&#039;s high level commitment to provide an effective benefits service is not adequately reflected in its operational planning and staff objectives. The organisational structure has also contributed to a lack of direction and effective communication within the service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111m02.html_para9"><a name="stpa_36">The BFI reports that although the council has not reached standard in any of the seven performance standards, there are some areas of strength. There is support for the benefits service at a corporate level, and a new management structure that was put in place just before the on-site phase of the BFI inspection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111m02.html_para10"><a name="stpa_37">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to further improve the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit, as well as counter-fraud activities.
