 The Government recognise the importance of the UK oil and gas industry to our economy and the dependable foundation it provides for the UK's energy security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="100127m0001.htm_para0"><a name="10012746000016">While we are trying to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels we must and do recognise that this will be a long transition and our oil and gas reserves will continue to play a vital role in supplying our energy needs for many years to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="100127m0001.htm_para1"><a name="10012746000017">We must ensure that the UK taxpayer receives a fair return from the extraction of our national resources. We are, however, committed to maximising the economic production of the UK's reserves, for the fuel this delivers, for the contribution this makes to our economy, and for the jobs and skills the industry supports and develops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="100127m0001.htm_para2"><a name="10012746000018">For these reasons, today I am announcing secondary legislation that is to be laid before the House of Commons in due course and, subject to approval by the House, will support the development of remote gas fields in the west of Shetland region. The area to the west of the Shetland islands is the last major area in the UK continental shelf to be developed and infrastructure is critical to fully unlocking the gas potential of the region. It is estimated that the area contains around 20 per cent. of the UK's remaining oil and gas reserves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="100127m0001.htm_para3"><a name="10012746000019">The legislation, if approved by the House, will extend the field allowance, announced in Budget 2009, to remote deep water gas fields, which are found in the west of Shetland area. The field allowance works by exempting an amount of income from the supplementary charge. All profits generated by qualifying fields are still subject to ring fence corporation tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="100127m0001.htm_para4"><a name="10012746000020">The legislation is to be introduced by Order and it is our intention that it will be effective from the day after the day on which it is made.

 The Supreme Court has today delivered its judgment in the case of HM Treasury<i> v</i>.<i></i>Ahmed and Others. The case concerns the UK's implementation of United Nations obligations to freeze the assets of terrorists and those associated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban.</p>

UNSCR 1373 in 2001, adopted shortly after 9/11, requires states to take a range of measures to deal with terrorism, including freezing the assets of those involved in terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="100127m0001.htm_para7"><a name="10012746000025">The UK has implemented these obligations through Orders in Council made under section 1 of the United Nations Act 1946. Section 1 of the UN Act authorises the Government to make an Order in Council to give effect to any decision of the UN Security Council where such provision appears to be</p>

The Court will consider tomorrow whether to stay the judgment for a period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="100127m0001.htm_para9"><a name="10012746000027">The Government made the Orders in Council in good faith based on their belief that section 1 of the United Nations Act was an appropriate legal vehicle and that it provided the most effective and timely way of implementing UN terrorist asset freezing obligations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="100127m0001.htm_para10"><a name="10012746000028">The Government are committed to maintaining an effective, proportionate and fair terrorist asset-freezing regime that meets our United Nations obligations, protects national security by disrupting flows of terrorist finance, and safeguards human rights.</p>

 Today I am announcing measures to give local authorities powers to manage better the quality and supply of private rented accommodation in their areas and to promote better balanced communities in local neighbourhoods. The private rented sector has an important, and growing, role in the housing market. This Government want to support the private sector. But, as well as a bigger  <br>

sector, we want a better sector with standards that meet the needs of those who depend on private rented accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="100127m0001.htm_para12"><a name="10012746000031">Local authorities need to be able to plan for the right housing mix and deal effectively with problems as they arise. Such problems can include antisocial behaviour, poorly maintained and dangerous properties, and pressures on community services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="100127m0001.htm_para13"><a name="10012746000032">The Government recognise the important contribution houses in multiple occupation make to the private rented sector. They provide housing to meet the needs of specific groups and households and make a contribution to the overall provision of affordable housing stock. However, localised problems caused by high concentrations of HMOs have been highlighted as concerns in some towns and cities across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="100127m0001.htm_para14"><a name="10012746000033">Following research to look at the issues we set out a number of options to deal with this problem in a public consultation paper, "Houses in multiple occupation and possible planning responses".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="100127m0001.htm_para15"><a name="10012746000034">In the light of the responses to this consultation I have decided to amend the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987, as amended, to provide for a specific definition of an HMO. Planning permission will then be required, where a material change of use occurs, to change the use of a property from C3 dwelling house to an HMO.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="100127m0001.htm_para16"><a name="10012746000035">At the same time as amending the Use Classes Order, I will amend the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, as amended, to provide that a change from an HMO back to the C3 class dwelling house will not require planning permission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="100127m0001.htm_para17"><a name="10012746000036">The consultation responses and research work have indicated that good practice alone cannot solve the problems encountered in a number of communities. This measure is strongly supported by responses to the consultation and it will enable local planning authorities to identify new HMOs with more certainty and act in particular neighbourhoods where there is concern about the mix and balance of communities and concerns about standards of conversion and maintenance of properties, to improve community balance.</p>

The licensing provisions under the Housing Act 2004 represent another local power available to local authorities in tackling problems associated with HMOs and other privately rented accommodation. I propose the introduction of a general consent, enabling local authorities to introduce discretionary licensing schemes without seeking approval from my Department. I believe it is right that these local decisions should be made by those who know their area best and who are directly accountable to local communities. The consultation will close on Friday 12 March, and any future general consent will come into effect from the common commencement date of 6 April 2010.</p>

This shows emerging evidence of improvements to the condition and management of properties as a direct result of HMO licensing, although it also indicates that local authorities have still to complete the task of licensing all HMOs subject to mandatory licensing. I am therefore reviewing the support available to local authorities in relation to regulation of the private rented sector, including publishing draft guidance on licensing provisions, and will put in place any changes before the commencement of the new powers I am announcing today. This work is part of our programme of reform and support for the private rented sector. We consulted last summer on a comprehensive package of proposals aimed at improving quality and professionalism in the sector and ensuring the best possible deal for tenants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="100127m0001.htm_para23"><a name="10012746000042">The proposed national register for landlords is a key element of the measures that we plan. By allowing local authorities to pinpoint private rented housing, the national register will give important support to local authorities seeking to use existing powers, including licensing, in a strategic and proportionate way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="100127m0001.htm_para24"><a name="10012746000043">The national register will also provide a mechanism by which landlords and tenants can be kept properly informed of their rights and responsibilities and by which tenants will, for the first time, be able perform basic checks on potential landlords. More broadly, I want to ensure that all tenants have easy access to clear advice, and know where to turn when things go wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="100127m0001.htm_para25"><a name="10012746000044">I will be making a more detailed announcement on these and other proposals for the private rented sector shortly, including a summary of responses to our summer 2009 consultation following the Rugg review.</p>

 The Equality Bill, currently before the House of Lords, will outlaw unjustifiable age discrimination against adults aged 18 or over in the provision of services and the exercise of public functions. It also includes powers to make exceptions from the ban, so that we can make clear the beneficial and justifiable age-based practices which will be allowed to continue.</p>

The consultation ended on 30 September 2009. Today we have issued "Equality Bill: Making it work-Ending age discrimination in services and public functions. A Policy Statement". This document summarises the consultation responses and sets out our plans for specific exceptions from the ban.</p>

<p><a name="st_144"><a name="10012746000070"><a name="100127m0002.htm_spmin1"><a name="10012746000124"><b>The Minister for Women and Equality (Ms Harriet Harman):</b>
 Today the Government have published their official response to the National Equality Panel's report, "An Anatomy of Economic Inequality in the UK". The National Equality Panel's report, which has also been published today, and the full Government response document can be found online at: www.equalities.gov.uk, and I have placed copies in the House of Commons Library. Printed copies of the NEP report and the Government's response are available upon request from the Government Equalities Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="100127m0002.htm_para8"><a name="10012746000071">To build a modern, prosperous society, we have to tackle the barriers that unfairly hold people back and give everyone the opportunity to succeed. Equality matters in the modern world:</p>
<a name="100127m0002.htm_brev21"><a name="10012746000114"><ul><p class="tabletext">for individuals, who are entitled to fairness and to have the opportunity to fulfil their potential and achieve their aspirations and not be held back;</p>
</ul><a name="100127m0002.htm_brev22"><a name="10012746000115"><ul><p class="tabletext">for the economy, because the economy that will succeed in the future is one that draws on the talents of all; and,</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="100127m0002.htm_para9"><a name="10012746000072">That is why I commissioned the National Equality Panel in 2008, chaired by Professor John Hills, to undertake an in-depth analysis of economic inequality in the UK today. The panel has examined how a range of factors-including gender, race, disability, social background and where you live-are associated with and influence how people fare at school and at work, their earnings, income and wealth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_378"><a name="100127m0002.htm_para10"><a name="10012746000073">The panel's report sets out the scale of the challenges that will need to be addressed if we are to effectively tackle inequality in the UK. The National Equality Panel's report confirms our strongly held view that public policy intervention can and does make a difference to economic inequalities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"><a name="100127m0002.htm_para11"><a name="10012746000074">We welcome the panel's groundbreaking report. We have made progress over the last 13 years. Some of the widest gaps in outcomes between social groups have been reduced, and trends reversed in the last decade. For example the attainment gap between black and white pupils fell from 18 per cent. in 1997 to 6 per cent. in 2008. The pay gap between men and women has also narrowed. But we are also determined to build on this and achieve more to create a fairer and more prosperous society. It is unacceptable that social background and other factors make so big a difference to the ability of people to fulfil their aspirations and potential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_380"><a name="100127m0002.htm_para12"><a name="10012746000075">The Government will continue to make the choices that prioritise fairness and aspiration.</p>
