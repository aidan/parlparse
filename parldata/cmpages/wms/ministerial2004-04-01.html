 The Government's road safety strategy <i>"Tomorrow's roads&#151;safer for everyone"</i> published in March 2000 included a commitment to evaluate every three years progress on delivery of the strategy and towards meeting the 2010 casualty reduction targets.
<P>

<a name="40401m01.html_para0">The first three-year review has been conducted by the Department, in consultation with the Road Safety Advisory Panel, which includes many of the key stakeholders both within and outside Government. I intend to publish the outcome of the review on 7 April 2004 to coincide with World Health Day 2004, the theme of which is the global road safety challenge. Copies of the review report will be placed in the Library of the House.

<a name="40401m01.html_spmin3"><B>The Minister for the Environment   (Mr. Elliot Morley): </B> 
 Charges to cover the costs of local enforcing authorities in regulating processes which are subject to Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (Local Air Pollution Control (LAPC)) were introduced in April 1991. Interim charges for installations which are subject to the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999 (Local Air Pollution Prevention and Control (LAPPC) and Local Authority&#151;Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (LA-IPPC)) were introduced in August 2000.
<P>

<a name="40401m01.html_para3">With the approval of the Treasury to the extent required, and following consultation with local authority associations and industry, myself with my right hon. Friend, the Minister for Sustainable Food and Farming have made revised schemes in respect of the Environmental Protection Act England and Wales and in respect of the Pollution Prevention and Control Act. The schemes specify the scale of fees and charges to take effect from 1 April 2004.
<P>

<a name="40401m01.html_para4">There will be a 2.75 per cent. increase to the LAPC, LAPPC and the LA-IPPC fees and charges schemes for 2004&#150;05. One of the factors taken into account was the take-up of cost accounting by local authorities which, when fully adopted, should provide the evidence of the adequacy or otherwise of current charging levels. According to my Department's statistics, 66 per cent. of local authorities had adopted cost accounting practices for LAPC by 31 March 2003, compared with 51 per cent. by the same date in 2002. A further 19 per cent. had said they intended to introduce cost accounting by the end of 2003&#150;04, while the remaining 15 per cent. have no stated plans to do so.
<P>

<a name="40401m01.html_para5">There will also be an additional fee spread over the 18,000 regulated activities, amounting to approximately &#163;2/3 per standard activity. This is required to cover the &#163;40,000 necessary to recover the costs of the Environment Agency's technical unit which provides guidance notes for use by local authorities and operators and is funded under the scheme.
<P>

<a name="40401m01.html_para6">The schemes will be laid before both Houses and copies placed in the Libraries.

<a name="40401m01.html_spmin4"><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Mr. Ben Bradshaw): </B> 
 In June 2003, the Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) published its report and recommendations on the welfare of farmed animals at

slaughter. It was a valuable and comprehensive report and I am grateful to the council for the work they put into it.
<P>

<a name="40401m01.html_para7"><P>

<a name="40401m01.html_para8">The report contains 94 recommendations for improvements in the welfare of animals at the time of slaughter or killing and the Government are prepared to accept, or partially accept, the majority of them. But the Government also accept that FAWC's recommendation to ban the slaughter of animals without prior stunning on welfare grounds has been contentious for the Jewish and Muslim communities.
<P>

<a name="40401m01.html_para9">The Government also recognise that such a ban would be likely to result in kosher and halal meat being imported with no overall improvement in animal welfare. We also think that there is a strong possibility that a legal challenge to a ban on slaughter without prior stunning would succeed on the grounds that the practice is protected under the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="40401m01.html_para10">While the Government therefore propose to reject the FAWC recommendation to ban slaughter without prior stunning, we recommend that cattle slaughtered by having their throats cut should receive an immediate post-cut stun because of the time it takes cattle to lose consciousness This should be progressed on a voluntary basis.
<P>

<a name="40401m01.html_para11">In addition to the issues identified by FAWC, the consultation provides an ideal opportunity for a debate on whether meat from animals slaughtered without prior stunning for the kosher and halal markets should be labelled voluntarily. Some meat that has been slaughtered without the animal previously being stunned finds its way onto the ordinary meat market. At present, such meat is not required to be labelled to indicate the method of slaughter.
<P>

<a name="40401m01.html_para12">We are today issuing our response to the FAWC report for consultation on all aspects including those identified in this statement.

 We are today laying before Parliament the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004, which will implement into United Kingdom law directive 2001/20 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 April 2001 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the member states relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use. The regulations will come into force on 1 May 2004, the date by which member states are required to implement the directive.
<P>

<a name="40401m02.html_para10">These regulations will ensure that the rights, safety and well-being of clinical trial subjects are protected by requiring sponsors of trials to be responsible for designing, conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials according to principles of good clinical practice derived from the principles set out in the amended 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, the regulations will further protect public health by ensuring that the results of clinical trials are collected, recorded and analysed in accordance with internationally recognised principles so that they can be audited and verified before being used to impact on public health, for example through a publication that changes medical prescribing practice or as evidence to support applications to place medicines on the market.
<P>

<P>

<a name="40401m02.html_para13">The Government have undertaken extensive consultation with stakeholders in both the pharmaceutical industry and the non-commercial clinical trials sector on how to implement the Directive. Where possible, concerns expressed by the non-commercial sector, in particular, about the possible regulatory burden have been taken into account in the UK Regulations. Furthermore, the MHRA and Department of Health have been working with stakeholders to help them comply with the practical requirements of the regulations. The Government believe that the regulations achieve a proper balance by safeguarding the rights of patients involved in clinical trials while avoiding a disproportionate impact on those who carry out clinical trials.

 The Department of Work and Pensions laid before the house on 18 November 2002 a consultation document entitled: "Pathways to Work&#151;Helping People into Employment", (Cm 5690). This outlined a range of proposals to provide more effective support to people with health conditions and disabled people. The Pathways to Work are at the leading edge of international best practice on the help and support that is on offer for people whose job prospects are affected by a health condition or disability. In a recent economic survey by the OECD, Pathways to Work has been described as a "radically new approach to dealing with those on incapacity benefits".

I know there has been considerable interest in these groundbreaking reforms and I wish to update colleagues on progress in the first three pilots.
<P>

<a name="40401m02.html_para16">To date, the specially trained personal advisers we have put in place have carried out over 3,000 Work Focused Interviews with promising results. Many customers are, as we believed; keen to actively consider a return to work and positive about the help on offer. They are keen to participate in the NDDP Programmes and NHS Condition Management Programmes. By mid-March, well over 400 customers had been referred to NDDP Programmes and in the first few weeks of operation, around 130 people had been referred to Condition Management Programmes. The Return to Work Credit of &#163;40 a week is also proving a popular incentive, with approximately 700 awards made, helping incapacity benefits recipients make that final step back into work. Furthermore, there are over 700 longer-term recipients who have volunteered to work with an adviser to try and find a job. These figures are drawn from management reports and are provisional&#151;validated statistics are expected to be available from May. With over 700 people helped back to work and off benefits, these pilots are already changing many people's lives. One such example is from Tonypandy, where a client who had been claiming Incapacity Benefit since 1978 due to a back problem and depression, with the support from her Personal Adviser, and help from Return to Work Credit, Adviser Discretion Fund, Tax Credits and New Deal 50+, started work as a Production Operator after 25 years on benefits.

<a name="40401m02.html_para17">On 5 June, I announced the locations of the final four pilots&#151;East Lancashire, Essex, Gateshead & South Tyneside and Somerset.
<P>

<a name="40401m02.html_para18">My Department, together with the Department of Health have been preparing for the implementation of these pilots.

<a name="40401m02.html_para19">In the Budget we also announced the expansion of the specialist Personal Adviser service to more actively support some longer-term IB recipients. We will also be introducing a new financial incentive to support customers as they undertake return to work activity.
<P>

<a name="40401m02.html_para20">Today, I am pleased to announce that these pilots will be launched on 5 April.
<P>

<a name="40401m02.html_para21">The pilots are to run until 2006 and the impact of the extra support will be fully evaluated before decisions are made about extending the measures.

 I am today confirming funding of &#163;473.4 million for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 for the eight Arm's Length Management Organisations (ALMOs) set up under Round 1 of the ALMO programme. The ALMOs in Ashfield, Derby, Hounslow, Kirklees, Rochdale, Stockton-on-Tees, Westminster and Wigan have made excellent progress. Tenants are benefiting from improvements to their homes and an enhanced housing management service. All the Round 1 ALMOs have achieved ratings of at least two stars from the Housing Inspectorate, with three (Ashfield, Derby and Westminster) achieving three stars.
<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para0">Following a detailed assessment of the ALMOs' costs and their other sources of income, and taking account of the need to maximise efficiency, I have approved the allocations for 2004&#150;06 shown in the table below. This will keep the ALMOs on track to achieve the decent homes target.

 I am today laying regulations confirming the introduction of quantitative restrictions on travellers bringing tobacco products from those new EU member states taking advantage of a derogation allowing them to delay meeting minimum duty levels on certain tobacco products.




<P>
<P>1 Apr 2004 : Column 107WS<P>

<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para2">The restrictions will apply from 1 May to the following:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>cigarettes bought duty-paid in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia;</FONT></UL>
<P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>smoking tobacco <sup>2</sup>  bought duty-paid in Estonia.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para3">Where new member states take advantage of the derogation, existing member states are entitled to maintain the same restrictions on the import of cigarettes and some other tobacco products bought in those countries for a traveller's own use, as are currently applied to travellers arriving from third countries, including the new member states.
<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para4">The Excise Duty Points (Etc.)(New Member States) Regulations 2004, the Customs and Excise Duties (Travellers' Allowances and Personal Reliefs) Order 2004 and the Channel Tunnel (Alcoholic Liquor and Tobacco Products)(Amendment) Order 2004 allow the UK to maintain these restrictions.
<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para5">After Accession on May 1, travellers to the UK bringing in tobacco products from the countries covered by the regulations will be restricted, as they are currently, to a limit of 200 cigarettes, or, in the case of Estonia, to a limit of 200 cigarettes or 250 grams of smoking tobacco; or, in the case of the Czech Republic, to a limit of 200 cigarettes or 50 cigars or 100 cigarillos or 250 grams of smoking tobacco.
<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para6">While the EU minimum duty rates are not met, uncertainties over the impact of EU Enlargement on excise smuggling and cross-border shopping are also heightened.
<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para7">The Government will therefore review both the operational and principled justification for retention of quantitive restrictions after 12 months in light of developments in smuggling and shopping patterns, and in light of progress made by the new member states to comply with the minimum duty levels.
<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para8">Customs and Excise has plans in place to explain the restrictions to the travel industry and general public.

 I would like to inform the House of developments in relation to Cyprus.
<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para9">Following the breakdown of settlement negotiations in The Hague in March 2003, the UN Secretary-General made a report to the Security Council. In this report Kofi Annan announced that his proposal for a comprehensive Cyprus settlement (the Annan Plan) remained on the table. However, he added that he did not propose to take any further initiatives unless and until such time as he was given solid reason to believe that the Necessary political will existed for a successful outcome.




<P>
<P>1 Apr 2004 : Column 108WS<P>

<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para10">The Secretary-General went on to say that he believed it would be a great step Backward if the plan were simply to wither away. He believed that a solution on the basis of the plan could be achieved only if there was an unequivocally stated preparedness on the part of the leaders of both sides, fully and determinedly backed at the highest level in both motherlands, to commit themselves <i>(a)</i> to finalise the plan (without reopening its basic principles or essential trade-offs) by a specific date with United Nations assistance, and <i>(b)</i> to put it to separate simultaneous referendums as provided for in the plan on a date certain soon hereafter.
<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para11">The United Kingdom shared this approach and continued to work with its EU and US partners in support of UN efforts to keep the plan on the table and to encourage the parties to Remonstrate the necessary political will to re-engage.
<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para12">The elections in north Cyprus on 14 December 2003 marked a turning point. The Turkish Cypriots voiced their resounding support for the pro-settlement, pro-EU parties and in doing so gave popular expression to a growing desire from the Turkish Cypriot community to work for an early settlement of the Cyprus problem in order to allow a reunited Cyprus to join the EU on 1 May 2004. Encouraged by the attitude of the Turkish Cypriots and aware of the potential positive impact a Cyprus settlement would have on its own EU aspirations, the JVKP government in Ankara led by Prime Minister Erdogan signalled its own willingness to tje-engage and work constructively for a settlement.
<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para13">The parties (the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Greece and Turkey) were therefore invited to New York by the Secretary-General on 4 February 2004 in order to resume negotiations towards a settlement on the basis of the Annan Plan. On 13 February, following an initial round of discussions, the Secretary-General announced that the parties had agreed to resume talks on the basis of the Annan Plan and had committed themselves to a three phase process leading to a finalised plan being submitted to simultaneous, separate referendums on 24 April
<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para14">The 13 February agreement was a landmark achievement. The parties had committed themselves to a strict timetable and a negotiation process which led inexorably towards simultaneous referendums on a pre-determined date on the basis of a settlement plan which, absent agreement between the parties (including, in the final stage, Greece and Turkey) would be finalised by the Secretary-General himself. Negotiations between the two sides resumed in Cyprus on 19 February. In parallel to the main political level negotiations between the leaders of the two communities, technical committees started to work through the whole range of laws and administrative texts and practical arrangements necessary to give effect to the new state of affairs.
<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para15">During this phase of the negotiations, our High Commissioner in Nicosia informed the UN that the UK's earlier offer to the UN of giving up roughly half of the territory of the Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus remained valid, subject to some small changes in the map. The land to be ceded to the United Cyprus Republic would not in any way compromise the operational capabilities of the bases themselves. The UN confirmed that the UK's offer would be very 



<P>
<P>1 Apr 2004 : Column 109WS<P>
valuable in taking forward the adjustments to the territory of the two new constituent states. The UK's offer has been incorporated in the UN's map for the new Cyprus.
<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para16">On 24 March, the negotiations moved to Buergenstock, Switzerland, where the UN and the parties were joined by Greece and Turkey in a final push for a negotiated settlement agreed between the parties themselves. The UK attended in its capacity as a Guarantor Power in order to assist the efforts of the UN Secretary-General's Good Offices Mission. The European Commissioner for Enlargement, Gunter Verheugen, also attended for the final days.
<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para17">On 29 March the Secretary-General presented the parties with a revised plan. This revision was produced following extensive consultation and aimed to strike a balanced compromise, building on the earlier version of the Annan Plan which had been presented to the parties in February 2003, and taking subsequent developments and both sides' views carefully into account. Following a further final round of meetings between the Secretary-General, the parties and Greece and Turkey, Kofi Annan called the parties together late on 31 March. Announcing that the time for negotiation and 



<P>
<P>1 Apr 2004 : Column 110WS<P>
consultation was over, and that the time for decision and action had arrived, the Secretary-General presented the parties and the Guarantor Powers (Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom) with his finalised plan&#151;Annan IV&#151;for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem.
<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para18">In his remarks, Kofi Annan said that the Plan was inevitably a compromise. It did not satisfy everyone's demands. But he believed that it met the core interests, and addressed the key concerns, of people on both sides. He added that the choice was not between the Plan and some other mythical solution. In reality, the choice was between the settlement on offer or no settlement at all. The Government shares this view.
<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para19">No one is under any illusion about what remains to be done. No one is saying that reunification will be easy. But the plan is balanced and fair, and offers all Cypriots the chance of a better future as citizens of a United Cyprus Republic within the European Union. The Government believes strongly that this is a chance that must not be squandered.
<P>

<a name="40401m03.html_para20">The final decision will now be taken by the Cypriots themselves in separate, simultaneous referendums to be held on 24 April.
