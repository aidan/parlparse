 I am today depositing copies of the Government response to consultation on Services Directive implementation. This summarises respondents&#146; views and sets out the Government&#146;s revised plans to implement the EU Services Directive in the UK. The directive is intended to create a single market for services across the EU by addressing barriers to effective cross-border service provision. The Government are required to implement the directive by 28 December 2009.</p>

 I announced to the House on 9 January that I had written to Sir Jim Rose setting out the remit for the review of the primary curriculum. I am today announcing that as part of that remit I have asked Sir Jim to review two of the early literacy goals for five year-olds included in the early years foundation stage (EYFS), and in the existing foundation stage. In carrying out this work, Sir Jim will consider how we can make sure that the early learning goals for literacy set the right foundation for transition into the new primary school arrangements.</p>

It was created and debated in Parliament through the Childcare Act 2006, and comes into statutory force from September 2008. The regulatory impact assessment for the EYFS announced that there would be a post-implementation review of the EYFS from 2010, and I am today announcing further details of this review. Work will begin immediately to make sure arrangements are in place to monitor and improve early delivery, and also to gather the necessary baseline data to measure the impact of the EYFS two years on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="80630m0001.htm_para4"><a name="0806306000031">Pending the outcome of the 2010 review, we will be making regulations to allow childcare providers to apply for exemptions from the EYFS for two years in circumstances where a majority of parents agree with the provider&#146;s assessment that the established principle which governs their practice conflicts with elements of the EYFS learning and development requirements. This reflects the commitment we have already given to keep under review the case for exemptions, and we have taken on board our discussions with representatives of childcare providers and experts in reaching this decision. This process will be administered by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority as part of the role we will give them in advising on children&#146;s learning and development in the EYFS. To ensure public confidence in the process, I have appointed Dorian Bradley, former Director of Children at OFSTED, as an independent adviser on applications for exemptions.</p>

It is important for diplomas to be available in all parts of the schools sector. We have held a national conference for independent schools and a seminar for the 14 independent schools which have expressed an interest in diplomas. These include Polam Hall School in Darlington which is approved for diploma delivery from September 2009 and also Wellington College which has announced that it is hoping to deliver the engineering diploma from 2009. I am also announcing today that we will work with independent schools to produce a protocol that sets out guidance for local authorities, schools and colleges on the arrangements, including fair financial and delivery arrangements, between independent schools and 14-19 consortia.</p>

 I am announcing today the successful conclusion of local area agreement (LAA) negotiations with all 150 local areas in England.

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="80630m0001.htm_para12"><a name="0806306000056">LAAs are about two things: improving the quality of life in local communities and providing better, more responsive, public services.

 I would like to announce the publication of &#147;The Defence Estate Development Plan 2008&#148; (DEDP 08) today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="80630m0001.htm_para15"><a name="0806306000061">The document may be found at http://www.defence-estates.mod.uk/publications/dedp08.php and copies have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="80630m0001.htm_para16"><a name="0806306000062">It sets out the framework to 2030, for the coherent development of the estate to meet the future needs of Defence and the priorities for investment and rationalisation arising from it. The DEDP 08 articulates our firm intentions for the short term and more general plans for the longer term. It is therefore an authoritative framework document that will drive future development and complements the Defence estate strategy 2006, &#147;In Trust and On Trust&#148;. It is intended that the plan will be reviewed annually within MOD.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="80630m0001.htm_para17"><a name="0806306000063">The defence estate is a strategic enabler and a key supporting capability that underpins force structures and defence outputs. The DEDP 08 will deliver an estate that supports flexible balanced forces optimised for expeditionary operations, enabling the efficient and effective generation, deployment, sustainment and recovery of military capability. This will be achieved through the development of defence communities. The aim is to have an estate of fewer larger sites in the UK and overseas that will be legislatively compliant, fit for purpose, support both the current and evolving military need and provide value for money. Sustainability remains a key tenet of Government policy and the DEDP 08 reflects the MOD&#146;s commitment to this important agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="80630m0001.htm_para18"><a name="0806306000064">The DEDP 08 sets out MOD&#146;s key sites in the core sites baseline and divides this into three categories; the core, retained, or disposal estate, providing a focus for investment. The core estate consists of large bases or groups of sites that have an indefinite operational future, or, individual sites that are expected to support Defence outputs for at least 15 years. The retained estate comprises that body of sites where the future is not fully assured and could be subject to review leading to reuse within the Department or disposal. Many retained sites may have a planning horizon of 10 years or more. The disposal estate consists of those sites already identified as surplus to Defence requirements. However, it is important to recognise that future, unforeseen, events and changed circumstance could mean that sites move both into and out of disposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="80630m0001.htm_para19"><a name="0806306000065">The DEDP 08 makes three underlying assumptions to ensure the maximum scope for innovation. First, that there will be little scope to reduce the existing UK training estate in the short term, as it is vital to the delivery of military capability. Secondly that the MOD is likely to remain committed to maintaining some heavy armour presence in Germany for the next 25 years. Thirdly, that the existing permanent joint operating bases will be required for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="80630m0001.htm_para20"><a name="0806306000066">Finally, the DEDP 08 will be widely available and will help to inform the development of regional spatial strategies, local development frameworks and the devolved authorities. In so doing it will highlight development opportunities and serve to better deliver our future plans through the planning process.</p>
