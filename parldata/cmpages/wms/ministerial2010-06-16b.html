 The Government will honour the commitment to spend 0.7% of GNI on overseas aid from 2013. We are determined to ensure that this vital and important aid budget is used effectively and delivers value for money for the world's poorest people. In this context I would like to inform the House that I have commissioned a review of the DFID Bilateral Aid Programme to ensure that we target UK aid where it is needed most and will make the most significant impact on poverty reduction.</p>

 A review of drink and drug driving regulation was commissioned by the then Secretary of State on  3 December 2009, to be undertaken by Sir Peter North. Sir Peter's final report has been published today. This report covers a wide range of issues and makes 51 detailed recommendations, which we need to consider carefully with other Government Departments. In doing so, it is important that we fully investigate the economic and public service resource impact of any suggested changes to the law, taking account of the current financial and economic situation.</p>
