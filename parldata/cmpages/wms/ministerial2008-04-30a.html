<p><a name="st_89"><a name="08043097000011"><a name="80430m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="08043097000076"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Alistair Darling):</b>
 Following representations by political parties in Northern Ireland, the Government commissioned Sir David Varney, in March 2007, to carry out a review of tax policy in Northern Ireland. The review was published in December 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="80430m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08043097000012">His report confirmed that the Northern Ireland economy was doing well under the devolution arrangements introduced a year ago. For example, Northern Ireland had the highest rate of economic growth of all UK regions outside London and the South East between 1997 and 2006, and in 2007 it had the lowest rate of unemployment of any region. There are now more people in employment than ever before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="80430m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08043097000013">But Sir David Varney's review noted that the Northern Ireland economy still faced some demanding challenges. It has the lowest level of productivity and employment of any region in the UK and public spending as a percentage of GDP is around 70 per cent. compared with 35 per cent. in Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="80430m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08043097000014">So the Government asked Sir David to undertake a second review of competitiveness in Northern Ireland. The terms of reference were: &#147;Building on Sir David&#146;s earlier analysis and agreement from all parties about the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland (in relation to the opportunities provided by the peace process, the need to strengthen the private sector, to create increased employment opportunities and to reform the public sector), this review will explore in more detail how to expand the private sector and to enhance Northern Ireland&#146;s competitiveness&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="80430m0001.htm_para3"><a name="08043097000015">The Government are today publishing Sir David Varney&#146;s report. Copies of the report have been deposited in the Library of both Houses. I am very grateful to Sir David Varney and his team, and to all those who submitted evidence to the review, for this comprehensive report. It provides a valuable assessment of how the opportunities and challenges facing the Northern Ireland Executive in developing its economic strategy might best be approached.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="80430m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08043097000016">Sir David recognises the new opportunities that peace and stability in Northern Ireland provide for stronger and greater prosperity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="80430m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08043097000017">The main findings of the report are:</p>
<a name="80430m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08043097000018"><ul><p class="tabletext">the Northern Ireland Executive&#146;s Programme for Government and the UK Government&#146;s May 2007 economic and financial package provide an excellent base for securing long-term transformational change in Northern Ireland;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="80430m0001.htm_para9"><a name="08043097000027">I welcome that the Northern Ireland Budget focused on those Northern Ireland Departments that have a central role in helping the economy.

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="80430m0001.htm_para10"><a name="08043097000028">I also welcome the support which the Irish Government continue to provide in developing the all-island economy which directly benefits Northern Ireland through infrastructure and innovation investment, the assistance provided by the EU and the interest shown by the US, as can be seen in next week&#146;s US investment conference in Belfast.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="80430m0001.htm_para11"><a name="08043097000029">In the 2008 Budget I announced a range of measures which will improve Northern Ireland&#146;s competitive position and strengthen the private sector including:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="80430m0001.htm_para15"><a name="08043097000041">The Council adopted a regulation which restricted Poland&#146;s future quotas for Baltic sea cod to reflect a 2007 overfish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="80430m0001.htm_para16"><a name="08043097000042">The Council held a policy debate on a proposal for a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. The debate was based on a presidency questionnaire focusing on: the scope of the proposal&#151;in particular whether EU vessels should be included or not; the proposed import certification system; and on potential criminal and administrative sanctions. The UK supported the general intention of the measure and the inclusion of EU vessels (to send the correct signal to our international counterparts), but raised concerns about the complexity of the proposed controls and the administrative resource implications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="80430m0001.htm_para17"><a name="08043097000043">The Council also held an exchange of views on a proposal amending the cod recovery regulation. The UK welcomed the general thrust of the proposal, but emphasised the importance of taking account of the UK&#146;s significant progress to date in reducing effort on cod. The UK also challenged the extension of the measures to the Celtic sea&#151;on the grounds that cod formed only a small part of the activities of the vessels concerned and restricting their effort in this way would interfere with their ability to catch a range of other less vulnerable species.</p>

<p><a name="st_91"><a name="08043097000052"><a name="80430m0001.htm_spmin2"><a name="08043097000078"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget Prentice):</b>
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence and I wish to make the following statement to the House about the inquests of service personnel who have died overseas. All casualties suffered by our armed forces are, of course, a source of profound regret. Our service personnel put their lives on the line to help build strong, stable and democratic nations, and to protect the interests of the United Kingdom. We cannot pay high enough tribute to the job that they are doing, or to the ultimate sacrifice which some of them have made. We remain strongly committed to minimising the effect on the bereaved families.</p>

Today, we are announcing the progress that has been made since the written ministerial statement on 31 January. This statement shows the position at 22 April, but does not reflect the tragic loss of Trooper Pearson in Afghanistan on 21 April, as the inquest has not yet been opened.</p>

In the remaining nine inquests, investigations are ongoing but it has not yet been possible for an inquest date to be set. The oldest individual inquest for which no date had been set at the time of the last written ministerial statement was that into the death of Lieutenant Palmer, who died on 15 April 2006.

These have enabled the coroner, Mr Masters, to engage an additional assistant deputy coroner, together with an additional coroner&#146;s officer and administrative support, and to provide appropriate accommodation to hold military inquests. These extra resources are helping to ensure that bereaved families are responded to sensitively and speedily following conclusions of the investigations.   <br>

We have increased the number of family members who can travel and stay overnight if necessary, at public expense, to attend the repatriation ceremony.
