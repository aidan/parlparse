This instrument sets out the technical details to bring into operation the original Council Decision on Pr√1/4m, which was agreed in June. In parallel the presidency has sent the text of the Council decision to the European Parliament for an opinion to be delivered during the European Parliament plenary session on 9 and 10 April 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="71107m0002.htm_para1"><a name="07110721000106">The proposal on Council decision on the improvement of cooperation between the special intervention units of the member states of the European Union in crisis situations is also likely to go to the Council for a general approach. This decision creates a framework for crisis intervention units from a given member state to provide assistance to other member states. The UK is supportive of this decision as it enables member states to receive assistance from other member states if they so require, although the UK does not envisage needing to use this agreement. The scheme is voluntary and places no obligation on member states to either request or provide assistance. The UK is able to provide assistance to another member state if it wishes to do so under this agreement. If we want to call on assistance from another member state for a foreign crisis intervention unit to exercise police powers here, we would need to make legislative changes to UK law. The European Parliament&#146;s opinion is also outstanding on this proposal and is expected after 15 January 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="71107m0002.htm_para2"><a name="07110721000107">Two new draft directives on legal migration will be presented by the Commission. The first is for a new EU &#147;Blue Card&#148; scheme to attract highly skilled migrants. The second proposes a single application procedure for third country nationals entering the EU, combining separate applications for residency and the right to work into a single application. We will only opt-in to these directives if it is in the UK&#146;s national interest to do so and we judge them to be compatible with our points-based system for managed migration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="71107m0002.htm_para3"><a name="07110721000108">Although the UK is not participating in the application of the draft regulation amending the common consular instructions, the UK has been involved in the discussions, particularly where they relate to biometric capture and age limits. The presidency noted that a number of key issues, which had been extensively examined at working party level, remained outstanding, and that further discussion with, among others, the European Parliament is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="71107m0002.htm_para4"><a name="07110721000109">The presidency will report on progress made in negotiations on the draft directive on common standards and procedures in member states for returning illegally staying third-country nationals. The Government made the decision not to opt in to this Directive shortly after it was issued in September 2005. The Scrutiny Committees of both Houses agreed with that decision. Negotiations in the Council have been lengthy and the first reading has not yet been completed. There are a number of outstanding issues unresolved. The content of the draft directive has not changed sufficiently for the Government to reassess the original decision not to opt-in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="71107m0002.htm_para5"><a name="07110721000110">The presidency will report back on the Balkans Ministerial Forum on Justice and Home Affairs that took place in Brdo in October. They will also announce the EU-LAC (Latin America and Caribbean) seminar on migration.</p>

more closely engaged in the democratic process&#148; and that, against this background, the IMC &#147;strongly believe that this position is now stable&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="71107m0002.htm_para16"><a name="07110721000156">On Loyalism, I welcome the IMC&#146;s assessment that the UVF&#146;s 3 May 2007 statement, renouncing violence and committing to transform itself from a military to a civilian organisation, represents &#145;a major turning point&#146; for the organisation. The report notes that the position is not yet entirely transformed and there are some pockets of resistance but does not doubt that the leadership is clear on the direction in which it is taking the organisation, has briefed the message in the statement down to the grass roots and has started to take steps to reduce the organisation&#146;s size.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="71107m0002.htm_para17"><a name="07110721000157">I share, however, the concern of the IMC that the pace of real change within the UDA remains far too slow. The IMC recognise that internal turbulence within the UDA has been a key factor in this in the six months under review, giving rise to continuing incidents of violence. The report also notes the very recent progress there has been by way of contact between the UDA and the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. But the violent scenes in Carrickfergus and Bangor were a stark reminder of Northern Ireland&#146;s troubled past. We must see an end to violence and criminality of this kind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="71107m0002.htm_para18"><a name="07110721000158">The IMC also calls on both the UVF and the UDA to decommission as a test by which any paramilitary organisation must ultimately expect to be judged. The report notes that in respect of PIRA the IMC did not consider it had embarked on a political path until after it had decommissioned arms in September 2005 and that it takes no different approach to the UVF or UDA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="71107m0002.htm_para19"><a name="07110721000159">In relation to dissident republican groups, the IMC makes it clear that these groups still pose a threat. Three paramilitary murders were reported, the first since February 2006. All three have been attributed to dissidents. These groups are ruthless and dangerous, and their intent to cause harm and destruction is undiminished, but they will not deter us from achieving long-term political stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="71107m0002.htm_para20"><a name="07110721000160">Once again, I am grateful to the IMC for their submission of this report and for its careful analysis. As ever, this report offers a clear picture of the challenges ahead to secure an end to paramilitarism in Northern Ireland.</p>
