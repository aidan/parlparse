 Today the Department for Communities and Local Government is publishing an action plan in partnership with the Local Government Association setting out a substantive and exciting community empowerment agenda.

The plan draws on existing good practice and brings together a range of actions to broaden and deepen empowerment activity. It forms an important strand of the Government's overall strategy for constitutional renewal, as set out in the Governance of Britain Green Paper. It will also be a building block to develop a cross-Government approach to community empowerment. It sets out activities in three key areas: widening and deepening empowerment opportunities locally; supporting and enabling people to take up those opportunities; and strengthening local representative democracy.</p>

Secondly, under UK national control, QRA provides an airborne contribution to countering threats against the UK by terrorist organisations or individuals. The SDR New Chapter confirmed that airfields across the UK&#151;RAF Marham, RAF St Mawgan and RNAS Yeovilton&#151;would be able to support QRA aircraft when needed, in addition to the bases from which the QRA aircraft usually operate.</p>

In the interim, RAF St Mawgan will continue to be utilised as necessary to support short term QRA aircraft. RAF Marham will continue to be maintained as a tertiary QRA airfield. This support is in addition to the bases that are already able to operate such aircraft and will give us enhanced flexibility in our air defence arrangements.</p>
