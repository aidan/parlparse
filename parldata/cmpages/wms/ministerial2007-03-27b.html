 On 30 January I announced that in response to our Invitation to Councils we had received 26 proposals from local authorities for the creation of unitary local government in their areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="70327m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07032768000062">In reaching her decision, my right hon. Friend has had regard to the submitted proposals, any supplementary material submitted by the proposers themselves, and other available relevant information. Her judgment is that there is at least a reasonable likelihood that these proposals, if implemented, would achieve the outcomes specified by the five criteria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="70327m0001.htm_para3"><a name="07032768000063">We are launching this consultation today, seeking the views of partners and stakeholders in the areas affected by the proposals. As the Invitation explains, partners and stakeholders include all local authorities, the wider public sector, the business community, and the voluntary and community sector. It is, however, open to anyone to respond to the consultation document that we are issuing today, copies of which are placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="70327m0001.htm_para4"><a name="07032768000065">We are in particular seeking views on the extent to which consultees believe the proposals would deliver the outcomes specified by the criteria, and in the case of the alternative proposals for Bedfordshire, Cheshire and Northumberland, which of the alternatives in each case would better deliver those outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="70327m0001.htm_para5"><a name="07032768000066">The consultation will run until 22 June 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="70327m0001.htm_para6"><a name="07032768000067">After the stakeholder consultation, we will consider very carefully all the representations that we have received. Proposals will proceed to implementation if, and only if, when we take our final decisions, we remain satisfied that they meet the criteria, and that the overall use of reserves remains affordable, having regard to the prevailing fiscal position and the risks around the estimated costs of implementation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="70327m0001.htm_para7"><a name="07032768000068">As explained in our original Invitation, implementation of any proposals involving transitional costs financed by the use of reserves impacts on planned public expenditure totals. Any use of reserves must therefore in aggregate be within the limited envelope available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="70327m0001.htm_para8"><a name="07032768000069">It was because of this limited envelope that the Invitation stated that the Government think it unlikely that it would be able to implement more than eight proposals, but that this maximum number would not preclude the Government from deciding to implement more if they offered good value for money and were affordable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="70327m0001.htm_para9"><a name="07032768000070">If when we take our final decisions there are more proposals that meet the criteria than we can afford to implement, we will prioritise in order to decide which ones to implement. We will consult during our main stakeholder consultation on the proposed means of prioritising restructuring proposals in such circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="70327m0001.htm_para10"><a name="07032768000071">If implemented, the proposals could, on the basis of current estimates, save up to around &#163;200 million annually.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="70327m0001.htm_para11"><a name="07032768000072">In those cases where there are alternative proposals, any decision on implementation will necessarily involve a decision as to which option should proceed. If we were to decide that Bedford Borough's proposal should proceed to implementation we may need to consider the future local government structures in the remaining county area, which might no longer be a viable two-tier area.</p>

 The UK's chemical protection programme is designed to protect against the use of chemical weapons. Such a programme is permitted by the Chemical Weapons Convention, with which the United Kingdom is fully compliant. Under the terms of the Convention, we are required to provide information annually to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

 Over the past 12 months the Ministry of Defence has undertaken a thorough review of the Defence Medical Services (DMS) manpower requirement. The aim of this review was to determine the number of uniformed, regular DMS personnel required to support operations consistent with overall Defence Planning Assumptions, provide full healthcare and allow for continued training and the provision of headquarters staff during deployment. The review has now been completed and I am now in a position to inform the House of the new DMS manpower requirement. I am convinced it provides a credible baseline on which the DMS can base its planning and ensure that the excellent level of healthcare which it provides both on operations and, in collaboration with the NHS, in the UK, is sustained into the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="70327m0001.htm_para17"><a name="07032768000101">The last full review of the DMS uniformed regular manpower requirement took place at the time of the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) over eight years ago, and produced a requirement for a grand total of 8,970 posts (the 'SDR total'). This however exceeded the available medical manpower, and subsequent experience in support of deployed operations showed that a different balance of medical specialisms was more appropriate. Hence a lower overall figure was adopted as a pragmatic interim basis for funding a different mix of established posts (the 'established liability'). To ensure that the requirement was valid not just in the light of emerging practice on operations since SDR, but also to be consistent with current defence-wide planning assumptions, a formal review was undertaken, starting in January 2006. The review was carried out by the multi-disciplinary Medical Operational Capability (Med Op Cap) project team, drawing on previous studies, lessons learned work, high-level operational analysis and incorporating military judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="70327m0001.htm_para18"><a name="07032768000102">The overall result of this work is that the DMS baseline uniformed regular manning requirement (the &#145;Med Op Cap requirement') has now been set at 7,573 posts plus an additional manning and training margin of 678, making a grand total of 8,251 posts.</p>

Some additional potential for civilianisation of up to 320 posts in the Med Op Cap total requirement was identified by the review, which will be investigated further.</p>

The proposal aims to consolidate the existing 21 sector-specific Common Market Organisations into a single Regulation, in an effort to streamline and simplify the legal framework. Along with other Member States, I broadly supported the Commission's proposal as an important step in the CAP simplification action plan and agreed that a case-by-case approach should be taken to the transfer of competence for implementing powers from the Council to the Commission. Some Member States did not agree to the inclusion of the fruit and vegetables and wine sectors in the Single Common Market Organisation in advance of the reform of those sectors, and opposed the abolition of pigmeat intervention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="70327m0002.htm_para1"><a name="07032768000123">I should have said that the Constitutional Review Committee, which was formed on 15 November 2006, is due to present its proposed amendments for the Council of Representative&#146;s consideration by mid-May 2007, and that while there is no stipulated time frame for the whole review process, Iraq&#146;s political party leaders have committed to completing the constitutional review process, including the required referendum, within a year of the review committee forming. We are making clear to the Government of Iraq that article 41 must be implemented in a way that does not contravene the various human rights provisions in the Iraqi constitution.

 In my statement to the House on 19 March 2007, <i>Official Report</i>, col 557-8, I set out the background to the review of the new national recruitment and selection process for doctors in postgraduate training. I outlined the decisions that had been made by the review group up to that date. As the review group continued to meet last week, the purpose of this statement is to provide a further update on progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="70327m0002.htm_para3"><a name="07032768000126">The review group issued a further statement on 22 March. This said:</p>
<a name="70327m0002.htm_brev4"><a name="07032768000127"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Building on last week's announcement, at a minimum, every long-listable applicant who applied through Medical Training Application Service (MTAS) and meets the eligibility criteria for their relevant specialty will be invited for an interview. Under this guaranteed interview scheme, candidates will be able to choose which of their preferences to be interviewed for in light of geographic specialty-specific and specialty training level-specific competition ratios which will be available on the MTAS website. We are in discussion about the implications of this for the timetable.</p>
</ul><a name="70327m0002.htm_brev5"><a name="07032768000128"><ul><p class="tabletext">The recruitment system has worked satisfactorily for general practice and this will continue. In other specialities, there is evidence that the short-listing process was weak and we will therefore eliminate this part of the process immediately. In contrast, the interview process has been working and therefore the revised approach will ensure that all long-listable candidates will be interviewed. The review group believes that this new approach is the most equitable and practical solution available. The group also recognises the enormous effort by the consultants, service and deans that has already taken place to ensure that the interview process has worked. The time and effort required for further interviews is recognised by the service and the time required will be made available. Therefore first choice interviews that have already taken place should not need to be repeated.</p>

</ul><a name="70327m0002.htm_brev7"><a name="07032768000130"><ul><p class="tabletext">In broad terms, this means that all eligible applicants at every stage of their training, whether or not they have already had interviews or interview offers, will be able to review their stated first choice preference and have the opportunity to select the one for which they want to be interviewed. We will be discussing operational details over the next week and these may differ between specialties and between different parts of the UK dependent on local circumstances. We will also consult widely. Exact details for how applicants will be able to do this will be available week commencing 2 April on the MMC website at www.mmc.nhs.uk. In the meantime, interviews will continue and applicants should attend unless they are confident that this will not be their preferred choice.</p>
</ul><a name="70327m0002.htm_brev8"><a name="07032768000131"><ul><p class="tabletext">No job offers will be made until all these interviews have taken place. Discussions are taking place on the implications of this for the filling of General Practice training places. We expect that the majority of training places will be filled through these interviews. Unfilled vacancies will be filled through further interviews.</p>
</ul><a name="70327m0002.htm_brev9"><a name="07032768000132"><ul><p class="tabletext">The review group has recommended the development of a programme of career support for applicants at all stages of the process. Further details to support applicants, deans and selectors through this process will be available next week on the MMC website. Future work will explore what the possibilities might be for doctors to change specialties.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="70327m0002.htm_para4"><a name="07032768000134">This represents a reasonable way forward to meet both the aspirations of junior doctors and the timetable for making appointments for August. I therefore regret the fact that the British Medical Association representatives have withdrawn from the group. Despite this, the important work of the review group will continue and I would encourage the British Medical Association representatives to come back to the table to ensure that all stakeholders can work together to take forward a workable solution to these issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="70327m0002.htm_para5"><a name="07032768000136">I am glad to note that the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges supports this revised approach. They believe that with the work of the review group it offers the most equitable and practical solution available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="70327m0002.htm_para6"><a name="07032768000138">The timetable for the group's work is very tight and the next two weeks will see important progress. Applicants, consultants, employers and all those with a stake in the process will be anxious to be kept informed of progress. I trust that the House will understand if we continue to issue updates on important developments during the recess.</p>
