These are currently the responsibility of DEFRA and DFT respectively. Further policy transfers may be agreed. It has also been agreed in principle that the agency will manage the UK's financial interest in the EU Satellite Centre, which is currently the responsibility of the MOD; subject to further work. The shadow agency will also begin to take responsibility for space funding for technology and instruments currently carried out by the Research Councils and TSB.

 We are today launching a consultation about personal insolvency. Specifically, we are asking whether we should amend the eligibility criteria relating to debt relief orders (DROs) in order to allow access to those people who are currently excluded because they have pension rights based on a small current pension valuation that they cannot draw down for some years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="100323m0001.htm_para4"><a name="10032397000031">DROs were introduced in April 2009 following research that identified that there were people in long-term debt difficulties who had nothing to offer their creditors and who could not afford to make themselves bankrupt. Delivered in partnership with the professional debt advice sector, DROs provide low-cost easy access to debt relief for those overwhelmed by relatively low levels of unmanageable debt. They are designed to provide a fresh start for the most vulnerable people trapped in debt.</p>

because they have pension rights based on a pension that has a low current valuation. This consultation examines a number of options designed to make the system fairer for these people. In particular, we propose asking whether a pension should not count towards the value of assets provided that the current valuation is no more than either £1,000 or £5,000 or £10,000; and/or where the individual cannot draw down the pension for at least five years or 10 years.

Defamation proceedings are now part of a mandatory costs budgeting pilot, with judges scrutinising costs as cases progress to ensure that they are proportionate and within the agreed budget. In addition, the Government are seeking to reduce the maximum "success fee" in conditional fee agreements in defamation-related proceedings to 10 per cent. as an interim measure so that the specific concerns around high costs in these cases can be addressed as quickly as possible.</p>
