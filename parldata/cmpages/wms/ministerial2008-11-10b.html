 I am today announcing final allocations of the first round of &#163;101 million of Housing Planning Delivery Grant (HPDG) for 2008-09. HPDG was established in 2007 to reward local authorities for improved delivery of housing and other planning outcomes as part of their strategic, place shaping role and to provide more support to communities and local councils who are actively seeking to deliver new homes. The grant replaces Planning Delivery Grant which has been paid since 2002-03. The housing element of the grant was developed following concerns from local authorities that housing growth was inadequately recognised by the local government finance system. HPDG is designed to strengthen the incentive for local authorities to respond to local housing pressures by returning the benefits of growth to communities and to incentivise efficient and effective planning procedures</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="81110m0001.htm_para0"><a name="0811108000015">The grant is performance-related. The &#163;40 million housing element of the grant goes to all local authorities with net additional housing completions above 0.75 per cent. of their existing housing stock. The net additions are averaged over the previous three years. For each net addition above the threshold, the local authority receives one unit (&#163;916) of housing grant. The amount per unit is calculated by the total amount of money for the year divided by the total number of units above the threshold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="81110m0001.htm_para1"><a name="0811108000016">The &#163;61 million planning element of the grant consists of four separate parts with incentives for local authorities to deliver:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="81110m0001.htm_para3"><a name="0811108000018">The announcement today includes the revised allocations of awards following the evaluation of the challenges to the provisional allocations which we published in July. The successful challenges resulted in an increase to the overall allocation which has been offset partially by redistribution of abatement. Downward adjustment of the provisional allocations for all authorities has therefore been kept to a minimum.</p>

 My predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Des Browne), represented the UK at an informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers held on 1 and 2 October 2008, in Deauville, France. It provided an important opportunity for discussions on EU-led operations, a range of military capability issues and presidency initiatives for &#147;Europe and its citizens&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="81110m0001.htm_para6"><a name="0811108000022">In the first session on operations, Javier Solana, the EU high representative for common foreign and security policy, briefed Ministers on the positive start to the EU monitoring mission in Georgia. On Chad, the French presidency sought greater clarity on which EU countries would remain militarily engaged for a post-March 2009 UN follow-on mission. On Bosnia-Herzegovina, Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe (DSACEUR), General Sir John McColl, briefed Ministers on options for drawing down the current 2,500-strong EU Operation Althea military force. It was agreed that further discussion on possible draw-down and civilianisation would be required at the next EU Defence Ministers&#146; discussion on 10 November. Responding to the growing menace of piracy in the seas off Somalia, Ministers discussed the prospects for an ESDP counter-piracy mission, noting the need for the EU to co-ordinate closely with other actors already in-theatre, notably NATO and combined joint taskforce 150.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="81110m0001.htm_para7"><a name="0811108000023">In the two sessions on military capabilities, the French presidency outlined a number of bilateral and multilateral initiatives to improve European military capabilities, in partnership with the European Defence Agency. My right hon. Friend outlined progress on the UK-France helicopter initiative, and some additional funding contributions were announced by Luxembourg and Finland. The Secretary-General of NATO welcomed the initiative and stressed the need for complementarity with NATO&#146;s efforts to deliver more operational capability from the large number of European helicopters. Ministers debated the difficulty of generating sufficient forces and reserves for operations such as EUFOR Chad. My right hon. Friend maintained that the battlegroup concept remained valid, but that the UK was ready to engage in a debate about the usability of European forces. He also emphasised that that European defence budgets should be spent on improving capability, not on boosting staff numbers and budgets of Brussels institutions; a theme supported by others.</p>

 Following the statement on civil nuclear co-operation with India on 6 September 2008 by the nuclear suppliers group (NSG) which provides an exception from the NSG guidelines for exports to civil nuclear facilities in India that are safeguarded by the IAEA, the UK Government have reviewed its policy towards nuclear-related exports to India.

Applications will be considered against the NSG guidelines for nuclear transfers, in accordance with the NSG statement of 6 September 2008.</p>

We also expect the agenda to feature the 2020 climate change and energy package; and the next stage on the Lisbon treaty ratification process. We also anticipate a discussion on the European Security and Defence Policy, including on an updated European Security Strategy; and on a range of external relations items including Russia/Georgia.</p>

We expect the Council conclusions to underline the EU&#146;s concern at the displacement caused by the resumption of fighting and the unacceptable human rights abuses continuing in the region. They will also reiterate the need to maintain efforts towards a political solution through the Goma and Nairobi processes. As my right hon.

The support of the international community is vital to developing co-operation between the Governments of DRC and Rwanda. The question of military support from the EU to the region will also be under discussion. The UN already has the world&#146;s largest peace keeping force deployed in DRC, and our view is that military support to the political processes must come through an enhanced UN response. But it is right that EU Foreign Ministers should consider contingency preparations.</p>

The Government believe closure of the Office of the High Representative should remain dependent on BiH&#146;s leaders fulfilling the agreed conditions and that decisions on the EU&#146;s military presence in BiH (EUFOR) should only be taken once there is clarity on the future of the international presence in Bosnia.</p>

Improving the co-ordination of the EU&#146;s efforts in Afghanistan, particularly the relationship between the EU special representative, the European Commission and the EU Police Reform Mission (EUPOL), will enable the EU to better assist the Government of Afghanistan in rebuilding the country, and addressing the underlying causes of insecurity.</p>

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="0811108000074"><a name="81110m0002.htm_spmin1"><a name="0811108000098"><b>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Shaun Woodward):</b>
 I have received the 20th report of the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC). This report has been made under articles 4 and 7 of the international agreement that established the Commission and it reports on levels of paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland. I have considered the content of the report and I am today bringing it before Parliament. I have placed copies in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="81110m0002.htm_para8"><a name="0811108000075">The report underlines the progress that has been made, particularly over the last three years, towards a more normal society in Northern Ireland. If further evidence of that were needed, the mutual respect and sensitivity demonstrated by the arrangements for the homecoming parades in Belfast and elsewhere shows the continued progress being made. The IMC also make the point that the devolution of policing and justice powers would be a further indication of progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="81110m0002.htm_para9"><a name="0811108000076">The report sets out the clear and important benefits that devolution would bring. It would enable the closer integration of law enforcement with other domestic policy, essential in the fight against crime. It would also allow the Executive and Assembly to ensure that the criminal justice system was fully aligned to the needs of an increasingly normalised Northern Ireland and that a co-ordinated, strategic approach to policing and justice could evolve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="81110m0002.htm_para10"><a name="0811108000077">The report acknowledges that the absence of certainty on the devolution of policing and justice may have encouraged dissident republican groups to think that they could exploit a political vacuum. Certainly the report clearly shows that both the Real Irish Republican Army (RIRA) and the Continuity Irish Republican Army (CIRA) have been more active at the same time in recent months. The report&#146;s picture of an increased threat by dissident republicans, including a high level of threat to police officers, is obviously a matter of concern, and the PSNI and security services continue to work to counter it. They should be commended for this work when the threat is so firmly targeted at their own officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="81110m0002.htm_para11"><a name="0811108000078">The report confirms the assessment made in previous reports that PIRA have maintained an exclusively political path and have completely relinquished the leadership and other structures appropriate to a time of armed conflict. In other words it is redundant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="81110m0002.htm_para12"><a name="0811108000079">The IMC is clear that while there is intent by some loyalists to proceed along a peaceful path, progress has been disappointingly slow with some members being involved in criminality for personal gain. The message to the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) is clear: it must recognise that the organisation&#146;s time as a paramilitary group has passed and that decommissioning is inevitable. The report points both the Ulster Volunteers Force (UVF) and the UDA to my statement in May that the legal protection for decommissioning will go sooner rather than later. The Government will look closely at the conclusions reached by the IMC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="81110m0002.htm_para13"><a name="0811108000080">Once again, I am grateful to the Commission for the submission of this report and for its careful analysis. The report offers a clear picture of both the extraordinary progress made and the challenges ahead to secure an end to paramilitarism in Northern Ireland and the devolution of policing and justice.</p>

 I wish to notify Parliament that Great Britain has fully implemented the recast directive 2006/54/EC, as required by the European Union.

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="81110m0002.htm_para15"><a name="0811108000083">We are, therefore, in a position to notify the European Commission that we have transposed the recast directive into our domestic law, in the way set out in the transposition table which will be placed in the Library.</p>
