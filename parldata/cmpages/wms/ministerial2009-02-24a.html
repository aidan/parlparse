While it is clearly sound financial management for schools to retain a small surplus from year to year, we expect revenue funding to be used for the salaries of staff at the school and on learning resources to support the education of pupils in school now, working towards raising attainment and narrowing the gaps in attainment between disadvantaged children and the rest. We would not normally expect schools to need to use it for capital improvement projects, given that separate capital funding is available. Where a school is in deficit, it must agree a recovery plan with the local authority to eliminate the deficit, normally over three years.</p>

If we do not see a substantial reduction of total revenue balances and the excessive balances held by individual schools, the Government will consult on further action from 2011-12 to bring the total down.</p>

It is based on the principle that local people know best what needs to be done to promote the sustainability of their area, but that sometimes they need central government to act to enable this to happen. In October 2008, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government invited local authorities to submit proposals, via the Local Government Association in its capacity as &#145;the selector&#146;, which they consider would contribute to promoting the sustainability of local communities.

The aim of these reports is to assist local authorities, their partners and local people in promoting the sustainability of local communities by providing more information about the public funding that is spent in their area.</p>

This will enable the Government to develop local spending reports which are useful and whose cost is likely to justify their benefit. This consultation paper is in two phases. Firstly, proposals for how the Government will put in place the first arrangements for local spending reports and, secondly, seeking views on how local spending reports might develop over time.</p>

 I am pleased to announce today that the European Commission has agreed to the Government&#146;s request for an exemption from Regulation (EC) 561/2006 on drivers&#146; hours for professional drivers operating solely within the UK when they are reservists undergoing military training or providing instruction to members of a Cadet Corps approved by the Secretary of State for Defence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="90224m0002.htm_para0"><a name="09022445000066">This exemption, which has been granted in accordance with the provisions in Article 14.1 of Regulation (EC) 561/2006, applies to the weekly rest requirements in Article 8(2) and 8(6) of Regulation (EC) 561/2006. It will enable a driver who finishes his normal driving duties on a Friday to complete a 34 hour period of military training as a volunteer reservist or as an instructor in the Cadet Corps and then resume his normal driving duties again on a Monday morning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="90224m0002.htm_para1"><a name="09022445000067">The following safeguards have been incorporated into the exemption to ensure that road safety is not jeopardised:</p>
<a name="90224m0002.htm_brev0"><a name="09022445000085"><ul><p class="tabletext">the exemption will apply to 15 days&#146; annual camp and 10 weekend training sessions per annum&#151;a total of 35 days.

The Ministry of Defence will be issuing guidelines that outline how drivers can manage their volunteer reserve service in accordance with the exemption, and a copy of the European Commission&#146;s Decision will be published on the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency website.</p>
