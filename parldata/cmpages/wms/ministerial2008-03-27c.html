<p><a name="st_26"><a name="08032765000026"><a name="80327m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="08032765000171"><b>The Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Ed Balls):</b>
 The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and I today welcome the publication of the report of the Byron review of the risks to children of potentially harmful or inappropriate material on the internet and in video games. A copy of the report, &#147;Safer Children in a Digital World&#148;, will be placed in the Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="80327m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08032765000027">In September 2007 the Prime Minister asked Dr. Tanya Byron to lead an independent review to help parents and their children get the best from new technologies while protecting children from inappropriate or harmful material. This review has been jointly sponsored by the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="80327m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08032765000028">The objectives of the Byron review were: to undertake a review of the evidence on risks to children&#146;s safety and wellbeing of exposure to potentially harmful or inappropriate material on the internet and in video games; and to assess the effectiveness and adequacy of existing measures to help prevent children from being exposed to such material and help parents understand and manage the risks of access to inappropriate material, and to make recommendations for improvements or additional action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="80327m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08032765000029">Dr. Byron&#146;s final report published today sets out a detailed analysis of the evidence on the risks and benefits of new technologies and evaluates the work already being done to protect children online and ensure appropriate access to age-rated video games. In doing so, Dr. Byron recognises the need to develop a shared culture of responsibility with families, industry and Government all playing their part to reduce the availability of potentially harmful material, restrict access to it by children and to increase children&#146;s resilience and ability to understand and manage risk. We welcome and support this approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="80327m0001.htm_para3"><a name="08032765000030">To achieve this, Dr. Byron recommends reforming how Government and stakeholders work to improve our children&#146;s safety when using the internet through the following measures:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="80327m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08032765000031">The creation of a new UK Council for Child Internet Safety, established by and reporting to the Prime Minister, including representation from across Government, industry, children&#146;s charities and other key stakeholders. The Council is to be chaired jointly by the Home Office and DCSF. DCMS will play a key role given its important policy responsibilities  <br>

Government and devolved Administrations should implement the UK CRC. The overall response of stakeholders to the consultation document is positive. Stakeholders support the adoption of CRC as a UK-wide scheme and tended to agree with most elements of the Government&#146;s proposed approach.</p>

 On behalf of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, I have signed regulations made under Part 1 of the Welfare Reform Act 2007, which are laid before the House today. This is an important set of regulations which provides the benefit structure and rules for the new employment and support allowance (ESA) which will be introduced from 27 October 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="80327m0002.htm_para6"><a name="08032765000093">This is a further significant step in the Government&#146;s welfare reform strategy and addresses a key area for simplification by providing a single income replacement benefit for people who are not working and have a health condition or disability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="80327m0002.htm_para7"><a name="08032765000094">The Employment and Support Allowance Regulations 2008 prescribe the conditions of entitlement and benefit regulations for those who claim on the basis that their capability for work is limited by their physical or mental condition. ESA will be payable in respect of new claims arising from 27 October and will replace incapacity benefit and income support paid on the grounds of incapacity or disability. Incapacity benefit and income support will continue in payment to existing customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="80327m0002.htm_para8"><a name="08032765000095">For ESA, new medical and capability assessments, collectively to be known as the work capability assessment, will focus on what a person can do and identify what steps they might take towards taking up work. We intend to apply the new medical test to existing claimants, as their benefit entitlement comes up for reassessment, starting in 2010. We expect all existing claimants to have been assessed using the new test by 2013.</p>

This will be delivered through the successful pathways to work initiative, which will be extended and available nationally from next month and which has already helped over 64,000 people into work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="80327m0002.htm_para10"><a name="08032765000097">ESA will be payable to those with the most severe health conditions or disabilities without them having to undertake any mandatory work-focused interviews&#151;they will be part of the support group.
