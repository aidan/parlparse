of Planning
Applications</h4><p><a name="06072524000025"><b><a name="06072524000124">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Meg Munn):</b> Today I have launched a
consultation on the requirements for local authority validation of
planning applications. This follows on from an earlier consultation on
proposals for a standard application
form.</p><p><a name="06072524000026">The
consultation proposes that there is a core and mandatory list of
national requirements for applicants to comply with in submitting a
planning application, which is to be supplemented by a list of local
authority requirements. These local requirements must be consulted on
by the local authority prior to being published on their website. The
Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) intends to
publish guidance for local authorities on what the local lists should
contain, and will also make clear that there are a number of national
requirements on applicants to provide information on such areas as
flooding, and land contamination. The proposals provide that where an
application does not meet the published national requirements and
locally consulted on requirements, the authority will not be required
to validate
it.</p><p><a name="06072524000027">The
consultation is linked with the development of the standard application
form, and the proposalsare intended to complement the
streamlining and efficiency benefits that will result from there being
a single national
form.</p><p><a name="06072524000028">The
consultation period ends on 30 September 2006. Any proposed legislative
changes would be brought in by April 2007, and local authorities would
have to adopt these by July 2007, the date on which the standard
application form would become
mandatory.</p><p><a name="06072524000029">The
consultation paper has been published onthe DCLG website at
http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=l017165 and a copy of the
paper has been placed in the Library of the
House.</p><h4 align="center"><a name="06072524000012">Homelessness Code

Secretaries of State for Health 
<br><notus-date day="25" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>25 July 2006 : Column 100WS</b><br>and for Education and Skills, and will replace the current guidance
(issued in July 2002) with effect from 4
September.</p><p><a name="06072524000031">The
code provides clear statutory guidance on how local authorities should
carry out their homelessness functions and will assist authorities in
providing appropriate and effective responses to homelessness and
potential homelessness. It also complements other forms of advice,
guidance and best practice which have been produced to help local
authorities strengthenthe services they provide to help people
avoid homelessness, wherever
possible.</p><p><a name="06072524000032">The
revised code strengthens the guidance on dealing with vulnerable
groups, including people fleeing violence and families with children.
It also includes stronger guidance on preventing homelessness, on
providing a wide range of housing options, and limiting the use of bed
and breakfast
accommodation.</p><p><a name="06072524000033">Copies
of the revised Homelessness Code of Guidance for Local Authorities is

the impact upon policy formulation by Government, the myths and
misperceptions that have grown up around the Act and proposals for the
way
forward.</p></ul><a name="06072524000036"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
Government remain fully committed both to the European Convention on

central
Government.</p></ul><a name="06072524000037"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
Government will take forward a number of actions to address areas of
concern highlighted by the review. The Government are conducting a
thorough review of how police, probation, parole and prison services
balance public protection and individual and collective rights and, if
necessary, will legislate to ensure that public protection is given
priority. Other initiatives include a major push for the provision of
better and more consistent guidance and training on human rights within
Departments; and a proactive, strategic and co-ordinated approach to
human rights litigation, so that it has the maximum possible impact on
future case law under the Human Rights Act. The Government will also
lead a drive to ensure that the public s well as the wider public
sector are better informed about the benefits which the Human Rights
Act has given everyone in the UK.&#148;</p></ul><br><notus-date day="25" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>25 July 2006 : Column 101WS</b><br><h4 align="center"><a name="06072524000014">Draft Tribunals, Courts and

Project</h4><p><a name="06072524000059"><b><a name="06072524000132">The
Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. David
Hanson):</b> The Government have received a report from the
Chief Inspector of Criminal Justice in Northern Ireland, Mr.
Kit Chivers. The report, &#147;The Causeway Project: A Short
Inspection&#148;, has today been
published.</p><p><a name="06072524000060">The
Government warmly welcome this report, and thanks the chief inspector
and his team for the evident care and reflection which has gone into
producing this work. The criminal justice organisations are actively
considering the report and have already taken some actions in line with
the
recommendations.</p><p><a name="06072524000061">Copies
of the chief inspector&#146;s report have been placed in the
Library.</p><p><a name="06072524000062"><i>Community-based
Restorative
Justice</i></p><p><a name="06072524000063">The
House will recall that in December 2005, I published for consultation
draft guidelines setting out a 
<br><notus-date day="25" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>25 July 2006 : Column 104WS</b><br>proposed framework regulating the community-based restorative justice
schemes that are currently operating in Northern Ireland.</p><p><a name="06072524000064">That period of
consultation afforded the opportunity for all interested parties to
make their views known to Government and generated responses from 56
organisations and individuals across the statutory and voluntary
sectors as well as from members of the public. The consultation
revealed general support for restorative justice as a concept but
highlighted serious concerns about the way in which some key aspects of
schemes might operate. It was clear from the strong criticisms that the
draft guidelines did not get it right and so today I am publishing a
robust new protocol to address those
concerns.</p><p><a name="06072524000065">The
Government have always been clear that where community-based
restorative justice schemes operate they must be part of the criminal
justice system and must not act, or be perceived to act, as an
alternative to the existing policing structures. Society would not
tolerate officially approved schemes becoming a tool for local
paramilitary control and neither will the
Government.</p><p><a name="06072524000066">The
regulation of community-based restorative justice in Northern Ireland
was a key recommendation of the Criminal Justice Review which itself
was central to the Good Friday
Agreement.</p><p><a name="06072524000067">I
have today published that revised framework which I have renamed a
&#147;Protocol for Community-based Restorative Justice
Schemes&#148; to affirm its status, not simply as guidelines, but as
a document which requires full compliance by all participants and which
effectively sets a &#145;gold standard&#146; for schemes. I have
placed a copy of the protocol in the Library of the
House.</p><p><a name="06072524000068">The
protocol contains a number of important changes which will, I believe,
substantively address the four keys issues of concern raised by
respondents during the consultation. Those concerns centred on: the
ability for schemes to use third parties to distance themselves from
direct engagement with the police; arrangements for determining the
suitability of persons working in schemes; the need for a robust
independent complaints mechanism; and the need to set demanding
standards for schemes underpinned by an effective inspection
regime.</p><p><a name="06072524000069">As
a consequence of those concerns I
have:</p><a name="06072524000120"><ul><p class="tabletext">Removed
the provision for schemes to report offences to the Police Service of
Northern Ireland through a third party. The protocol now requires that
schemes engage, and have a direct relationship, with police on all
matters governed by the protocol. The centrality of the police to the
way in which schemes operate is
non-negotiable.</p></ul><a name="06072524000121"><ul><p class="tabletext">Agreed
arrangements for a panel, comprising representatives of relevant
statutory bodies, to determine the suitability of individuals to work
in posts governed by the protocol. The panel will consider criminal
records and other pertinent information provided by statutory agencies,
including the police, in determining the suitability of any individual
in accordance with published criteria contained in the
protocol.</p></ul><a name="06072524000122"><ul><p class="tabletext">Agreed
with the Probation Board for Northern Ireland that they will establish
an independent complaints mechanism for victims and offenders who may
have cause to raise concerns about how a scheme has handled their
case.</p></ul><br><notus-date day="25" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>25 July 2006 : Column 105WS</b><br><a name="06072524000123"><ul><p class="tabletext">Ensured that the new
protocol sets exacting standards which schemes must meet to achieve
accreditation, with continued compliance tested by a rigorous, regular
and unannounced inspection regime undertaken by the Criminal Justice
Inspectorate who shall publish their inspection reports.</p></ul><p><a name="06072524000070">The
protocol would establish the relationship between schemes and the
criminal justice system in dealing with low-level criminal offences and
offenders and, by definition, governs cases which have both achieved
the criminal threshold and been deemed suitable by the Public
Prosecution Service for referral for a restorative disposal. While the
protocol cannot therefore formally extend to schemes&#146; other
activities, as part of the inspection regime records on non-criminal
cases handled by schemes will be examined to help ensure that all cases
attaining the criminal threshold have been referred to the police.
Schemes which achieve accreditation will, as organisations, have
demonstrated the attainment of the high standards required in the
protocol which I expect to see reflected in all aspects of their
activities.</p><p><a name="06072524000071">Due
to the significant nature of the changes I want to allow for a further
period of consultation on the new protocol, which will run in parallel
with an Equality Impact Assessment to explore the potential for any of
its measures to adversely impact on equality of opportunity for any of
the nine categories set out in section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act
1998. This will be launched shortly and will involve at 12-week public
consultation
period.</p><p><a name="06072524000072">It
has never been a direct corollary that schemes which sigh up to the
protocol will receive NIO funding. However I expect that accredited
schemes meeting the exacting standards set out in the protocol should
be in the best position, where they meet the appropriate grant
criteria, to apply for funding from whatever statutory or charitable
sources are currently available to them. Conversely any scheme which
does not sigh up to them will not receive any funding whatsoever from
Government for community-based restorative
justice.</p><p><a name="06072524000073">I
hope that the revised protocol can provide an effective way forward but
I am keen to hear the views of all the stakeholders and interested
parties during the consultation
period.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06072524000007">Prime

statement:</p><a name="06072524000080"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Government announced on 22 March 2006 a consultation on a proposal to
create a Large Facilities Council. The consultation was announced in
the document Science and Innovation Investment Framework 2004-2014:
Next Steps, and the Government asked for responses on two principal
questions as
follows:</p></ul><a name="06072524000081"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
Government would welcome views on whether all large facilities
operations should be integrated under a new Large Facilities Council,
or whether there is a case for some facilities to remain under the
management of other Research
Councils.</p></ul><a name="06072524000086"><ul><p class="tabletext">Furthermore,
in the event of a merger, should the grant-giving functions of the
Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC) be moved to the
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council
(EPSRC)?</p></ul><a name=""><ul><p class="tabletext">Following this consultation, which closed on
16 June, the Government have decided to create a new Large Facilities
Council by merging the current responsibilities of the Particle Physics
and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC), and the Council for the Central
Laboratory of the Research Councils (CCLRC). PPARC's grant-giving
functions will not be transferred to the Engineering and Physical
Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). Responsibility for nuclear physics
will be transferred from EPSRC to the new Council. The Government aim
to set up the new Council so that it can take on its new functions by 1
April 2007&#148;.</p></ul><br><notus-date day="25" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>25 July 2006 : Column 107WS</b><br><h4 align="center"><a name="06072524000023">Waste Electrical and Electronic
Equipment
Directive</h4><p><a name="06072524000091"><b><a name="06072524000136">The
Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):</b> I have today
published a consultation document on the Government&#146;s proposals
to implement the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive
(the WEEE
Directive).</p><p><a name="06072524000092">The
Government are firmly committed to sustainable development and
recognises that effective implementation of the WEEE directive has a
key role to play in achieving this goal. Electrical and electronic
equipment is the fastest growing category of waste across the European
Union, with an estimated 17 to20 kg per person produced every
year. The UK alone generated around 1 million tonnes of WEEE last year.
By ensuring that WEEE is treated, recycled and disposed of to high
environmental standards as required by the directive, we protect the
environment and human health from the risk of hazardous
contamination.</p><p><a name="06072524000093">The
proposals published today follow on from the implementation review
announced last December, and have been developed through extensive
consultation with companies and other interested parties who will be
directly affected by the new regulations. They represent a balance of
controls needed to identify and discourage free-riders and give
companies the freedom to find the most cost-effective routes to meet
their obligations.</p><p><a name="06072524000094">The
intention is, subject to the outcome of public consultation, that the
directive should be transported into UK law early in 2007, leading to
full implementation on 1 July 2007.</p><br><notus-date day="25" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>25 July 2006 : Column 108WS</b><br><p><a name="06072524000095">The consultation document will
be placed on the DTI website so that it is available to the wider
public. The consultation period will run for 12 weeks, with a closing
date for comments of 17 October 2006. Copies of the consultation
document have been placed in the Libraries of both
Houses.</p><h4 align="center"><a name="06072524000024">Unfair Terms in
Contracts</h4><p><a name="06072524000096"><b><a name="06072524000137">The
Minister for Trade (Mr. Ian McCartney):</b> The Law
Commission and the Scottish Law Commission published a report on unfair
terms in contracts in February 2005 (Law Com No. 292; Scots Law Com no.
199). It sets out detailed recommendations, together with a draft Bill
designed to produce a unified regime replacing the Unfair Contracts
Terms Act 1977 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations
1999 for the whole of the UK in a way that is much clearer and easier
to follow, and also addressed some gaps in protection that the
Commissions identified. I am grateful for the Law Commissions&#146;
detailed and comprehensive report and for their extensive consultations
on the issues involved, and appreciate their commitment to this
project.</p><p><a name="06072524000097">This
project was undertaken jointly by the Law Commissions at the request of
both the Department of Trade and Industry and the (then) Lord
Chancellor&#146;s Department&#151;now the Department for
Constitutional Affairs. The Government have carefully considered the
Law Commissions&#146; report and is content in principleto
accept the recommendations for reform. This acceptance is subject to
further consideration of the detail of the issues, and to further work
to identify potential cost impacts. The proposed legislation will be
subject to full public
consultation.</p>
