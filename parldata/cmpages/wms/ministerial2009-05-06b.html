<p><a name="st_104"><a name="09050664000022"><a name="90506m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="09050664000094"><b>The Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs (Mr. Pat McFadden):</b>
 Today we have announced our response to our consultation regarding the change of regulation relating to the use of service charges, gratuities, tips and cover charges in use in payment of the national minimum wage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="90506m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09050664000023">Since the National Minimum Wage Act came into force in 1999, it has created a level playing field for employers in the payment of wages and an essential safety net for vulnerable low-paid workers. Through this we have seen a better rewarded and more committed workforce who have been a force in driving up standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="90506m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09050664000024">Under the 1999 Act, the use of service charges, gratuities, tips and cover charges may count towards payment of the national minimum wage in certain circumstances. Some 10 years on, we believe that the time is right to review this practice to ensure equity for workers in receipt of the national minimum wage and a level playing field in the payment wages among employers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="90506m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09050664000025">In July 2008 we announced that we would be amending national minimum wage regulation to prevent the use of tips towards the payment of the national minimum wage. Alongside this we recognised a need for greater transparency for consumers about what is happening to the tips they leave.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="90506m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09050664000026">We have now consulted on these issues, and we thank all those who responded for their input. The majority of the respondents to our consultation supported the change. Taking this into account and evidence gathered as part of our impact assessment, we believe that now is the right time to make this change. It is our intention that from 1 October 2009 that use of service charges, gratuities, tips and cover charges will be no longer be permitted in payment of the national minimum wage. We will also continue to work with interested parties in developing a way of making information available to consumers. This will include a code of best practice for sectors affected by the change.</p>

 On 24 March I welcomed &#147;Keeping our School Safe&#148;, Sir Roger Singleton&#146;s review of safeguarding arrangements in independent schools, non-maintained special schools and boarding schools in England. His careful and thorough report showed that the current framework generally works well, but that there are elements that need to be reviewed and updated. Since the initial response was published we have considered each recommendation in more detail and consulted schools, Ofsted and the other independent school inspectorates about implementation arrangements. We are grateful for the assistance and support we have received from those organisations that represent schools covered by the review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="90506m0001.htm_para6"><a name="09050664000031">We have already accepted all the recommendations in the review, and our initial response set out the immediate steps we were taking to implement those things that could be done straight away. Our more detailed response published today sets out specific time scales and steps that we will take to ensure that, over time, every recommendation is considered carefully and implemented in a way that realises safeguarding benefits without imposing undue complexity, cost and bureaucracy. We will continue to work closely with key stakeholders in implementing the plan, to ensure that the strengthened arrangements set out in the report are realised collaboratively and in a way that recognises the diversity of the independent school, non-maintained special school and boarding school sectors.</p>

He underlined the progress that has been made and the positive difference that people working with children, particularly those most at risk, are making every day. But he was also clear that there needs to be &#147;a step change in the arrangements to protect children from harm&#148;. He challenged us all&#151;central Government, local government, national and local partners, and the public&#151;to do more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="90506m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09050664000036">Lord Laming&#146;s report set out a comprehensive set of recommendations to ensure best practice is universally applied in every area of the country, to strengthen national and local leadership and accountability, and to provide more support to local leaders and for the front-line work force.

Sir Roger will submit his first annual report to Parliament, reporting on progress nationally including the delivery of the actions we are setting out today, in April 2010.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government is publishing today the &#147;South East Plan&#148;, the revised Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS) for the South East of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="90506m0001.htm_para17"><a name="09050664000044">The South East Plan forms part of the statutory development plan for every local authority in the region and sets the framework for the production of local development frameworks and local transport plans. It is the spatial plan for the development of the region, and provides the policy framework for employment, housing, transport and the environment. The South East Plan is crucial to delivering the Government&#146;s sustainable communities and growth agenda in the region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="90506m0001.htm_para18"><a name="09050664000045">The Regional Spatial Strategy replaces Regional Planning Guidance for the South East (RPG9) which was issued in 2001. It also replaces a number of partial reviews to RPG9 that were carried out since 2001. The single exception is that the Part A Statement of the Milton Keynes and South Midlands Sub-Regional Strategy issued in March 2005 continues to apply. In the event of any conflict, the more recent document will take precedence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="90506m0001.htm_para19"><a name="09050664000046">A draft revision of the Regional Spatial Strategy was submitted to Government in March 2006 by the South East England regional assembly. This was tested by an independent panel at an examination in public (EiP) that was held between November 2006 and March 2007. The EiP panel&#146;s report was published in August 2007. Based on the panel&#146;s recommendations, the Government Office for the south-east issued the Secretary of State&#146;s proposed changes to the draft RSS in July 2008 and the public consultation closed in October 2008. During the consultation 13,654 comments were made by 5,672 people and organisations. In addition, a 1,700-name petition was submitted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="90506m0001.htm_para20"><a name="09050664000047">We have considered all of these representations. We have decided that no further major policy changes are required, although amendments and clarifications have been made to various parts of the plan. The result in terms of housing provision is that 32,700 dwellings are to be planned for annually compared with 33,125 dwellings in the proposed changes document and 28,900 in the draft plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="90506m0001.htm_para21"><a name="09050664000048">The plan therefore represents a step towards addressing housing need in the south- east though falls short of what is likely to be required in the longer term to meet the Government&#146;s Housing Green Paper target. I am pleased that the South East England Partnership Board are committed to carrying out a further review of the plan to consider housing growth, including taking account of latest evidence and eco-towns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="90506m0001.htm_para22"><a name="09050664000049">Copies of the South East Plan are available in the Library of the House and have been provided for all the region&#146;s MPs and MEPs.

We received responses from all English regions and we have considered, in detail, these formal consultation responses. This feedback identified a number of areas that required further development, which we have addressed through further professional analysis and direct engagement with the fire and rescue service community, the Chief Fire Officers Association and the Local Government Association.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="90506m0001.htm_para26"><a name="09050664000054">The headline messages from this analysis demonstrates that: the total project costs, which will be met by central Government, have stabilised at &#163;380 million; the project will deliver greatly enhanced capability to the fire and rescue service at no additional cost to fire and rescue authorities; and national Government will support the fire and rescue service directly through annual FiReControl payments totalling &#163;8.2 million once the network is up-and-running, which will be subject to a three-year review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="90506m0001.htm_para27"><a name="09050664000055">Taken together with the other elements of the Fire and Resilience Programme&#151;the Firelink radio communications system and the New Dimension equipment&#151;we believe that this provides a powerful platform for the modernisation of the fire and rescue service. We are committed to supporting the fire and rescue service to meet the challenges they face, now and in the future, to enable them to continue providing a world-class service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="90506m0002.htm_para1"><a name="09050664000059">I can confirm that HM Naval Base Devonport will be the main operating base for Amphibious Shipping, Survey and Hydrographic vessels, for the Type 22 frigates and, for at least the next five years, for seven of the Type 23 frigates. Work will be undertaken to look carefully at the nature of the less complex Future Surface Combatant variants and to consider the optimal base-porting arrangements for these vessels, taking account of similarities with existing classes. This work will help determine whether there is any case to change the base-porting of the Type 23 frigates. Devonport will also continue to provide world class sea training through Flag Officer Sea Training and will undertake Fleet Time Engineering support for base-ported ships and for visiting sea training vessels. Devonport will also retain and, subject to commercial negotiations, enhance its position as the centre of excellence for Surface Ship and Submarine Deep maintenance activity. Finally, subject to ongoing approvals, we will develop Devonport as the centre of specialisation for Amphibious Operations by moving 1 Assault Group Royal Marines, including the Landing Craft of 10 training Squadron and 539 Assault Squadron currently at Poole and Turnchapel, to Devonport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="90506m0002.htm_para2"><a name="09050664000060">Following on from that, HM Naval Base Clyde will become the main operating base for all classes of submarines, including the future classes of submarines, such as the replacement for the Vanguard Class, and eight Sandown Class Mine Counter Measure Vessels. Fleet Time Engineering support for these vessels will also be undertaken at Clyde. To reduce duplication of facilities and to provide future stability for submarine personnel, we intend to accelerate the move towards a single submarine operating base some six years earlier than originally planned, although there will be no base-porting changes for around five years. This decision will see three of the Trafalgar Class submarines transfer their base port to HM Naval Base Clyde upon completion of their respective mid-commission major maintenance periods. This is currently expected to be by 2017, while four will remain at HM Naval Base Devonport until their planned decommissioning dates (currently 2010 to 2017). We will ensure that the necessary infrastructure to support this move will be put in place.</p>

We remain committed to complying with legislation and Government policy and will be conducting further research, assessments and consultation before any final recommendations are made. We are on track to undertake a Strategic Environmental Assessment later this year, including a period of public consultation. After the Strategic Environmental Assessment it is also our intention to establish a demonstrator programme to optimise the process to dismantle and recycle as much material as feasibly possible from our submarines after they have left Royal Navy service, and to examine issues such as how to reuse the reclaimed material in the future. It has been decided, after consultation with stakeholder groups, that the project will be renamed the  <br>
