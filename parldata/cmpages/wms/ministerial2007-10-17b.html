 I can today confirm the new London Fire Brigade Regional Control Centre will be located at Morden, in the London Borough of Merton. This new control centre will provide a modern, effective control and mobilisation system that will help to protect the public in London, support the London fire brigade to save lives and form part of the resilient FiReControl network across England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="71017m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07101762000008">Working in close partnership with the fire and rescue service, the FiReControl project is a key part of Communities and Local Government&#146;s investment in the Fire Resilience Programme. To be in a position to make this announcement of the location of the London Regional Control Centre is testament to the close partnership working with both LFEPA and the London fire brigade in delivering this project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="71017m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07101762000010">These purpose-built regional control centres will be supported by best available technology, including:</p>
