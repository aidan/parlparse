<p><a name="st_123"><a name="10072727000030"><a name="100727m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="10072727000192"><b>The Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (Vince Cable):</b>
 The Government's decision to cancel the £80 million loan for a new 15,000 tonne press that had been conditionally offered to Sheffield Forgemasters by the last Government was taken on the grounds of affordability. Sheffield Forgemasters is a great British company with a dedicated, highly skilled workforce and a strong senior management team. The Government's decision is no reflection on the company's staff, directors or this particular project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="100727m0001.htm_para0"><a name="10072727000031">It is a worthwhile project, but when the coalition Government came into office they discovered that the previous Administration had allocated too much money across Government. In total, the previous Government approved £34 billion of new spending commitments between 1 January 2010 and the general election. It was therefore necessary to seek additional savings of £6 billion in this financial year. This meant that Ministers across the whole of Government had to take a number of very difficult decisions-cancelling the loan for a new 15,000 tonne press that had been offered to Sheffield Forgemasters was one such decision. The cancellation of the loan has not led to redundancies. In fact, the company continues to prosper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="100727m0001.htm_para1"><a name="10072727000032">Although the question of equity dilution had no bearing on the decision not to proceed with the loan to Forgemasters, comments made by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have been queried and I therefore wish to explain the position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="100727m0001.htm_para2"><a name="10072727000033">When giving oral evidence to the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee on 20 July 2010, I explained that there is an inherent problem with a relatively small company taking on a very big project. If the company finances the project with a large amount of debt it is likely to become so highly geared that its long-term viability is put at risk. If it funds the project with third-party equity, existing shareholders have to dilute their shareholding. This is not a criticism of the company, its shareholders or the project; it is simply a statement of the problem and it is something that the chief executive of Sheffield Forgemasters, Graham Honeyman, raised in an interview with the Yorkshire Post on 17 June 2010 when he made the following points:</p>
<a name="100727m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="10072727000169"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Private equity would take the whole of the shareholding away from Forgemasters and put it in the hands of somebody else. That is, not just my shares (49%) or the other directors, 65% of the shop floor own the shares in the company. The amount of money to put in to fund the press would more or less have to absorb the whole of the shareholding".</p>
</ul><a name="100727m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="10072727000170"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The reason why we went to the Government is the interest rates were reasonable. Bank interest rates are very high therefore we would have to make huge profits every year in order just to pay off interest on the debt. This is why we needed support from the Government".</p>
</ul><br>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="100727m0001.htm_para3"><a name="10072727000034">It is this dilution that the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister were referring to when they spoke in the House. The chief executive of Sheffield Forgemasters has confirmed that he is prepared to dilute his shareholding in the company in order to facilitate the project. However, it has also been clear that the shareholders would seek a fair price for any equity sale, and at this time their view is that their returns from growing the business organically are likely to exceed those from undertaking the 15,000 tonne press project if the purchase of the press was financed by substantial equity dilution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="100727m0001.htm_para4"><a name="10072727000035">On 20 July, Sheffield Forgemasters issued a statement in which the company said:</p>
<a name="100727m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="10072727000171"><ul><p class="tabletext">"We are still keen to undertake the 15,000 tonne press development but feel that the company's best interests will be served by suspending work on the project for the time being. The opportunities in global nuclear will continue to grow".</p>
</ul><a name="100727m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="10072727000172"><ul><p class="tabletext">"This pause will give the company, which has invested more than two years and significant funds to this project, time to resume a greater focus on growing our business into civil nuclear and other sectors. We will continue to pursue other development opportunities based around our 10,000 tonne and 4,000 tonne forging presses and our recently completed programme of machine shop improvements".</p>
</ul><a name="100727m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="10072727000173"><ul><p class="tabletext">"As our thinking develops we will of course take up the Government's offer of further discussions. The company recognises the difficult financial position faced by the country and accepts the loan offer will not be reinstated".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="100727m0001.htm_para5"><a name="10072727000036">The Government understand this decision and the company's desire to focus on other projects. We have made clear that we stand ready to work closely with the company as it pursues its ambitions and we are willing to look carefully at all proposals, as we would for any project, when the future availability of public funds becomes clearer after the completion of the spending review.</p>

 The coalition programme sets out this Government's ambitions for a low-carbon and eco-friendly economy, and to be the greenest Government ever. Substantial, and cost-effective, reductions in carbon emissions from buildings will be an essential part of our effort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="100727m0001.htm_para28"><a name="10072727000094">Much of that reduction will come from retrofitting the existing housing stock, but new-build homes will need to play an important part. The coalition programme commits to continuous improvements in the energy efficiency of new housing. We need to make sure that our homes in future are cleaner, greener and cheaper to run from the outset. We must also meet the challenge  to build more homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="100727m0001.htm_para29"><a name="10072727000095">We will therefore ensure that from 2016 new homes need not add extra carbon to the atmosphere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="100727m0001.htm_para30"><a name="10072727000096">Our approach will balance mitigating the impact of new development in carbon terms against the viability of that development. This will involve a flexible approach which sets an ambitious level of energy efficiency and carbon compliance measures in building regulations, and enables developers and local authorities, working together, to achieve zero-carbon. The role of local authorities is central in achieving real reductions in carbon emissions, and we will ensure that they will have their say when it comes to delivering zero-carbon homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"><a name="100727m0001.htm_para31"><a name="10072727000097">I am announcing today some important further steps on the route to zero-carbon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"><a name="100727m0001.htm_para32"><a name="10072727000098">First, I can confirm that we will introduce the minimum standard for fabric energy efficiency based on that set out in the recent consultation on the Code for Sustainable Homes. We will take this forward in the future revisions of part L of the building regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"><a name="100727m0001.htm_para33"><a name="10072727000099">Secondly, we will set a national benchmark carbon compliance standard in building regulations. I will need to be realistic and take account of costs. The Government recognise the challenges posed by the 70% level previously proposed and the case for this needs to be re-examined. Therefore, I am commissioning more work from the Zero-Carbon Hub to test what would be an appropriate level. I have asked the hub to report back on this as early as they can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="100727m0001.htm_para34"><a name="10072727000100">There has been considerable interest in giving developers the option to meet their further obligations through payments to fund local energy projects, possibly via an existing local tariff mechanism. We intend to explore the feasibility of this option over the coming months, including how the use of such funds for carbon abatement could complement the delivery of other types of infrastructure. We intend to ensure that local authorities have a prominent role in the design and delivery of funds that may be made available through any payment mechanism. We will work with local authorities and the house building industry to establish the precise details of any potential approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="100727m0001.htm_para35"><a name="10072727000101">To respond to these challenging new standards, industry will need to develop innovative and better integrated design and building methods and technologies; methods which will not only enable them to build new and better homes, but which will make our construction industries more competitive internationally in the coming years. To support these efforts, we will continue to work  <br>

closely with industry through bodies such as the Zero-Carbon Hub and I can confirm that we have made an allocation of £600,000 for this year to support the hub's work. We will also work with house builders to assist them in complying with these standards, and those charged with ensuring there is compliance, to ensure that energy and carbon savings are obtained.</p>

 National security vetting is a critically important control for protecting UK interests. It is important for our domestic security, for the protection of sensitive information, and for the protection of critical sites and individuals assessed to be at risk from terrorism. It facilitates information sharing with international partners, and defence and intelligence co-operation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="100727m0001.htm_para79"><a name="10072727000157">Vetting arrangements should be as transparent as national security considerations allow. Consequently, a copy of "HMG Personnel Security Controls" has been placed in the Library. This describes the vetting checks that may be made in order to safeguard national security. It describes a renewed emphasis upon a proportionate approach to vetting in terms of the application and decision-making process, to ensure that vulnerabilities are properly managed, subjective judgments are not made, and grievances can be heard.

 The annual reports of the Chief Surveillance Commissioner, the right hon. Sir Christopher Rose, (HC 168), the Interception of Communications Commissioner, the right hon. Sir Paul Kennedy, (HC 341), and the Intelligence Services Commissioner, the right hon. Sir Peter Gibson, (HC 342) have today been laid before both Houses of Parliament.</p>

The Government are committed to ensuring that public authorities only use these powers when it is necessary and proportionate to do so. The commissioners play an important role in monitoring the use of these powers by public authorities, and ensuring compliance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_414"><a name="100727m0001.htm_para81"><a name="10072727000160">It is regrettable that systematic failings have been noted by the Interception of Communications Commissioner in some prison establishments, and that a small number of errors have occurred elsewhere. As the commissioners themselves make clear, the details of these incidents cannot be disclosed publicly for security reasons. Following the practice of many years, my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for the Home Department, Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Northern Ireland and Defence have been provided by the commissioners with a detailed description of and explanation for these errors. The Government are satisfied that appropriate action has been taken to address  these failings.</p>

 Today the Government are reaffirming their clear commitment to disabled people by launching a new programme to provide support for severely disabled people.

It will sit alongside the Work Programme and will help into work disabled people who face the most complex and long-term barriers to employment and who may require high intensity support in the workplace.</p>
