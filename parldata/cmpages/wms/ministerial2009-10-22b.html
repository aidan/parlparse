 On 9 March 2009, I informed the House that I had asked Ofsted to carry out a survey of independent faith schools' work to promote pupils' spiritual, moral, social and cultural (SMSC) development. The purpose of the survey was to gather evidence on current practice with a view to considering whether the independent school regulations on SMSC are fit for purpose. The survey focused on practice in faith schools in view of the particular context a faith ethos provides.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="91022m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09102219000030">Ofsted has today published the results of the survey. It found that practice in all of the 51 schools visited was at least good with pupils demonstrating a strong sense of identity and belonging to their faith, their school and to Britain; and with a clear commitment to promoting the values of good citizenship. Ofsted has concluded that the current regulations are fit for purpose but recommends various ways in which we can work with the sector to improve pupils' spiritual, moral, social and cultural development further and support consistently high standards across the sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="91022m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09102219000031">I very much welcome the report. I asked Ofsted to carry out this survey because some concerns had been expressed about whether all independent faith schools were effectively preparing pupils for life in British society. While we will always take any specific allegations very seriously, this survey shows that the regulatory regime for independent schools is fit for purpose and that provision across the sector is good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="91022m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09102219000032">I would like to thank the schools and the representatives of different faith organisations who took part in Ofsted's survey. I look forward to working with them and with other practitioners from across the sector to take forward Ofsted's recommendations and promote excellent opportunities for all pupils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="91022m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09102219000033">Ofsted has made recommendations in three areas:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="91022m0001.htm_para4"><a name="09102219000034"><i>1) Provide greater clarity in the meaning of the five strands of the SMSC regulations.</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="91022m0001.htm_para5"><a name="09102219000035">The independent school regulations are designed to offer flexibility to allow schools to provide a distinctive education in line with their faith ethos while at the same time preparing pupils to lead successful lives as responsible citizens in wider British society. While schools want to retain this flexibility, Ofsted has found that they would welcome greater clarity about what is meant by aspects of the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="91022m0001.htm_para6"><a name="09102219000036">I will be setting up a new independent schools practitioners group to work with us on revised guidance to promote consistently high standards right across the sector. This will include encouraging schools to provide  <br>

pupils with opportunities to learn about the different cultures and faiths practised in the UK, alongside developing a deep understanding and sense of belonging to their own community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="91022m0001.htm_para7"><a name="09102219000037"><i>2) Encourage more interfaith and partnership working between independent schoolsand with the maintained sector.</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="91022m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09102219000039">Ofsted has found that some of the best practice occurs where schools work in partnership with local communities and with other schools to support the professional development of staff and build mutual respect and understanding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="91022m0001.htm_para9"><a name="09102219000040">There are lots of excellent examples of good partnership working already taking place. I have asked Pat Langham, Chair of the Independent-State School Partnership Group (ISSP) for that group to consider how the sector could encourage this further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="91022m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09102219000041">Around 70 faith schools from the maintained and independent sectors are already embarking on linking projects through the DCSF funded national Schools' Linking Network (SLN). Last week I announced an additional Â£50,000 support for the national Schools' Linking Network to work in partnership with the Three Faiths Forum to provide high quality advice and training for Local Authorities and schools to encourage successful interfaith linking projects and links between maintained and independent schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="91022m0001.htm_para11"><a name="09102219000042"><i>3) Ensure teaching resources are accurate and unbiased.</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="91022m0001.htm_para12"><a name="09102219000043">Religious Education (RE) has a very important role to play in promoting cohesion through developing understanding of different faiths and cultures and exploring the role faith plays in society, and it is important that teachers have access to high quality and accurate resources. In a minority of the schools visited, Ofsted found that while the pupils' understanding was good, there were examples of inaccurate or biased materials being used to teach about religions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="91022m0001.htm_para13"><a name="09102219000044">We know that the availability of high quality resources for RE is an issue in both maintained and independent sectors and I would urge all schools to review the resources they are using. As part of a drive to improve RE provision in all schools, we have commissioned Warwick University to carry out research to look at the RE materials that are currently being used. This work will help to inform work with the RE council, local RE curriculum advisors, teachers and schools to make sure that all pupils have access to high quality learning materials. We will publish this research in the New Year.</p>

 I am making a statement on the UK's bilateral agreement with the Government of Iraq on defence training and maritime support. Copies of the text of this agreement were placed in the Libraries of both Houses on 26 July.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="91022m0001.htm_para20"><a name="09102219000078">The House will be aware that the UK concluded combat operations in Iraq on 30 April, and that our combat forces were withdrawn by the end of July in accordance with our previous arrangement with the Government of Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="91022m0001.htm_para21"><a name="09102219000079">As the Prime Minister announced on 18 December last year, the Iraqi Government have requested our continued military assistance, particularly in officer training, naval training and maritime support. The two Governments therefore concluded an agreement concerning naval training and maritime support to Iraqi forces in June. Since then, the agreement has been considered by the Iraqi Council of Representatives and received its Third Reading on 13 October. The agreement will now enter into force once both parties have completed their parliamentary procedures and exchanged diplomatic notes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="91022m0001.htm_para22"><a name="09102219000080">My right hon. Friend the Defence Secretary wrote to Opposition spokesmen and the Chair of the House of Commons Defence Committee last month to explain our intention to bring the agreement into force as soon as the Iraqi Government are ready. Training of the Iraqi Navy has been paused since June, and it is important to resume this activity as soon as possible to ensure that they quickly develop the capacity to protect their own territorial waters and the offshore oil platforms which are so vital to Iraq's economic revival. A prompt resumption of training would allow our Royal Navy trainers, who have been held at readiness since June, to return to the task that they are so adept at delivering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="91022m0001.htm_para23"><a name="09102219000081">The agreement was published as a Command Paper and laid before both Houses on 25 September. However, due to our summer recess, it will not now be possible to allow the agreement to lay for the full 21 sitting day period before exchanging diplomatic notes. Since it is agreed that our training activity should resume as soon as possible, and having kept Parliament informed of progress throughout the recess, the Government intend to notify the Iraqi Government within the next few days that the UK is ready to bring this agreement into force.</p>

 In April 2009, the Secretary of State for Health asked Sir Ian Carruthers, Chief Executive of NHS South West, and Jan Ormondroyd, Chief Executive of Bristol City Council, to undertake a review of age discrimination and age equality in the health and social care sector, as announced in a written statement on 27 April 2009, <i>Official Report</i>, column 35ws.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="91022m0002.htm_para24"><a name="09102219000121">The review was asked to consider what health and social care organisations should do to meet the age provisions of the Equality Bill, currently before Parliament. The Bill outlaws age discrimination against people aged 18 and over by those providing services and exercising public functions. The Bill also creates a new public sector equality duty which applies in relation to age as well as to seven other protected characteristics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="91022m0002.htm_para25"><a name="09102219000122">The review was supported by the National Advisory Group on Age Discrimination, chaired by John Dixon, Deputy Chief Executive and Director of Social Services at West Sussex County Council.

to ensure immunity, rather than two as previously thought. As requested by the Council conclusions, the Commission would propose a mechanism whereby member states with surpluses of vaccines could make those vaccines available to other member states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="91022m0002.htm_para30"><a name="09102219000128">The Commissioner then noted that the joint procurement exercise for those member states without agreements with the pharmaceutical industry (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Malta) was ongoing and might be extended to EU neighbourhood or candidate countries.

She complained that the Commission and other member states had often heard about important announcements through the media, rather than beforehand from the member state(s) concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="91022m0002.htm_para32"><a name="09102219000130">The ministerial discussion focused on three main issues: communications with the public; work with developing countries; and cross-cutting multi-sectoral preparedness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="91022m0002.htm_para33"><a name="09102219000131">Most member states agreed that communications should be co-ordinated wherever possible, but noted that they would always have to be tailored to local circumstances. When policies or messages differed, it was important that authorities could explain to the public why this was. This was particularly true for the vaccination campaigns which will be launched in the near future. The UK, and other countries, emphasised the key role that the Health Security Communicator's Network, which provides a forum for officials dealing with communications to liaise with each other, has to play here. The UK also noted that it would be important for any EU-level communications initiative to support member state initiatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="91022m0002.htm_para34"><a name="09102219000132">There was also a clear consensus that work with developing countries should be led by the UN system, and the WHO in particular. Many member states noted that the question of aid was wider than only the supply of vaccines: the EU should consider how healthcare systems more generally could be strengthened. The UK encouraged other member states and the Commission to provide as much support as possible to the UN's urgent needs identification and prioritisation process for developing countries, and looked forward to the discussions on this envisaged by the Council conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="91022m0002.htm_para35"><a name="09102219000133">The presidency received clear support for the work they had initiated on multi-sectoral issues in the friends of the presidency group. In addition to transport, telecommunications, and energy, member states thought that business continuity in banking and food and water supplies should be considered. The UK said that it thought that this multi-sectoral work was essential and suggested two specific tasks this group could set itself:</p>
<a name="91022m0002.htm_brev0"><a name="09102219000191"><ul><p class="tabletext">in the short term, a report summarising the business planning assumptions each member state is using; and</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="91022m0002.htm_para36"><a name="09102219000134">The presidency welcomed these suggestions and said that the group would indeed take forward the work suggested by the UK.</p>

While the UK does not participate in the EU visa regime, we do maintain an interest in all visa issues, notably for full reciprocity with third country nationals. The Council will then exchange views on Canada's decision to reintroduce visa requirements for all Czech nationals.

This instrument will strengthen the network's ability to identify exchange and disseminate crime prevention information and actions targeted at traditional, or volume, crime.

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="91022m0002.htm_para42"><a name="09102219000141">In the afternoon, Justice Ministers will be asked to adopt a Council resolution on a "roadmap" for strengthening procedural rights of suspected or accused persons in criminal proceedings. The resolution encourages the European Commission to submit proposals, to be considered by the member states, for action to improve criminal procedural law standards across the European Union.

 Local authorities use the magistrates courts to enforce non-payment of council tax. This process begins with an application (called a "complaint") for the court to issue a summons informing the individual that the local authority is seeking unpaid council tax and asking the individual to attend court if they wish to challenge the court making a liability order for that amount. The issue of a summons for non-payment of council tax or non-domestic rates must be authorised by a justice of the peace or legal adviser with delegated powers from a justices' clerk. Fees are chargeable and the decision of the court at the hearing must be recorded in a court register.</p>

More seriously two magistrates courts, Rochdale and Salford permitted the local authorities to issue summonses requiring attendance at court without the authorisation of the court.</p>

<p><a name="st_70"><a name="09102219000151"><a name="91022m0003.htm_spmin1"><a name="09102219000203"><b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Mr. Michael Wills):</b>
 Land Registry is today announcing a five-year programme of reorganisation and transformation that will cut its costs and put it in the best possible position to continue to deliver effectively the service its customers need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="91022m0003.htm_para4"><a name="09102219000152">Land Registry believes that the proposals will help create an organisation that can meet the challenges of a developing property market, that can live within its means and that can continue to provide an outstanding service to its customers. Having looked at a range of possibilities it is proposing to close five local offices and to reduce staff numbers to reflect more efficient working practices. It also intends to embark on a programme of outsourcing some of its support functions and to decrease outgoings further by selling surplus property. These changes will be accompanied by a new customer strategy to ensure Land Registry continues to deliver services that make property transactions easier for all its customers and will also develop additional services to generate extra revenue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="91022m0003.htm_para5"><a name="09102219000153">The "Blueprint for Land Registry's Future" published in 2006 recognised the need for it to change to become a smaller, leaner, more flexible organisation. Since then Land Registry has steadily reduced staff numbers but it now needs to move much faster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="91022m0003.htm_para6"><a name="09102219000154">Land Registry is proposing, in the first phase of its programme, the closure of its offices in Croydon, Peterborough, Portsmouth, Stevenage and Tunbridge Wells, outsourcing some of its support functions and the sale of surplus property, including its current head office building in central London. Combined with a redundancy scheme for some clerical staff, Land Registry aim to reduce their total staff numbers by a further 1,500 people over the next year and a half. Land Registry will review progress in 2011. Subject to the outcome of that review they envisage the need to reduce staff numbers further resulting in the closure of two further offices in the second phase of the programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="91022m0003.htm_para7"><a name="09102219000155">The proposals announced today, which have been developed by the Land Registry working with the Operational Efficiency Programme, have been accelerated by the property slump-which drastically cut Land Registry's work and lead to a Â£129.9 million loss including restructuring costs in 2008-09-but they are not a knee-jerk response to it. They will however allow Land Registry to respond faster and more efficiently to future fluctuations in the market. Building as robust and sustainable an organisation as possible will allow Land Registry to be proactive rather than passive in the face of market changes and to be in good shape for a recovery in the property market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="91022m0003.htm_para8"><a name="09102219000156">The proposed closure of the five offices will be very unwelcome news for Land Registry staff. Land Registry will do whatever it can to ameliorate the impact on their exceptionally loyal, dedicated and hardworking workforce. Unfortunately however compulsory redundancies will undoubtedly be necessary if the proposals put forward are confirmed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="91022m0003.htm_para9"><a name="09102219000157">Land Registry believes that the proposals will allow it to make far better use of its buildings and to create significant efficiency savings. Land Registry makes no call on taxpayers' money but they expect cutting their costs to allow their fees to be significantly reduced over the next five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="91022m0003.htm_para10"><a name="09102219000158">Looking ahead, Land Registry will continue to work with the Operational Efficiency Programme to identify additional opportunities to involve the private sector in its business whilst recognising that the creation, recording and guaranteeing of registered titles should remain a responsibility of Government. There will be a further statement in the pre-Budget report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="91022m0003.htm_para11"><a name="09102219000159">Land Registry have today published "Land Registry's Accelerated Transformation Programme: Consultation on Office Closures", copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and are available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>
