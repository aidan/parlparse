<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60503m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Mr. Ben Bradshaw): </b> 
 On 27 April the House was informed of the finding of avian influenza in samples from chickens on a poultry farm near Dereham in Norfolk. The strain was confirmed as low pathogenic H7N3 on 28 April. The Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) are carrying out further investigation before the presence of the high pathogenic strain in the flock can be completely ruled out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60503m01.html_para0"><a name="stpa_0">The Veterinary Laboratories Agency on 29 April reported to DEFRA positive results for avian influenza in free range chickens on two further poultry farms near Dereham, Norfolk. Further testing has confirmed the low pathogenic H7N3 strain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60503m01.html_para1"><a name="stpa_1">On all three premises the birds have been culled and disposed of, and cleansing and disinfection is being carried out. A 1km restricted zone is in place around each of the premises. Movements of poultry and poultry products may only take place under licence from the state veterinary service. The necessary surveillance is being carried out within the restriction zones and movements and contacts are being traced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60503m01.html_para2"><a name="stpa_2">A preliminary epidemiological report has been produced which has been published today, and copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. It sets out our current understanding of the source and spread of the disease based on the evidence available. The report concludes that it is not possible to say at this stage whether any of the three flocks was the index case&#151;other premises may be involved. It is also not possible to determine yet whether they were infected by a common source&#151;wild birds and other possibly infected premises are being investigated. However, the report does explain that it is likely that the first free range flock was infected around 20 March, some 11 days later the virus infected the second free range flock, and the housed poultry flock was infected between 15 and 18 April. Any links or movements between the premises involved are being investigated.
