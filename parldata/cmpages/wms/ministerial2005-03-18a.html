<a name="50318m01.html_sbhd0"><h4 align=center>Funding of Horseracing</h4>












<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50318m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Sport and Tourism  (Mr. Richard Caborn): </b> 
 It remains the Government&#039;s view that commercial agreements between the relevant parties provide the appropriate long-term basis for the funding of racing. However, in the light of a judgment by the European Court of Justice last September it has become clear that the British Horseracing Board is not in a position to proceed immediately with its plans to fund racing by the sale of database rights in place of the current statutory levy. Following consultations with the Horserace Betting Levy Board, the British Horseracing Board and the Association of British Bookmakers, I have therefore accepted the interim recommendations made by the independent review group, chaired by Lord Donoughue, that more time is needed to develop the commercial options and that it is in the public interest in the well-being of the sport that the levy arrangements should therefore remain in place for a further limited period. We will accordingly be making an order under part 2 of the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Act 2004 to end the levy on 31 March 2009, and to close the levy board six months later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50318m01.html_para0"><a name="stpa_0">I welcome the agreement of the parties that Lord Donoughue&#039;s group should continue to explore the commercial options, considering all areas relating to the funding of racing which it believes are relevant to establishing appropriate post-levy arrangements, with a view to preparing a final report this autumn. It will then be for the British Horseracing Board and the other parties to work towards putting agreed arrangements in place to meet the above timescale.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50318m01.html_para1"><a name="stpa_1">In the meantime it is important that racing continues to take forward the modernisation of its structures, with priority being given to the establishment of an independent regulatory authority.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50318m01.html_para2"><a name="stpa_2">It is also important that, both now and after the ending of the levy arrangements, there continues to be proper financial support for the advancement of veterinary science and education and for the improvement of breeds of horses, which are the levy board&#039;s other statutory purposes. I have therefore made clear the Government&#039;s wish to see the board, while it continues in being, take over the funding commitments previously given by the British Horseracing Board in respect of the Equine Fertility Unit and the equine genome project; to maintain support for veterinary science and education at 2.5 per cent. of levy income and for breed societies at no less than current levels; to take forward consideration of the establishment of a university chair in the field of equine veterinary science; and to complete the grant to the National Stud, for 





<br>&nbsp;<br>18 Mar 2005 : Column 30WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

which budget provision was previously made, on the stud&#039;s proposed re-establishment as an independent charitable trust.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50318m01.html_para3"><a name="stpa_3">I wish to place on record my appreciation of the work of the members and staff of the levy board, who have been contending with an extended period of uncertainty, and of their commitment to running the levy arrangements effectively for longer than had previously been expected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50318m01.html_para4"><a name="stpa_4">I am aware that other sports, particularly football, have also been affected by the ECJ judgement. I have met with representatives from the football industry and I look forward to working with them, as I have done with racing, as they develop their own solutions to the funding difficulties arising from this ruling.

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50318m01.html_spmin3"><b>The Secretary of State for Health  (Dr. John Reid): </b> 
 On 30 November 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 24&#150;27WS, I announced the publication of an implementation framework for reconfiguring the Department of Health&#039;s arm&#039;s length bodies (ALBs) and achieving its three overarching objectives:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">A 50 per cent. reduction in the number of ALBs</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">A saving in expenditure by ALBs of &#163;0.5 billion by 2007&#150;08; and</p>

<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">A reduction in posts of 25 per cent in the same period.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50318m01.html_para12"><a name="stpa_12">The ALB change programme is part of a wider programme to improve efficiency and cut bureaucracy in the management of the National Health Service. The aim of these activities is to reduce the burden on the front line and free up more resources for the delivery of front-line services to patients and users. This wider programme is to ensure that the increased investment in the NHS&#151;42 per cent. in real terms from 2003&#150;04 to 2007&#150;08&#151;is accompanied by modernisation that cuts out waste.






<br>&nbsp;<br>18 Mar 2005 : Column 32WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50318m01.html_para13">Today I am announcing the achievement of a further milestone towards the ALB change programme&#039;s key objectives. In November 2004 we made the following commitment as a first step towards our savings target on ALB expenditure:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;Even with these new functions, which bring new costs, we will be setting the 2005&#150;06 budget for the ALB sector so that it will cost about &#163;100 million a year less to run than in 2003&#150;04.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50318m01.html_para14"><a name="stpa_13">I am pleased to report that I am today setting budgets for the operating costs of ALBs for 2005&#150;06 which will reduce Department of Health funding by in excess of &#163;150 million compared with 2003&#150;04. This is despite the fact that in 2004&#150;05 the ALB sector assumed new functions agreed by Parliament that increased the sector&#039;s costs substantially. A significant proportion of the savings generated in Department of Health funding will be redeployed for investment in front-line healthcare. We have additionally provided some &#163;50 million to fund one-off identified costs in ALBs. This includes initiatives which will deliver savings in future years and enable us to continue the downward trend in operating costs for the ALB sector when we set budgets for 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50318m01.html_para15"><a name="stpa_14">In setting the 2005&#150;06 budgets, we have:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">Invested in ALBs which deliver front-line healthcare, like the National Blood Authority (an increase in Department of Health funding of more than &#163;38 million over 2003&#150;04), or carry out crucial work to protect public health, like the Health Protection Agency (an increase in Department of Health funding of more than &#163;36 million over 2003&#150;04).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">Achieved the greatest savings in ALBs which provide central services to front-line NHS organisations. The reduction in Department of Health funding for this group of ALBs comes to more than &#163;220 million compared to 2003&#150;04 and provides a lower cost-base for overheads in future years.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">Met our commitment that spending on ALBs undertaking inspection and regulation will not exceed 0.4 per cent. per cent. of the national spend on the NHS and social care, and made progress on our policy of full cost recovery for work relating to the independent health and social care sector.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50318m01.html_para16"><a name="stpa_15">Alongside these savings, we are also on course for ALBs to generate very substantial savings for the NHS front line by improving the efficiency of the services they provide centrally on behalf of the NHS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50318m01.html_para17"><a name="stpa_16">We expect to generate further savings of over &#163;100 million in 2005&#150;06 from new national framework agreements let by the NHS purchasing and supply agency (PASA) alone. This follows savings of over &#163;25 million in 2004&#150;05. PASA is on target to achieve savings of &#163;240 million per annum by 2007&#150;08 for the NHS. Work is also under way to deliver efficiencies in the services offered by other ALBs. Taken together, this puts us well on course to meet or exceed our commitment to deliver &#163;250 million to the front line by the end of 2007&#150;08 through efficiencies generated by ALBs, as promised in the 30 November 2004 implementation framework.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50318m01.html_para18"><a name="stpa_17">The major reconfiguration of individual ALBs is also on course. The total number of ALBs will have reduced from 38 in 2003&#150;04 to 34 on 1 April and is on course to reduce further to 31 by 1 October this year. The changes are:

The total grant in aid provided by the Department in 2003&#150;04 was &#163;1,265 million. Therefore the 2005&#150;06 grant in aid is over &#163;150 million less than that included in 2003&#150;04 operating costs.
