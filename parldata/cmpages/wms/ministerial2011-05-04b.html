<p><a name="st_121"><a name="11050484000005"><a name="110504m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="11050484000048"><b>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr Mark Hoban):</b>
 The Government are committed to reporting quarterly on the operation of the UK’s terrorist asset-freezing regime. We believe this is essential to ensure transparency and accountability of the regime. The Terrorist Asset-Freezing etc. Act 2010 (the Act) has enshrined in law the commitment to report quarterly to Parliament on the operation of the UK’s asset-freezing regime mandated by UN Security Council Resolution 1373.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="110504m0001.htm_para0"><a name="11050484000006">This is the first report under the 2010 Act and it covers the period from when the Act came into force on 17 December 2010 to 31 March 2011<sup>(1)</sup>. This report also covers the operation of the UN al-Qaeda and Taliban asset-freezing regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="110504m0001.htm_para1"><a name="11050484000007">As of 31 March 2011, a total of just under £230,000<sup>(2)</sup> of funds relating to terrorism were frozen in the UK. This covers funds frozen under the UK’s domestic terrorist asset-freezing regime, mandated by UN Security Council Resolution 1373, and also funds frozen under the UN al-Qaeda and Taliban asset-freezing regime, mandated by UN Security Council Resolution 1267.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="110504m0001.htm_para2"><a name="11050484000008"><i>(1) UK’s domestic terrorist asset-freezing regime under the Terrorist Asset-Freezing etc. Act 2010</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="110504m0001.htm_para3"><a name="11050484000009">As of 31 March 2011, a total of 85 accounts containing just over £120,000 were frozen in the UK under the domestic terrorist asset-freezing regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="110504m0001.htm_para6"><a name="11050484000012">In the period 17 December 2010 to 31 March 2011, the Treasury made one new designation under the Act. The final designation was made in respect of the military wing of Hezbollah, including the External Security Organisation (ESO). This replaced a designation of the ESO only, extending the freeze to the entire military wing of Hezbollah.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="110504m0001.htm_para8"><a name="11050484000014">The Act contains a transitional provision that ensured that all designations made under the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2009 which were in force at the time the Act came into force remained valid as final designations under the Act until 17 March 2011, whereupon they would lapse if not already renewed. All 57 UK domestic asset freezes were therefore reviewed during the quarter to see whether they should be renewed as final designations under the Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="110504m0001.htm_para9"><a name="11050484000015">The review process was completed by 17 March 2011 and as a result of these 57 reviews:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="110504m0001.htm_para11"><a name="11050484000017">Maintaining a fair and effective licensing system is crucial to ensuring the overall proportionality of the asset-freezing regime, whether the individuals concerned are subject to an asset freeze in accordance with a UN or EU listing, or domestic designation. A licensing framework is put in place for each person in the UK on a case-by-case basis. The key objective of the licensing system is to strike an appropriate balance between minimising the risk of diversion of funds to terrorism and implementing asset freezes in a proportionate way. Licences contain appropriate controls to protect against the risk of the diversion of funds for terrorist finance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="110504m0001.htm_para12"><a name="11050484000018">A total of 12 licences were issued this quarter under the Act in relation to four persons subject to an asset freeze. Of these, two were new licences, whereas the other 10 were existing licences which were reissued under the Act so as to reference the current legislation rather than the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2009, under the authority of which they were originally issued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="110504m0001.htm_para13"><a name="11050484000019">In addition to issuing licences relating to a specific person, the Treasury may also issue general licences, which apply to all persons designated under a particular regime or regimes. Licences are granted where there is a legitimate need for such transactions to proceed and where they can proceed without giving rise to any risk of terrorist finance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="110504m0001.htm_para14"><a name="11050484000020">Six general licences that had been issued under the 2009 order were reissued this quarter under the Act:</p>
