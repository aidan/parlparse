 Today my right hon.

Copies of which are available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="80612m0002.htm_para5"><a name="08061274000088">We are determined to unlock the talent and potential of all our people. We therefore need to give people the skills that will be required in both today&#146;s and tomorrow&#146;s labour market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="80612m0002.htm_para6"><a name="08061274000089">To achieve this, we are extending entitlements to training for young adults in work and also looking at how everybody can have their own personal skills account so that they can get the training that they need and the jobs that they want.</p>

And they are also crucial to getting a better job too. We will now make sure that when people sign on for benefits, they sign up for skills as well. Increasingly, addressing skills needs where they are preventing someone from returning to work will be an important part of receiving out-of-work benefit.</p>

 In December 2006 we consulted on proposed changes to charges for use of the Dartford crossing to address continuing congestion pressures.
