 The recent flooding has brought widespread damage to large areas of central and northern England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="70717m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07071769000023">The Government are very grateful to the committed staff in schools, early years and childcare settings and local authorities who have worked so hard to contain and reduce the effect of the floodwaters, to get many schools and early years settings back in use, and to provide places in temporary or alternative accommodation where necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="70717m0001.htm_para1"><a name="07071769000024">In the flood hit regions, numbers of schools which lost teaching days included 91 in Kingston-upon-Hull, 72 in East Riding, 72 in Doncaster, 66 in Sheffield, 27 in Lincolnshire, six in Nottinghamshire, four in Derbyshire and two in Rotherham. Only eight of Kingston-upon-Hull&#146;s 99 school sites were unaffected:&#151;65 primary schools, 13 secondary schools, 10 special units and three nurseries were all temporarily closed. Nine sites were still closed last week. The local authority has found temporary premises for the children affected. Kingston-upon-Hull calculates that the flooding resulted in losing 107,000 pupil-days, but prompt action by the schools and council avoided losing-up to 90,000 more. In Doncaster, six schools were damaged and closed at some point&#151;but only one is still closed. In the East Midlands, five schools have all their pupils in temporary premises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="70717m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07071769000025">Our main aim is to help as many of these schools and early years settings as possible to re-open at permanent premises by the start of the September-term; and, where that is not possible, to help ensure satisfactory alternative arrangements so that no child suffers educationally because of flood damage. There is still an immense amount of hard work to do. The immediate dangers are over, but every child and young person and their parents will rightly expect no let up in efforts to get back to normal as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="70717m0001.htm_para3"><a name="07071769000026">To that end, my Department is working closely with the regional government offices and local authorities, to:</p>

The strategy also identifies new measures which modelling shows could help achieve significant health benefits and help us move closer towards meeting our targets.

to improve the way the police combat serious organised crime and other threats to public safety. All police forces will be expected to meet newly developed protective service standards.

The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police believes that it is necessary due to the enduring, vehicle-borne terrorist threat to London. The MPS requires bulk ANPR data from TfL&#146;s camera network in London specifically for terrorism intelligence purposes and to prevent and investigate such offences.

 I wish to inform the House that the UK intends to make a contribution of &#163;3 million to the Palestinian Authority (PA).

(TIM) in May, a &#163;1 million contribution to the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross and a &#163;15.6 million payment to the UN Relief and Works Agency in April, this brings the UK&#146;s total bilateral spend this financial year to &#163;22.6 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="70717m0002.htm_para5"><a name="07071769000109">The last year has seen a deterioration of the chronic economic decline in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Israel has withheld clearance revenues owed to the PA, leading to the PA having to reduce or stop entirely the payment of civil servant salaries. At the same time, the PA has run up significant debts with private sector suppliers. This has in turn reduced investment, thereby further shrinking the productive capacity of the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="70717m0002.htm_para6"><a name="07071769000110">Israel has now agreed to transfer the customs revenue, allowing the Government to pay salaries again. However, the large backlog of public debt remains unpaid. The Prime Minister, Salaam Fayyad, has requested international support to address this. Direct international assistance through the Palestinian Authority&#146;s Central Treasury Account will boost the economy and make clear international approval for Fayyad&#146;s Government. It will also increase Palestinian companies&#146; ability to continue trading, and so invest and employ more people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="70717m0002.htm_para7"><a name="07071769000111">In the last year, DFID has provided &#163;15 million out of a total of &#163;265 million committed through the TIM. This has successfully stemmed the economic decline in the Occupied Palestinian Territories from a projected 27 per cent. to around 10 per cent. The Quartet recently extended the TIM until the end of September. It has already been aligned with the Ministry of Finance to enable full salaries to be paid to public sector workers. Following the creation of the Emergency Government in June, DFID can now resume direct financial assistance.</p>

But ultimately the only way to guarantee the long-term welfare of the people is for all sides to give up violence and work towards a two-state solution.</p>

 The Employment and Social Policy informal meeting was held on 5 to 7 July in Guimarães, Portugal. I represented the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="70717m0003.htm_para0"><a name="07071769000254">The theme of the informal was &#147;Improving Policies, Improving Results&#148;, which was discussed in two plenary sessions. The discussions were informed by a paper presented by Maria João Rodrigues, who was involved in the formulation of the Lisbon strategy during the last Portuguese presidency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="70717m0003.htm_para1"><a name="07071769000255">Ministers discussed what the future priorities of the Lisbon strategy should be and how to make the Open Method of Co-ordination (OMC) work better. There   <br>

was broad agreement that the Lisbon goals were the right ones, and that next year&#146;s review should avoid major changes to the strategy, as continuity was needed and would enable comparisons over time. Ministers believed that the focus should be on proper implementation and better exchange of good practice. A number of member states did call for greater prominence to be given to the social dimension of Lisbon. On behalf of the UK, I made it clear that we should not re-open the employment guidelines and that the focus should remain on jobs and growth. I also emphasised that we needed to do more to tackle skills issues as this is the key to helping people into work and ensuring their progression.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="70717m0003.htm_para2"><a name="07071769000256">In terms of process, most felt the OMC was a success. There was broad agreement that there should be no new instruments or processes. Suggestions for areas of greater focus were: education, skills and lifelong learning; making flexicurity work; increasing labour market participation (including active ageing, work-life balance, gender equality, childcare provision); fighting child poverty; making mobility in the EU work; and tackling the social impacts of migration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="70717m0003.htm_para3"><a name="07071769000257">Germany also suggested a one off &#147;European Social Day&#148; where, for example, Parliaments across the EU could discuss the EU&#146;s contribution to social policies on the same day. The idea received considerable support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="70717m0003.htm_para4"><a name="07071769000258">The presidency concluded that the revised Lisbon process had improved the focus on employment but The meeting had highlighted the need to: have greater co-ordination of policy approaches; improve the integration and visibility of social priorities; and a balanced approach to flexicurity.</p>

 The review of Pension Scheme Assets led by Andrew Young published its interim findings yesterday on 16 July.</p>

The interim findings represent a significant improvement on our understanding of the circumstances of failed pension schemes and provide us with an evidence base upon which to build policy in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="70717m0003.htm_para6"><a name="07071769000263">The Assets Review has made considerable progress in identifying the value of assets remaining in pension schemes that qualify for FAS and has stated that the current process of annuitisation on a scheme by scheme basis may not offer the best use of these assets. It concludes that it is probable that additional value for money could be secured through a number of different methods and the team will focus on investigating the feasibility of these options before it delivers its final conclusions later in the year. I welcome these interim findings and am hopeful that the work that the review team is to continue over the summer will enable us to increase the value of assistance that FAS is able to offer without further calls on public funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="70717m0003.htm_para7"><a name="07071769000265">The potential for any increase will, of course, depend on the value of assets available.

the case. In the meantime the Government&#146;s position has always been (and remains) that trustees must act in the best interests of their members but, trustees may wish to take into account the effect that the decisions they take about winding up their scheme may have on the amount of assets potentially available to increase assistance levels.</p>
