 The Government are today publishing a statement setting out final proposals for additional powers and responsibilities for the Greater London Authority (GLA)&#151;the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="60713m0001.htm_para0"><a name="06071356000019">In November 2005 we launched a consultation exercise which looked at options for giving the Mayor a greater say in the planning and delivery of London's strategic services. The consultation exercise stimulated a great deal of interest and debate about the future strategic governance of London. We have carefully considered all the responses to consultation in deciding the final package of new powers published today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="60713m0001.htm_para1"><a name="06071356000020">The Mayor will have new lead roles in housing and adult skills in London, a strengthened role in planning in the capital, a stronger strategic role on waste, and additional strategic powers in a wide range of policy areas including culture and sport, health, energy and climate change, and appointments to the boards of the GLA's functional bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="60713m0001.htm_para2"><a name="06071356000021">On housing, the Mayor will prepare and publish a London Housing Strategy and a strategic Housing Investment Plan, setting out the priorities to meet the housing needs of all Londoners. The Mayor will decide the broad allocation of the affordable housing part of the Regional Housing Pot in London in line with the strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="60713m0001.htm_para3"><a name="06071356000022">On skills, the Mayor will chair a new Skills and Employment Board, in partnership with London's key business leaders, which will prepare an Adult Skills Strategy for London. The Board will be supported by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) for London,  <br>

which will sit within the national LSC structure and spend its adult skills budget in line with the priorities set out in the strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="60713m0001.htm_para4"><a name="06071356000023">The Mayor's planning powers will be enhanced to give him a greater strategic say in planning in London. He will be able to direct changes to boroughs' programmes for the local development plans they produce. The Mayor will also have a stronger say in whether draft development plan documents are in general conformity with his London Plan. Furthermore, the Mayor will have discretion to determine planning applications of strategic importance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="60713m0001.htm_para5"><a name="06071356000024">The Mayor will work closely with the boroughs in a new, London-wide waste and recycling forum, which will manage a new fund to improve performance and promote collaboration in waste and recycling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="60713m0001.htm_para6"><a name="06071356000025">The Mayor will make appointments to the boards of key London cultural organisations. His health role will be enhanced. He will promote the reduction of health inequalities in London, and prepare a strategy to tackle those inequalities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="60713m0001.htm_para7"><a name="06071356000026">Finally, the Mayor will have a new, lead role in tackling climate change. The GLA will be subject to a new duty to take action to mitigate the effects of climate change and adapt to its unavoidable impacts. The Mayor will publish a Climate Change and Energy Strategy setting out his plans for minimising emissions of carbon dioxide caused by the use of energy in the capital, helping to eradicate fuel poverty and harnessing economic opportunities for London from investment and innovation in energy technologies and energy efficiency. He will also publish a Climate Change Adaptation Strategy setting out how the capital should adapt to the effects of climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="60713m0001.htm_para8"><a name="06071356000027">We are strengthening the London Assembly's role. The Assembly will be able to set its own budget, publish an annual report highlighting its work and achievements and hold hearings with candidates for key appointments that the Mayor proposes to make. The Mayor will be required to have specific regard to the views of the Assembly and the GLA's functional bodies when preparing or revising his statutory strategies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="60713m0001.htm_para9"><a name="06071356000028">Arrangements for appointing GLA employees will change so that most appointments will be made by the Head of Paid Service. The Mayor and Assembly will jointly appoint the Authority's three statutory posts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="60713m0001.htm_para10"><a name="06071356000029">This package devolves powers from Whitehall to London wherever feasible. In specific cases it strengthens the Mayor's powers in relation to the boroughs where we are convinced that this will deliver better co-ordinated strategic services. It provides a robust and coherent set of strategic powers for the Mayor and Assembly, fulfilling the Government's manifesto commitment. It ensures that the capital has the strong leadership it needs as a successful world city to meet future challenges, including hosting the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. It builds on the success of the GLA to date, providing the Authority with additional powers to make a real difference to the quality of Londoners' lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="60713m0001.htm_para11"><a name="06071356000031">We plan to implement the changes as quickly as possible. We will introduce a GLA Bill as soon as parliamentary time allows, to enact any changes  <br>

<p><a name="st_48"><a name="06071356000033"><a name="60713m0001.htm_spmin2"><a name="06071356000083"><b>The Minister for the Middle East (Dr. Kim Howells):</b>
 Following the launch of the National Drug Control Strategy at the London Conference on Afghanistan in January, the UK continues, as partner nation, to support the Government of Afghanistan&#146;s counter- narcotics effort. This year&#146;s planting season pre-dated the launch of that strategy and, although last year saw a 21 per cent. decline in opium poppy cultivation across Afghanistan, this year it is likely that there will be a significant rise in cultivation. This is worrying and is due, in part, to a substantial increase in planting of opium poppy in the south of Afghanistan, including in Helmand province. But in areas where governance, security and levels of development have improved, there are signs that last year&#146;s cultivation reductions will be sustained. At the same time, the Government of Afghanistan&#146;s eradication effort has been more effective than in previous years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="60713m0001.htm_para13"><a name="06071356000034">The Government of Afghanistan&#146;s National Drug Control Strategy offers the best means to tackle the opium trade at its source. We are determined to work with the Government and people of Afghanistan to sharpen delivery in order to achieve sustained impact on the ground. In particular they will be focusing their efforts on targeting the traffickers and their accomplices who profit most from the trade. We will be assisting by helping to establish the rule of law across Afghanistan, which is essential to counter-narcotics efforts and to the success of the broader reconstruction process. The UK is working with the Government of Afghanistan and with other donors to develop new intelligence structures and to build the capacity of counter-narcotics law enforcement and criminal justice agencies. These efforts are starting to show results. Since August 2005 we have seen the conviction of over 190 traffickers, and a significant increase in drugs- related seizures and the destruction of laboratories. These actions are helping to disrupt the trade, forcing traffickers to move and store drugs in smaller quantities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="60713m0001.htm_para14"><a name="06071356000035">The Department for International Development also continues to support Afghan national programmes focused on strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihoods, including in Helmand province where my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development recently announced that the UK would contribute &#163;30 million to livelihoods activity over the next three years. Since April 2003 over 12 million labour days have been provided and over 8,000 km of roads rehabilitated. Almost US $70 million micro-finance loans have been disbursed over the last two years and US $180 million in grants approved to some 10,000 community development  <br>

This is in spite of the widespread damage to forensic evidence caused by the explosions and fires, and the dangers posed by the site to the investigation teams until well after the incident. The Investigation Board considers that enough is known to set out with reasonable confidence the sequence of events leading to the incident, though uncertainty remains about why the explosion was so violent.</p>
</ul><a name="60713m0001.htm_brev13"><a name="06071356000061"><ul><p class="tabletext">It is of paramount importance to ensure that all the lessons of Buncefield are learned to prevent recurrence of such an incident, and to ensure the maximum effectiveness of emergency arrangements if an incident does occur. The Board's initial report identifies several areas of concern, while noting the extent of the work already underway to address them. In particular, the Board welcomes the post-Buncefield programme of inspections being undertaken by the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency as the Competent Authority regulating Buncefield. The Safety Alerts issued on matters of immediate concern, and the industry-chaired task group convened by the Competent Authority to review the results of these initiatives, are also noted. The Board makes clear that it intends to focus on several broad areas of concern, and pay close attention to the preliminary conclusions from the different strands of work as they emerge.</p>

This work has been underway since before the Buncefield incident, but will take account of information and analysis arising from the investigation. Once clear conclusions emerge, the work will be the subject of consultation with stakeholders. Information about this was set out in a previous Parliamentary Statement on the 15 May.</p>
</ul><a name="60713m0001.htm_brev15"><a name="06071356000063"><ul><p class="tabletext">The investigation is continuing. Many people, not least the local residents and businesses directly affected by the incident, need answers to resolve the uncertainties caused by Buncefield. The Investigation Board is keenly aware of their needs, while ensuring the investigation is thorough and fully considers the implications of its findings. The Board is also conscious that in doing so it must not prejudice any future criminal proceedings, should it be decided that there be grounds to pursue them. The HSC and Environment Agency are now considering the initial report and the Board's early conclusions, and will ensure that actions identified are taken forward without delay&#148;.</p>

One key area in which Government need to do much more is the involvement of disabled people in the design and delivery of services which impact on their lives. The GDI&#146;s report provides information on our progress in developing a UK Advisory Network on Disability Equality, which will be established later this year.</p>

 As my statement of 1 February said, the Government set up the Review Group on Common Parts, during the passage of the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, to review the legal position in relation to alterations to the common parts of let residential premises and of residential commonholds and to make recommendations. The Government are very grateful for Members&#146; work on this and have published the group&#146;s report on my Department's website at http://dwp.gov.uk/aboutus/business.asp</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="60713m0002.htm_para0"><a name="06071356000074">This is an initial response to the report and covers the five non-legislative recommendations made by the review group. We are continuing to consider the complexities of the legislative recommendations, including with the devolved administrations, and will issue a further response as that work develops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="60713m0002.htm_para1"><a name="06071356000076">The review group considered disabled facilities grants (DFG) to be an important source of assistance for disabled people who need alterations made to their home. We agree, and have recently increased resources in England so that we could end the means testing of families where alterations are for children. DFG funding is already available for alterations to the common parts of residential premises, and this will continue. DFG resources have been increased significantly by this Government (in England from &#163;56 million in 1997-98 to &#163;121 million in 2006-07). The review group called for more money to be made available for DFGs and we will consider this further as an integral part of the cross-Government spending review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="60713m0002.htm_para2"><a name="06071356000078">In addition, a Government review of DFGs is currently under way following independent research and recommendations made by Bristol University. This review is looking to make the DFG process easier and quicker to use in respect of all alterations, including those to the common parts of let residential premises. As recommended by the review group, we are also considering, in the context of the review of DFGs, the merits of an increased role for regional housing boards in the provision of accessible housing and housing adaptations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="60713m0002.htm_para3"><a name="06071356000080">The review group recommended that guidance should be made available on making alterations to the common parts of let residential premises and of residential commonholds. This would inform landlords, commonhold associations and disabled people about the current law and other relevant issues, and help them resolve potential disputes. The inclusion of appropriate guidance in housing organisations&#146; publications about housing-related issues would be an effective way of disseminating good practice and, in particular, such guidance could encourage the use of alternative dispute resolution procedures rather than automatic resort to the courts where disputes arise. We will prepare such guidance in consultation with the devolved administrations and will discuss it with appropriate organisations. And, as the review group recommended, in considering responses to our consultation on proposals for England for a code for sustainable homes we will consider the extent to which it would be appropriate to incorporate guidance on improving the accessibility of common parts of premises in new builds.</p>
