 On 29 June 2010, the Minister responsible for defence personnel, welfare and veterans established a project team to identify and implement the most cost-effective organisational structure for the Army’s regional structure. The strategic defence and security review White Paper<sup>(1)</sup> (SDSR) directed that the four Army regional divisional headquarters would be replaced by a single support command and that at least two of the 10 regional brigade headquarters would close. This capitalised on earlier work which concluded that the rationalisation of the regional structure would principally increase effectiveness with the added benefit of saving resources.</p>

The new formation, commanded by a major-general, would be known as Headquarters Support Command and it would be based in Aldershot.  <br/>

The headquarters of 2nd and 5th Divisions will disband by the beginning of April 2012 although tasks will continue to be carried out in Edinburgh and Shrewsbury until the end of August 2012 when we expect HQ Support Command to achieve full operating capability.

            <p class="tabletext">Under any other business Council heard an update from Commissioner Dalli on implementation of the laying hens directive, which comes into force on 1 January 2012. The Commission was clear that there would be no postponement of the ban on battery cages even though at least 11 member states were unlikely to have complied with the directive by the start of next year. The Commission said it would exercise powers, beginning targeted inspection visits at the start of 2012, and would begin legal proceedings against non-compliant member states. While there was an argument that non-compliant eggs should be destroyed, this would not make political or economic sense. Instead, the use of non-compliant eggs would be limited to production of egg products within the member state of origin. There was no opportunity for member states to intervene.</p>

This new fund is closely aligned with the four priorities of the new strategic vision for volunteering for health and care. “Social action for health and well-being: building co-operative communities”, the Department’s new strategic vision for volunteering, was launched in October this year.</p>

               <b>The Prime Minister (Mr David Cameron):</b>
 The Government published the “Consolidated Guidance to Intelligence Officers and Service Personnel on the Detention and Interviewing of Detainees Overseas, and on the Passing and Receipt of Intelligence Relating to Detainees” on 6 July 2010. The guidance was subsequently made  <br/>

            <p>the subject of two linked legal challenges; one brought by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and the other brought by public interest lawyers on behalf of Mr Al-Bazzouni. Judgment in these two linked cases was handed down by the High Court on Monday 3 October. The Court dismissed the challenge brought by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, accepting the Government’s position that there was no material difference between “real risk” and “serious risk” as the threshold at which officers may proceed or must refer cases for more senior consideration, and that it was legitimate for the guidance to use the term “serious risk”. As a judicial endorsement of Government policy, this was an extremely positive outcome.</p>

               <a name="11111066000089"> The Court, however, found in favour of Mr Al-Bazzouni on his challenge regarding the lawfulness of the exception in the annex to the guidance which states that the following could constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (CIDT):</p>
            <a name="111110m0001.htm_brev3"> 
            <a name="11111066000095"> 
            <p class="tabletext">“methods of obscuring vision or hooding (except where these do not pose a risk to the detainee’s physical or mental health and is necessary for security reasons during arrest or transit)”.</p>

               <a name="stpa_232"> 
               <a name="111110m0001.htm_para67"> 
               <a name="11111066000090"> The Court considered that although the exception could conceivably operate lawfully (so that UK officers could legitimately proceed where a detainee had been hooded in accordance with the conditions set out in the exception), it was unworkable to expect officers on the ground to judge whether the detainees held by foreign liaison services came within the exception, and that the annex should therefore be amended to omit hooding from the ambit of the exception. The relevant section of the guidance has therefore been slightly reworked to reflect this finding. The revised version of the guidance has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

               <a name="11111066000091"> To be clear, the Government stand firmly against torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. We do not condone it, nor do we ask others to do it on our behalf. Officers whose actions are consistent with the guidance should have confidence that they will not risk personal liability.</p>
