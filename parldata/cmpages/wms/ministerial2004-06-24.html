<a name="40624m01.html_sbhd0"><h4 align=center>ChangeUp: A Capacity Building and Infrastructure Framework</h4>












<p><a name="40624m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Fiona Mactaggart): </b> 
 I am today announcing the launch of ChangeUp&#151;a programme of investment specifically for capacity building and infrastructure in the voluntary sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40624m01.html_para0">ChangeUp aims to ensure that by 2014 the needs of frontline voluntary and community organisations will be met by support which is available nationwide, structured for maximum efficiency, offering excellent provision which is accessible to all, truly reflecting and promoting diversity and sustainably funded. It sets out an architecture for how that infrastructure should develop and highlights key strategic actions that will bring it into being.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40624m01.html_para1">ChangeUp has been created in response to the <i>2002 Cross-Cutting Review on the Role of the Voluntary and Community Sector in Service Delivery </i>which recommended that the voluntary and community sector and Government together draw up a strategy to underpin the capacity of the sector. The Home Office has led on the development of the framework, which has included a three-month consultation period on the document <i>Voluntary and Community Sector Infrastructure&#151;A Consultation Document, </i>published in September 2003.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40624m01.html_para2">ChangeUp sets out the principal capacity needs of frontline organisations&#151;especially small and medium sized organisations. The main elements are performance improvement, workforce development and leadership, ICT, governance, supporting volunteers and financing voluntary and community sector activity. Each has a clear high level objective and achievable actions which will make a difference.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40624m01.html_para3">It also describes how voluntary and community sector infrastructure should be modernised and reconfigured. The emphasis is on placing the voluntary and community sector in the driving seat, helping it to work with public sector partners and funders to agree the best way to provide high quality and sustainable support to frontline organisations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40624m01.html_para4">Nationally, expertise and leadership in particular areas should be provided by &quot;hubs&quot; which will build on best practice and reduce confusion in the sector by bringing people together to provide strategic leadership, signpost organisations to sources of support, and act as beacons of good practice, reaching directly to frontline organisations to develop advanced thinking and good practice.






<br>&nbsp;<br>24 Jun 2004 : Column 86WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="40624m01.html_para5">The ChangeUp framework will be used as a planning tool for Government, funders and voluntary and community sector partners at all levels and in different sectors to develop further action and will provide a point of reference for future thinking.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40624m01.html_para6">Implementation will be underpinned by Home Office investment of &#163;72m of ChangeUp funds that will support strategic planning and catalyse modernisation of infrastructure provision to improve its quality and reach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40624m01.html_para7">Copies of the document are available in the House Library and on the Home Office website at www.homeoffice.gov.uk. A regulatory impact assessment is also available with the document.

<p><a name="40624m01.html_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Mr. Ben Bradshaw): </b> 
 I am pleased to announce today the publication of the &quot;Animal Health and Welfare Strategy for Great Britain.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="40624m01.html_para8">The strategy fulfils the Government&#039;s commitment made in the strategy for sustainable food and farming to work in partnership with industry, specialists and the wider community to provide an overarching framework for the development and implementation of policies in all areas of animal health and welfare. It is based on the public consultation launched on 15th July 2003 and has been jointly produced by Defra, the Scottish Executive and Welsh Assembly Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40624m01.html_para9">I have arranged for copies of the &quot;Animal Health and Welfare Strategy for Great Britain&quot; to be made available in the Libraries of both Houses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40624m01.html_para10">Copies are also available on the Defra website at www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/ahws/default.htm
</p>





<a name="40624m01.html_sbhd2"><h4 align=center>Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate</h4>












<p><a name="40624m01.html_spmin2"><b>The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Margaret Beckett): </b> 
 The Government are publishing the sixth section of the <i>Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate (Framework)</i> on waste today. This is available on the sustainable development in Government website. Copies of the website, on CD-Rom, will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40624m01.html_para11">The waste section of the <i>Framework</i> sets for the first time a Government wide commitment to reduce waste on the Government estate, and increase recycling and composting rates. It encourages Departments to purchase re-usable, recyclable, and recycled products; and return used products to manufacturers. This will make an important contribution to the UK&#039;s target on reducing waste sent to landfill, and will help deliver our commitment to moving up the waste hierarchy towards more sustainable waste management practices.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40624m01.html_para12">The <i>Framework </i>now requires all relevant waste management contracts to take account of measures and opportunities for reducing and avoiding the impact of waste, and for collecting waste management data. 





<br>&nbsp;<br>24 Jun 2004 : Column 87WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

Departments must draw up sustainable waste management strategies setting out how they will deal with these issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40624m01.html_para13">Our ongoing work on the <i>Framework </i>defines a set of cross-Government targets for sustainable development, and outlines the mechanisms by which Departments will be expected to achieve them. These challenging targets give a clear indication of the Government&#039;s continued determination to take a lead in the practical implementation and achievement of sustainable development.
</p>
