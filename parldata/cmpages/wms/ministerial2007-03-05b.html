 The Government today have issued a UK Government &#147;Sustainable Procurement Action Plan&#148;, which together with the HMT report on &#147;Transforming Government Procurement&#148; (published 23 January), provides their response to the report of the sustainable procurement task force, chaired by Sir Neville Simms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="70305m0001.htm_para0"><a name="0703052000013">The task force presented its report to the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 12 June. It set out recommendations in six key areas for achieving the Government goal to be a leader in sustainable procurement in the EU by 2009. DEFRA, HM Treasury and other Government Departments have worked closely together to produce a response setting out how Government will take this forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="70305m0001.htm_para1"><a name="0703052000014">The action plan sets out the Government&#146;s ambition to achieve a low carbon resource efficient public sector and actions designed to move towards this.

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="70305m0001.htm_para3"><a name="0703052000018">The consultation has confirmed that there is broad support for reform of the Prevention of Corruption Acts. The Government remain committed to a fundamental reform of our bribery laws and we shall bring forward legislative proposals as soon as we are in a position to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="70305m0001.htm_para4"><a name="0703052000019">It is clear that there is significant and influential opposition to the Government&#146;s draft Bill of 2003 and we have therefore concluded that that Bill is unsuitable for presentation to Parliament. However, no consensus has emerged from the consultation as to what the scheme of new offences should look like. There remains fundamental disagreement between stakeholders as to which of a number of differing models should be adopted. I regret to conclude that there is insufficient support for any one particular model to justify its being submitted to Parliament at this time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="70305m0001.htm_para5"><a name="0703052000020">The Government are therefore asking the Law Commission to undertake a thorough review of our bribery laws with a view to fundamental reform and in so doing to look at the full range of structural options for the scheme of bribery offences. Since the Law Commission last considered this area of law the context of reform has moved on. The Law Commission will take into account the issues and views that have emerged during the course of our work since the introduction of the 2003 draft Bill. This includes additional practical experience of UK law enforcers in operating the existing law and other countries&#146; experience of implementing international conventions in this area. We are also asking the Law Commission to look at the wider context on corrupt practices so that it will be clear how existing provisions complement the law of bribery. This part of the review will comprise a summary of provisions and not recommendations for reform. I have written to the Law Commission today setting out the agreed terms of reference for their review. A copy of the terms of reference is attached.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="70305m0001.htm_para6"><a name="0703052000021">We are asking the Law Commission to prioritise its review and to produce a draft Bill. We will make additional resources available to expedite the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="70305m0001.htm_para7"><a name="0703052000022">The consultation also sought views on a separate operational proposal to amend and enhance the Serious Fraud Office&#146;s powers in foreign bribery cases. This proposal was on balance favourably received. We shall take forward this proposal as soon as a suitable legislative vehicle has been identified.</p>

I welcome the fact that a UN humanitarian co-ordinator has been designated for Burma and that the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs will strengthen its office in Bangkok so that it can play a more active role in support of work in eastern Burma.

This directive is in part a response at EU level to the corporate scandals of earlier in the decade. It updates the provision on auditor qualification, ethics and registration as well as providing for external quality assurance, public oversight and investigations. There are also provisions for co-operation between audit regulators, both within the EU and with third countries. In respect of listed companies, there are new provisions on audit committees, and the oversight of third country auditors. Existing UK law already provides for many of the requirements of the directive, and only minor adjustments will be required in these areas. There are, however, some areas, such as audit committees and the provisions for third country auditors where new provision will be needed. The Government propose to build on the existing UK audit framework in its implementation of these provisions, and options are set out in the consultation document. This directive must be implemented in the UK by  29 June 2008.</p>

This directive was part of the EU company law action plan, produced by the Commission in 2003, reflecting issues arising from the post-Enron environment. The overall objective of this directive was to &#147;further enhance confidence in the financial statements and annual reports published by European companies&#148; (EU Commission) by improving access to reliable and complete information.
