 The Treasury has today published a discussion document on possible international options to reduce the cost to taxpayers of financial sector failures. "Risk, reward and responsibility: the financial sector and society" is a contribution to the international debate on the future of the global financial sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09121060000029">The document highlights the importance of the financial sector to the UK economy alongside the risks it poses to society. While some risk-taking is inherent in financial sector operations, the recent financial crisis has shown the high cost to taxpayers when risk-taking becomes excessive. The document considers ways in which the financial sector might contribute to the potential costs of any residual risks it poses to taxpayers and to broader social objectives.</p>

 This Government have transformed the provision of early years education and childcare in this country, increasing investment sevenfold since 1997 and creating a universal free offer for three and four-year-olds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09121060000032">As a result there is now nearly universal take-up of the 121/2 hours of free early learning and childcare available to three and four-year-olds, and we remain on course to extend the provision to 15 hours per week from September 2010. The commitment and endeavour of early years providers across the country have been crucial to this success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09121060000033">In 2007 we announced plans to introduce a single local Early Years Single Funding Formula (EYSFF).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para5"><a name="09121060000035">The necessary paving legislation for the EYSFF was included in the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009, which has recently completed its passage through Parliament. The introduction of the EYSFF was welcomed by Members on all sides of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para6"><a name="09121060000036">Our intention has been that every local authority should implement the EYSFF from April 2010. In anticipation of this many local authorities have been working hard to prepare for this and have engaged positively with local providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para7"><a name="09121060000037">However, during the summer it became clear that a significant number of local authorities were experiencing difficulty in developing their EYSFF. More recently, parents and providers, from both the maintained and the PVI sectors, have expressed concerns about the potential adverse impact on provision if the EYSFF is introduced now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09121060000038">In response to these concerns the Department acted quickly to survey all local authorities, to establish how much progress they had made. This was completed towards the end of November and found considerable variation in terms of their readiness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para9"><a name="09121060000039">The data and information we have collected now suggests that less than a third of local authorities will be in a secure position to implement their EYSFF from April 2010. While it is difficult to generalise about the underlying reasons it seems clear that some local authorities have experienced serious difficulties in obtaining accurate data from their providers, while others have simply found the task extremely challenging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09121060000040">I have therefore decided to postpone the formal implementation date for the EYSFF by one year until April 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para11"><a name="09121060000041">I have asked my officials to invite all local authorities that are confident they are ready to implement their new formulae in April 2010 and who wish to do so to continue as planned. These local authorities will be able to apply to join a pathfinder programme, which currently involves nine local authorities but which we will now expand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para12"><a name="09121060000042">This expansion will increase the capacity of the pathfinder programme to develop practice from which other local authorities can learn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para13"><a name="09121060000043">The Government remain strongly committed to the introduction of the EYSFF in all areas from April 2011. We believe that it is only through the effective implementation of the EYSFF that all providers across the sector can have confidence in local decisions about funding. This 12-month delay should provide sufficient time for concerns to be addressed, without incurring a risk of drift. It will also allow time for more dedicated support to be offered to those local authorities that need it in order to complete the development of their formula.</p>

 Today I have presented to Parliament a revised School Admissions Code ('the Code'). Subject to the usual Parliamentary procedure, this revised Code will come into force in February 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para14"><a name="09121060000045">This statement follows on from previous statements I have made accepting recommendations made by Sir Jim Rose from his primary curriculum review in April 2009, in particular those designed to help improve outcomes for summer-born children, by enabling them to start school from the September following their fourth birthday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para15"><a name="09121060000046">Sir Jim Rose recommended that, subject to parents taking into account their child's maturity and readiness to enter reception class, summer-born children should  <br>

be entitled to start part school in the September after their fourth birthday. This could be at part-time basis if parents prefer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para16"><a name="09121060000047">A study for the primary curriculum review by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found that admissions policies do matter and that, in general, summer-born children are slightly better off in terms of cognitive outcomes at Key Stages 1-3 if they start school in the September following their fourth birthday. The IFS study also reported that summer-born children risk being treated as 'immature' in comparison with their older classmates, giving rise to lack of confidence and low self-regard that may limit expectations of them and their expectations of themselves. Furthermore, a literature review by the National Foundation for Educational Research concluded that children who start school later will spend less time in reception class prior to entering Year 1 of primary school, and therefore they may lose some of the educational experience that will develop and prepare them for their school careers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para17"><a name="09121060000048">The majority of local authority areas already operate an entry point in September following a child's fourth birthday so summer-born children don't have the same education opportunities across the country. Implementing this proposal will therefore provide a fair system for parents, which also gives them more choice to meet their own child's needs. Research conducted by Sir Jim Rose found that 61 per cent. of parents of children currently in part-time maintained provision and 63 per cent. of parents with summer-born children would move to a full-time provision once offered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para18"><a name="09121060000049">The aim of the policy change is to enable parents to choose between school or other early learning provision for their four years olds. Some parents have a strong preference for their child's early years experience to take place outside a school setting. I am therefore also making arrangements to enable all children to receive full and part time provision in private, voluntary, independent and maintained nurseries from the September after their fourth birthday up until compulsory school age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para19"><a name="09121060000050">Parents who prefer to delay their child's starting school would be able to defer a school place until compulsory school age-as they can already do now. But it's right that all children should be in school-playing and learning and developing-from age five.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para20"><a name="09121060000051">The four years olds proposal is just one of many recommendations made by the primary curriculum review aimed at giving greater parental choice and improving transition and outcomes for all children, particularly summer-born children and vulnerable groups such as those with SEN, who Sir Jim felt would benefit most from starting school early. We are already reforming the primary curriculum to encourage a smoother transition from early years foundation stage (EYFS) into school by arranging the curriculum in six areas of learning (similar to EYFS areas of learning and development) and free it up for teachers. This supports my proposal by creating an appropriate school environment for all four years olds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para21"><a name="09121060000052">Continuing play based learning into primary schools and ensuring children receive learning experiences appropriate to their age and circumstances is a key feature of the new primary curriculum. Whether in  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para24"><a name="09121060000056">Importers, retailers, NGOs and consumers have asked the Government for clarity over the precise origin of products from the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs). The label "West Bank" does not allow consumers to distinguish between goods originating from Palestinian producers and goods originating from illegal Israeli settlements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para25"><a name="09121060000057">Rules on the labelling of produce are set by the European Union and require that the place of origin or provenance should be supplied on foodstuffs where omission of such information might materially mislead the consumer about true origin or provenance of the foodstuff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para26"><a name="09121060000058">Since the "West Bank" is a recognised geographical area within the OPTs, labelling produce with the "West Bank" does not infringe EU labelling rules. However, retailers have informed us of consumer demand for more detailed information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para27"><a name="09121060000062">Therefore, in March, the Government arranged a round-table discussion between interested parties to look at how retailers could make labelling clearer for consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para28"><a name="09121060000064">We have taken these views into account, and have today issued advice to retailers and importers. This will help them consider how best to respond to consumer demand for information about the origin of food that has been produced in the OPT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para29"><a name="09121060000065">The Government will keep their policy on labelling food imports from the OPTs under review, in conjunction with the European Commission and other EU member states, and in the light of developments in the middle east peace process. The Government believe that that existence, and continued growth, of Israeli settlements poses a significant obstacle to peace in the middle east. At the same time, the clear position of the Government is that we are opposed to boycotts of Israel or Israeli goods. We do not believe that boycotts help engage or influence Israel, or lead to progress in the middle east peace process.</p>

<p><a name="st_63"><a name="09121060000067"><a name="91210m0001.htm_spmin4"><a name="09121060000216"><b>The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Hilary Benn):</b>
 On 12 November, <i>Official Report</i>, column 32WS, I informed the House that I was confirming the designation of the South Downs national park and signing the orders which set the precise boundary. I am now proceeding to establish a national park authority for the new national park.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para31"><a name="09121060000068">On 16 July 2009 I consulted on the membership of the future South Downs national park authority, proposing that the authority should have from 29 to 37 members. I am most grateful to all those who have taken the time to submit a response to that consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para32"><a name="09121060000069">There was a diverse range of views expressed, not only on the size of the proposed authority, but also on its composition, and on the representation of those who live in and around the new park. Although several people offered views on how parish seats might be allocated, this is a matter for the parish councils within the park to determine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para33"><a name="09121060000070">The main reasons cited by those in favour of a 37 seat authority or larger were that it would enable proportional representation of all local authorities, as well as enable more "grass roots" representation with parish councils having several seats. While I understand the reasons for many respondents favouring such a composition, it is the case that, once selected to serve on the park authority, members are expected to act in the best interests of the park in its entirety, so any emphasis on weighted representation is not really consistent with that principle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para34"><a name="09121060000071">A number of respondents favoured a "medium" sized authority of around 31-33 members, in preference to the two ends of the range laid out in the consultation paper. While appreciating that this might draw together the best features of both a large and small authority, it would not be large enough to allow it to be fully weighted nor would it be small enough to minimise the additional administrative burden which a larger authority might create.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para35"><a name="09121060000072">Those supporting a smaller, 29 seat authority saw it as creating an efficient, cost-effective authority, with faster decision-making, and at a lower cost to the taxpayer. The suggested composition was generally 15 local authority, eight national and six parish seats. Although a smaller authority would mean weighted representation wouldn't be possible, it would still allow every local authority one seat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para36"><a name="09121060000073">A further option emerged in the wake of the consultation which is for a 27 seat authority. This is made possible because two local authorities have stated they wish to share a seat. This would reduce the minimum number of local authority seats from 15 to 14. As I have previously confirmed my view that local authorities should have an absolute majority, this would require the Government to respond to the reduction in local authority members by reducing the number of "national" members from  8 to 7. So the overall composition could be 14 local authority, seven "national" and six parish seats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="91210m0001.htm_para37"><a name="09121060000074">Having considered each of the above options carefully, and being satisfied that it would be appropriate for Worthing and Adur councils to share a seat, I have decided to opt for a 27 seat authority. In order to ensure that the national park authority keeps in close touch  <br>

 The Government have no higher duty than to protect the public. A critical tool in this is the warranted interception of communications that allows law enforcement and intelligence agencies to gather intelligence about those individuals who seek to do us harm.</p>

It has been, and remains, the Government's objective to find a way to make this possible. In February 2008, the Prime Minister accepted the findings of a Privy Council review, chaired by Sir John Chilcot, which recommended that intercept should be admissible as evidence subject to meeting nine operational requirements, which the review judged to be necessary to protect the public  and national security. He set in train the necessary implementation process and established an advisory group, comprising the right hon. Sir John Chilcot, the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith), the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), and my right hon. And noble Friend Lord Archer of Sandwell, in order to help safeguard intelligence capability and protect the public.</p>

both of the complexity and sensitivity of the work programme and the commitment and thoroughness of officials in undertaking it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="91210m0002.htm_para4"><a name="09121060000087">Any implementation of intercept as evidence must, as set out in the original Privy Council review, ensure that trials continue to be fair and that the operational requirements to protect current capabilities are met. As noted in the advisory group's interim report to the Prime Minister, reported in my predecessor's written ministerial statement of 12 February and placed in the Libraries of both Houses, there is an intrinsic tension between these legal and operational requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="91210m0002.htm_para5"><a name="09121060000088">The work programme set out to develop a model for intercept as evidence that successfully reconciled these requirements, based on the approach recommended by the Privy Council review. This model has been subject to extensive practical testing, with the close involvement of senior independent legal practitioners. This testing has demonstrated that the model, if fully funded, would be broadly consistent with the operational requirements. However, it would not be legally viable, in that it would not ensure continued fairness at court. This has been confirmed by a recent European Court of Human Rights case (<i>Natunen v Finland</i>). The result would be to damage rather than enhance our ability to bring terrorists and other serious criminals to justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="91210m0002.htm_para6"><a name="09121060000089">These findings are disappointing. In the light of them, the Government conclude, as does the advisory group, that the model does not represent a viable basis for implementation. However, the Government also share the advisory group's view that the potential gains from a workable intercept as evidence regime justifies further work. We therefore welcome the group's suggestion of three areas of analysis, beyond the scope of the original work programme, intended to establish whether the problems identified are capable of being resolved. These areas are to examine:</p>
<a name="91210m0002.htm_brev4"><a name="09121060000187"><ul><p class="tabletext">Further enhancing the judicial oversight available.</p>
</ul><a name="91210m0002.htm_brev5"><a name="09121060000188"><ul><p class="tabletext">Full retention of intercept material alongside alternative review requirements.</p>
</ul><a name="91210m0002.htm_brev6"><a name="09121060000189"><ul><p class="tabletext">Advances in technology which might make full retention and review more manageable.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="91210m0002.htm_para7"><a name="09121060000090">The Government agree with the advisory group that while continuing to seek innovative and imaginative approaches, these should not be at the cost of the operational requirements, and hence national security or public protection. I am grateful for the advisory group's agreement to continue in its current invaluable role and for agreeing to be similarly engaged on interception related matters that have arisen in the context of the Coroners and Justice Bill.</p>

 I have today given the Information Commissioner a certificate under section 53 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 ('the Act'). The certificate relates to case FS50100665 from 23 June 2009 in which, in my opinion, the Information Commissioner wrongly found that the Cabinet Office had failed to comply with section 1(1 )(b) of the Act by withholding copies of the minutes of the Cabinet Ministerial Committee on Devolution to Scotland and Wales and the English Regions (DSWR) of 1997. The consequence of my giving the Information Commissioner a certificate is that the Commissioner's decision notice ceases to have effect.</p>

The decision to exercise the veto in this case was not taken lightly but in accordance with the statement of Government policy<sup>(1)</sup> on the use of the executive override as it relates to information falling within the scope of section 35(1) of the Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="91210m0002.htm_para11"><a name="09121060000096">In accordance with the policy, my conclusion rests on an assessment of the public interest in disclosure and non-disclosure of these Cabinet minutes, and of the exceptional nature of the case. While the convention of collective Cabinet responsibility is only one part of the public interest test, in my view disclosure of the information in this case would put the convention at serious risk of harm. As an integral part of our system of Government the maintenance of the convention is strongly in the public interest and must be given appropriate weight when deciding where the balance of the public interest lies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="91210m0002.htm_para12"><a name="09121060000097">Having done that, and having taken into account all of the circumstances of this case, I have concluded that the public interest falls in favour of non-disclosure and that this is an exceptional case where release would be damaging to the convention of collective responsibility and detrimental to the effective operation of Cabinet Government. Consequently, this case warrants the exercise of the veto.</p>
