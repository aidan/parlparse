<p><a name="st_1"><a name="41124m01.html_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Keith Hill): </b> 
 I am announcing today the publication of a consultation draft of a new policy statement on minerals planning and supporting good practice guidance for England. The draft of minerals policy statement 1 (MPS1) sets out the Government&#039;s core policies and principles for minerals planning in England to be applied in the preparation of regional spatial strategies and local development documents and in considering planning applications. The draft good practice guidance provides advice on how these policies and principles might be implemented.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41124m01.html_para3"><a name="stpa_3">When finally published MPS1, together with the good practice guidance, will replace minerals planning guidance note 1 &quot;General Considerations and the Development Plan System&quot;, published in 1996 and equivalent general statements on minerals planning policies in a number of other MPGs. Draft MPS1 and the good practice guidance meet the commitment set out in the 2001 planning Green Paper for shorter, more focused planning policy statements separated from advice on non-policy matters.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41124m01.html_para4"><a name="stpa_4">Draft MPS1 takes account of relevant legislative changes since 1996 that affect minerals planning. It seeks to ensure that minerals planning and development is undertaken in as sustainable a manner as possible. It contributes to the Government&#039;s sustainable development objectives for planning and the creation of sustainable communities, by helping to secure the necessary supplies of materials, particularly for construction, while seeking to minimise the effect 





<br>&nbsp;<br>24 Nov 2004 : Column 2WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

of mineral working on local communities and the environment, and by promoting the recycling of suitable materials.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41124m01.html_para5"><a name="stpa_5">We intend MPS1 to be supported by a number of specialist annexes setting out the appropriate planning policy considerations that need to be applied to individual types of minerals in view of their differing characteristics. A consultation draft on the first group of these, to deal with construction aggregates, brick clays, building stone and onshore oil and gas development, will be issued in the spring of 2005.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41124m01.html_para6"><a name="stpa_6">Consultation on draft MPS1 and the accompanying good practice guidance will run until 28 February 2005. Copies of the draft consultation papers have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="41124m01.html_spmin2"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Keith Hill): </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has today published for public consultation, a paper on licensing in the private rented sector concerning the implementation of Housing in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licensing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41124m01.html_para7"><a name="stpa_7">This paper seeks to explain the Government&#039;s proposals for licensing in the private rented sector that have been set in place by the Housing Act, which has just received Royal Assent. In particular, the paper explains the Government&#039;s proposals for HMO licensing and sets out proposals for the secondary instruments required to implement these measures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41124m01.html_para8"><a name="stpa_8">The powers in the Act and proposed secondary legislation will require local authorities to introduce licensing for HMOs. Licensing will enable local authorities to:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">Ensure that landlords are fit and proper persons or employ agents who are.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">Ensure that the standards of tenancy relations management and property management employed by a landlord or agent are adequate.</p>
</ul>

This will require the creation of a culture for policing which can tackle crime successfully from the local, to the national and international level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41124m01.html_para13"><a name="stpa_13">The national policing plan will inform local planning and help to ensure that all communities know what they should expect from their local police force.
