<p><a name="st_2"><a name="0803313000083"><a name="80331m0001.htm_spmin2"><a name="0803313000169"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Alistair Darling):</b>
 On 18 March, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 53-54WS, I informed the House that the Government had formally notified to the European Commission proposals to continue to provide state aid to Northern Rock to support a restructuring of the company during the period of temporary public ownership. In addition, the board of Northern Rock plc set out in general its plans for the future direction of the business during the period of temporary public ownership. The Government&#146;s objectives in relation to Northern Rock remain the protection of taxpayers and consumers, and the maintenance of financial stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="80331m0001.htm_para7"><a name="0803313000084">The board of Northern Rock plc has today published its annual report and accounts for 2007. These show that the Bank of England loan facilities to Northern Rock plc as at 31 December 2007 stood at &#163;26.9 billion. Since then some &#163;2.5 billion has been repaid and the gross loan stands at around &#163;24 billion. These accounts also demonstrate that Northern Rock remains solvent and meets its regulatory requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="80331m0001.htm_para8"><a name="0803313000085">The board of Northern Rock has also published a more detailed business plan, which I have approved, based around four objectives:</p>
<a name="80331m0001.htm_brev16"><a name="0803313000086"><ul><p class="tabletext">Contracting to a smaller, sustainable business through a reduction of the asset base from &#163;107 billion in 2007 to &#163;49 billion in 2011, while maintaining on average around &#163;5 billion a year of new mortgage origination over this period and continuing to treat customers fairly;</p>
</ul><a name="80331m0001.htm_brev17"><a name="0803313000087"><ul><p class="tabletext">Repaying of the Bank of England loan by the end of 2010 and enabling the Government to release their guarantee arrangements gradually by 2011, subject to the Financial Services Authority being satisfied of the capital position of Northern Rock at that time. In the meantime, the existing Government guarantee arrangements remain in place. Depositors&#146; money continues to be safe and secure. Retail deposits are projected to increase to &#163;20 billion by 2011 providing closer to half the company's funding needs&#151;but in total will remain below 2007 levels;</p>
</ul><a name="80331m0001.htm_brev18"><a name="0803313000088"><ul><p class="tabletext">Restructuring the organisation and its operations so that these are aligned to the business objectives;</p>
</ul><a name="80331m0001.htm_brev19"><a name="0803313000089"><ul><p class="tabletext">Strengthening risk management in key business areas.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="80331m0001.htm_para9"><a name="0803313000090">This business plan meets the Government&#146;s objectives. As set out in the Budget, the Government will, during 2008-09, replace the Bank of England&#146;s loan to Northern Rock with direct Treasury funding. The Bank of England and the Treasury are agreeing with Northern Rock the terms of this financing. This will include a back-up liquidity facility, to meet the Financial Services Authority&#146;s requirements, that may remain in place beyond 2010 until sufficient alternative liquidity arrangements are in place. Northern Rock will maintain, but contract over time, its Granite securitisation vehicle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="80331m0001.htm_para10"><a name="0803313000091">Furthermore Northern Rock has published as part of its business plan a competitive framework, which is subject to European Commission approval, setting out its commitment not to take unfair advantage of Government support during the state aid period. It will commit to a series of steps, in particular Northern Rock will restrict itself from positions of market leadership on any product category for 2008.</p>

 I am today publishing a consultation document, &#147;Promoting Achievement, Valuing Success: A Strategy for 14-19 Qualifications&#148;. Building on the aim that we set out in the Children&#146;s Plan for a world-class education system for all 14-19 year olds, this strategy will help to ensure that we can unlock the talent of every young person&#151;enabling all teenagers to pursue qualifications that are understood and valued and allow them to achieve and succeed. This strategy builds on the advice we have received from a group of independent experts from all parts of the education sector and employers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="80331m0001.htm_para13"><a name="0803313000095">The current qualification system is overly complex&#151;it is often difficult for young people and their advisers to understand which will best meet their needs and support their aspirations. Not every qualification option has clear progression routes to further study or to skilled employment. Not all the qualifications currently on offer enable young people to develop all the skills and knowledge they need, and that employers and universities want. We want a more comprehensive and coherent qualifications for young people, supporting better progression through a set of clear, well-valued qualification choices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="80331m0001.htm_para14"><a name="0803313000096">Building on the vision set out in the 2005 White Paper, &#147;14-19 Education and Skills&#148;, there will be four key national qualification routes: GCSEs and A levels; Diplomas; Apprenticeships; and the Foundation Learning Tier. These will offer a range of choices from general education to job-specific learning, and will support young people of all abilities throughout the country. This clear new offer will build on the best of existing provision, but will also secure a coherent system of 14-19 education that is truly fit for the future, with the flexibility to meet the needs and aspirations of each and every young person. We have said that we will conduct a first full review in 2013 to consider how diplomas, GCSEs and A levels and any other general qualifications publicly funded for young people at that point, are combining to meet the needs of young people, employers and universities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="80331m0001.htm_para15"><a name="0803313000097">These proposals are an essential part of our plans to raise the education and training leaving age to 18, so that all young people have the right skills to meet the demands of a rapidly changing world and can continue learning throughout life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="80331m0001.htm_para16"><a name="0803313000098">Some key elements of the strategy are as follows:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="80331m0001.htm_para17"><a name="0803313000099">We will simplify the system, with a new process to bring in the best of existing qualifications, while building towards the more streamlined offer;</p>

Department has already put in place and the further action we are planning to take in order to make children safer and to tackle all forms of abuse, including domestic violence and forced marriage. It also addressed the specific questions asked by the Select Committee on action to safeguard children and young people from forced marriage and how this relates to the local authority duty to make arrangements to establish the identities of children not receiving a suitable education. This was informed by data gathered from 14 local authority areas, via Government Offices. The Committee has placed my letter in full in the public domain.</p>

We will draw on our recent data gathering exercise which indicates that a range of different approaches can be effective.</p>
