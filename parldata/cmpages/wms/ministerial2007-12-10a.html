That is why an investigation was instigated into the collapse of Farepak, within days of the appointment of administrators.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="71210m0001.htm_para56"><a name="0712107000084">Whilst the companies investigation branch completes 90 per cent. of its investigations within six months, the investigation into Farepak has regrettably taken longer because of the huge number of documents that have had to be analysed, the inter-company relationships and the numerous parties to be interviewed. The investigators (CIB staff with long experience of these types of investigations) have compulsory powers&#151;those facing questions must answer them or face court proceedings. These powers are certainly wide enough to embrace all those who have had dealings with Farepak, including its bankers and advisers. It is anticipated that the investigation will be completed early next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="71210m0001.htm_para57"><a name="0712107000085">As a proportionate and acceptable balance against these compulsory powers, the Companies Act requires that these investigations be accorded a limited disclosure regime&#151;information obtained can only be disclosed through legal gateways and the report cannot be directly published.</p>

The ongoing political divisions over who should succeed him remain a source of instability. We have been urging all sides to come together in the spirit of compromise to choose a President who can lead the country forward. We support them in their efforts to do so and hope they will be able to resolve the political crisis as rapidly as possible.</p>

On 30 May 2007, the Security Council adopted Security Council Resolution 1757, establishing the Tribunal. The Tribunal will try those accused of killing the former Lebanese Prime Minister, Rafiq Hariri, who was assassinated on 14 February 2005 along with 21 others in a car bomb in central Beirut. This attack was part of a campaign of targeted political attacks against anti-Syrian MPs and political activists in Lebanon. The most recent of these was the assassination of MP Antoine Ghanem on 19 September. Mr. Ghanem was killed along with two bodyguards and four other civilians in a car bomb explosion in east Beirut which also injured more than 70 other innocent civilians.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="71210m0002.htm_para9"><a name="0712107000096">The UK has been, and remains, firmly committed to the pursuit of justice for Rafiq Hariri&#146;s murder and the sequence of assassinations that followed it. The UK worked closely with UN partners to establish the UN Independent International Investigation Commission (UNIIIC) into Mr Hariri&#146;s assassination. We were also co-sponsors of UN Security Council Resolution 1757 establishing the Special Tribunal. As part of our continued commitment, and in response to the UN Secretary-General&#146;s call for contributions, I am pleased to announce that the UK will be contributing &#163;500,000 ($l million) to the Tribunal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="71210m0002.htm_para10"><a name="0712107000097">The success of the UN-led investigation process and of the Tribunal remain vital for the stability of Lebanon. It is essential that justice is done to send a clear message that political assassinations will not be tolerated. The UK will continue to offer its strong support to the UN and the Lebanese Government as they take this important work forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="71210m0002.htm_para26"><a name="0712107000122">It is recognised that regenerating a 500 acre park to stage a great Olympic and Paralympic games, as well as providing the underlying infrastructure so that long-term legacy benefits can be achieved, involves managing significant risks.

 Consultation begins today on draft regulations which will allow protected rights to be held in Self-Invested Personal Pensions (SIPPs). A copy of the consultation document and draft regulations have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="71210m0003.htm_para1"><a name="0712107000305">The consultation is the result of the very useful dialogue we have had with the pensions community about the existing restrictions preventing SIPPs from holding protected rights.
