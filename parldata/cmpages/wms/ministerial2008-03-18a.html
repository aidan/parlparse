<p><a name="st_99"><a name="08031857000023"><a name="80318m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="08031857000139"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Alistair Darling):</b>
 As I have previously announced, continuing to support Northern Rock will require the approval of the European Commission under state aid rules. On  5 December 2007, the European Commission announced that it had authorised, under state aid rules, the Government&#146;s package of measures to support Northern Rock. Also in line with the rules, the Government were obliged to notify by 17 March 2008 a restructuring plan for Northern Rock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="80318m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08031857000024">Accordingly, the Government yesterday formally notified the European Commission of their proposals to continue to provide state aid to Northern Rock to support a restructuring of the company during the period of temporary public ownership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="80318m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08031857000025">The Board of Northern Rock is today setting out in general the future direction of the business during the period of temporary public ownership. The company will submit a final business plan to HM Treasury for approval by the end of March. Thereafter, I will report to the House further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="80318m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08031857000026">I have placed in the Library of the House a copy of the statement issued today by Northern Rock. This sets out the basis for the removal of Government support through the creation of a smaller, more focused, financially viable mortgage and savings bank, which will be returned to the private sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="80318m0001.htm_para3"><a name="08031857000027">On this basis, the Government&#146;s state aid notification sets out that Northern Rock's future will be based around four strategic priorities:</p>
<a name="80318m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08031857000028"><ul><p class="tabletext">Contracting to a smaller, sustainable business through a reduction of around half in the asset base by 2011, whilst maintaining a modest level of new loan origination.</p>
</ul><a name="80318m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="08031857000029"><ul><p class="tabletext">Progressive repayment of the Bank of England loan and release of the Government guarantees over the next three to four years, while increasing the level of retail deposits modestly to form a larger share of total funding.</p>
</ul><a name="80318m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="08031857000030"><ul><p class="tabletext">Restructuring the organisation and its operations so that these are aligned to the business objectives. The company&#146;s initial assessment is that this will involve staffing levels falling by around a third by 2011, with the majority of the reduction likely to occur in the first year. The final figure will depend on the business plan ultimately adopted, and the evolution of the business in the light of market and economic developments.</p>
</ul><a name="80318m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="08031857000031"><ul><p class="tabletext">Strengthening risk management in key business areas.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="80318m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08031857000032">Northern Rock has said that it is committed to doing all it can to communicate openly with staff and provide the best possible support through the changes ahead, including working closely with UNITE and other employee representatives. The bank proposes to provide outplacement services to help affected staff find alternative employment in the region, working closely with local agencies.</p>

To help those people affected I have asked the chief executive of the Regional Development Agency, ONE NorthEast, to lead the Government&#146;s response. ONE NorthEast have already begun constructive discussions with Northern Rock and will work with local authorities, Jobcentre Plus, Business Link NorthEast, the Learning and Skills Council and Northern Rock&#146;s management to co-ordinate the Government&#146;s support for those involved.</p>

The Government will set out the arrangements for the repayment of the loan when the business plan is finalised.</p>

 Today I am publishing the action plan for the youth taskforce. The youth taskforce in my Department was created in October 2007 from the respect task force to build on Government&#146;s success in tackling antisocial behaviour. Copies will be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="80318m0001.htm_para9"><a name="08031857000038">The new taskforce will concentrate on the minority of young people who get into serious trouble, including anti-social behaviour, and cause serious problems in their neighbourhoods. It will work with local partners&#151;children&#146;s services, the police, schools and community safety teams&#151;to ensure that across the country every area has an effective approach for dealing with young people in serious difficulty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="80318m0001.htm_para10"><a name="08031857000039">The approach needed to change young people&#146;s behaviour and deal with the problems that concern communities, must combine:</p>

<a name="80318m0001.htm_brev7"><a name="08031857000045"><ul><p class="tabletext">New intensive intervention projects to address the most challenging young people. We will apply the principles used successfully in family intervention projects (FIPs) to the most challenging and antisocial young people. Over 80 per cent. of families involved in a FIP reduced or ceased antisocial behaviour. I will invest &#163;13 million over three years to establish 20 pioneering schemes to turn round the lives of around 1,000 of the most challenging young people each year.</p>
</ul><a name="80318m0001.htm_brev8"><a name="08031857000046"><ul><p class="tabletext">New early intervention &#147;challenge and support&#148; projects. These projects will systematically identify young people involved in or at risk of antisocial behaviour and crime, and intervene early to nip problems in the bud. Help will be offered, but will not be optional&#151;where necessary tools like parenting orders and individual support orders which are court orders will be used to make individuals take the help they need. I will invest &#163;13 million over three years to work with around 15,000 young people involved in or at risk of anti-social behaviour per year.</p>
</ul><a name="80318m0001.htm_brev9"><a name="08031857000047"><ul><p class="tabletext">Continued investment to support local services to tackle antisocial behaviour. Over the next three years, the Government will continue to invest more than &#163;100 million to support action to tackle antisocial behaviour: antisocial behaviour teams in every area; the successful national network of family intervention projects tackling the most anti-social families; and parenting experts working with families of young people behaving badly.</p>
</ul><a name="80318m0001.htm_brev10"><a name="08031857000048"><ul><p class="tabletext">Help every local authority area put in place the targeted youth support reforms by December 2008. The youth taskforce will put additional resources into reforming support services for at risk teenagers in England. This will enable local authorities to identify vulnerable young people early, provide swift support to stop problems from escalating, and ensure young people receive joined-up, effective support and challenge through multi-agency teams. I will invest &#163;5 million to provide expert support from the Training and Development Agency (TDA) to help local areas implement the reforms, with most help to those areas facing the greatest challenges.</p>
</ul><a name="80318m0001.htm_brev11"><a name="08031857000049"><ul><p class="tabletext">Increase young people&#146;s participation in positive activities. I set out in &#147;Aiming High for Young People: A Ten Year Strategy for Positive Activities&#148; the importance of enabling young people to take part in constructive activities in their leisure time. Well-supported activities also increase community cohesion by bridging gaps between young and old, and between different income, ethnic and faith groups. The taskforce will support implementation of &#147;Aiming High&#148; by working with 50 local areas to target activity and invest  &#163;22.5 million next year to increase young people&#146;s participation in activities in the most deprived areas, and to make sure facilities are there, and open at the times young people and communities need them&#151;Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
</ul><a name="80318m0001.htm_brev12"><a name="08031857000050"><ul><p class="tabletext">Helping every parent do their best for their child. In the children&#146;s plan I made clear that the state does not bring up children&#151;parents do. But parents are a key influence and I am making extra help available to ensure they meet their responsibilities. I will invest up to &#163;60 million to expand the successful parenting early intervention pathfinders. These projects have improved the support available for parents of children aged 8-13 at risk in 18 areas across the country. They have almost halved the number of parents who considered their children have significant behavioural difficulties. We will expand this programme over the next three years to the majority of local authorities, to reach over 18,000 people each year and ensure that more parents receive the support they need to help with their child&#146;s behaviour.</p>

 The Government are currently undertaking a major programme to reform health and adult social care to improve the quality and safety of services. They are committed to make major changes to the current regulatory and system management frameworks covering health and adult social care, and are legislating to that purpose in the current session. This programme of change will put patients and service users at the forefront of driving forward improvements to services through increased choice, improved commissioning, and new regulatory arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="80318m0002.htm_para26"><a name="08031857000112">In 2009 we plan, subject to the passage of legislation, to replace the current regulatory bodies covering health and social with a new single regulator&#151;the Care Quality Commission, which will build on the work of the Healthcare Commission, the Commission for Social Care Inspection, and the Mental Health Act Commission. However, certain changes to the current regulatory system for private and voluntary health care are needed earlier to ensure that we can continue to regulate this sector effectively during the run-up to the wider changes to the regulatory and system management frameworks. These changes are designed to:</p>
<a name="80318m0002.htm_brev0"><a name="08031857000113"><ul><p class="tabletext">remove a small number of private and voluntary health care services from regulation by the Healthcare Commission where the risk to the public is small; and</p>
