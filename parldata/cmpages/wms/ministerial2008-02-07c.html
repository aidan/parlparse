 The Housing and Regeneration Bill, currently before Parliament, establishes the Homes and Communities Agency, bringing together, for the first time, land and money to deliver decent, affordable housing and regenerate our communities by creating places where people choose to live. It will give local authorities a clear strategic partner to work with on housing and regeneration, and will enable better and more effective use of a range of assets, resources and funding streams to respond to the particular housing and regeneration problems in different communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="80207m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08020765000025">Work to establish the agency is progressing well. Following his appointment as chief executive designate of the agency, Sir Bob Kerslake has appointed a full time set-up team comprising staff drawn from the Housing Corporation, English Partnerships and CLG. The team will lead the delivery of the detailed work necessary to bring the agency into being.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="80207m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08020765000026">Reflecting the devolved arrangements that operate for the London Development Agency, and the Mayor of London&#146;s responsibility to produce a housing strategy for the capital, my predecessor asked Sir Bob Kerslake, chief executive designate of the Homes and Communities Agency, to discuss how the HCA and the Mayor&#146;s bodies could most effectively co-operate to meet London&#146;s housing and regeneration needs. Following those discussions, I have agreed to their proposal that, once the agency is established, a sub-committee of the HCA board should be set up with specific responsibility for London. The board will be chaired by the Mayor, and the vice chair will be the chief executive of the HCA. The London boroughs will also be actively involved through participation on the sub-committee and involvement in the delivery of individual schemes on the ground. The sub-committee will be supported by a team comprising the London staff of the HCA and staff drawn from the London Development Agency. The team will be able to draw on the resources and assets of both the HCA and the LDA in meeting London&#146;s housing and regeneration needs.</p>

made available a total of &#163;605 million through PDG which has played a significant part in raising the profile of planning, providing additional resources for both development management and plan-making, and incentivising improvement in performance against a background of a rapidly increasing number of planning applications.</p>

 I am today publishing the Government&#146;s new water strategy &#147;Future Water&#148;, together with consultation documents on social and environmental guidance to Ofwat, on surface water drainage and on controls on phosphates in domestic laundry cleaning products. The consultations will close on 30 April 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="80207m0001.htm_para12"><a name="08020765000042">Securing and maintaining water supplies is vital to the prosperity of the country and to the health of people and the environment. In some areas, current supplies are already unsustainable and this situation was exacerbated by the drought in South East England between 2004 and 2006. These pressures are going to get worse as the climate changes, the economy grows, and population increases. Combined with the need to reduce CO2 emissions from the water industry and from our use of hot water in our homes, this means that we must find ways of improving efficiency, and of reducing demand and wastage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="80207m0001.htm_para13"><a name="08020765000043">There is no single answer. What is needed is a combination&#151;or in some areas all&#151;of one or more of the following measures:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="80207m0001.htm_para15"><a name="08020765000050">We will be commissioning an independent review to advise on the future of water charging and metering including whether there is a need to move beyond the current system in which companies in seriously water stressed areas can introduce mandatory metering where there is a clear case for doing so. The review will need to look at social, economic and environmental concerns. Any proposed change would need to include measures, such as tariffs, that help vulnerable customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="80207m0001.htm_para16"><a name="08020765000051">As well as drinking water, we are concerned about the quality of our lakes, rivers and streams. These are affected by discharges from sewage treatment works, and by direct pollution, such as from agriculture. High quality water is important for habitats and ecosystems and is greatly valued for recreation and leisure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="80207m0001.htm_para17"><a name="08020765000052">Over the last two decades we have made great improvements to water quality in the environment. This has been achieved mainly through the tightening of controls on pollution from the end of pipes such as the discharge from sewage treatment works. We must now take action on a wider range of pollution including: tackling phosphate pollution of rivers and lakes by phasing out phosphates as an ingredient in laundry cleaning products by 2015; continuing to clean up the water that is discharged from sewage treatment works; and using river basin management plans under the water framework directive to tackle direct pollution of water from agriculture and water run off in urban areas. I am today publishing a consultation on controls on phosphates in domestic laundry cleaning products which will consider both voluntary and regulatory control options.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="80207m0001.htm_para18"><a name="08020765000053">The drought was followed in 2007 by major flooding. While this may seem a different problem, science tells us that both droughts and floods will become more frequent with climate change. I announced on Monday the allocation of funding for flood management, and the outcomes we expect to see from this funding. The floods of 2007 have made us all aware of the need to tackle surface water drainage. A consultation on surface water drainage is being launched today on the recommendations from Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s &#145;lessons learned&#146; report. The proposals include introducing surface water management plans to coordinate activity, and clarifying responsibilities for sustainable drainage systems, as well as reviewing the ability of new development to connect surface water automatically to the public sewer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="80207m0001.htm_para19"><a name="08020765000054">Alongside the strategy, I am today publishing draft statutory social and environmental guidance to the Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat) for consultation. In reflecting the policies set out in &#147;Future Water&#148;, it is one of the ways in which the strategy can begin to be implemented. Following the consultation it will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny as set out in the Water Industry Act 1991, as amended by the Water Act 2003.</p>

My right hon. and noble friend the Attorney-General, the Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice, my hon.

Those not on the group were invited to give their views. All supported the work underway, stressing the need to prioritise data-sharing, both within the EU and co-operation with third countries. In relation to other subject areas, there were suggestions that work might look at the further harmonisation of rules to manage the Schengen area, tighter border controls, measures to bring terrorists to justice and the strengthening of action in the area of civil protection and disaster response. Several delegations also raised the need to ensure that the work of the Home Affairs Group and that of the Justice Future Group were linked more closely. The new European Parliament&#146;s civil liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) President, G&#233;rard Deprez, gave a general introduction to the approach of LIBE, stressing their concern for privacy and individual rights.</p>

on data sharing, coupled with thorough data protection. On migration, an integrated approach to management was needed based on Frontex (the EU&#146;s border agency), operating across land and sea borders. Links with external policy should be stronger, as should data-sharing, and work with and in third countries. In all these areas the EU should analyse what it already had, and then look at the next steps. The presidency noted that a final report should be prepared under the incoming French presidency, with a view to contributing to the successor to the Hague JHA work programme.</p>

The UK welcomed practical co-operation based on an assesment of why people moved. The Commission said that its proposals on the second stage of the Common European Asylum System were due in July and work on an ESO should start with a feasibility study. All member states agreed that practical co-operation should be strengthened, and that there was a need for more uniform country of origin information. All member states also supported the ESO, but views differed as to its role and staffing. The presidency concluded that work to unify the interpretation of existing instruments, common training, and shared interpretation pool should continue. There was wide support for an ESO, but further work was needed on its tasks and financing. The presidency looked forward to the Commission&#146;s ESO study. The Council would be invited to agree conclusions on this at a future session.</p>

The Commission and presidency argued that member states had to set and commit to a real timetable for SIS II. More time for testing was needed, but a formal decision had to be taken at the February JHA Council. Ministers agreed with a presidency proposal to remodel the oversight of the SIS II project on similar grounds to that used for SISOne4all, setting up a ministerial level steering group of various member states.</p>
</ul><a name="80207m0001.htm_brev14"><a name="08020765000069"><ul><p class="tabletext">Ministers also had an exchange of views on the Commission&#146;s proposal on the use of the passenger name records (PNR) for law enforcement purposes. The Commission stressed the need to prevent terrorism, but protect the privacy and rights of honest travellers. At the presidency&#146;s request, the Government presented the UK&#146;s experience of using PNR data, with concrete examples of its use, proportionality, and success, with the conclusion that it should be used to detect all forms of crime. While generally favouring the proposal, member states noted that it raised difficult technical and substantive issues, including concerns about data protection. The presidency concluded that there was general support for the proposal, subject to further work on the scope and to ensure data protection.</p>

My hon. Friend, the Under Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Maria Eagle) said that the portal should be opened up, but that issues around data protection and charges for access, if any, had to be carefully considered in each pilot.</p>

<a name="80207m0002.htm_brev0"><a name="08020765000073"><ul><p class="tabletext">During their final session, Justice Ministers discussed matters of family law and, in particular, their views in relation to the proposed regulation on maintenance obligations and the proposed regulation on divorce, also known as Rome III. The UK has not opted in to either proposal. In response to a question from the presidency, a majority of Ministers agreed that the recently agreed text on the Hague convention and protocol on maintenance obligations should be signed and ratified as soon as possible, reflecting the UK&#146;s position. Further discussions took place on the desirability of eliminating obstacles to the recognition and enforcement of maintenance decisions from other member states. On Rome III, a consensus view emerged that spouses ought to be able to choose the competent jurisdiction and law applicable to their divorce.</p>

 I have today laid amended Education (Student Support) Regulations, making changes in the way we support prisoners undertaking full-time higher education courses.</p>

We estimate about 590 prisoners are currently studying on part-time distance learning courses, usually provided by the Open University. A smaller number of students study full-time in higher education. They must satisfy attendance criteria agreed by the HEI and the prison governor by, for example, securing release on temporary licence (day release). All prisoners released on temporary licence are subject to regular and rigorous risk assessment by the governor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="80207m0002.htm_para10"><a name="08020765000109">Payments properly made under the student support regulations will have been in compliance with the law. However, I do not believe that it has ever been the intention of Parliament that prisoners, who are accommodated at public expense, should receive any additional form of financial support for maintenance. Nor do I believe that it is an appropriate use of public money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="80207m0002.htm_para11"><a name="08020765000110">Last week, I suspended all student support payments to prisoners with immediate effect. While I am examining this further, I am laying amended Education (Student Support) Regulations today to enable me to prevent any further payments of maintenance support being made. These regulations will come into force on 28 February 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="80207m0002.htm_para12"><a name="08020765000111">I have taken a number of further immediate steps to ensure that no further successful applications for maintenance support can be made by prisoners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="80207m0002.htm_para13"><a name="08020765000112">The permanent secretary of my Department is today writing to higher education providers, requesting that they immediately inform the SLC when offering a prisoner a full-time place at their institution. With the support of the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, the Deputy Director-General of the Prison Service has instructed prison governors to identify all prisoners currently undertaking full-time higher education and to inform any such prisoners that they must not apply for maintenance support. In addition, as soon as the amended regulations come into force, all prison governors will be instructed to inform the SLC if an offender within their establishment is offered a place to study full time in higher education, or is currently a full-time student. These measures will enable the SLC to identify all future applications from prisoners, and assess them in accordance with the amended regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="80207m0002.htm_para14"><a name="08020765000113">I have also instructed the SLC to continue to identify and review all current and past applications, as well as live cases. We will then provide a complete estimate of the number and cost of payments and our investigations will ensure that all legal requirements were properly complied with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="80207m0002.htm_para15"><a name="08020765000114">The decisions of HEIs to accept prisoners as students, and the decision of prison governors to allow their attendance, are taken at local level. The student support regulations do not require an applicant to identify themselves as a prisoner. Nor do regulations provide explicitly for the circumstances of a student who is subsequently subject to a custodial sentence. Individuals may also successfully apply for student support while in prison, for courses that they take up upon release. In addition, since full-time student support was introduced in 1962, prisoners have not been specifically excluded from these regulations. As a result, there is no central list of offenders studying full-time HE courses. Current estimates of the amount of support received are therefore provisional. We have identified 91 prisoners who have received a total of &#163;250,000 of repayable maintenance loans, and &#163;120,000 in maintenance grants in the 2007 calendar year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="80207m0002.htm_para16"><a name="08020765000115">Our preliminary investigations suggest that, since current SLC operational systems were put into place in  <br>

1998, approximately 250 prisoners have received up to &#163;250,000 in maintenance grants. Where prisoners have received loans, these will be repayable in the usual way. These cases will be examined on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="80207m0002.htm_para17"><a name="08020765000116">I am minded to conclude that support for offenders studying in higher education, which remains a proper Government objective, should be provided through regulations made specifically for that purpose. In consultation with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, I have asked the Permanent Secretaries of my Department and the Ministry of Justice, drawing upon the wider resources of the civil service, to oversee the SLC&#146;s review of cases, in conjunction with relevant local authorities, officials from my Department, the Ministry of Justice and the Prison Service, and to make recommendations to me about the management of support for offenders in full-time higher education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="80207m0002.htm_para35"><a name="08020765000149">(i) Private cars should be eligible for discounts when used by residents of Dartford and Thurrock local authority areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="80207m0002.htm_para36"><a name="08020765000150">(ii) There will be a &#163;10 annual registration fee which will entitle residents of these areas to 50 free one-way journeys per year. Thereafter journeys will be charged at 20p each. (London charges the same annual &#163;10 fee for those who make use of their residents&#146; discount scheme).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="80207m0002.htm_para37"><a name="08020765000151">(iii) To benefit from the discount residents will need to register annually and apply for an electronic &#147;tag&#148; that is fitted in the windscreen of the nominated vehicle. The tag will be provided free of charge but a &#163;10 charge will be levied for replacement of lost or damaged tags.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="80207m0002.htm_para38"><a name="08020765000152">The Government&#146;s intention is that the discount scheme should be implemented alongside the other changes to the charging regime on which we consulted in December 2006. This includes the possibility for any car user, regardless of where they live, to use the Crossing for the current &#163;1 rate if they opt to use a tag and open an account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="80207m0002.htm_para39"><a name="08020765000153">Our December 2006 consultation document made clear that if a local discount scheme were introduced then all revenues would go towards national transport projects. Therefore the current arrangement, under which a proportion of revenues from the crossing (&#163;1.75 million) is made available to help deliver integrated transport policies in the Dartford and Thurrock areas, would be discontinued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="80207m0002.htm_para40"><a name="08020765000154">The consultation document will be published next week and copies will be placed in the Library of the House. The consultation exercise will run for 12 weeks from the date of publication.</p>

forward a clear statement of their preferred approach, work has already started to put in place the necessary systems and processes. A further announcement about the precise start date for the new regime will be made at the end of the consultation period.</p>
