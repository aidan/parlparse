<a name="40525m01.html_sbhd1"><h4 align=center>Vietnam Programme</h4>












<p><a name="40525m01.html_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development  (Mr. Gareth Thomas): </b> 
 The Department for International Development (DFID) will be increasing its support to Vietnam to &#163;40 million in 2004&#150;05 and to &#163;60 million in 2005&#150;06 to help Vietnam meet its challenges. Our new Country Assistance Plan for Vietnam (copies of which I have placed in the Library) will support the Government of Vietnam&#039;s own strategies for growth and poverty reduction. It sets out three key objectives for our contribution to the collective development effort. First, we will promote fair, efficient and effective use of public financial resources. Second, we will seek to strengthen the Government of Vietnam&#039;s efforts to achieve social and economic development that includes all groups of society. Third, we will support Vietnam in its transition to market-based economy. A fourth pillar of our programme in Vietnam will be to help improve the effectiveness of the international development effort.






<br>&nbsp;<br>25 May 2004 : Column 76WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="40525m01.html_para1">DFID intends to provide &#163;20 million a year over the next three years in the form of poverty reduction budget support. This commitment will constitute the single largest element of our programme in Vietnam and will provide a significant boost to Vietnam&#039;s overall reform programme. I can also announce today a &#163;500,000 project to help improve the quality of public investment in Vietnam by supporting the introduction of a modern and efficient inspection system in the Ministry of Planning and Investment.

<p><a name="40525m01.html_spmin2"><b>The Minister for Local and Regional Government  (Mr.&nbsp;Nick Raynsford): </b> 
 I have today received the independent boundary committee&#039;s final reports and recommendations on options for unitary local government for each of the existing two-tier county areas in the three northern regions. We welcome the completion of this significant step towards the holding of referendums for elected regional assemblies in the autumn.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40525m01.html_para2">We will now carefully consider the recommended options and any representations about them that are made to us before taking decisions about the options that will be included in a draft order. We do not intend to take decisions about the options until 6 July.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40525m01.html_para3">In the meantime, those who wish to make representations to us may do so. We will have regard to those before deciding what options we propose to put to electors. These options, together with the date of the referendums, will be contained in an order to be made following parliamentary approval.

<p><a name="40525m01.html_spmin3"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs  (Mr. Bill Rammell): </b> 
 The Government have recently issued a licence for the BBC to export to Iran up to three civilian armoured vehicles which are of military specification. Although military rated, these vehicles are manufactured for civilian use and would provide essential protection for journalists working for the BBC. Her Majesty&#039;s Government believed that an exception to the UK unilateral arms embargo should be made to allow the free and secure movement of journalists throughout the region and that approval of the application was otherwise consistent with the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria. Specific provisos about usage and disposal are attached and Her Majesty&#039;s Government are satisfied that there is minimal risk of diversion to a military end-use or for use in internal repression.
