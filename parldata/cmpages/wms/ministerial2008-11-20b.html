<p><a name="st_24"><a name="08112038000020"><a name="81120m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="08112038000120"><b>The Minister for Trade, Investment and Consumer Affairs (Mr. Gareth Thomas):</b>
 Today my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communications, Technology and Broadcasting made the following statement:</p>
<a name="81120m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08112038000095"><ul><p class="tabletext">I am pleased to confirm the agenda items for which BERR has responsibility at the forthcoming Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council (Telecoms Council) in Brussels on 27 November 2008.</p>
</ul><a name="81120m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="08112038000096"><ul><p class="tabletext">The first substantive item on the agenda is the review of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services, which is on the agenda for a political agreement. The French presidency is working hard to achieve agreement on the three elements of this package: amending the directives on a common regulatory framework, authorisation and access&#151;often referred to as the Better Regulation directive; amending the directives on universal service, users rights and e-privacy&#151;often referred to as the citizens&#146; directive; and the regulation on the new European Electronic Communications Market Authority.</p>
</ul><a name="81120m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="08112038000097"><ul><p class="tabletext">Although at present we still expect a political agreement to be reached on the whole package, there remains some doubt whether concerns by some member states on individual issues, such as on functional separation, may lead to the better regulation package to be rejected. There is more confidence on the citizens&#146; rights package and on the authority, where there have been significant improvements over the last few months better reflecting UK objectives. The proposed authority no longer has a role in spectrum management or in security and is a smaller, more efficient and independent body intended to be a disseminator of best practice to the 27 national regulatory authorities (NRAs). However, the Commission continues to propose the creation of an agency, giving rise to concerns that it would not be properly independent, and would risk becoming bureaucratic and inefficient. This is unacceptable to the UK, and I shall confirm this point.</p>
</ul><a name="81120m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="08112038000098"><ul><p class="tabletext">The French presidency compromise text proposes the formalisation of the European Regulators&#146; Group (ERG) in Community law and supported by a separate secretariat. This is much more concordant with UK objectives for the creation of a small and efficient source of independent regulatory expertise which would not be subject to external influence. I will consequently be strongly supporting the presidency compromise text at the Council, and urging other member states to do the same.</p>
</ul><a name="81120m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="08112038000099"><ul><p class="tabletext">The citizens&#146; directive has also improved; it no longer risks extending privacy obligations on to private networks, includes greater powers for NRAs to protect citizens and consumers and contains more robust protection for disabled users.</p>
</ul><a name="81120m0001.htm_brev5"><a name="08112038000100"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Better Regulation directive is where the French presidency is focusing its last minute efforts, and the UK is also been working extremely hard to realise our own objectives. However, given the potential this package has to deliver real economic benefits to every European citizen and enterprise, and the time pressures we are under to reach an agreement before the current term of the European Parliament expires, there is a real need to balance our outstanding concerns against the need to give the presidency&#151;now the French, shortly to be the Czech Republic&#151;the necessary mandate to negotiate of behalf of all member states with the European Parliament and the European Commission.</p>

<a name="81120m0001.htm_brev6"><a name="08112038000101"><ul><p class="tabletext">In my interventions on the regulatory framework I intend, while congratulating the presidency on its hard work and achievement in bringing forward these near agreed texts, to express concern that on several substantive issues the approach being taken is neither conducive to enhanced competition across the European Union nor better regulation. I will particularly highlight, though this will depend on the exact detail in the final texts, our disappointment that there is not more robust language on the political independence of regulators, the liberalisation of spectrum or on functional separation as an access remedy.</p>
</ul><a name="81120m0001.htm_brev7"><a name="08112038000102"><ul><p class="tabletext">This package is subject to co-decision, so the final text voted upon at the Council will have to be negotiated and compromised with the European Parliament, who share many of the UK&#146;s objectives. The Commission, who will also have a key role in these co-decision negotiations, also share many of the UK objectives.</p>
</ul><a name="81120m0001.htm_brev8"><a name="08112038000103"><ul><p class="tabletext">I will endeavour to keep you informed at these key stages, but subject to developments over the coming days I am likely to reserve the UK position on these elements of the package, pending a better outcome in the forthcoming discussions with the European Parliament and the European Commission.</p>
</ul><a name="81120m0001.htm_brev9"><a name="08112038000104"><ul><p class="tabletext">Following this, there will be discussion on the general approach of proposals for amending the regulations on roaming on public telephone networks.</p>
</ul><a name="81120m0001.htm_brev10"><a name="08112038000105"><ul><p class="tabletext">I fully support the aims and objectives of the proposal, with its rationale of consumer benefit and protection. I consider that the proposed price caps for voice calls and SMS messages strike the right balance between the consumer&#146;s interest in low prices, and the operators&#146; legitimate aspirations for the profit margins which are the foundation for sustainable and innovative services. It should be noted that these caps are concordant with those considered appropriate by both the European Regulators&#146; Group and our own telecoms regulator, OFCOM.</p>
</ul><a name="81120m0001.htm_brev11"><a name="08112038000106"><ul><p class="tabletext">I also concur with the need to avoid &#145;bill shock&#146; for those downloading data on their mobiles when abroad, albeit tempered by the need to ensure that transparency, meaning the customer being aware of what they might be billed, can be provided without disproportionate cost or complexity. The UK has consequently submitted alternative text introducing a flat-rate charge which we consider will reduce the need for costly and possibly ineffective systems changes. I will be speaking in support of this approach and the rationale for it.</p>
</ul><a name="81120m0001.htm_brev12"><a name="08112038000107"><ul><p class="tabletext">I also agree with the Commission that the rapid evolution of the data market, coupled with the existence of alternative sources of supply&#151;such as wi-fi hotspots&#151;means that it would be inappropriate to consider retail price controls for data at this stage. I will be speaking in support of the Commission on this point at Council, should others move to include retail price controls for data.</p>
</ul><a name="81120m0001.htm_brev13"><a name="08112038000108"><ul><p class="tabletext">At the House of Lords&#146; Scrutiny Committee hearing of 17 November 2008, I explained some of the history of the roaming regulation and that the national regulatory authorities had requested that the Commission act to address a cross-border issue that could not be tackled effectively by individual member states. I also explained why it was better to set a maximum price cap rather than an average one, as the latter would reduce the possibility of competitive pricing between suppliers. There are also practical difficulties associated with introducing an average cap as price controls effectively take money out of the market that could be used for investment and could lead to higher prices. We also discussed the possible &#145;waterbed&#146; effect of roaming caps; and although the evidence is largely anecdotal at the moment, we have seen some increases in pre-pay domestic rates, but elsewhere competition has limited price increases. We will, of course, continue to monitor this situation.</p>
</ul><a name="81120m0001.htm_brev14"><a name="08112038000109"><ul><p class="tabletext">This will be followed by a presentation from the Commission and discussion on second periodic review of the scope of universal services in communications networks. I am pleased that this is on the agenda as I recently deposited an explanatory memorandum about this communication. As Members will be aware, I have welcomed the initialisation of this debate on broadband as a universal service given the importance of broadband in the Digital Britain work the Department is engaged on. I am confident the debate will identify the best way forward for the European Union on this important issue, not least on such aspects of funding  <br>

The UK objective for this agenda item is to ensure that the Commission proposals provide a suitable basis for ensuring that the future internet remains open and hence innovative and friendly. It is also necessary to set a marker ensuring that the six forthcoming proposals highlighted in the conclusions of the communication remain technology and service neutral.</p>
</ul><a name="81120m0001.htm_brev17"><a name="08112038000112"><ul><p class="tabletext">I believe that it is important to engage all the relevant stakeholders in the broadband, next generation network debate and to examine all the relevant areas including private investment, economic and social value, regulation and the public sector. Currently I am of the view that roll-out of NGNs in the UK should be private sector led and that public sector should limit its interventions to addressing clear market failures.</p>

I agree with the European Commission that security and privacy issues are of prime importance and that it is imperative that these features are designed into systems and infrastructures, and thus EU research and development funding should be directed into this area.</p>

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="08112038000021"><a name="81120m0001.htm_spmin1"><a name="08112038000121"><b>The Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Angela Eagle):</b>
 Yesterday morning the Government successfully held the UK&#146;s first auction of carbon allowances as part of phase II of the EU&#146;s emissions trading scheme (ETS). The auction was also the first of its kind to take place in Europe, demonstrating the UK&#146;s continuing leadership in the battle against dangerous climate change. Four million allowances were offered for sale and sold at a total value of &#163;54 million excluding VAT, or &#163;13.60 per allowance. The auction was over four times oversubscribed demonstrating that the auction was competitive and that it attracted a significant amount of market interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="81120m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08112038000022">The ETS puts a cap on emissions from around 12,000 installations throughout the EU&#151;including in the energy and heavy industrial sectors, which are collectively responsible for close to half of the EU&#146;s emissions of carbon dioxide. Any of these installations that exceed its emissions cap will need to purchase the appropriate number of allowances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="81120m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08112038000023">Through auctions and the creation of a secondary market for allowances, the ETS is sending clear price signals. The carbon price will encourage Governments, businesses and individuals to factor the costs of emissions into their spending and investment decisions. A price for carbon creates an incentive to find products and processes that produce less carbon to achieve the same outcomes, which in turn encourages investment in the research and development of low carbon technologies.</p>

 Ensuring learners are able to access education and training post-16 is a key priority for this Government. I would like to update the House on the current situation in regard to the delivery of Education Maintenance Allowances (EMAs).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="81120m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08112038000027">There have been processing and other related problems since Liberata won the contract to deliver helpline, assessment and payment functions for EMA and other learner support schemes in July 2007. The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has been closely monitoring the situation and has been regularly providing me with updates, which I have shared with the Children, Schools and Families Select Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="81120m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08112038000028">As of Tuesday 18 November, 794,655 applications&#151;237,826 more than 8 October, the date of my previous letter&#151;have been processed. This has resulted in 485,396 young people&#151;201,516 more than at that time&#151;receiving notifications that they are entitled to EMAs, which means they can begin claiming the allowance. There are currently 12,016 applications in the process of being finalised&#151;down from 111,000 on 8 October.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="81120m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08112038000029">Despite this progress, the LSC&#146;s view has been that in order to preserve the best interests of learners, a change in contractor was necessary. The LSC has been in talks with Liberata about the future of the contract for over four weeks and yesterday informed me that they intend to discontinue the Liberata contract. I have been clear from the outset that these delays have been totally unacceptable and I therefore fully back the LSC&#146;s decision to change contractor to Capita.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="81120m0001.htm_para7"><a name="08112038000030">The transfer of the EMA helpline, processing and payment service from Liberata to Capita will take effect from Friday 28 November. With effect from that date, Capita will bring in a new senior management team to oversee the staff and operations in Coventry, Manchester and Darlington. The transfer will place us in a stronger position to fix the helpline and processing problems, enabling us to improve the future service for young people, colleges and learning providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="81120m0001.htm_para8"><a name="08112038000031">The migration of the learner support service programme contract from Liberata will have resulted in Liberata losing future revenues of over &#163;60 million over the remaining term of the contract. In addition, in addressing the issues caused by the failure of their proposed IT system, Liberata rightly took the decision to employ significant numbers of additional temporary staff to deal with the backlog in applications.

The UK welcomes such a proposal, which could help to enhance co-operation and the exchange of good practice across all aspects of disaster management. Draft Council conclusions on the strengthening of civil protection capabilities through a system of mutual assistance will also be discussed.

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="81120m0002.htm_para10"><a name="08112038000056">The presidency is looking to agree the proposal for amending Council directive 2003/109/EC which currently allows third-country nationals the right to long-term residence in a member state after five years of legal and continuous residence and permits them to have the same rights and duties as nationals. The Commission proposal would extend the scope of the directive to refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection, known as humanitarian protection in the UK. The UK has chosen not to opt in to the proposed extension of the directive because, as with the original directive, the UK believes it is not in line with its frontiers protocol and would want to determine the status of third-country nationals via the immigration rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="81120m0002.htm_para11"><a name="08112038000057">The Council will discuss the proposal to amend the regulation on common consular instructions on visas which relates to the issuing of Schengen visas into a single code on visas. It aims to fill gaps in existing legislation and remove redundant provisions. The UK does not issue Schengen visas and therefore is not opted-in to this proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="81120m0002.htm_para12"><a name="08112038000058">However, we welcome the efforts of Schengen member states to ensure that the Schengen external EU borders are as secure as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="81120m0002.htm_para13"><a name="08112038000059">The proposal to amend Council Regulation No. 2252/2004 establishing common standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents will also be discussed. Member states wish to exclude children under the age of six years and persons who are physically unable to give fingerprints for travel documents. The amendment also hopes to establish the principle of &#147;one person one passport&#148; as a measure to prevent child trafficking. The UK is not opted-in but intends to keep abreast with any amendments. The UK does not support the exemption of persons under the age of six but would prefer the bar to be set at 11&#151;this would fit with our plans for synchronising the issuing of e-passports and ID cards. Children&#146;s passports would have a five-year validity and all passport holders aged 16 and over will have their fingerprints recorded. The UK introduced the &#147;one person one passport&#148; principle in 1998.</p>

This will allow for a person who is resident in one member state, but the subject of criminal proceedings in another, to have their bail conditions monitored in their member state of residence. No such system exists at present, with the effect some individuals are released pre-trial without supervision. The Government have been concerned to ensure that the proposal struck the right balance between public protection and the liberty of the individual, and provided the executing state with sufficient options to act in the public interest in the event of breach of bail conditions or the commission of further offences. The Government welcome the improvements to the text that have been achieved in the course of negotiations and, subject to any further changes to the text before the Council, expects to be in a position to agree to the proposal.</p>

the internal investigation into this matter, which was undertaken by a National Offender Management Service (NOMS) director with no prior involvement in the incident.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="81120m0002.htm_para23"><a name="08112038000071">The investigation has confirmed that initial reports over-stated the volume of data involved. The hard drive contained 256 items of sensitive personal information that could potentially, if in the public domain, cause damage to that individual, namely: bank details; address details; and National Insurance numbers coupled with dates of birth. There remains no indication that this information has entered the public domain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="81120m0002.htm_para24"><a name="08112038000072">The investigation found that the data had been downloaded to the hard drive so it could be transferred to another site as part of a disaster recovery exercise carried out in July 2007. While no problems arose regarding the implementation of the exercise itself, the disk was not wiped before it was to be removed from the site and thereafter EDS failed to take adequate measures to track or record the location of the hard drive when it was transferred to another site. Although strictly the hard drive was not at that time being removed for other uses, it ought to have been treated as such and EDS&#146; company policy at that time requiring a disk to be purged prior to release for any other purpose, ought to have been followed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="81120m0002.htm_para25"><a name="08112038000073">This did not comply with data protection principles, and also meant that the investigation could not identify precisely when or where the hard drive went missing. The possibility of theft has resulted in this matter being referred to the West Mercia Police. EDS is taking appropriate action, which will include disciplinary action if necessary, concerning the staff involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="81120m0002.htm_para26"><a name="08112038000074">The inadequacy of EDS&#146; tracking systems meant that the data was not missed until 2 July 2008. On 3 July, EDS notified NOMS verbally of the data loss, the possible scope of which was made apparent in a written interim report to the NOMS IT security team on 4 July, There is no evidence of any other communication between EDS and NOMS on this issue until 6 September when the matter was raised by the press, although EDS were preparing a final report to submit to NOMS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="81120m0002.htm_para27"><a name="08112038000075">The NOMS IT security team did not take sufficient action following receipt of the interim report, with the result that senior officials and ministers were not aware of the loss until 6 September, when comprehensive and appropriate action was taken to identify and contact any staff involved and to investigate further the circumstances of the loss. NOMS is taking appropriate action, including disciplinary action, concerning the staff involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="81120m0002.htm_para28"><a name="08112038000076">In the context of the Hannigan review and subsequent Cabinet Office guidelines, NOMS and EDS were both actively improving data protection processes before this matter arose. Since 6 September, EDS and NOMS have agreed an additional set of measures to be undertaken, at EDS&#146; cost, to both reimburse NOMS for its additional expenses arising from the incident and to further develop the security of NOMS&#146; information assets. These include an exercise to identify all uncontrolled copies of NOMS&#146; sensitive data and have such copies destroyed in a secure manner, as well as reviewing and strengthening the policies and process controls which govern the transfer of NOMS data. In addition, the number of transfers using removable media will be reduced, and encryption will be introduced on removable media. A further detailed  <br>

review will also be undertaken to identify and prioritise any additional security measures to be enhanced. Finally, EDS has committed to the design, development and delivery of appropriate classroom and computer-based training packages for both EDS and NOMS staff. An annual, independent audit of EDS&#146; compliance with security standards will be introduced with a requirement for EDS to rectify any areas of non-compliance.</p>

 On 11 June my predecessor told the House, <i>Official Report</i>, column 485 of two lost Joint Intelligence Committee assessments and announced that the Cabinet Secretary had asked Sir David Omand to carry out a full investigation of the circumstances of the case. He undertook to keep the House informed of Sir David&#146;s conclusions.</p>

With the conviction of the individual responsible under s.8(1) of the Official Secrets Act on 28 October, those processes are now complete.

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="81120m0002.htm_para31"><a name="08112038000080">Sir David concluded that the documents were mislaid because of the direct actions of the officer and that even if all the current security procedures had been followed to the letter the inadvertent removal of the documents, though less likely to have occurred, could still have happened. He judged that the loss was not a preventable accident given the mistakes made by the individual. He has also observed that no security system that is both affordable and allows for the efficient conduct of business will provide proof against all forms of human error; and that the key determinant of good security has always been and remains staff with high morale and sense of purpose. Sir David said he had no reservations in that regard about the staff of the Joint Intelligence Organisation, who are highly security aware.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="81120m0002.htm_para32"><a name="08112038000081">Sir David has recommended a number of additional and affordable measures covering security education, practical procedures and emergency arrangements that would reduce some of the more likely human failings. He has also made suggestions about strengthening governance of the future development of security policy. An example of the sort of measures recommended that can be made public without damaging security is the introduction of spot checks. All the recommendations have been accepted: many have already been implemented but some depend on changes to accommodation in hand and will be implemented when those changes have been made.</p>
