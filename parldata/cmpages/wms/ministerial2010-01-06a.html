 I am announcing today the Government's intention to present to Parliament proposed legislative changes to the corporation tax rules for capital gains of companies for inclusion in Finance Bill 2010. The changes, which have immediate effect from 6 January 2010, will ensure that a postponed charge on gains arising where assets of an overseas branch are transferred to a non-resident company is brought back into charge at the appropriate time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="100106m0001.htm_para0"><a name="10010646000014">The changes will affect UK companies that transfer assets of an overseas branch to a non-resident company in exchange for securities consisting of shares or loan stock. In these circumstances corporation tax on gains arising from the transfer are postponed until the disposal of the securities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="100106m0001.htm_para1"><a name="10010646000015">In some situations, however, the security received in exchange can be an exempt asset. Where loan stock is received it can fall within the definition of a Qualifying Corporate Bond ('QCB'). Section 115 of the Taxation of Capital Gains Act 1992 exempts QCB's from tax on capital gains. As a result any postponed gain arising from a transfer of an overseas branch's assets is exempt on the subsequent disposal of a security received in exchange where that security is a QCB. This can create unintended outcomes in the treatment of postponed gains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="100106m0001.htm_para2"><a name="10010646000016">The proposed legislative change will correct this defect in the current rules. Where a gain on the transfer of an overseas branch's assets to a non-resident company in exchange for securities has been postponed, the change will ensure that the disposal of securities will create a deemed gain that is chargeable to tax. Instead of treating the postponed gain as additional consideration for the disposal of an exempt asset, a separate chargeable gain equal to the postponed gain will be deemed to accrue at the time of disposal of the securities. This change will apply where the securities themselves are exempt from a charge to tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="100106m0001.htm_para3"><a name="10010646000017">HM Revenue and Customs will today publish a Technical Note on its website setting out further detail, including the draft legislative amendments.</p>

 A new call-out order has been made under section 56 of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 so that reservists may continue to be called-out into permanent service to support operations in the region of Iraq and the Gulf.

Reservists may be called out to support any of these tasks although we envisage that the majority will be from the Royal Naval Reserve to support the maritime operations.</p>

 The Minister with responsibility for the National Offender Management Service, the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle) and I wish to make the following joint statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="100106m0001.htm_para8"><a name="10010646000026">The MOD and the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) have been working to provide up to date and authoritative data on the number of veterans in prison in England and Wales. We can today confirm that the Defence Analytical Services and Advice (DASA) of the MOD has estimated that ex-service personnel in prison represent almost 3 per cent. of offenders in prison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="100106m0001.htm_para9"><a name="10010646000027">The estimate was determined by matching a database of prisoners aged 18 and over in England and Wales from the MOJ against a database of service leavers held by the MOD. The analysis does not include reservists nor those who had left the service prior to 1979 (Navy), 1972 (Army), and 1968 (RAF). Further work will seek  <br>

to quantify the likely effect of the incompleteness of the MOD database. DASA estimates that a more complete database is unlikely to increase the estimated proportion of offenders who are ex-service to more than 4 per cent. This is because reservists have other employment and it is possible that it makes them less likely to come into contact with the criminal justice system; and, because evidence from previous studies suggests that crimes tend to be committed soon after discharge from service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="100106m0001.htm_para10"><a name="10010646000028">The 3 per cent. figure compares with the Home Office survey of 2,000 nationally representative offenders at the point of release in 2001, 2003 and 2004, which reported the armed forces proportion to be 6 per cent., 4 per cent. and 5 per cent. respectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="100106m0001.htm_para11"><a name="10010646000029">The next stage in this project will be to evaluate the ex-service prison population in terms of demographic and service variables such as age, gender, service branch, length of service, rank, deployment history, time since discharge, and offence type. This qualitative analysis should allow for informed policy decisions to be made where necessary to ensure that resources are better targeted at appropriate groups of offenders. The MOD will also investigate where relevant improvements could be made in-service to minimise contact with the criminal justice system once personnel are discharged from the armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="100106m0001.htm_para12"><a name="10010646000030">The Howard League for Penal Reform in November 2009 launched an independent inquiry into former armed forces personnel in prison.

That is a matter for the NHS Staff Council which is responsible for overseeing Agenda for Change pay, terms and conditions which cover about 1.1 million NHS staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="100106m0001.htm_para18"><a name="10010646000038">I note the NHSPRB's concerns about the lack of sufficiently detailed workforce statistics relating to building craft workers and other non clinical staff in the NHS.
