<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60317m01.html_spmin3"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development  (Mr. Gareth Thomas): </b> 
 Since January Bolivia has been experiencing above average rainfall, as well as hail and freezing temperatures in the highlands. Rainfall levels are reported to be at their highest in over 75 years and more is expected over the coming weeks. Some 23 people have died as a result of flooding, while another 280,000 people have been affected. As well as causing damage to infrastructure, homes and crops, reports are emerging of increased incidence of diarrhoea, gastro-intestinal diseases and conjunctivitis in affected highland communities. Some 9,347 families have been evacuated to temporary accommodation. The Bolivian Air Force has been assisting in search and rescue efforts, and the Government are distributing relief supplies.

target 2,700 of the worst affected families, repairing local water systems, supporting health facilities and providing urgently needed relief items such as jerry cans. It will also contribute to programmes to reduce the impact of future disasters, whilst the livelihoods support will help fill the food gap over the coming months.

<p>
<a name="60317m01.html_para40"><a name="stpa_39">The US has provided some US$ 300,000 of urgently needed relief items such as plastic sheeting and 100 tons of food.

The European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office has also provided &#8364;1 million for water and sanitation, health, food security and disaster preparedness, of which the UK&#039;s share is &#8364; 200,000 in addition to our &#163;100,000 of bilateral support.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60317m02.html_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Energy  (Malcolm Wicks): </b> 
 I represented the UK at the extraordinary Energy Council meeting in Brussels on 14 March. Discussion focused largely on the recent Commission Green Paper on a European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317m02.html_para0"><a name="stpa_41">Commissioner Piebalgs described the Green Paper as a comprehensive and balanced response to the Hampton Court agenda. The Commission envisaged a six-month consultation period before taking a view on any additional measures, although some actions could be taken more quickly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317m02.html_para1"><a name="stpa_42">For the UK, I recognised the scale of the challenge and need for prompt action. I emphasised the priority of completing the internal energy market, promoting both transparency and regulatory consistency, and supporting the DG Competition sectoral inquiry. Externally, I underlined the need for a coherent strategy to engage key providers, transit countries and consumers, but particularly Russia and neighbouring countries. I also advocated an ambitious but realistic approach to promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. I drew attention to the UK paper identifying priority actions that the spring European Council might endorse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317m02.html_para2"><a name="stpa_43">Other member states indicated broad support for the Commission&#039;s analysis, agenda and level of ambition. They welcomed the focus on open and competitive markets, though one warned against further legislation now, while another questioned how competitive markets could be consistent with ensuring energy security. Other issues to attract comment were support for energy efficiency, a long-term renewables strategy, developing interconnections, and new external initiatives with Russia and EuroMed countries. Many member states emphasised national sovereignty over energy mix. One explicitly supported the UK paper while others touched on many of the actions proposed there.

<p>
<a name="60317m02.html_para3">Commissioner Kroes warned that the Commission would act against mergers or acquisitions that were anti-competitive, but noted that cross-border activity in this area was often a positive sign of the operation of an open and competitive market.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60317m02.html_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Derek Twigg): </b> 
 In the Air Transport White Paper, we promised to examine the scope for further development of Heathrow, consistent with environmental conditions. We are making good progress on this programme of work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317m02.html_para7"><a name="stpa_47">In particular, the review of how to assess air quality around Heathrow, involving independent experts, has recently been completed and we will be publishing a full technical report shortly. A further statement will be made at the time, and copies of the report will be deposited in the Library.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317m02.html_para8"><a name="stpa_48">The technical report will include data on air quality around the airport in recent years, comment on emissions sources, and recommend how these can best be represented and modelled in future years. We believe this process, which has itself been subject to peer review, will provide a solid basis for the remaining stages of the project.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317m02.html_para9"><a name="stpa_49">In parallel, we have been working with BAA and others to identify how mixed mode might be operated at Heathrow, and its likely impacts in terms of noise and air quality in particular. The work so far has confirmed that the issues are complex. It will take some time to identify options, their impacts and the range of accompanying measures that might be needed to mitigate these, including steps to manage traffic on the surrounding road network. Similar considerations apply equally to the further assessment of the likely impacts of a third runway.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60317m02.html_para10">Accordingly, we think it prudent to defer public consultation. This will ensure that when we consult, it will be informed by the fullest possible assessment of impacts, and give consultees the best information on which they can make their responses.

<p>
<a name="60317m02.html_para11"><a name="stpa_50">The main items were preparation for the spring European Council and the Tripartite Social Summit through the endorsement of a set of key messages to the European Council.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317m02.html_para12"><a name="stpa_51">The presidency posed three questions to help focus the discussion. The first question was to the Council asking if it shared the Commission&#039;s assessment on the delays of implementing delivery in certain unemployment policy areas. The second question was on the role of the social partners in strengthening the Lisbon process and the third question was on the progress made with social protection and social inclusion. I supported the key messages paper, particularly the focus on implementation and delivery. I stated that we all need to deliver the promises made to Europe&#039;s citizens in our national reform programmes and that we must step up a gear to deliver against Lisbon and contribute to the economic well being of Europe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317m02.html_para13"><a name="stpa_52">The Council noted the annual Work Programmes of the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee for 2006.

This is a regular update of the regulation which coordinates social security within the European Union.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60317m02.html_para15"><a name="stpa_54">The final agenda item was a Commission presentation on the report on transitional arrangements set out in 2003 Accession Treaty. These are the measures allowing member states to restrict, for a transitional period, free movement of workers from eight of the new member states. As the UK has opened its labour market I outlined the benefits the UK labour market has drawn from this. Portugal, Spain and Finland announced that they would be lifting their restrictions from 1 May 2006.
