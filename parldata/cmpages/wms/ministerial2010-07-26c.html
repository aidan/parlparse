 Coming into the recovery, the Government's focus is on creating the conditions for balanced and sustainable growth in the private sector. In order that UK business can finance this growth, we are seeking to address the challenges and risks faced by businesses in ensuring that they can access the finance they require.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para0"><a name="1007264000051">At the heart of these challenges is ensuring stable financial conditions for business. The coalition Government have taken decisive action to tackle the fiscal deficit, which is the first priority for restoring business confidence. But businesses also need sustainable and secure sources of finance for investment. Unless the financial system is reformed it may fail to deliver the finance that is vital to this task.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para1"><a name="1007264000052">Today, I am publishing a Command Paper, jointly written with my right hon. Friend the Chancellor. This discussion document sets out lessons learnt from the past and some of the challenges ahead. We would like to encourage businesses, investors and lenders to participate in this consultation as it will inform the Government's future response to the issues raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para2"><a name="1007264000053">In "Financing a private sector recovery", we state that the Government would like more diverse sources  of finance available. The paper explores a broad range of options, including trade finance, greater application of the mutual model, more use of equity and a responsible return to securitisation. The paper also addresses the success of existing Government schemes, such as the enterprise finance guarantee, and whether they should be improved or extended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para3"><a name="1007264000054">But it is emphasised that industry and market-led solutions are the preferred response to any market failures. Only where appropriate will Government assist in providing solutions, in conjunction with business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para4"><a name="1007264000055">The paper is being published today on BIS's website: www.bis.gov.uk/businessfinance. The deadline for responses is 20 September 2010.</p>

 The Government have today published a consultation document outlining the coalition Government's proposals for reforming the framework of financial regulation in the UK. This builds on the statement I made in the House on 17 June 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para24"><a name="1007264000206">"A new approach to financial regulation: judgment, focus and stability" sets out in more detail plans to overhaul the UK's financial regulatory framework, including providing the Bank of England with control of macro-prudential regulation and oversight of micro-prudential regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para25"><a name="1007264000207">The UK banking system is emerging from the most serious financial crisis in over a hundred years. Despite making three authorities-the Bank of England (the Bank), the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and the Treasury-collectively responsible for financial stability, the UK's "tripartite" system failed in a number of important ways. For example, it failed to identify the problems that were building up in the financial system; to take steps to mitigate them before they led to significant instability in financial markets; and to deal adequately with the crisis when it did break.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para26"><a name="1007264000208">The document describes the future arrangements for the framework of financial regulation that will address these failings head on. These include proposals to create an independent Financial Policy Committee in the Bank of England and a new prudential regulation authority as a subsidiary of the Bank. In addition to the proposed changes to macro and micro prudential regulation, the consultation document sets out in more detail plans to create a dedicated consumer protection and markets authority (CPMA), with a primary statutory responsibility to promote confidence in financial services and markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para27"><a name="1007264000209">The document also sets out details of proposals for approaching future financial crises. One of the failings of the UK system currently is the fact that no single institution has the responsibility, authority or powers to monitor the system as a whole, identify potentially destabilising trends and vulnerabilities, and respond to them with concerted action. The document outlines how the Government intend to rectify this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para28"><a name="1007264000210">The document presents a range of issues and questions for consultation.

Localism should involve both devolving power down to local councils, and going further by devolving power and opportunity down to community groups, neighbourhoods and individual citizens. Our free schools policy is an example of localism and the big society in action-by empowering individuals to come together to improve the educational choices for their children in their local community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para53"><a name="1007264000240">The Secretary of State for Education outlined his proposals for new free schools on 18 June. Teachers, parents and charities will have much greater freedom to set up schools which respond to local needs. We want to encourage competition and innovation, to address the imbalance of opportunity in education and enable schools to develop their own identity. Our approach will increase choice and drive up standards across the country and provide a real opportunity to transform the lives of disadvantaged children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para54"><a name="1007264000241">We know that many individuals and organisations are passionate about improving standards in education, and they will want to take advantage of the new freedoms. But we do not want to squander the opportunities that they represent, for lack of suitable school premises. Neither do we want to strangle proposals with red tape, by putting them through a lengthy and ponderous planning process. So we want to make it easier for promoters of schools to build new premises, or find and if necessary adapt buildings suitable for the needs of a school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para55"><a name="1007264000242">We are already giving a strong message to local planning authorities that they must be more responsive to the needs of their own area. We are empowering them to take more responsibility for planning decision-making, by removing centralised targets and streamlining national planning policy. We are also encouraging them to take a more proactive and positive, collaborative approach to development at the pre-application stage. The best authorities work with applicants to identify the key issues and how they might be resolved, before the planning application is submitted. In this way, they have the opportunity to work with development promoters, to bring about imaginative, but practical solutions, which will benefit their local community. This is what we would like to see happening with new free schools.</p>

In the case of the Film Council, for example, this will include its current responsibilities for the distribution of lottery funding for films, which will be maintained, as well as support for the certification process which is critical to the film tax relief, which will also be maintained.

 Joint Warrior is a bi-annual tri-service major exercise with invited NATO and allied nations and usually takes place over a two-week period in the spring and autumn. Its aim is to provide high-quality joint collective training and pre-deployment training in a multi-threat environment for participating units and their staffs. Each unit will operate from various bases in the UK and abroad but specifically there is an increase in air and land activity across Wales, Scotland and the border regions of England, as well as an increase in maritime activity in the north and west of Scotland.</p>

The next exercise, Joint Warrior 102, commences on 4 October 2010 and a press release will be issued for public information.</p>

For disadvantaged pupils, a gap opens at KS1 and increases over time. Pupils entitled to free school meals (FSM) are only a third as likely to achieve five good GCSEs as their peers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para82"><a name="1007264000273">These gaps persist through to higher education. A pupil who has been entitled to FSM is less than half as likely to go on to study at university as their peers. In the last year for which we have data, out of a cohort of 600,000 pupils, 80,000 pupils were eligible for free school meals, and of those, just 45 made it to Oxbridge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para83"><a name="1007264000274">Addressing this disparity is a top priority of the coalition Government and it is for this reason that we are implementing a pupil premium, to ensure that extra funding is targeted at those deprived pupils that most need it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para84"><a name="1007264000275">The coalition document specified that this will be:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para85"><a name="1007264000276">The consultation sets out our proposed methodology for allocating the premium, including options on the best deprivation indicator to use. This money will not be ring-fenced at school level as I believe that schools are in the best position to decide how the premium should be used to support their pupils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para86"><a name="1007264000277">We are also using this consultation to set out our proposals for possible additional support for service children, as set out in "The Coalition: our programme for government". Furthermore, I have included proposals for additional support for looked after children, who have consistently low attainment but are often not picked up by deprivation indicators and so would not benefit from the pupil premium.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para87"><a name="1007264000278">The consultation document also outlines our intentions for school funding for 2011-12. We will continue with the current methodology for the distribution of school funding to allow for a clear and transparent introduction of the pupil premium, but we also recognise that the funding system could be more reflective of pupil characteristics and so we intend to review the system for funding schools beyond 2011-12.</p>

The amendment will ensure that the scheme can provide measures for all customers whose applications have been accepted and that it can manage the Warm Front budget effectively in advance of the spending review outcome.

Power will be devolved to the front-line. Liberating the NHS will fundamentally change the role of the Department and those bodies accountable to it.

The Government have guaranteed that spending on health will increase in real terms in every year of this Parliament and are committed to increasing the proportion of resource available for front-line services, to meet the current financial challenges and the future costs of demographic and technological change. This means that we need to make significant cuts in the costs of health bureaucracy. Over the next four years, the Government will reduce NHS administrative costs by more than 45%, freeing up resources for front-line care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para106"><a name="1007264000300">The review has assessed arm's-length bodies in light of both the current financial challenges and the strategy for the NHS set out in "Equity and excellence: Liberating the NHS". Only those functions which need to be carried out a national level to support the Department's clear objectives should remain in the sector. Functions that are better delivered by other parts of the system should be devolved to the right level, and organisations that carry out these functions should be abolished. Shifting functions from public bodies back into the Department, or to those who are closer to local needs and are independent of the state, will ensure more direct accountability to local people, Parliament and Ministers.</p>

comprehensive report makes a broad range of significant recommendations for reducing costs in the civil justice system in England and Wales. The Government are very grateful to Sir Rupert for his report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para135"><a name="1007264000339">CFAs have played a role in giving access to justice to a range of people. However, high costs under the existing arrangements have now become a serious concern, particularly in clinical negligence cases against the NHS Litigation Authority and in defamation proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para136"><a name="1007264000340">CFAs are a type of "no win no fee" agreements under which lawyers are not paid if they lose a case, but can charge an uplift on top of their base costs-otherwise known as a "success fee"-if they win. Success fees allow lawyers to cover the costs of cases they take on which do not succeed. The success fee can be up to 100% of base costs. After-the-event (ATE) insurance can be taken out by parties to a CFA funded case to protect them against the risk of having to pay their opponent's costs if they lose. Under the current arrangements, success fees and ATE premiums can be recovered from the losing opponent in addition to the base costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para137"><a name="1007264000341">Sir Rupert recommends significant changes to the current arrangements for CFAs. He proposes abolishing the recoverability of both success fees and ATE insurance premiums; this would require primary legislation. In addition, to assist claimants to meet the cost of the success fees for which they would now be liable, he also recommends an increase of 10% in the level of general damages for personal injury, defamation and other tort claims; and a regime of qualified one-way costs shifting in specified proceedings, including personal injury and defamation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para138"><a name="1007264000342">Our consultation in the autumn would also seek views on other related recommendations on funding arrangements such as whether lawyers should be permitted to enter into damages-based agreements (DBAs) or "contingency fees" in litigation. DBAs are also a type of "no win no fee" agreements which allow a lawyer to take a percentage of the claimant's damages for taking on the claim. DBAs are commonly used in employment tribunals but are not permitted in litigation before the courts. This consultation will take account of any relevant legal aid reform proposals on which we will also be seeking views in the autumn, as previously announced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para139"><a name="1007264000343">Work is also progressing on a number of other areas covered by Sir Rupert's review, but will not form part of the Government's consultation in the autumn. The Government are considering the recommendations on fixed recoverable costs in the fast track, and on referral fees. The Legal Services Board is looking at the issue of referral fees, and their conclusions will inform the Government's position. We will also consider Lord Young of Graffham's conclusions from his "Review of Health and Safety Law and the Compensation Culture". Separately, the Civil Justice Council will consult over the summer on a voluntary code of conduct for third party funders, as recommended by Sir Rupert. Third party funding is an arrangement whereby a party not directly relevant to the proceedings agrees to fund the case in return for a share of the damages awarded.</p>

 For two winters in a row, severe weather has caused significant disruption for transport in this country. The cost to the economy and the disruption to the public has been significant, and there has been a level of dissatisfaction and confusion about the response by Government at both local and national level. This is unacceptable and must be resolved before the next winter season. An independent review of the transport sector's response to last winter was commissioned by my predecessor as Secretary of State and I have asked David Quarmby CBE, who leads it, to continue that work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para152"><a name="1007264000360">The review panel's interim report is being published today; and I am grateful to David Quarmby, Brian Smith, Chris Green, and those who have supported them, for their thoughtful and forthright analysis and recommendations.

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para155"><a name="1007264000363">I welcome the recommendation that the Highways Agency should build up a strategic salt supply of last resort for 2010-11, given the particular re-stocking challenges for local highway authorities for this coming winter. I have instructed the Highways Agency immediately  to consider how arrangements could be implemented  to source a volume of imported salt to establish and manage national strategic stockpiles of up to 250,000 tonnes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para156"><a name="1007264000364">In taking action to create strategic salt reserves for the 2010-11 winter season, the Highways Agency will clearly need to take account of the constraints imposed by the availability of salt from overseas and immediate storage facilities. It is important, as the review makes clear, that local highway authorities do not treat the possibility of such a supply as absolving them from the need to make appropriate provision for their highway networks. I urge local highway authorities to take forward the recommendations that relate to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para157"><a name="1007264000365">The experience of last winter has shown that adopting standards and methods which reduce the utilisation of salt without compromising effectiveness will both reduce vulnerability to salt supply problems and reduce the cost to the local highway authority. It is therefore vital that authorities share best practice across the sector and my Department will discuss with the UK Roads Liaison Group how best we can support this aim for this winter and in the longer term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para158"><a name="1007264000366">Although highway authorities have a duty, as far as practicable, to keep their highways clear of snow and ice, it was clear from last winter that many members of the public were keen to show community spirit in clearing the footways outside their property. It was equally clear, however, that many were uncertain of their rights and liabilities if they were to act in this way. The interim report recommends (as does a recent report by the Local Government Association) that the Department for Transport should produce a brief guide to help the public understand this area of the law. I have tasked my officials to produce this by the end of October, not in the spirit of laying down what people should or should not do, but in the spirit of empowering those who wish to act in a neighbourly way.</p>

west midlands set out in the recent report by HS2 Ltd. This consultation closed on 17 June. Around 4,500 responses were received. This statement sets out my response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para161"><a name="1007264000370">It is clear from the responses to the consultation that there is overwhelming support for a scheme to be introduced to provide assistance for those most severely affected by HS2 Ltd's proposed line. I can therefore confirm that an exceptional hardship scheme will be introduced, and that it will be open to applications from Friday 20 August.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para162"><a name="1007264000371">The introduction of the scheme recognises the unique nature of the proposed line, which is only the second high-speed rail project to be considered in the UK and which differs significantly from its predecessor in terms of its design, operation and potential market. It should therefore not be taken as setting any precedent for future infrastructure schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para163"><a name="1007264000372">Respondents to the consultation also made many suggestions as to how the terms of the scheme might be altered. I have considered these and have made the following changes from the scheme put forward for consultation. First, the scheme will be widened to include owner-occupiers of agricultural units and commercial properties with an annual rateable value not exceeding £34,800; this brings it in line with the blight provisions under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Secondly, the scheme will also be able to cover properties recently inherited following a bereavement and repossessed properties that the original owner urgently requires the bank or other lender to sell to realise some value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para164"><a name="1007264000373">A number of respondents asked for the scheme to be extended to properties over tunnelled sections of the proposed line of route. It is my view, however, that any blighting effects over tunnels are likely to be limited, and this is reinforced by the additional information note on the effects of tunnelling which HS2 Ltd has published on its website today. However, I accept that there is a need to make special provision in relation to properties close to the proposed entrances and exits of tunnels. I have therefore decided to extend the scheme to cover these properties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para165"><a name="1007264000374">Finally, I have decided that the panel which makes recommendations to me on applications to the scheme should have a majority of independent members, although this will not be the case for the shadow panel announced in my written ministerial statement of 27 May 2010, <i>Official Report</i>, column 15WS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para166"><a name="1007264000375">In other respects, the scheme will operate as set out in the consultation document. In particular, the scheme will apply only to properties on or in the vicinity of HS2 Ltd's route option 3. HS2 Ltd's report makes a clear recommendation and it is therefore my view that assistance of this kind should be focused on this route, where the blight impacts will be most severe. It is also my conclusion that, to minimise the risk of blight spreading as a result of a scheme of this kind, it should be limited to those who have a pressing need to sell and who would otherwise experience exceptional hardship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para167"><a name="1007264000376">A large proportion of consultation responses also raised issues in relation to longer-term provision to address blight. If a decision is taken following public consultation to proceed with a new high-speed line and to safeguard the route that it would follow, statutory blight arrangements would come into force covering those properties which would have to be acquired in  <br>

order to build or operate the new line. However, many respondents suggested that additional provision would be needed to cover those properties which would not have to be acquired but which might still be seriously affected by the construction or operation of the line. Respondents also made a number of proposals for how such provision might be structured. I am aware that provision of this kind has been made in respect of a number of previous schemes in both the public and private sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para168"><a name="1007264000377">I am mindful of the importance of appropriate longer-term arrangements to assist those who would be most seriously affected by a new line. I agree that some additional provision over and above the statutory blight regime will be needed to achieve this, and it is therefore my intention that this should be put in place, if and when a decision is taken to safeguard a route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para169"><a name="1007264000378">The specific issues raised in response to the consultation, particularly in respect of the different models for operating such arrangements, are complex and require detailed consideration. I have therefore asked my officials to provide me with further advice on options for the terms and conditions of such additional provision and how it should operate. I will report to Parliament on my proposed way forward in the light of the spending review outcome and before public consultation on the Government's strategy for high-speed rail and the route of any new high speed line.</p>

take the work of the joint strategic board forward as quickly as possible I have asked Chris Bourne, a non-executive director of Trinity House, to act as chair of the board. In his role as chair of the joint strategic board Mr Bourne will take an independent and impartial view of the issues, and will report to me on the board's achievements. His extensive shipping background and knowledge of the work of the general lighthouse authorities make him an excellent choice for this role. In the longer term, the Government will look at the appointment of a chair for the joint strategic board from outside the three general lighthouse authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para173"><a name="1007264000383">The Government have also decided that it is right, particularly in current economic circumstances, to ask the general lighthouse authorities to deliver reductions in their running costs below the level of inflation and welcome the commitment by the general lighthouse authorities to delivering this challenge. The precise target will be agreed with the general lighthouse authorities alongside the development of their corporate plans and budgets for 2011 to 2014 that are submitted to me for consideration in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="100726m0001.htm_para174"><a name="1007264000384">In this difficult economic period the Government also wish to provide long term stability and reassurance, both for light dues payers in the level of charges they face and for the general lighthouse authorities so they can plan effectively with budgetary stability. The responses received to my request for comments on the Atkins recommendations suggest that there is little appetite to make major changes to the structure and scope of light dues payable by ships visiting our shores. I do not therefore intend to change the basis on which light dues are currently charged, although I will continue to work with all interested parties to seek an equitable means of ensuing that all those who benefit from the provision and supervision of marine aids to navigation by the general lighthouse authorities pay towards their provision where it is viable, practicable and economic to do so.</p>
