Minister for the Middle East (Dr. Kim Howells):</b> With the
support of Her Majesty's Government, the United Nations Security
Council on 14 October 2006 unanimously adopted UNSCR 1718 (2006) under
Chapter VII of the UN Charter. The Security Council's rapid and
decisive action, in response to DPRK's nuclear test on 9 October, sends
a strong signal to the DPRK Government that the international community
will not tolerate its irresponsible and provocative
actions.</p><p><a name="06103038000013">The
resolution is targeted at stopping the DPRK's WMD and missile
programmes and changing the behaviour of the regime in Pyongyang. We
now expect the DPRK to comply with the resolution and return to the six
party talks without pre-conditions. If it does comply fully with the
resolution's provisions and if the talks resume successfully, the UK
would expect the Security Council to lift the measures imposed by the
resolution.</p><p><a name="06103038000014">The
resolution backs these demands by imposing sanctions against the DPRK.
All states have a legal obligation to comply. The individual sanctions
comprise an assets freeze and travel ban on individuals and entities
involved in or supporting DPRK's nuclear and ballistic-missile
programmes; a ban on making funds available to those individuals and
entities; a ban on the export or supply of certain substantial military
items, nuclear materials, missiles and sensitive technologies; the
export of luxury goods; the provision of any technical assistance,
training or other advice in relation to the military or
nuclear/ballistic-missile items and the procurement of any of the
sensitive items so that DPRK can not export proliferation-sensitive
technologies to other countries. The resolution also includes a
provision calling upon states to inspect cargo going to and from DPRK
subject to action being in conformity with international law and member
states' own national laws, where such action is necessary to prevent
illicit trafficking in prohibited goods and
materials.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="61030m0001.htmdpthd_2"><a name="06103038000002">Health</h3><h4 align="center"><a name="61030m0001.htmstpa_1"><a name="06103038000006">Medical

Officer was asked to consider the role of medical expert witnesses in
relation to family law cases and in particular to examine the
experts&#146; participation throughout the process, and the
competencies needed; to examine evidence of best practice for expert

Liam reported to Ministers at the Department of Health and the
Department for Education and Skills in 2005, in his independent
capacity as Chief Medical Officer for England and chief medical advisor
to the United Kingdom Government. I have been considering the next
steps, in consultation with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State,
Department for Education and Skills (Parmjit Dhanda) and the Minister
of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs (Harriet
Harman), and we are pleased to announce that we have decided
Sir Liam's report should form the basis for a consultation document,

been placed in the Library and is available on the Department's website

is of paramount importance that we secure medical expertise in family

Hospice at Home Grant have now been considered by a group which
included key stakeholders and I am pleased to announce that 35 hospice

the same time as announcing this grant I announced a review of
children's hospice services and subsequently announced in a written
ministerial statement on 18 September that the review had been extended
to consider the long term sustainability of children's palliative care
services and funding more generally. I am pleased to announce that
Professor Sir Alan Craft and Ms Sue Killen have agreed to lead
this important review. The consultation phase of this review commenced
in October and contributions are being sought. Contact can be made with
the review team at childpalliativecare@dh.gsi.gov.uk. I expect the
review to be completed by spring 2007.</p><br>

paper on a new charging regime for immigration and nationality fees,

to our border security and enforcement capability set out in the IND
review last
July.</p><p><a name="06103038000026">Migration
and tourism benefit Britain greatly. But to continue to welcome
legitimate migrants, we need an immigration system that is fair and
effective. The integrity of the immigration system depends on robust
borders, with effective security overseas and in the UK ensuring and
enforcing compliance with our immigration laws. As the Home Office
implements the measures outlined in the IND Review, and improved
controls and measures are introduced overseas and in-country by the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Home Office jointly, we need to
consider how immigration and nationality services are paid for and
whether our charging strategy should better reflect the end-to-end cost
of the whole immigration system. We want improved enforcement of a fair
and effective immigration system. We believe that it is right that a
greater contribution towards the costs of maintaining such a system
should fall to those for whom immigration to our country brings
benefits and
rewards.</p><p><a name="06103038000028">The

valuable contribution they make to economic growth and the way that
they enrich our society through cultural
exchange.</p><p><a name="06103038000030">The
consultation paper sets out some options on how we charge for our
immigration and nationality services. We want a genuine debate on the
most appropriate way to charge, and hope that key stakeholders and
members of the public engage with this consultation process. We will be
holding a number of stakeholder events throughout the consultation
period in order to get the views and ideas of as many people as
possible.</p><p><a name="06103038000032">Copies
