 My noble Friend the Minister for Communications, Technology and Broadcasting, Lord Carter of Barnes, has made the following statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="90325m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09032541000019">I am pleased to confirm the agenda items for which BERR has responsibility at the forthcoming Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council (Telecoms Council) in Brussels on 31 March 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="90325m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09032541000020">There are only two substantive agenda items, the first of which is the adoption of Council conclusions on the Commission&#146;s Communication for an accessible information society. The UK welcomes and supports the timing of this communication which is in line with recommendations recently made in the cross-Government report &#147;Delivering Digital Inclusion - An Action Plan for Consultation&#148;. Both the cross-Government paper and the Digital Britain report are also looking at what the Government can do to stimulate take-up and access of digital technologies in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="90325m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09032541000021">This will be followed by an exchange of views on the impact of the economic downturn on ICT and how ICT can boost the EU&#146;s economy. As the Government&#146;s interim Digital Britain report highlighted, ICT is one of the sectors which we all rely upon to underpin our whole economy, as its effective utilisation can deliver productivity gains to our citizens and enterprises. This discussion will provide an opportunity to introduce our thinking for taking Digital Britain forward, and listen to the plans and proposals other Ministers are considering to enable ICT to accelerate longer term growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="90325m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09032541000022">In addition to these two substantive items, there are four further items for which BERR has responsibility listed under any other business. The first of these will be an update from the Council presidency on negotiations on a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on interoperability solutions for European public administrations (ISA Programme). The UK supports the proposed programme as its predecessors have proved successful in delivering guidelines, common frameworks, studies on cross-border communication and IT&#151;enabled service platforms for the delivery of community policies and activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="90325m0001.htm_para4"><a name="09032541000023">The presidency will then provide information on the recent 112 Day. To mark 112 Day in the UK, I wrote to other Government Departments who could play a role in raising awareness of the pan-European emergency number. We are currently undertaking follow up work on this with the Foreign Office and Identity and Passport Service (IPS).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="90325m0001.htm_para5"><a name="09032541000024">The Commission will then present their Communication on mobilising information and communication technologies to facilitate the transition to an energy-efficient, low- carbon economy. The UK agrees with the aims of this Communication which seeks to raise awareness of the potential ICT has to improve efficiency of European enterprises, including public sector, systems and processes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="90325m0001.htm_para6"><a name="09032541000025">Lastly, the presidency will provide an update on the review of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services. On the same day as the Council, the European Parliament are voting in Committee stage on this review package, followed by their plenary vote on 22 April. I will shortly be writing to hon. Members with explanatory memoranda on the Commission&#146;s response to the Council common position, and will take the opportunity to update hon. Members on the progress of negotiations.</p>

Commissioner Reding will present the forthcoming communication on Communication and Information Infrastructure Protection. I understand the communication will recommend broad standards on the resilience of critical ICT infrastructure and on member states&#146; national response capacity to ensure the provision of telecoms services.</p>

 On 25 March, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) published a report setting out its findings on the effectiveness of the Payments Council in meeting its objectives. The Payments Council started work in March 2007, following an agreement in November 2006 by the OFT-chaired payment systems taskforce that a new body be created to provide strategic direction for the UK&#146;s payment industry. The taskforce set three key objectives for the Payments Council:</p>
<a name="90325m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="09032541000086"><ul><p class="tabletext">to lead the future development of co-operative payment services in the United Kingdom;</p>
</ul><a name="90325m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="09032541000087"><ul><p class="tabletext">to ensure that the payment system is open and accountable; and</p>
</ul><a name="90325m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="09032541000088"><ul><p class="tabletext">to ensure the operational efficiency, effectiveness and integrity of payment services in the United Kingdom, through a focus on issues which cross schemes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="90325m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09032541000028">The taskforce agreed that the OFT would carry out a review of the effectiveness of the new governance body (subsequently named the Payments Council), after two years of its operation. This was to ensure that the objectives of the new body were being met and delivered on in practice. This statement highlights the key findings and recommendations in the OFT review of the operations of the Payments Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="90325m0001.htm_para9"><a name="09032541000029">The OFT report concludes that the Payments Council is a definite improvement on what prevailed before its creation. The Payments Council&#146;s consultation on a national payments plan, setting out the strategic direction it should pursue over the next five to 10 years, was widely welcomed by stakeholders, and contributed to its objective on openness and accountability. The introduction of the faster payments scheme (FPS) in  <br>

May 2007 represented a substantial innovation. Users of the system will be able to make telephone and internet payments within a matter of hours, rather than over three working days as under the BACS system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="90325m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09032541000030">While the introduction of the faster payment scheme was a real achievement, the rolling out of faster payment services by many banks to their customers has been relatively slow. The report finds that the Payments Council should be more proactive in following up its initiatives with members and should also consider widening its membership and making more effective use of user groups, to ensure that end users get the benefits envisaged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="90325m0001.htm_para11"><a name="09032541000031">The OFT report recommends that the Payments Council increases the emphasis on its integrity objective in future. Although the safety and security of payment systems have not been compromised, the Payments Council has not added value quickly enough, and this is an area where it needs to improve. The OFT considers that the Payments Council should commission an accountancy firm to report in two years on how well it has performed against its integrity objective. The report (or the executive summary of it) should be published in the Payments Council&#146;s Annual Review, and the Payments Council should outline how it intends to address any action points identified in it. Following the review from the accountancy firm, the Payments Council should self-assess against its integrity objective using the same procedure described below for its other objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="90325m0001.htm_para12"><a name="09032541000032">The OFT also recommends that the Payments Council provides a self-assessment against progress every two years on:</p>
<a name="90325m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="09032541000089"><ul><p class="tabletext">its strategic direction and openness and accountability objectives;</p>
</ul><a name="90325m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="09032541000090"><ul><p class="tabletext">recommendations of the taskforce where these have not been met; and</p>
</ul><a name="90325m0001.htm_brev5"><a name="09032541000091"><ul><p class="tabletext">recommendations coming out of this OFT report.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="90325m0001.htm_para13"><a name="09032541000033">This self-assessment should contain the results of an open consultation with stakeholders on progress against objectives. The OFT may still choose to look into specific aspects of the Payments Council&#146;s performance against objectives, if it considers there to be sufficient reason.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="90325m0001.htm_para14"><a name="09032541000034">The Government welcome the OFT work to review the effectiveness of the Payments Council, and welcomes the recommendations made. I am writing today to the chair of the Payments Council to note the Government&#146;s continued interest in the future work of the Payments Council.</p>

final report of the review, with detailed recommendations, was published in July 2008. The review identified the specific challenges facing rural areas but recognises that, &#147;contrary to an often outdated view of the countryside, the economies of rural and urban England are much more alike than many people might imagine&#148;. The Government will therefore give local authorities more flexibility to tackle the issues their communities face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="90325m0001.htm_para16"><a name="09032541000037">Our response sets out our proposals to take forward most of the review&#146;s 48 recommendations to continue to encourage a prosperous rural economy and improve the delivery of affordable rural homes. This will help businesses, councils and the wider community, particularly in the current challenging economic conditions, and will assist rural communities in becoming more sustainable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="90325m0001.htm_para17"><a name="09032541000038">We welcome the review as giving important emphasis to what it takes to develop and sustain a strong rural economy, and improve access to a range of housing.

This reflects a positive trend; for example, the UN mission in Darfur moving towards full strength. And it also reflects some new commitments. These include the decision by the Security Council in Resolution 1863 to provide a package of logistical support to the African Union mission in Somalia and its decision to reinforce MONUC, the UN mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), following the renewed hostilities in eastern DRC.</p>

We have therefore undertaken an exercise to prioritise UK discretionary conflict expenditure more tightly on countries where the risk and impact of conflict is greatest. An outline of the revised programmes is provided below.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="90325m0002.htm_para2"><a name="09032541000056">The total allocation for <i>South Asia, including Afghanistan</i>, will now be &#163;61.3 million. This will allow us fully to sustain current levels of conflict related activity in Afghanistan, reflecting the very high priority which we attach to stabilisation in that country. A large proportion of the available resources will be spent on stabilisation programmes in Helmand, including on capacity building of the provincial institutions, communications with the Afghan people, counter narcotics and the rule of law. The priority given to this region sees a continuation of current levels of financial support for India/Pakistan issues, Sri Lanka and Nepal and an increase in support for work on the Afghanistan/Pakistan border.</p>

The balance of resources will necessarily shift away from West and Southern Africa towards East Africa and the Horn in line with PSA 30 with a few exceptions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="90325m0002.htm_para4"><a name="09032541000058">In <i>Wider Europe</i>, the total allocation will now be &#163;33 million. This will allow us to maintain our national contribution to United Nations Forces in Africa (UNFICYP), the UN peacekeeping operation in Cyprus, in 2009-10. NATO has informed us that the current UK contribution to KFOR, the NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo, is no longer required and we will therefore make plans to draw this down. We will fund a reduced level of commitment to EU and OSCE operations in the Balkans and the Caucasus, and continue to fund conflict prevention work in the Balkans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="90325m0002.htm_para5"><a name="09032541000059">In <i>the Middle East</i>, we will prioritise work in Iraq, Israel/Palestine and Lebanon within a revised programme of &#163;18 million. A majority of the resource available will support stabilisation activity in Iraq. The allocation will also allow us to continue to support the emerging conflict prevention programme in Yemen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="90325m0002.htm_para6"><a name="09032541000060"><i>The &#163;6.5 million thematic programme including support for international organisations</i> will provide resources for a security sector reform advisory capacity, a peacekeeping training capacity, defence education within priority countries, and support for the United Nations&#146; Rule of Law Unit, Department of Peacekeeping Operations and Peacebuilding Support Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="90325m0002.htm_para7"><a name="09032541000061">The need to prioritise within the limited resources available means that we have taken a decision to discontinue funding the CPP programme in <i>Latin America</i>. We will maintain the UK&#146;s significant contribution in the region on such issues as human rights and democracy; countering the illegal drugs trade; and climate change. Our embassies will also continue to work alongside international partners including the UN on conflict issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="90325m0002.htm_para8"><a name="09032541000062">Within the &#163;171 million we will retain a small central reserve to act primarily as a buffer against fluctuations in the exchange rate and increases in assessed peacekeeping or other conflict related costs. The likely cost of the assessed contributions will be reviewed regularly, so that any likely underspend or overspend against the upper limit of &#163;456 can be identified and addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="90325m0002.htm_para9"><a name="09032541000063">This process has involved a series of difficult decisions and we will not be able to fund all areas of activity to the same level as in previous years. However, we are confident that the rigorous approach to prioritisation which has been taken, as well as the additional &#163;71 million allocated by Departments, should allow us to maintain our significant contribution to international peacekeeping, and to fund essential conflict prevention and stabilisation activity in priority regions.</p>

 In my role as the Government&#146;s anti-corruption champion I am pleased to inform the House that I have today laid before Parliament the draft Bribery Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny (&#147;Bribery - Draft Legislation&#148; Cm 7570). This is in accordance with the Government&#146;s Legislative Programme as set out in the written statement by my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House of Commons on 4 December 2008, <i>Official Report</i>, column 12WS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="90325m0002.htm_para13"><a name="09032541000069">The Bill describes a modern, clear and consolidated law that will support our commitment to high ethical standards generally and will equip our courts and prosecutors to deal effectively with bribery of all kinds whether it occurs at home or abroad. I believe these provisions strike the right balance between clarity and detail, so as to allow for both legal certainty and the effective differentiation between bribery and the legitimate giving and receiving of advantages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="90325m0002.htm_para14"><a name="09032541000070">Our current criminal law of bribery is old and anachronistic and can be difficult for prosecutors, courts and members of the public. Statutory law is fragmented and dates back to around the turn of the 20th century. It is unconsolidated, resulting in inconsistencies of language and concepts between the various provisions and one or two small but potentially significant gaps in the law. The scope of the common law offence is unclear, adding to inconsistency and overall complexity. These issues have been noted at home and abroad, most notably by the OECD Bribery Working Group. It is clear that, from a purely legal perspective, the case for reform is strong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="90325m0002.htm_para15"><a name="09032541000071">This is, however, much more than a desire for an orderly statute book. While the United Kingdom is recognised as one of the least corrupt countries in the world we do not underestimate the threat posed by bribery. If it is not kept in check bribery can destroy the integrity, accountability and honesty that underpin ethical standards in public and commercial life. By its very nature insidious and difficult to root out, bribery worldwide  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="90325m0002.htm_para16"><a name="09032541000072">As advances in technology and communication enable ever more sophisticated means of committing and concealing crimes, we must ensure that our law provides our courts and prosecutors with the tools they need to combat such crime effectively. Over the years it has become clear that a law that has narrow national focus will not fulfil this role. The global economy is a reality. Modernisation of the law is therefore a priority, not only to deal effectively with those who offer or accept bribes in our business or public sectors, but also to reinforce transparency and accountability in our international business transactions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="90325m0002.htm_para17"><a name="09032541000073">Law reform is one of the key elements of the UK&#146;s strategy against foreign bribery, which I am co-coordinating in my role as Government anti-corruption champion as announced in my statement of 2 October 2008. Concerted multilateral action is essential to tackle the global impact of bribery and related issues such as money laundering. Co-operation with our international partners is producing significant progress in areas such as the tracing, recovery and repatriation of money laundered misappropriated assets. In addition we are supporting effective implementation of the UN Convention against corruption, the OECD Bribery Convention and the Council of Europe&#146;s Criminal Law Convention on Corruption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="90325m0002.htm_para18"><a name="09032541000074">The Bill builds on the Law Commission proposals set out in its report &#147;Reforming Bribery&#148; in November 2008. I would like to express my gratitude to the Law Commission for its excellent report. The Bill&#146;s principal provisions create two general offences; one dealing with the giving, promising, and offering of a bribe and the other with agreeing to receive or acceptance of a bribe. It provides a new discrete offence of bribery of a foreign public official and a new corporate liability offence of negligently failing to prevent bribery. The detail of these and the other remaining provisions of the Bill are explained in full in the explanatory notes published along side the Bill. My officials have shared details of our proposed legislation with colleagues in Scotland. It will be for the Scottish Ministers to consider whether any similar changes will be necessary to Scots law.</p>

The second is an amending regulation extending the responsibilities of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to the safety of aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services.
