 &#147;The Future of Rail&#148; White Paper and the Railways Act 2005 set out a new role for Transport for London (TfL) in relation to rail, giving them more say in the specification of rail services and allowing them greater flexibility to make choices about the balance between rail and other modes. I am today publishing guidance that explains how the new role of TfL in the franchise specification, letting and management process under the Railways Act 2005, will work in practice. Copies of the guidance have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and can also be found on the Department for Transport&#146;s website at: www.dft.gov.uk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="70718m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07071863000016">The London suburban commuter rail network does not stop at the GLA boundary. Certain rail services terminate just outside the Greater London area. Because of this the Mayor and TfL were not able to propose changes to &#147;inner suburban&#148; services, to improve service levels or better integrate services with other transport modes. &#147;The Future of Rail&#148; White Paper set out a commitment to change this by enabling TfL to specify and pay for enhancements to these services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="70718m0001.htm_para3"><a name="07071863000017">Following consultation on the proposal, I am today announcing that TfL, as part of the franchise specification  <br>

process, can propose and pay for extra train services or improvements to stations on a number of these &#147;inner suburban&#148; routes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="70718m0001.htm_para4"><a name="07071863000018">It is vital to ensure that the rights and interests of rail passengers outside London are protected by those democratically accountable to them. Therefore TfL will be required to consult with Local Transport Authorities in the affected areas beyond the boundary, as well as Regional Assemblies, and London TravelWatch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="70718m0001.htm_para5"><a name="07071863000019">Were TfL to seek any reductions to service levels, the governance arrangements are stronger. TfL would be required to obtain the agreement of affected Local Transport Authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="70718m0001.htm_para7"><a name="07071863000021">Section 17 of the Railways Act 2005 amends schedule 10 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 so as to ensure that within six months of section 17 coming into force the membership of the TfL board includes at least two members who can represent the interests of people living, working and studying in areas outside Greater London served by rail services running into London. A commencement order bringing section 17 of the Railways Act 2005 into force on 8 August 2007 was made on 10 July 2007.</p>

TfL will not be able to propose changes to fares on &#147;inner suburban&#148; routes that run beyond the boundary. As a general rule, TfL will not be allowed to propose additional stops on long distance and inter-city services, although the Department will look at individual proposals on a case by case basis.</p>
