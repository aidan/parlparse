The presidency noted that Europe continued to face major challenges, for example from globalisation. ECOFIN&#146;s work under the German presidency would reflect this, including through further integration of the internal market.</p>

This paper stresses the need for a Single Market which allows European businesses to compete in global markets, while fostering innovation and market dynamism. A revised strategy should therefore focus on driving up competition and take prioritised action where the potential economic benefits are greatest, based on clear evidence, and use a wider range of policy tools to achieve a well-functioning single market. The UK also said that enhancing EU-US economic relations and tackling unfair tax competition had a part to play.</p>

The report concluded that the nine member states assessed did not fulfil all the convergence criteria, however the Commission noted significant progress was being made on inflation, fiscal stability and exchange rates.</p>

As a consequence the role and function of HM Fire Service Inspectorate has changed and it no longer undertakes its original core role of inspecting all fire and rescue services in England.

The Information Commissioner's report &#147;What Price Privacy?&#148;. The unlawful trade in confidential personal information highlighted the extent of the illegal trade in personal information and recommended custodial sentences for offences relating to the misuse of personal data. The Government believe that the existing financial penalties are not sufficiently protecting people's personal data.</p>
</ul><a name="70208m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="07020840000058"><ul><p class="tabletext">The consultation period closed on 30 October 2006. The majority of responses welcomed the introduction of custodial penalties to provide a larger deterrence to potential offenders, to provide public reassurance that offenders would receive the appropriate sentence and to achieve parity with a number of disparate pieces of legislation which, deal with similar types of offences.</p>
</ul><a name="70208m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="07020840000059"><ul><p class="tabletext">Our reforms to the Data Protection Act fit squarely within the Government's wider strategy on data sharing. As the Government move to an era of greater data sharing&#151;to deliver better, more customer-focused services and to protect the security of both individuals and society as a whole&#151;it is essential for people to be confident that their personal data will not be wilfully or recklessly abused.</p>

The Government are clear that custodial penalties will be reserved for the most serious breaches of the Act. We will seek to introduce an amendment to the Act as soon as parliamentary time allows.&#148;</p>
