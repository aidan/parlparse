The UK offered strong support for the Commission's European innovation partnerships concept, but felt access to finance for innovation was a problem. It believed EU funding could be used to augment existing national pre-commercial procurement schemes. The UK also pointed to problems relating to the implementation of the EU clinical trials directive which it saw as hampering innovation in the pharmaceuticals sector.</p>

One change was made to the draft and sent to Council at the request of the presidency-a reference to the importance of work on biomarkers in the pilot joint programming initiative on neurodegenerative diseases was weakened. The presidency updated the Council on recent efforts to strengthen the European research area and on the work of the strategic forum for international science and technology co-operation.</p>

 To mark the International Day of Disabled Persons today, on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, the Forced Marriage Unit (a joint Home Office/Foreign and Commonwealth Office unit) launches multi-agency practice guidelines for supporting people with learning disabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="101203m0001.htm_para57"><a name="10120332000079">The guidelines have been developed to assist frontline professionals, such as the police, children and adults social care services, education and health professionals, care workers, charities and volunteers handling cases of forced marriage involving people with learning disabilities. It covers issues relating to a person's capacity to consent and the use of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 to establish this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="101203m0001.htm_para58"><a name="10120332000080">The document draws on research carried out by the Ann Craft Trust in partnership with the Judith Trust, and statistics on reports to the Forced Marriage Unit's helpline. It complements the "Multi-Agency Practice Guidelines: Handling cases of forced marriage" published by the FMU last year and should be read in conjunction with these.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="101203m0001.htm_para59"><a name="10120332000081">The guidelines can be downloaded from on the Forced Marriage Unit's webpage at: www.fco.gov.uk/forcedmarriage and hard copies will be placed in House Libraries.</p>

Minister responsible for employment relations, consumer and postal affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr Davey).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="101203m0001.htm_para60"><a name="10120332000083">There will be two orientation debates. The first is on the pregnant workers directive, which is being renegotiated in a co-decision procedure between the Council and the European Parliament. As the European Parliament's position goes much further than the Commission's original proposal, and would require 20 weeks' fully paid maternity leave, two weeks' paternity leave and 20 weeks' adoption leave, the UK will not agree to these changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="101203m0001.htm_para61"><a name="10120332000084">The second is on retirement pensions, in particular maintaining a "living standard to a reasonable degree" and our reaction to the Commission's Green Paper. This will include the presentation of a joint report from the Social Protection (SPC) and Economic Policy Committee (EPC) on pensions. The UK will stress the need to ensure that pensioners have the income to live with dignity in retirement and that each member state should find its own balance for public pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="101203m0001.htm_para62"><a name="10120332000085">There will be an exchange of views on the Employment Policies in Europe 2020 and the European Semester. This will include information from the Commission and presidency on the EU 2020 flagship projects "New Skills and Jobs" and "Youth on the Move", approval of two Employment Committee (EMCO) opinions, on employment and climate change and an initial country analysis of the draft national reform programmes, and approval of a joint EMCO-SPC opinion on the Joint Assessment Framework and the Employment Monitor. The UK will stress how important it is that employment is at the heart of the Europe2020 strategy and that there must be a robust methodology for assessments, but it is important to recognise that this should not lead to policy prescriptions in an area that is primarily member state competence.</p>

There are two sets on gender; one on the implementation of the strategy on equality between women and men, and one on the fight against inequalities in salaries between women and men. There are also conclusions on the fight against poverty and social exclusion, employment policy for the low carbon economy, the impact of the ageing workforce, adequate and sustainable pensions, the social dimension of the Europe 2020 strategy and social services of general interest.</p>
