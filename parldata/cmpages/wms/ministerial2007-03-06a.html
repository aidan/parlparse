 In the pre-Budget report (PBR) of 6 December 2006, action was announced to close loopholes used by companies to avoid paying corporation tax. Thanks partly to the disclosure regime, we have now become aware of more schemes similar to those we closed from the date of the PBR.</p>

HMRC has obtained information about a scheme which seeks to avoid the proper application of schedule 26 FA 2002 to relevant contracts which are accounted for as financial assets. Schedule 26 will be amended to provide that such contracts must be brought into account for tax purposes on the assumption that fair value accounting is used in cases where it is not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="70306m0001.htm_para8"><a name="07030649000022">E. HMRC has also obtained information which indicates that it might be possible to frustrate the workings of sections 774A to 774G of the Income and Corporation Tax Act 1988 (structured finance arrangements or SFAs). To put the issue beyond doubt legislation will be introduced to amend those sections so that arrangements under which existing liabilities ape refinanced using an SFA will be brought clearly within the legislation.</p>

 Today I welcome publication of the second report by the adult learning inspectorate (ALI), into the conduct of initial training in the armed forces. In this report, &#147;Better Training&#148;, the ALI publishes its findings on the progress we have made in improving the initial training environment so as to reduce the risks to, and improve the welfare and wellbeing of, recruits and trainees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_387"><a name="70306m0001.htm_para19"><a name="07030649000034">The ALI&#146;s initial review, &#147;Safer Training&#148;, published in March 2005 identified that training in the armed forces, and the care of young people undergoing training, were not sufficiently well managed. The subsequent report of Mr. Blake QC in March 2006 confirmed many of the ALI and, indeed, earlier HCDC findings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"><a name="70306m0001.htm_para20"><a name="07030649000035">Following publication of &#147;Safer Training&#148;, I gave my full commitment to delivering the improvements necessary to correct this situation; we had to ensure the right balance between robust preparation for frontline duties and the absolute necessity to treat our young people fairly and with due care. I also noted at this time that the transparency provided by independent oversight was vital in demonstrating to the wider community that we seek to improve. To that end, the ALI has continued to have unrestricted access to every aspect of our initial training whilst we have sought to implement the necessary improvements. External inspection has proved to be an extremely beneficial process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_389"><a name="70306m0001.htm_para21"><a name="07030649000036">I am pleased to report that substantial improvements have been made everywhere, with some very marked achievements. Against a backdrop of fiercely competing priorities, not least our operational commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan, we have made substantial financial investment to date, with more planned in the coming four years. This investment, over and above that already committed to the training environment, is testament to our resolve. We recognise, however, that money alone will not suffice and have completely overhauled our policies, processes and training, notably for our instructors and commanding officers, to ensure that minimising the risks to trainees&#146; welfare is core activity. The scale of our achievement thus far is recognised in &#147;Better Training&#148; and should provide members of the House and the public with reassurance of the scale and depth of our determination to succeed in this critical area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_390"><a name="70306m0001.htm_para22"><a name="07030649000037">We fully recognise that there is still much to do and &#147;Better Training&#148; identifies a number of areas where performance can be improved. We will remain focused on addressing these issues, while maintaining the improvements already achieved. The improvement programme, vigorously pursued from the outset, has been difficult and demanding, but we are now beginning to reap the rewards. I am confident that our armed forces will continue to receive the training they need  <br>

 The recently released United Nations Office on drugs and crime (UNODC) rapid assessment survey for 2007 is a snapshot that identifies early trends in cultivation. It shows a mixed picture. It suggests that cultivation is down in the north; stable in the centre and west; but heading up in the south and east, including in Helmand, Kandahar, Uruzgan and Nangarhar. It is too early to predict overall cultivation levels for 2007, but if these trends are born out, it shows that Afghanistan may be facing another year of high poppy cultivation. Security challenges, insurgent activity and the lack of extension of rule of law continue to present obstacles toward poppy elimination. The survey also shows similarities with last year&#146;s pattern of cultivation, with a levelling off or reduction in areas of improved access to governance, security and development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_393"><a name="70306m0001.htm_para25"><a name="07030649000042">The threat from drugs to Afghanistan&#146;s reconstruction and development ranks alongside the threat from the Taliban. There are no quick or simple ways of dealing with this problem. The only way to reach a sustainable solution is to deal with the full range of causes. The Afghans know this, but need the international community&#146;s help to make it happen. The Afghan Government&#146;s national drug control strategy (NDCS) is the right approach. It includes measures to reduce the cultivation, production and trafficking of opium. Progress is being made. We are working with the Afghans to build up the criminal justice system and we have helped establish the counter-narcotics police force and the Afghan special narcotics force. In the last year and a half we have seen the passage of vital counter narcotics legislation, the conviction of over 320 traffickers, and an increase in drug related seizures. With the support of international partners a community led programme has been established to develop alternative rural livelihoods that have so far reached some 8.5 million rural Afghans.</p>

It can have a deterrent effect for poppy farmers in areas where there is access to alternative legal livelihoods. Eradication on its own will not solve the drugs problem. But it is an important part of the comprehensive strategy when balanced with measures to interdict drugs, bring criminals to justice, build institutions and encourage development of rural communities to provide alternatives for poppy farmers. Eradication implementation is the responsibility of the  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_395"><a name="70306m0001.htm_para27"><a name="07030649000044">There are no silver bullets. There have been suggestions that the opium poppy crop could be used for licit medical purposes. We have considered options for the licit cultivation of opiates in some detail and the Afghan Government have ruled out licit cultivation as a means of tackling the illicit trade. Currently there are no central Government and law enforcement mechanisms in place to administer such a scheme. In the absence of an effective control system, traffickers would be free to continue operate and there would be a high risk that any licit cultivation would be diverted into the illegal market. Another buyer in the market might also drive up the price, attracting more farmers to cultivate poppy.</p>

Offenders can now be prosecuted without a victim&#146;s statement and previous offences can be admitted as evidence. Specialist victim support is also being rolled out across the country to ensure that victims&#146; safety and welfare come first in the work of the police and partner agencies.</p>
