<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="90709m0001.htm_para16"><a name="09070983000045">The STRB has further recommended that the Department:</p>
<a name="90709m0001.htm_brev6"><a name="09070983000127"><ul><p class="tabletext">undertake regular data collection and analysis to monitor developments in the teacher workforce related to issues of diversity and equality. This should include an ongoing review of matters relating to equal pay and of the extent to which the teaching profession reflects the diversity of the population it serves;</p>
</ul><a name="90709m0001.htm_brev7"><a name="09070983000128"><ul><p class="tabletext">should review and strengthen the ways it encourages schools to use existing recruitment and retention flexibilities to address local teacher shortages in mathematics and other priority subjects; and</p>
</ul><a name="90709m0001.htm_brev8"><a name="09070983000129"><ul><p class="tabletext">should consider the introduction of new financial and other incentives and measures to improve the quantity and quality of the supply of mathematics teachers. If asked to do so, the STRB would welcome the opportunity to explore the form these might take in a future remit.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="90709m0001.htm_para17"><a name="09070983000046">I agree with the STRB&#146;s recommendation about data collection and analysis. That is why my Department is developing the new School Workforce Census which will provide comprehensive data on an annual basis about the individual characteristics, contract details and pay of school teachers. The development is being piloted with a view to full live roll-out in 2010. The data collected from schools and local authorities in England will include age, gender, ethnicity, disability and qualifications&#151;all at individual teacher level&#151;to allow detailed analysis related to diversity and equality issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="90709m0001.htm_para18"><a name="09070983000047">I note that the STRB recommends that my Department should take steps to encourage schools to use existing recruitment and retention flexibilities to address teacher shortages in mathematics and other priority subjects at a local level. Following an earlier consultation on how best to encourage increased use of existing pay flexibilities, there was no appetite for any action plans or guidance or other communications. However, a note was added to the 2008 model pay policy, which states &#147;Schools should consider making use of existing pay flexibilities within the school teachers&#146; pay and conditions document&#151;particularly to help with the recruitment of teachers of shortage subjects such as mathematics, science and, in Wales, Welsh. Schools will be expected to meet the costs of any payments from within the budgets they have available&#148;. I would like to invite consultees&#146; views on whether any other strategies might usefully be adopted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="90709m0001.htm_para19"><a name="09070983000048">I note that the STRB has also said that consideration should be given to the introduction of new measures to attract high quality mathematics teachers in the required numbers. While there is some evidence that the measures we have taken to increase recruitment to shortage subjects such as mathematics and science are working, I would prefer to return to this recommendation once I have further evidence of their impact. Meanwhile I would welcome consultees&#146; ideas, in the context of the recently published 21st century schools White Paper, as to what might be acceptable forms of any such incentives or measures to improve the quality and quantity of mathematics teachers.</p>

 Today I am announcing the successful proposals for England to receive a share of the migration impacts fund. The fund provides &#163;35 million across the UK for 2009-10 financed by a levy on migrants and, subject to a review in the autumn, a similar amount in 2010-11. This money will be used to tackle illegal working practices and reduce local pressure on public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="90709m0001.htm_para20"><a name="09070983000050">This funding works alongside the Government&#146;s points based system which means only those migrants the country needs can come here. The money will be made available quickly and directly to local services across the country, including police, schools and hospitals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="90709m0001.htm_para21"><a name="09070983000051">These front-line services, police, councils, the NHS and voluntary organisations have identified projects in their area that will make the biggest difference to insulating them and local people against the impact of migration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="90709m0001.htm_para23"><a name="09070983000053">Projects receiving funding include those introducing tougher measures to crack down on rogue employers, those creating more teachers in schools to ensure good results for all and those increasing GP registration to cut pressures on emergency services and A and E.</p>

However, in some areas local authorities report concerns that the housing used by migrants can be overcrowded or in poor condition. This can lead to local tensions and cohesion issues. Funding is being targeted to this by cracking down on rogue landlords that will improve the quality of neighbourhoods for all residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="90709m0001.htm_para29"><a name="09070983000059">Funding will be targeted at those schools dealing with a sudden influx of pupils whose first language is not English.

 I wish to inform the House of changes to cross-compliance and of an agreement that has been reached on the approach to recapture the environmental benefits of set-aside. This follows public consultation earlier this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="90709m0001.htm_para42"><a name="09070983000075">To meet the requirements of the common agricultural policy health check for the protection of water resources, new standards will be introduced to cross-compliance. These will require farmers to comply with the existing domestic abstraction licensing regime for irrigation activities and to restrict the spreading of inorganic fertiliser and manure where it is likely to adversely impact on water quality. In addition farmers will be encouraged to implement buffer strips as a voluntary measure to further protect water resources, and the success of this approach will be monitored. We will also consolidate four existing standards relating to soil into one, providing farmers with increased flexibility and clarity and removing the need for derogations to access waterlogged soils. Further simplification will come from clarification of the existing standard protecting hedgerows which will encourage traditional hedgebank management. Lastly, on land not in agricultural production, greater flexibility will be allowed by confirming that a range of non-agricultural activities can be undertaken.</p>

 The Minister for Food, Farming and Environment represented the United Kingdom at June&#146;s Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg. Richard Lochhead MSP also attended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para2"><a name="09070983000082">There were six substantive agenda items under agriculture and fisheries, and a number of AOB items.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para3"><a name="09070983000083">On agriculture, presidency efforts to agree Council conclusions on the future of direct payments under CAP reform were rebuffed. With six statements of opposition, (including the UK), the document was adopted as presidency conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para4"><a name="09070983000084">Ministers endorsed the Council conclusions on the reform of less favoured areas. Ministers also endorsed the Council conclusions on agricultural product quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para5"><a name="09070983000085">At a closed lunch, Ministers discussed the difficulties in the dairy sector. The Commission informed the debate, which took place in the light of recently adopted European Council conclusions on the dairy sector, with a quarterly report on diary market trends. A number of member states spoke on the present difficulties on the milk market, and questioned the role and power of retailers in managing prices. However none came forward with ideas of what additional measures could be introduced beyond those already in hand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para6"><a name="09070983000086">There were nine agriculture AOB items. The Dutch Minister encouraged Ministers to reflect on the specific recommendations from CSD-17 in respect of agriculture and climate change in the run-up to the Copenhagen climate change negotiations. The incoming presidency (Sweden) also plans to discuss this, notably at its informal Council in September. The UK underlined the importance of the debate and distributed copies of its recently published climate projections for the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para7"><a name="09070983000087">The presidency then briefly reported the conclusions on the EU paying agencies conference held under its auspices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para8"><a name="09070983000088">France introduced its paper calling for the rapid implementation of recommendations made by the European Parliament in respect of the Commission&#146;s 2008 communication on food prices, and the soon-to-be-adopted recommendations of the high level group on the competitiveness of the agro-food industry. Many member states shared the French concerns, though the UK cautioned that any new regulation needed to be proportionate and evidence-based.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para9"><a name="09070983000089">The presidency outlined the progress it had made on the control of trade in illegally logged timber member states, including the UK, urged rapid action to agree the dossier and called for inclusion a ban on the import of illegally logged timber. Sweden, as incoming presidency, said it aimed to reach a Council common position by December 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para10"><a name="09070983000090">The presidency also concluded that the proposed regulation updating and harmonising the animal welfare rules applicable at slaughter was agreed, and would be adopted as an &#147;A&#148; point in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para11"><a name="09070983000091">Ministers were then updated on the progress of the welfare of animals used in scientific research dossier. Sweden confirmed it would be a priority during their presidency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para12"><a name="09070983000092">Next, the presidency explained their work to reach compromises on the proposals to ban the use of seven pesticides which had not been approved by the relevant regulatory committee. Compromises had been reached on three, which would be approved as &#147;A&#148; points at the June Environment Council. Work was continuing on the other four.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para13"><a name="09070983000093">The presidency reported on the limited progress made on the proposal to modernise, simplify and clarify the 30-year old rules on food labelling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para14"><a name="09070983000094">Finally on agriculture, the UK thanked the Commission for the flexibility it had shown so far to help reduce the compliance costs of sheep EID, but stressed that the dossier remained of concern within the UK because of the impact on the farming industry. The UK put forward further proposals for reducing the costs of the regulation whilst retaining the benefits and protection provided by sheep EID, however the proposals were not supported by the Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para15"><a name="09070983000095">On fisheries, the Council adopted pre-prepared conclusions on the importance of the aquaculture  industry, principally welcoming the Commission&#146;s April communication designed to give new impetus to the sustainable development of aquaculture in the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para16"><a name="09070983000096">Ministers then held a structured debate on some of the key issues outstanding in the negotiations to agree a new control regulation for EU fisheries, which governs the obligations for monitoring fishing activity to ensure compliance with EU legal obligations. On the main issues, member states were broadly in agreement that there should be tighter controls and better use of technologies to ensure a more cost-effective and workable enforcement regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para17"><a name="09070983000097">Turning to fishing opportunities for 2010, the Commission pointed to its communication setting out the intended approach to setting catch limits for 2010. When taken with existing multi-annual recovery and management plans for certain stocks, and the scientific advice due for publication on 26 June, an accurate impression of the likely outcomes for each stock can be determined. The UK and others supported the high- grading ban, and the UK noted that economic impact assessment should be undertaken before TAC reductions were agreed to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para18"><a name="09070983000098">Finally under any other business, the Commission gave an oral six-monthly report on CFP simplification, noting more streamlining and the deletion of some obsolete regulations. The Commissioner also thanked member states for having responded well to their  obligations on bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean.</p>

 I am delighted to announce that the Government are to honour the vital contribution made by the military and civilian members of the Government code and cypher school who served at Bletchley Park and its outstations during the second world war. A commemorative badge will be awarded to all surviving veterans in recognition of their great success in intercepting and decrypting enciphered messages. Enigma is the most widely recognised example of this work, but Bletchley Park and its outstations had many more successes against different cipher machines and manual ciphers. The thousands of people who worked at Bletchley Park and its outstations played a vital part in the war effort, and kept their work secret until the Government avowed its success.

 As I announced in my oral statement to the House on  2 July 2009, <i>Official Report</i>, column 497, part of the move to the new &#147;treatment&#148; phase of our response to the current swine flu pandemic will involve a new way of collecting and publishing information about swine flu.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para20"><a name="09070983000103">The treatment phase refers to the period when antivirals are used only for treating those who have contracted the illness; contact tracing ceases as does providing antivirals for prophylaxis. The swabbing and testing of all cases also ceases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para21"><a name="09070983000104">The Health Protection Agency (HPA) had previously been collecting, compiling and releasing United Kingdom figures on a daily basis on their website.

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para22"><a name="09070983000105">Because we will rely on clinical diagnosis instead of laboratory confirmation of swabs to identify cases of swine flu, we cannot continue to measure total number of cases in the same way as we have been doing. This is because without testing everyone we would not know how many swine flu cases there are among other cases of influenza-like illnesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="90709m0002.htm_para23"><a name="09070983000106">Therefore, to replace the data previously published, we will need to move to higher level estimates of spread. This will be combined with other key indicators to give a fuller picture of the progress of swine flu.</p>
