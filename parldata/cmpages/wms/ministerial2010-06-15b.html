 On 10 June 2010 the Prime Minister appointed me to become the Government's international anti-corruption champion. The continuation of this central role demonstrates the coalition Government's clear commitment to transparency and accountability. The role is also in recognition of the significant cost of international corruption, both to individuals and to our economy.

I recognise that the interest and impact of corruption is felt not only by all Government Departments but also by British businesses and individuals, particularly those working overseas. I will therefore be working closely with colleagues across Departments, devolved Administrations, law enforcement, prosecution authorities and regulatory agencies to ensure a coherent and joined-up approach to combat international corruption. The champion role sends out a clear message that the UK coalition Government will not tolerate bribery or corruption and that we will work together to stamp out these practices across the board.</p>

 The Government believe that aviation makes a vital contribution to the economy of this country and to the lives of our citizens. The aviation sector contributes some £11 billion to GDP and directly employs some 200,000 people. Its true economic value is much greater than this when we consider the importance of air travel to the global economy and to UK competitiveness. But we cannot simply allow growth to continue at the levels it has in the past. Doing so risks unacceptable consequences in terms of noise and local air quality, quite apart from the global impacts in terms of CO2 emissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="100615m0001.htm_para23"><a name="10061518000047">We need to start a new chapter in aviation policy-one that promotes a competitive aviation industry, supporting UK economic growth, while recognising the need for restraint. We have already begun that by making clear our opposition to adding yet more runways at Heathrow, Stansted or Gatwick. Instead, we must explore different ways in which to improve the efficiency of these key components of our national transport infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="100615m0001.htm_para24"><a name="10061518000048">Improving the passenger experience is at the heart of this Government's vision for UK aviation. We announced in the Queen's Speech our intention to reform the economic regulation of airports to deliver better outcomes for passengers. But I believe that there are also other things that Government and the industry can do together, and so today I am announcing the establishment of a South East Airports Task Force with key players from across the industry to explore the scope for other measures to help make the most of existing airport infrastructure and improve conditions for all users. The group will be chaired by the Minister of State, Department for Transport, my right hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs Villiers) and its initial focus will be on action at our three biggest airports-Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="100615m0001.htm_para25"><a name="10061518000049">I am confident that, by working closely with the aviation sector, alongside our regulatory reforms, this will help deliver improvements for all.</p>
