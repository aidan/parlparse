<p><a name="st_4"><a name="1104041000019"><a name="110404m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="1104041000062"><b>The Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Mr David Gauke):</b>
 I am announcing today the Government's intention to present to Parliament a proposed legislative change to schedule 10 to the Finance Bill. This schedule simplifies the calculation of chargeable gains degrouping charges for companies. The change we are proposing, which will have effect from 1 April 2011, will allow companies the option to apply the new degrouping charge provisions to transactions occurring from 1 April 2011 rather than only after the passing of the Finance Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="110404m0001.htm_para0"><a name="1104041000020">A degrouping charge is intended to prevent loss of tax on gains that arise on the disposal of assets, where a company owning the asset is sold. This can be used for tax avoidance. Companies identified it as one of the most burdensome tax rules that affect them when they are making an acquisition or disposal, or restructuring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="110404m0001.htm_para1"><a name="1104041000021">The new provisions in schedule 10 provide greater certainty to companies planning acquisitions and disposals. The changes will promote growth in the economy by removing some tax barriers to corporate transactions, reducing the costs of restructuring a business and simplifying the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="110404m0001.htm_para2"><a name="1104041000022">The changes made by schedule 10 have already been welcomed by many businesses. I am announcing this new change in response to recent representations, to ensure that the benefits of the changes we are making are available to those groups that are currently in the process of a reconstruction, or considering making an acquisition or disposal.</p>

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="1104041000028"><a name="110404m0001.htm_spmin2"><a name="1104041000064"><b>The Minister for Housing and Local Government (Grant Shapps):</b>
 Today, I am announcing the final allocations for local authorities in England for the new homes bonus year 1 funding. This announcement follows my written statement of 17 February 2011, <i>Official</i><i> Repor</i><i>t</i>, columns 93-95WS, about the final design of the new homes bonus. The new homes bonus will fulfil the Government's coalition agreement commitment to provide local authorities with real incentives to deliver housing growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="110404m0001.htm_para7"><a name="1104041000029">Local authorities had until 10 March to make data representations on their provisional grant allocations. We received 27 representations of which 16 were revisions to the 2009 and 2010 council tax base statistics, three were banding corrections between 2009 and 2010 and eight were about other matters. The 2010 council tax base statistics were released as official statistics on 31 March and we have used the official statistics to calculate the final allocations. We have worked closely with authorities to resolve other data issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="110404m0001.htm_para8"><a name="1104041000030">New homes bonus is a key part of our ambition, set out in the local growth White Paper, to create a fairer and more balanced economy through encouraging growth. The role of local areas in this rebalancing of growth is crucial-they are best placed to understand the drivers of, and barriers to, local growth and should lead their own development to release their economic potential. In so doing they should be able to benefit directly from the development they bring forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="110404m0001.htm_para9"><a name="1104041000031">The new homes bonus is designed to address the disincentive within the local government finance system for local areas to welcome growth. Until now, increased housing in communities has meant increased strain on public services and reduced amenities. The new homes bonus will remove this disincentive by providing local authorities with the means to mitigate the strain the increased population causes. In addition, in doing so, the new homes bonus should help engender a more positive attitude to growth, and create an environment in which new housing is more readily accepted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="110404m0001.htm_para10"><a name="1104041000032">The new homes bonus scheme will be a powerful, simple and transparent incentive.

 The Government announced in the strategic defence and security review last October that as part of moving to Future Force 2020 and due to the economic situation we have inherited, we would reduce the size of the Army by 7,000 personnel, and both the Navy and RAF by 5,000 personnel. We also made clear that regrettably an element of these reductions would need to be made through a redundancy process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="110404m0001.htm_para13"><a name="1104041000036">I set out in my statement of 1 March 2011 the process and timetable the armed forces redundancy scheme would follow. The RAF informed their personnel of the areas in which they would look to make reductions in tranche one on the same day. In accordance with the timetable set out in the 1 March statement the Army and Navy have today published to their personnel the equivalent information. In the first stage the Army are looking to reduce by around 1,000 personnel, and the Navy by 1,600. Like the RAF, individuals will not be selected for redundancy by the Army and Navy until 1 September 2011 and 30 September 2011 respectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="110404m0001.htm_para14"><a name="1104041000037">While it is too early to know who will be selected for redundancy, the principles set out in the 1 March statement will be followed. First, both services will ask for volunteers although all personnel in the relevant areas will be considered. Secondly, the redundancy scheme will not impact adversely on the current operations in Afghanistan and Libya, where our armed forces are fighting so bravely on this country's behalf. No-one who is preparing for combat operations, deployed on combat operations where they will receive the operational allowance or on post-operational tour leave on the day redundancy notices are issued will be made redundant unless they have volunteered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="110404m0001.htm_para15"><a name="1104041000038">The Government would rather not have had to reduce the size of the armed forces but the size of the fiscal deficit inherited left little choice. As we continue with the redundancy process we will ensure we retain the capability our armed forces require to be as effective in the future.</p>

Recruitment of Afghan army and police remains ahead of target, but the standard of Afghan national police leadership needs to be improved and the rate of turnover of recruits needs to be reduced. The Afghan Parliament's election of a new Speaker, after a protracted process, is an encouraging step forward, but further appointments need to be confirmed before the Parliament can play a full role in the legislative process. Stronger links are beginning to develop between central and local government in Helmand, through governance, rule of law and economic development programmes and better access to Government -provided services including transport. This is essential to help the Afghan Government deliver basic services and win the support of the population. Concern remains over a lack of progress in certain areas, for example, women's rights.

the last 18 years, DLA has failed to keep pace with the changing approach to disability in society. As it stands, DLA is complex to apply for and to administer, lacks consistency in the way it supports disabled people with similar needs, and has no systematic process for checking the ongoing accuracy of awards.</p>
