<p><a name="st_2"><a name="0807145000016"><a name="80714m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="0807145000122"><b>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Jane Kennedy):</b>
 Tax credits today provide support to 20 million people including around 6 million families and 10 million children. Take-up of tax credits is a significant success. Tax credits have played a key role in tackling child poverty: since 1998-99, some 600,000 children have been lifted out of relative poverty, compared to a doubling of child poverty in the previous 20 years. Tax credits also play a major role in moving people into work and helping people move up the employment ladder, ensuring that work pays over welfare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="80714m0001.htm_para0"><a name="0807145000017">Over the past 12 months, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has significantly accelerated its work programme for measuring error and fraud in the tax credits system and has today published its estimates for both 2005-06 and 2006-07. A copy of these statistics has been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses and is available on the HMRC website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="80714m0001.htm_para1"><a name="0807145000018">The figures show that HMRC has reduced the level of error favouring the customer from 9.2 per cent. of all tax credit entitlement in 2003-04 to 7.6 per cent. in 2006-07, and the levels of fraud from 0.6 per cent in 2003-04 to 0.2 per cent in 2006-07.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="80714m0001.htm_para2"><a name="0807145000019">I have today set HMRC a target to further reduce levels of error and fraud to no more than 5 per cent. of finalised entitlement by the end of March 2011. HMRC is committed to achieving this challenging target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="80714m0001.htm_para3"><a name="0807145000020">HMRC has strengthened its strategy for reducing error and fraud, building on the Tax Credits Transformation Programme. This programme has improved HMRC&#146;s understanding of tax credit customers, enabling the Department to better support customers to get their claim right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="80714m0001.htm_para4"><a name="0807145000021">HMRC will deliver targeted assistance to customers making a new claim, to help them claim more easily. This could range from straightforward advice when a customer requests a claim form to intensive help over the phone or face-to-face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="80714m0001.htm_para5"><a name="0807145000022">Existing customers will receive support in areas in which they have difficulty to ensure that they are providing the correct information on which to base their awards, and help with the renewals process. For example, during this years&#146; renewal window HMRC is proactively contacting vulnerable customers to offer them additional assistance to renew their claims. From September, HMRC is also rolling out new services to proactively seek information from customers and make better use of information already held, to help mitigate against errors relating to an individual&#146;s award.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="80714m0001.htm_para6"><a name="0807145000023">HMRC is also embedding this deeper understanding of customer behaviour into its compliance programme, deploying resources to areas of greatest risk with the aim of identifying incorrect claims and supporting customers to prevent errors in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="80714m0001.htm_para7"><a name="0807145000024">HMRC also remains vigilant to fraud. Previously published information on organised fraud shows that HMRC is successfully stopping the majority of claims identified as being submitted by organised fraudsters. The Department has implemented a range of measures designed to restrict the opportunity for fraudsters to abuse the system, including tighter control on the issue of claim forms, fraud awareness training for staff, and deploying compliance officers in tax credit call centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="80714m0001.htm_para8"><a name="0807145000025">These measures, combined with the closure of the e-portal, have significantly reduced the level of identified losses due to organised fraud from the levels in 2005-06. In 2006-07 HMRC identified attempts to defraud the tax credit system of around &#163;252 million. Of this the vast majority, some &#163;212 million, was detected by HMRC before any money was paid out.</p>

 The Ministry of Justice is today publishing an internal review led by Kevin Lockyer, the then regional offender manager for the south-west region into indeterminate sentenced prisoners, including indeterminate sentences of imprisonment for public protection (IPP).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="80714m0001.htm_para28"><a name="0807145000063">This review was a study into operational matters relating to the management and progress of indeterminate sentence prisoners through offender services. It was commissioned by Helen Edwards, then chief executive officer of the National Offender Management Service in April 2007. The review reported to the NOMS board in August 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="80714m0001.htm_para29"><a name="0807145000064">The review identifies various areas for improvements and proposed recommendations on how these improvements could be achieved.

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="80714m0001.htm_para31"><a name="0807145000066">These principles are:</p>
<a name="80714m0001.htm_brev13"><a name="0807145000067"><ul><p class="tabletext">The offender assessment should be front-loaded in order to facilitate sentence progression. An OASys assessment and an outline sentence plan should, wherever possible, be available at the point of sentence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="80714m0001.htm_para32"><a name="0807145000072">In response to this report, NOMS established better case management arrangements through new, streamlined procedures for the management of indeterminate sentenced prisoners. This was to be achieved through the roll-out of phase three of the offender management model and through targeted work on IPP prisoners at or approaching their tariff date. It set out recommendations aimed at ensuring IPP prisoners have an assessment of need completed which leads to a sentence plan. It also sets out the need for improved access to the interventions contained in those plans. Good progress has been made, in particular in delivering assessments to those nearest their tariff expiry date and in moving IPP prisoners through the prison system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="80714m0002.htm_para1"><a name="0807145000089">These opportunities will of course be in addition to any such debates that Select Committees table, through the Liaison Committee, for consideration on Estimates days. As noted in the second report of the present session from the Liaison Committee &#147;Parliament and Government Finance: Recreating Financial Scrutiny&#148; (HC 426), to which the Government will be responding shortly, the Treasury&#146;s Alignment project on the financial documentation (including the Estimates) made available to Parliament will provide an opportunity in due course for the House to review further the pattern of Estimates days and the exact forms of motion which it would be appropriate to consider on Estimates days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="80714m0002.htm_para2"><a name="0807145000090">Through these means it will be possible for the objectives and plans of a range of Government Departments to be debated each year, as envisaged in &#147;Governance of Britain&#148;. Since there will be no single House procedure under which these debates will take place, the Government will monitor closely how this system is operating. As the Modernisation Committee has suggested, there could be scope on occasion for debates to be cross-departmental debates where the objectives (in the form of PSAs) link to more than one department and in some cases material and publications other than the departmental annual report will also inform the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="80714m0002.htm_para3"><a name="0807145000091">The Committee has also emphasised the importance of the relevant departmental Select Committee playing a central role in these debates, and proposes that debates should not take place until after the relevant Select Committee has completed its work on any departmental annual report. The Government certainly envisage that Select Committees will be key contributors to the debates and the Liaison Committee will be a major initiator of the debates in Westminster Hall. Many debates will take place on the basis of proposals instigated by committees themselves on the basis of work they have completed. For those debates not instigated by Select Committees, it is difficult to give a firm undertaking that debates should not take place until after a Select Committee has  <br>

completed its work, since different committees examine Departments&#146; annual reports on very different timescales and there will be a range of factors influencing the timing of a debate; nevertheless the Government will seek to liaise with relevant committees and the Liaison Committee to try to ensure that any select committee work is taken into account in the timing of any such debate.</p>

 During the earlier public stages of scrutiny of the Crossrail Bill and more recently during the House of Lords Grand Committee stage on Thursday 26 June 2008, amendments were proposed that would have placed specific obligations on the Secretary of State, the Mayor and Cross London Rail Links (CLRL) to publish information on an annual basis about the project&#146;s funding and finances.</p>
