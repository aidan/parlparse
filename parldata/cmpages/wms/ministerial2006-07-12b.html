 The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of schedule 2 to the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 requires the Secretary of State to set and meet a timetable for the majority of planning cases decided by the Secretary of State where the inquiry closed on or after 1 April 2005; and to make a report to Parliament each year on performance. This is intended both to ensure that such cases are dealt with expeditiously and to enable the parties to any particular case to know when they can expect to receive a decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="60712m0001.htm_para0"><a name="06071256000014">The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has accordingly today laid before Parliament an Act Paper reporting on all decisions where the inquiry, hearing or site visit ended on or after 1 April 2005 and the decision was made on or before 31 March 2006. During this period, 100 per cent. of the 200 decisions made by the Secretary of State on cases other than appeals under tree preservation orders were made within their statutory timetables, as were 532 out of 545 decisions (98 per cent.) on tree preservation order appeals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="60712m0001.htm_para1"><a name="06071256000015">These provisions relate to decisions on called-in planning applications; planning appeals recovered for the Secretary of State's decision; other cases "linked" to such decisions, including listed building consent, conservation area consent, advertisement consent and enforcement notice appeals; and tree preservation order appeals. They do not apply to cases decided by Inspectors or to those decided by the Secretary of State jointly with a Minister of another Department.</p>

 The Government are committed to ensuring that by 2008 no one will wait for more than 18 weeks from GP referral to hospital treatment.

 I am today laying before Parliament, with the Comptroller and Auditor General, the annual report and accounts for 2004-05 for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority.

The accounts estimate the final settlement value of cases in progress and the predicted value of applications which have not yet been received in respect of crimes that have already occurred. As a result, the balance sheet at 31 March 2005 shows net liabilities of &#163;1,257 million and an operating deficit of &#163;46.5 million.</p>

immunity during 2004, 12 December, <i>Official Report</i>, column 127WS, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has reviewed its policy relating to disclosure of the names of the missions whose diplomats have allegedly committed serious offences. I have today placed in the Library of the House a list of foreign missions whose diplomats allegedly committed serious offences and a list of the offences, between 1999 and 2004. I shall place a further list in the Library of the House updating this information to cover 2005 in the autumn this year. From 2007, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office shall present this information to Parliament annually, by means of a written ministerial statement, laid by the end of June each year, covering the previous five-year period.</p>
