 I have been considering Sir George Quigley&#039;s Review of Parades, the subsequent consultation on his report, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee (NIAC) report of January this year and the events of last summer. Each of these offers different perspectives on how to go forward and I have come to a balanced decision about how to respond.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m03.html_para10">I have decided that a case has not been made to make fundamental changes to parading arrangements in Northern Ireland. Parades have been increasingly peaceful over the last few years. The number of contentious parades has fallen. Out of approximately 2,000 parades notified last year, only 200 were regarded as &#039;contentious&#039; and two resulted in serious public order incidents. I think this shows the success of the arrangements we have here in reducing tension. I want to echo the words of NIAC, which concluded that the Parades Commission remains the best hope for developing the peaceful resolution of disputes. I will therefore not be pressing forward with the changes recommended by Sir George Quigley at this time. I am, however, indebted to Sir George for his insightful and intelligent contribution to the debate around parades in Northern Ireland. Although I am not adopting his recommendations, my thinking has been greatly influenced by his work and I am, indebted to him for his insightful and intelligent contribution to the debate around parades in Northern Ireland.

 A consultation exercise has been launched today on the evaluation of the EU process called the &quot;open method of co-ordination&quot;. This provides a structure for co-operation between EU member states to enable the exchange of best practice and joint evaluation of policies. The European Commission has invited all EU member states to comment on the effectiveness of this open method in the fields of social inclusion and pensions. The questionnaire has been placed in the Library and is also available online at www.dwp.gov.uk/consultations/2005/omc/index.asp.

<p><a name="50222m04.html_spmin3"><b>The Minister for Pensions  (Malcolm Wicks): </b> 
 In December 2004 we said that our priority was getting help to those facing the most urgent difficulties being closest to, or already at, retirement age and therefore less able to make provision to replace their lost pensions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m04.html_para3">At that time we had asked independent trustees to provide data on the pension schemes that they thought might be eligible for the financial assistance scheme. We had a very good response and from the information provided it appears that there are at least 380 schemes in which members might be potentially eligible for financial assistance. The precise scale of the financial shortfalls in these schemes cannot be known until the winding-up processes are close to completion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m04.html_para4">A list of these potentially eligible schemes has been placed in the Library. It is a provisional list which broadly confirms earlier estimates of the scale of the problem, and the number of individuals affected. The detailed eligibility criteria for both schemes and members will be set out in regulations that we expect to publish for wider consultation in the spring. Once finalised these will need parliamentary approval, which we hope to obtain by the end of July.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m04.html_para5">As solvent employers have a duty to support their schemes and provide the benefits members were expecting, it is right that the FAS focuses on insolvent employers. We expect employers to stand by their pension promise to their employees, and will take a dim view of the solvent employer who seeks to avoid their responsibilities to their employees or the employees of a company for which they have been a parent company. We have consulted widely on how we should define &#039;employer insolvency&#039; and concluded that for FAS purposes we should have a sufficiently general definition of insolvency to capture schemes where the sponsoring employer no longer exists and also where insolvency may have occurred some time after scheme wind-up had started. This definition will be similar to that used by the PPF but with the additional inclusion of some companies which have undergone members&#039; voluntary

<br>&nbsp;<br>

liquidations&#151;where a declaration of solvency was made at the time of wind-up but where the company is now no longer solvent and so no employer exists to support the scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m04.html_para6">We are minded to judge the insolvency position for multi-employer schemes on the principal employer of the scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m04.html_para7">The list contains those pension schemes on which we received information in the latest data collection exercise and which from the information provided by trustees, appear potentially eligible under the criteria set out above. The list provides an early indication of scheme eligibility for members of the schemes we have been told about. But I need to make clear a number of caveats. First, it will take time to establish the final position, but as wind-up progresses we will become clearer on the size of the gap between assets and liabilities of these schemes. Second, presence on this list does not guarantee individuals will receive support from the FAS. Third, it does not mean trustees should stop their duties of securing the best possible outcome for their scheme members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m04.html_para8">After the FAS regulations have come into force, there will be a six-month period during which we shall accept formal notification from the independent trustees of other under-funded pension schemes, which may in due course be added to the list, so absence from this list does not preclude eligibility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m04.html_para9">Whilst we have sought industry contributions, it is very disappointing that no financial contribution has been forthcoming. As a result the available funding stands at &#163;400 million over 20 years, which the Government have committed on behalf of the taxpayer.

<p>
<a name="50222m04.html_para10">As we have explained before, in many cases the trustees are not yet able to provide detailed information on the scale of individual losses and in practice this may not be available until they are close to completing the winding-up of each pension scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m04.html_para11">But those scheme members who have already retired or expect to retire within the next few years need to know where they stand now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m04.html_para12">I can therefore announce today that the financial assistance scheme will provide help to those within three years of their scheme pension age on 14 May 2004. The assistance will top up individuals to a level broadly equivalent to 80 per cent. of the core pension rights accrued in their scheme. That means that those within three years of their pension scheme age on 14 May 2004 should expect to get 80 per cent. of their core promised pension. As we previously announced, payments will be subject to a de minimis level and a cap on assistance provided. Further information on these will be provided when the draft regulations are published.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m04.html_para13">The assistance will be paid as a monthly pension.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m04.html_para14">FAS payments will be treated by the tax and benefit system in broadly the same way as payments from an occupational pension scheme.

<br>&nbsp;<br>22 Feb 2005 : Column 30WS

</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m07.html_para7">The criterion is as follows:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">A teaching and learning responsibility payment may only be made to a teacher who is accountable for a significant, specified responsibility focused on teaching and learning, that is not required of all classroom teachers, clearly defined in the job description of the teaching and learning responsibility payment holder, and requiring teachers&#039; professional skills and judgement. The TLR payment should be for a sustained responsibility in the context of the school&#039;s staffing structure needed to ensure continued delivery of high-quality teaching and learning.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m07.html_para8">The factors are as follows:

<p class="tabletext">Payments should not be portable from one school to another;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Payments should be withdrawn where a teacher declined to perform the responsibilities attached to the payment; or lost the responsibilities as a result of poor performance (as a result of capability procedures); and</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m07.html_para13">Subject to the timely provision of guidance and budget information to schools, we recommend specifically that:

<a name="50222m07.html_para14">Our recommendations should be applied to Wales in accordance with constitutional responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m07.html_para15">I welcome these recommendations. I believe that they represent a genuinely constructive opportunity for schools to organise their teaching and learning responsibilities in a new way, focusing on the professionalism of teachers and enabling reward to be given for significant tasks which have an impact on the educational progress of pupils and the professional practice of other teachers. I am particularly glad to recognise the flexibilities, within an overall framework, recommended within the new teaching and learning responsibility payments system, and the emphasis on openness through the pay policy, which would give schools the freedom to establish the arrangements which suit their own needs, while openly justifying their decisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m07.html_para16">However, I am anxious that all schools should have sufficient time to prepare and consider what staffing structure is most appropriate for them before implementation of these pay changes. To promote clarity and consistency I propose that all schools&#039; transition periods should begin on 1 January 2006, at which point TLR payments should be available and management allowances would cease to be awarded.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m07.html_para17">I also welcome the focus on restructuring, which will be key to enabling the transition from the existing management allowance system to be managed. Action on school restructuring in Wales will, of course, be for the Welsh Assembly to determine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m07.html_para18">I agree that guidance to schools on restructuring, transition and the new TLR payments system will be very important. However, I believe that the guidance should not be restrictive or suggest different levels of TLR payment for different tasks or responsibilities. I believe that the detailed criteria and factors for the payment of TLRs should be the focus for schools&#039; (and in the case of unattached teachers, LEAs&#039;) decisions, and that this should be sufficient to enable them to take appropriate decisions within the context of their own individual published structures. All parties will, as usual, be consulted on the development of statutory guidance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m07.html_para19">I agree that the arrangements for the award of TLRs also require provisions for their future cessation and the recommendations of the STRB are sensible and helpful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222m07.html_para20">I welcome the proposed arrangements for transition from management allowances to TLRs, and the proposed provisions giving protections for teachers who would otherwise incur a reduction in salary, which are fair and reasonable.

<a name="50222m07.html_para32">I recognise the difficulties and sensitivities which exist in the context of bringing change to this area of the teachers&#039; pay system, and the framework proposed will enable existing and future safeguarding to be handled on a fair, uniform and predictable basis. Moreover, the framework as proposed will ensure that teachers are protected from sudden drops in total salary which would otherwise occur through no fault of their own, for a suitable period. I also welcome the recommendation of the STRB that these detailed matters are handled in future using my subsidiary powers, within the context of the framework established, which seems to be entirely appropriate.

<p>
<a name="50222m07.html_para35">The remit to the STRB invited it to consider the salary levels of secondary mathematics and science advanced skills teachers.

This was proposed as part of the Government&#039;s approach to overcoming the national under-achievements in these two subjects and their impact on the economy, as identified in the reports of Professor Adrian Smith and Sir Gareth Roberts.

<p>
<a name="50222m07.html_para36">The STRB has reflected carefully on this but has concluded that at present it will not make recommendations along the lines proposed. It has indicated that this could be considered further in a future remit, in the wider context of teachers&#039; remuneration as a whole.

To qualify, the teacher should have to have been paid on U3 for at least two years, be willing to meet the expectations of an Excellent Teacher, and have their application endorsed by their head teacher. They would also need to provide evidence of work during their period on the upper pay scale that had addressed the identified needs of a particular group or groups of pupils; and successfully pass a procedure of external assessment against national standards;</p>

<p class="tabletext">A separate national (England and Wales) standard should be developed for the scheme, building on a common core of excellence with the AST standard, to take account of the distinctive profile and features of the scheme; subject to discussion with the Welsh Assembly Government, this standard might be based on the three themes of new professionalism in teaching <sup>1</sup>  and the requirements of an Excellent Teacher should reflect more closely the three themes of new professionalism in teaching, again subject to discussion with the welsh assembly government;</p>
