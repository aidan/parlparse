 I have placed in the Libraries of both Houses alongside this statement, copies of the December update of the G8 Gleneagles Implementation Plan for Africa. This plan is updated monthly by the Department for International Development (DFID) on behalf of all Departments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="70125m0001.htm_para4"><a name="07012590000033">A year ago, the Government set out 11 objectives that we hoped would be achieved by the end of 2006 (Annex1- Box1). I am pleased to report that the majority of these have been met, although more progress is needed on the Africa Standby Force and donor support for 10-year education plans and significant progress is needed on trade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="70125m0001.htm_para5"><a name="07012590000035">Effective international monitoring mechanisms have been put in place. G8 leaders reviewed progress at the 2006 summit and will do so again at the 2007 summit in Germany. The Africa Partnership Forum produced its first three progress reports in October 2006, with four more expected in May 2007. The civil society &#147;African Monitor&#148; is gaining momentum. The UK has helped create the Africa Progress Panel, to be chaired by Kofi Annan, to complement these other mechanisms.</p>

Preliminary aid figures for 2006 will be available from the OECD in April 2007, with the EU publishing a progress report for member states in May. Aid levels may fall back in 2006 and 2007 as debt relief declines, but the UK will continue to press donors to meet their 2005 pledges so we meet the overall target to increase global aid by $50 billion by 2010. The UK is on track to meet its target to provide 0.7 per cent. of national income as aid by 2013. Future spending projections are being finalised as part of the comprehensive spending review.</p>

for tackling international asset recovery and for coordinating technical assistance. Twenty-six countries have signed up to implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. Three countries (Ghana, Kenya and Rwanda) have completed the Africa Peer Review Mechanism review process and are beginning to implement recommendations. South Africa and Algeria should be peer-reviewed in 2007. We would like to see more countries with self-assessments under way.</p>

The Education Fast Track Initiative (FTI) is being expanded to 60 countries. Twenty-eight countries have FTI endorsed education sector plans. Three further plans are likely to be approved in early 2007 with a further 15 likely by the end of 2007. A conference&#151;to be convened by the EU and the World Bank in the spring&#151;will encourage donors to make long-term commitments to fund these plans.</p>

Alongside this, the UK has increased its own efforts: DFID is focusing on 12 African countries, with Ethiopia, Nigeria, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo identified as top priorities.</p>

This represents around a quarter of those in need, so there is a long way still to go. Treatment has prevented around 250,000-300,000 premature deaths in developing countries in 2005. The international focus is firmly on achieving universal access to comprehensive prevention programmes, treatment, care and support by 2010. The UK is providing substantial funding, for new initiatives such as the International Drug Purchase Facility (UNITAID) and increasing its contributions to organisations such as the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria (GFATM) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="70125m0001.htm_para16"><a name="07012590000056">Important changes have been made to the international humanitarian system, to increase its ability to prevent and to respond to emergencies. The new Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has already demonstrated its value as a source of rapid-response funds for &#147;neglected&#148; humanitarian crises such as in Timor-Leste where in April and May 2006 more than 135,000 people became displaced overnight following the outbreak of fighting. The UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator (HC) system has been strengthened, with a new Secretariat focused on training and deployment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="70125m0001.htm_para17"><a name="07012590000057">Twenty-one experienced co-ordinators have been trained, providing a pool to respond to crises, most recently in Lebanon. The &#147;Cluster Approach&#148; has increased coordination among agencies. A joint World Bank/DFID programme is supporting integration of disaster risk reduction measures into development strategies, focusing on particularly vulnerable countries (including Malawi and Mozambique). Reform of the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction is gaining momentum. DFID is supporting this, alongside other initiatives such as the Pan-American Health Organisation&#146;s programme for emergency preparedness and disaster relief and the ProVention Consortium of international donors on disaster risk reduction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="70125m0001.htm_para18"><a name="07012590000059">The one area where progress has been very disappointing is trade. Informal talks on the Doha Round of World Trade Organisation negotiations restarted in late 2006. The UK Government continue to push for early agreement on a deal that will substantially help poor countries, provide extra aid for private sector development, cut agricultural subsidies and end export subsidies.</p>

We will be working hard to ensure that this delivers further progress on Africa. As part of the Government&#146;s commitment to accountability, we have established 10 milestones we believe need to be achieved by July 2007 (Box 2 in the Gleneagles Implementation Plan).

International cooperation in fighting transnational crime is essential. Further, this guidance should assist prosecutors to have the earliest notice of cases that could be of interest to them for possible investigation and prosecution in the UK.

 This statement is to inform the House of the events surrounding the beaching of the MSC Napoli at Lyme Bay, east of Sidmouth. The chain of events began on the morning of 18 January. During severe weather conditions, the MSC Napoli, a UK-registered vessel, experienced difficulties on the French side of the English channel, 40 miles off Cornwall. The MSC Napoli&#146;s master made the decision that the danger was sufficient that the crew should abandon the ship. Despite the heavy seas, all of the crew were successfully rescued by UK helicopter from Royal Navy Air Station Culdrose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="70125m0001.htm_para24"><a name="07012590000068">In accordance with the Anglo-French Joint Maritime Contingency Plan (Mancheplan) the initial assistance to the ship was a French-led operation (conducted in close liaison with the UK Secretary of State's Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention&#151;SOSREP). An on-scene assessment of the condition of the MSC Napoli was made, and the conclusion of this assessment was that the least environmentally risky option was to tow the vessel to a place of refuge in UK waters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="70125m0001.htm_para25"><a name="07012590000069">The need for a place of refuge and its location are always driven by the circumstances of an incident, including such event-specific data as the weather, the geographical whereabouts of the incident and the type of threat posed by the vessel and its cargo. On this occasion, the south coast of England provided better options for a place of refuge than the French coast.   <br>

<notus-date day="25" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>25 Jan 2007 : Column 70WS</b><br>
On the French coast, there were no suitable places of refuge within reasonable distance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="70125m0001.htm_para26"><a name="07012590000070">Accordingly, Portland Harbour was selected as the destination for the MSC Napoli, owing to the extent of its port facilities. A tow was attached on the evening of 18 January. However, in the early hours of 20 January, the MSC Napoli&#146;s condition began to worsen significantly due to continuing severe weather and it became clear that it would not be possible to reach Portland. Priority was given to giving the vessel shelter and keeping it in one piece, as there was real concern the vessel might start to break up. The decision was made to turn the vessel towards an identified beaching site in the sheltered waters of Lyme Bay. Environmental groups and local authorities were consulted, and it was on this basis that the decision was taken to beach the ship just to the east of Sidmouth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="70125m0001.htm_para27"><a name="07012590000071">On the evening of 20 January, tugs attempted to pull the MSC Napoli harder aground. At this time there was some leakage of oils into the water and a boom was deployed around the vessel to contain it. The oil leaking from the MSC Napoli created an 8 km wide sheen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="70125m0001.htm_para28"><a name="07012590000072">The MSC Napoli was carrying approximately 2,300 containers, of which 157 are believed to contain hazardous materials, including perfume, pesticides and batteries. Some 103 containers were lost overboard, and some have washed ashore; 76 of the containers have been found, many of which have been identified and have had their contents verified. The contents and positions of all but 27 containers have now been identified. Three of the containers washed ashore contained perfumes, small gas cylinders and battery acid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="70125m0001.htm_para29"><a name="07012590000073">Security around the Lyme Bay area has been a concern, with looting widely reported. A heavy police presence has been deployed in the area. The ship's owners have appointed a private security company to guard containers while the owners arrange for recovery. The beach at Branscombe has been fenced off and made secure. Footpaths down on to the beach are also fenced off, as Devon County Council temporarily closed the paths leading to the beach from Branscombe to Beer on Monday for health and safety reasons. Contractors appointed by the ship's owners to deal with any shoreline clean-up are setting up a compound by the beach to hold the waste and their equipment. Recovered material will be returned to the owner, recycled, or else will go to landfill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="70125m0001.htm_para30"><a name="07012590000074">SOSREP is leading the response to this incident. The National Contingency Plan has enabled us to take prompt and appropriate action in assisting the stricken MSC Napoli and there has been strong co-operation between SOSREP and all the parties concerned, including the French authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="70125m0001.htm_para31"><a name="07012590000075">Because of the fast-moving nature of this incident, I anticipate making a further statement to the House next week.</p>
