 Our local government White Paper, &#147;Strong and prosperous communities&#148;, proposed that a move to whole council elections should be a matter for local discretion. We have now included provision to give effect to this in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, which received its second reading on 22 January. District councils will in future, subject to the Bill receiving Royal Assent, be able to move to whole council elections after passing a resolution to that effect and for that change to take place in the usual year for whole council elections for that type of authority.</p>

 The 16th report of the School Teachers&#146; Review Body (STRB) is being published today. It covers a range of matters referred to the STRB in May 2006. Copies are available in the Vote Office, the Printed Paper Office and the Libraries of the House and at http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="70206m0001.htm_para1"><a name="07020659000019">In making its recommendations, the STRB was required to have regard to the matters set out in the remit letter of 17 May 2006. The16th STRB report does not include a pay award as we are currently in the middle of a multi-year award, but it does deal with some very important matters affecting teachers&#146; pay and conditions, and I am most grateful for the careful and detailed attention the STRB has given to these matters. The STRB recommendations are set out below followed in each case by my response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="70206m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07020659000020">I am seeking consultation comments on the report and my response by 5 March 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="70206m0001.htm_para5"><a name="07020659000023">We recommend that:</p>
<a name="70206m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="07020659000024"><ul><p class="tabletext">the Department undertake a programme of action to secure a significant increase in the use of existing flexibilities in the STPCD to address local teacher shortages in priority subjects;</p>
</ul><a name="70206m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="07020659000025"><ul><p class="tabletext">the Department focus this programme on three areas, namely more effective support for local managers, a sharper framework of accountability, and school budgets;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="70206m0001.htm_para6"><a name="07020659000029">I note that the STRB considers that existing recruitment and retention incentives are the most flexible tool available for addressing teacher shortages, and that a programme of action is required to secure a significant increase in the use of them. We will need to consider with partners where support for local managers will help them to do this. We will also consider the best way to raise awareness and provide better information to help school management to use the flexibilities as an active management tool.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="70206m0001.htm_para7"><a name="07020659000030">The STRB also said we should investigate the points about budgets made by consultees and take appropriate action. We shall consider the points raised, but note at the outset that the context of this issue is that schools are free, within the existing statutory framework, to spend their budgets in accordance with their own priorities for school improvement, and that includes the existing recruitment and retention incentives and benefits.</p>

I agree that this is a complex and sensitive matter and that it deserves careful review. I therefore propose to accept the recommendation that the Department should gather additional evidence on a range of matters relevant to this, in preparation for further consideration by the STRB.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="70206m0001.htm_para13"><a name="07020659000037">Having reflected carefully on the STRB&#146;s proposals for further evidence, and taking into account the need for this matter to be considered further by interested parties, I propose to work on the basis that the question of potential review of SEN allowances be included in the 2008 STRB remit.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="70206m0001.htm_para17"><a name="07020659000045">The remit to the STRB invited it to make recommendations on what framework may be appropriate to enable relevant bodies to set a spot salary for excellent teachers, within the ranges recommended in its 15th Report; and whether, and on what basis, the spot salary may be reviewed. I am grateful to the STRB for its advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="70206m0001.htm_para18"><a name="07020659000046">The excellent teacher scheme is a distinctive and attractive career option for experienced teachers who are excellent classroom practitioners. To help schools make sound decisions about the appropriate spot rate on the range for excellent teachers, the STRB has suggested that the pay document should set broad, high-level criteria with local flexibility. The STRB has agreed with the two factors proposed by the Rewards and Incentives Group in its evidence&#151;the nature of the work to be undertaken and the degree of challenge of the role&#151;and has added that schools should be able to set any additional criteria they consider appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="70206m0001.htm_para19"><a name="07020659000047">I am concerned that allowing schools to determine additional local criteria, as the STRB suggests, might be too open-ended for schools to manage and there is a risk that factors unrelated to the excellent teacher role could be added. I also think that allowing schools to set additional local criteria could undermine the sense of a national benchmark for the scheme. The concept of a  <br>

spot salary i.e. a salary with no progression is new to the teaching profession and it is paramount that schools have a clear basis for reaching fair and consistent decisions on the salary levels they set. Before I decide whether or not to accept the &#145;additional criteria&#146; I would like to invite views on whether such a framework would be workable and, if so, what help schools might need to enable them to make these decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="70206m0001.htm_para20"><a name="07020659000048">The STRB has proposed that the basis for review of an excellent teacher&#146;s salary should be if there are significant changes in the nature of the work, the degree of challenge of the role and any additional factor the school considers appropriate. ETS salaries could also be looked at as part of any wider review of salaries. I accept this recommendation in principle, but I want to make clear my view that the review should only be in relation to changes in the criteria established at the outset (including whatever might specifically be set under the additional criteria category) or a wider review of salaries.</p>

I am therefore happy to accept their recommendations and we will work with partners to develop the provisions that they have identified, with the intention being to incorporate these into the STPCD from September 2008. We recognise that in doing so we will be increasing cost pressures on some schools, which we will need to take into account in the context of the full range of school funding issues for 2008 and beyond, and which will be one of the considerations for the STRB in their next report.</p>

However it does seem to me that we should be looking to take forward these developments in parallel, so that the impact of each area on the other can be considered.</p>

 I represented the United Kingdom at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 29 January 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"><a name="70206m0002.htm_para0"><a name="07020659000085">The Agriculture Commissioner presented proposals to reform the fruit and vegetable sector which she said would help it to meet the challenges it faces from third country competition and pressure from the retail sector. The proposals focused on increasing the competitiveness of the sector, risk management measures and simplifying legislation. The Council held its first exchange of views on the proposal and I intervened in support of aligning this regime with the 2003 CAP reform model, but expressed concern that the proposed risk and crisis management measures should not distort the market. I also underlined the need for budget discipline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="70206m0002.htm_para1"><a name="07020659000086">The Commissioner also presented two proposals on the common organisation of the market in cereals: the first on the abolition of maize intervention and the second to deliver extra short-term cash to compensate for high interest charges. Only the first proposal was discussed. The Commission held that intervention abolition was the only way to rectify the current unsustainability of the maize market, although reservations were expressed by some member states. I welcomed the proposal, and its intent to tackle current market imbalances.</p>
