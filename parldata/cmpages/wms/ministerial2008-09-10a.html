</ul><a name="80910m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="0809104000102"><ul><p class="tabletext">The environment facing manufacturers has undergone and continues to face significant change. To understand what is powering these shifts we have conducted consultations with the Ministerial Advisory Group on Manufacturing and other stakeholders, and drawn upon academic and survey evidence.

It will have industrial scale pre-production and demonstration facilities, which could lead to &#163;130 million of investment in business-led applied research and its exploitation over the next 10 years.

UK and global businesses are growing their investment in intangible or knowledge assets, such as software, design, brand building in order to improve their global competitiveness and to meet the changing needs of customers. The Design Council and Regional Development Agencies will implement the findings of the current review of the Designing Demand programme to increase penetration of the programme across the regions. We have supported the creation of the UK Design Skills Alliance and will work with the alliance to help ensure the world-leading UK design sector has the skills required by manufacturers to compete in global markets.</p>

We will expand apprenticeships by inviting bids from larger manufacturers to train additional apprentices, including for their supply chains. And for manufacturers, there will be a clear focus on simplifying their experience of the skills system so they can quickly and easily access the skills and training support they need. The &#147;Memorandum of Understanding&#148; published alongside the strategy sets out how delivery partners will work together to simplify the offer to employers.</p>

The Office of Nuclear Development will work with industry partners to develop the nuclear supply chain and maximise high value-added work captured by UK manufacturers from an estimated &#163;20 billion capital expenditure in nuclear. And a new Office for Renewable Energy Deployment will be established to address barriers to renewables deployment including helping to develop the UK supply chain. Nuclear and renewables alone could create up to 260,000 jobs over the next ten years.</p>

the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 will for the first time bring together in one agency housing and regeneration funding, public land and expertise to deliver decent, affordable housing and regenerate our communities by creating places where people choose to live. It will play a key role in turning our ambition to deliver three million new homes by 2020 into a reality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="80910m0001.htm_para4"><a name="0809104000036">As part of that role, I am today announcing that from 1 December 2008 the Homes and Communities Agency will take on responsibility for the Gypsy and Traveller Site Grant, which provides funding for the provision and refurbishment of Gypsy and Traveller sites. This approach will bring delivery of homes for Gypsies and Travellers into line with the arrangements for housing and accommodation delivery for the rest of the community. It reflects our determination to address the existing shortfall in accommodation for all in society, tackling the problems that can be caused by unauthorised camping and the poor life chances of Gypsies and Travellers themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="80910m0001.htm_para5"><a name="0809104000037">The HCA will be responsible for administering the Gypsy and Traveller Site Grant to meet ambitious but realistic targets for the delivery of pitches across England. Through its close relationship with local authorities and other delivery partners, the HCA will be well placed to step up the pace of delivery for the benefit of both Gypsies and Travellers and the settled community. This approach responds to the findings of the independent task group on site provision and enforcement, chaired by Sir Brian Briscoe, whose report issued in December found that the policy framework for site provision was sound, but that delivery was slow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="80910m0001.htm_para6"><a name="0809104000038">Ministers will continue to have oversight of the programme, ensuring that it achieves the Government&#146;s objectives of meeting Gypsies&#146; and Travellers&#146; accommodation needs and supporting community cohesion. We will also be asking the HCA to recommend any changes to the programme for 2010-11 that may be necessary to improve delivery. The sum of &#163;97 million was allocated for the grant through the CSR07 period, and funding for 2009-10 and 2010-11 will be transferred in full to the HCA on its establishment.</p>

PA manage under contract to the Home Office. I was informed the same day and immediately initiated an inquiry into this incident, undertaken by the Home Office Security Unit with advice and support from the Metropolitan Police. The incident inquiry has now been completed. The Information Commissioner and Cabinet Office have been kept fully informed. I have also today sent a full report to the Information Commissioner and have placed a copy in the House Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para1"><a name="0809104000055">JTrack is the operational system used by the police and Crown Prosecution Service as part of the Government&#146;s Prolific and other Priority Offender (PPO) programme. The data on JTrack relate to prisoners and other offenders in England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para2"><a name="0809104000056">The inquiry found that data were transferred to PA from the Home Office in a secure manner. These data were not handled securely by a PA employee on their premises. Data were downloaded to a data stick. The data stick was used to transfer data between computers on the PA premises and was not encrypted or managed appropriately. The data stick went missing and, despite extensive searches, has not been found. This was a clear breach of the robust terms of the contract covering security and data handling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para3"><a name="0809104000057">Based on the findings of the inquiry, the Home Office have decided to terminate this contract. My officials are currently working with PA to take this work back in house without affecting the operation of JTrack or the PPO programme. Data transfers to PA for JTrack were suspended immediately following the incident, data handling has now been transferred to the Home Office, and the system is fully operational. Other PA activity such as system maintenance and user training will be transferred by December.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para4"><a name="0809104000058">We are reviewing our other contracts with PA, specifically from a data handling and security perspective. Lessons learned from this incident more generally will be applied to working with suppliers on contracts involving sensitive data.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para5"><a name="0809104000059">Together with the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Ministry of Justice, we have undertaken careful assessments of the potential risks to individuals of this incident. The risk to public safety is assessed as low. The risk to individuals whose data was lost is also assessed as low. Appropriate measures are in place for individuals seeking information about the data held on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para6"><a name="0809104000060">The Home Office has been very active in implementing the findings of the Hannigan Data Handling Review but as with other incidents of data loss the Government are reviewing the circumstances of this incident and will ensure that any lessons, including in relation to strengthening the delivery chain, are incorporated in the ongoing programme of work to provide support and guidance to Departments on information assurance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para7"><a name="0809104000061">Given the seriousness of this incident, I believe it is important both to provide external assurance to the public on our response to the incident and also to enable others to benefit from the lessons learned. Hence I have commissioned Dr. Stephen Hickey to undertake an external scrutiny of our response. I will be placing a report of his findings in the House Library in due course.</p>

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="0809104000062"><a name="80910m0002.htm_spmin0"><a name="0809104000154"><b>The Secretary of State for the Home Department (Jacqui Smith):</b>
 On 6 December 2007, I published Sir Clive Booth&#146;s report &#147;Determining Pay in the Police Service&#148;. Sir Clive Booth recommended that a pay review body for police officers should be created. I indicated that the Government accepted his recommendations and we would consult on proposals for implementing the necessary changes to the police officer pay machinery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para8"><a name="0809104000063">On 8 January 2008, I wrote to the Police Negotiating Board (PNB) asking them to consider a multi-year deal for police officers based on the index used by the Police Arbitration Tribunal (PAT) in 2007. I made clear that if the PNB agreed such a deal then it could be implemented in full, and the issue of implementing a pay review body for police officers would become less pressing. We therefore deferred consultation on the implementation of a pay review body while negotiations on a multi-year deal were taking place. The Government&#146;s approach on this was also set out in &#147;From the Neighbourhood to the National: Policing our Communities Together&#148; (Cm 7448) published on 17 July 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para9"><a name="0809104000064">The official Side of the PNB made an offer of a three-year pay deal which was one of the most generous in the public sector. Regrettably, there was a failure to agree with the staff side on this basis. In the event that the PNB had agreed a multi-year deal there would have been no role for a pay review body for some time, but disappointingly for the third consecutive year a deal was not agreed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para10"><a name="0809104000065">The Government are therefore today beginning consultation on proposals for implementing a pay review body for police officers. Sir Clive Booth already consulted widely with policing stakeholders when undertaking his review. So this second consultation will be an opportunity for stakeholders to comment on the detail of the proposed changes to the police officer pay machinery, including : the scope and purpose of the new body; its remit; membership and coverage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para11"><a name="0809104000066">The consultation will close on Wednesday 5 November 2008.</p>

 On 25 August I published a consultation document, &#147;Review of Police Injury Benefits: Government Proposals&#148;, which sets out proposals for a revised police injury awards scheme in the UK. We intend that the new scheme should be in place as early as is possible in 2009, following agreement of the key issues in the Police Negotiating Board by December this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para13"><a name="0809104000069">The review of the current police injury awards scheme has given us the opportunity to ensure that we have a system of benefits with criteria suitable for modern-day conditions and which ensures that the financial support currently given to police officers and their families for injury or death in the line of duty is properly targeted and is effectively and consistently administered by police  <br>

forces. The proposals in the consultation document cover a range of issues, including the eligibility criteria for receiving an award, the structure of benefits under the scheme for both former officers and their survivors, and the role of police authorities and medical practitioners involved in considering claims for awards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para14"><a name="0809104000070">Key proposals set out in the consultation document include:</p>
<a name="80910m0002.htm_brev0"><a name="0809104000130"><ul><p class="tabletext">The introduction, as announced by the Home Secretary to the Police Federation conference in May this year, of life-long adult survivor benefits and the extension of survivor benefits to nominated unmarried and unregistered partners in cases where an officer dies in the line of duty. At present survivor benefits for death in the line of duty are restricted to bereaved spouses and civil partners and are stopped on remarriage or cohabitation.</p>
</ul><a name="80910m0002.htm_brev1"><a name="0809104000131"><ul><p class="tabletext">Simplifying injury and survivor awards so they are easier to understand and apply. For instance, if an officer dies or is totally disabled within one year of an injury in the line of duty, the lump sum payment made will as a matter of course be five times the officer&#146;s pensionable salary. Currently financial support is set at four times the officer&#146;s actual total salary if that works out to be the lesser amount.</p>
</ul><a name="80910m0002.htm_brev2"><a name="0809104000132"><ul><p class="tabletext">Making injury and death payments fairer. The pensionable salary on which lump sum awards are based will be changed so that it is based on average pensionable pay. This will take account of a person&#146;s working hours averaged over his or her police career rather than simply the pensionable pay at the time the officer ceased to serve. This will protect those who may have just reduced their hours before being injured.</p>
</ul><a name="80910m0002.htm_brev3"><a name="0809104000133"><ul><p class="tabletext">Revising the eligibility criteria and clarifying the definition for injuries received in the line of duty. This clarification will mean officers will be specifically covered for injury benefits as a result of a terrorist attack and will focus benefits on those injuries received in the line of duty. Proposals will also include withdrawing cover for injury or death sustained on a journey to or from work where the cause was not related to police duty&#151;to bring injury benefits for the police service in line with injury benefits for other public servants.</p>
</ul><a name="80910m0002.htm_brev4"><a name="0809104000134"><ul><p class="tabletext">A clearer link between injury awards and police duty, by introducing a five-year time limit for new post-retirement claims, except in the case of specified progressive illnesses and specified conditions with a long incubation period.</p>
</ul><a name="80910m0002.htm_brev5"><a name="0809104000135"><ul><p class="tabletext">A clearer link between injury awards and compensation for loss of earnings, by introducing an absolute cut-off for new claims at age 65 or state pension age at the time if over 65.</p>
</ul><a name="80910m0002.htm_brev6"><a name="0809104000136"><ul><p class="tabletext">Replacing injury pension reviews at age 65 (or the state pension age at the time if over 65) by introducing a new minimum retirement income guarantee. Under the current system officers injured early in their career can suffer a large reduction in financial support in their retirement if the review takes them to the lowest pay banding. The new retirement income guarantee will protect against this.</p>
</ul><a name="80910m0002.htm_brev7"><a name="0809104000137"><ul><p class="tabletext">No longer paying injury pensions in cases where a former officer has suffered only a very slight loss of earning capacity as a result of the injury. In cases where the loss of earning capacity is 10 per cent. or less the former officer will receive a lump sum payment in recognition of the injury. This will allow benefits to be targeted where they are needed most.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para15"><a name="0809104000071">Any changes made as a result of the review will apply to officers serving at the time of implementation, regardless of whether they have already sustained an injury. They will not apply retrospectively however, that is, to officers who have already retired when the changes come into force&#151;they will still be dealt with under the system as it currently stands, even if they have not yet applied for an award.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para20"><a name="0809104000078">Despite this plan, on 26 August, Russia unilaterally recognised the independence of South Ossetia and of Georgia&#146;s other separatist region, Abkhazia. Russia also refused to withdraw its forces from Georgia and in some cases moved to reinforce them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para21"><a name="0809104000079">It was in this context that I and my right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para22"><a name="0809104000080">At this meeting the European Council unanimously condemned Russia&#146;s decision to recognise the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia; and expressed its grave concern about the consequences of the conflict and Russia&#146;s disproportionate military action. Russia&#146;s actions were in clear breach of international law and of successive UN Security Council Resolutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para23"><a name="0809104000081">In response to Russian actions, the Council decided to conduct a comprehensive review of EU-Russia relations. This evaluation has begun and will continue in the run up to the next EU-Russia summit scheduled to take place in Nice on 14 November 2008. The EU has decided to suspend negotiations with Russia on the new EU Partnership and Co-operation Agreement (PCA) until Russian troops withdraw from Georgia to their pre-conflict line. We strongly support this decision. As I made clear during Council discussions, although the EU should continue discussions with Russia on areas of interest and concern to the EU, it cannot be &#147;business as usual&#148;. This review will allow us to take a considered decision about the future of EU-Russia relations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para24"><a name="0809104000082">Russia&#146;s actions in Georgia illustrate the need for Europe to intensify efforts to ensure its long-term energy security. The European Council tasked the EU with examining initiatives to be taken to this end. We should explore all options for the diversification of energy supply in the EU, including increased support for infrastructure that diversifies energy sources, an increased commitment to renewable energy, measures to improve energy efficiency and measures to improve the internal market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para25"><a name="0809104000083">The international community must support Georgia in rebuilding the damage caused by the conflict.

The Council and the Commission have been tasked to start preparations for an international conference to bring focus to reconstruction efforts. The UK will play its part. We have already committed &#163;2 million to Georgia in humanitarian aid. The EU has pledged to step up its relations with Georgia, including through visa facilitation measures, appointing an EU special envoy and the possible establishment of a full and comprehensive free trade area as soon as the conditions are met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para27"><a name="0809104000085">The international community will support efforts to ensure lasting peace and security in the region, including through the presence of observers on the ground. In line with the EU Council conclusions and the 8 September Moscow agreement, the European Union will contribute to these efforts. EU Foreign Ministers will discuss the deployment of EU monitors at the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) on Monday, 15 September. It is vital that international monitors are given free and unfettered access by all sides to carry out their mandate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="80910m0002.htm_para28"><a name="0809104000086">The EU&#146;s response to this crisis must also consider the implications for the EU&#146;s common neighbourhood. On 27 August my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary travelled to Kiev where he made a speech on the need for closer ties between the EU and the region. I am pleased that the Council agreed that the EU should strengthen its relations with the region, including Ukraine.
