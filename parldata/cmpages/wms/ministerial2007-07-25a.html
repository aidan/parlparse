Euro area member states are required every year to present stability programmes, and non-euro area member states convergence programmes under the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact. Ministers agreed a decision that the Czech Republic has not complied with the terms of its Excessive Deficit Procedure, and examined a communication from the Commission which concludes that Hungary is taking sufficient action in response to its Excessive Deficit Procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="70725m0001.htm_para15"><a name="07072565000076">HMRC have estimated that they need to review around 160,000 awards in total from 2003-04 and 2004-05, out of the 6 million households that are benefiting from tax credits. These are cases where information that reduced the households&#146; entitlement came to light after the award for that year had been finalised and closed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"><a name="70725m0001.htm_para18"><a name="07072565000079">Although the revised award was an accurate reflection of the households&#146; new circumstances, the process by which HMRC took this into account was not correct. HMRC should have notified recipients in writing at the time, that it was examining the award after finalisation, but did not do so in certain cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_396"><a name="70725m0001.htm_para49"><a name="07072565000123">An independent review, the Graham Review, recommended changes to modernise and streamline SFLG in 2004, changes which were implemented from December 2005. The new form of the scheme focuses on start-ups and young businesses under five years old, simplifies the eligibility criteria, and enables participating lenders to take all operational decisions regarding individual loans, providing their normal commercial lending criteria but for the lack of security are met. BERR has been engaging strategically with lenders to gain a better understanding of how the scheme is being used. Whilst it is too early to assess the full impact of the new form of the scheme on the debt finance gap, the Annual Report highlights initial indications of progress against each of the benchmarks set by the Graham Review. Going forward the focus now will be to continue to build strategic relationships with existing lenders to ensure the full potential of SFLG is exploited, and to extend the lender base to further broaden availability of the scheme.

<p><a name="st_101"><a name="07072565000126"><a name="70725m0002.htm_spmin0"><a name="07072565000411"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Kevin Brennan):</b>
 I am announcing today the support the Government will provide to front-line professionals in children's services by implementing a single national IT system to support the Common Assessment Framework (eCAF).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_398"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para0"><a name="07072565000127">The Common Assessment Framework (CAF) is a key element of the Every Child Matters programme to transform children's services by supporting more effective prevention and early intervention. Its goal is to provide a standardised approach for practitioners in the holistic assessment of a child's needs and the design of an integrated service to meet those needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_399"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para1"><a name="07072565000128">By facilitating a greater number of early interventions, eCAF will shift the focus from dealing with the consequences of difficulties in children's lives to preventing them from happening in the first place. By facilitating better collaboration between practitioners and encouraging needs-led intervention, eCAF will directly improve the experience of service provision for children and families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_400"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para2"><a name="07072565000129">Any given case with a child can involve multiple agencies working across borders, both geographic and organisational. It is, therefore, essential that any supporting mechanism for CAF provides practitioners from different sectors easy access to key information concerning the assessment to allow them to plan, monitor, and review a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of the most appropriate services. eCAF is the response to this need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para3"><a name="07072565000130">eCAF will allow a practitioner to create electronically, store, and share a CAF securely. Completion of CAFs by different agencies and the subsequent exchanges of data between relevant agencies promote multi-agency working and early interventions. The complexities of cross border work are removed, as eCAF provides a consistent approach for all practitioners working in different agencies and locations, thus facilitating the effective and efficient delivery of a coordinated service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_402"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para4"><a name="07072565000131">eCAF will only hold information about some (not all) children, with consent, and for a limited period of time. It will offer a systematic means of capturing:</p>
<a name="70725m0002.htm_brev0"><a name="07072565000132"><ul><p class="tabletext">details of child/young person being assessed (i.e. name, gender, date of birth, contact details, ethnicity and immigration details);</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para6"><a name="07072565000143">Using eCAF, the assessment process will be enhanced through the removal of unnecessary administration and inherent business issues, allowing practitioners to focus on activities that have the greatest impact. Business issues that eCAF will reduce include unnecessary repeat assessments, inappropriate referrals and inappropriate interventions. Efficiency gains from the reduction of these business issues are expected to yield savings estimated at &#163;150 million over the first eight years from the inception of the national system. We do not intend to reduce funding for children's services, but instead to enable savings realised to be reinvested in more and better services for children and more effective use of staff time. We anticipate that this will enhance staff satisfaction with their jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_405"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para7"><a name="07072565000144">Using proven technology, the system will be built and implemented on a single nationally, hosted infrastructure that all practitioners will use. Data will be held in a single physical location enabling practitioners to easily work together, accessing the most up-to-date information. The system will have the ability to share data with other case management systems in order to avoid duplication of input when specialist assessments are created. Locally owned systems can be modified to take advantage of this functionality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_406"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para8"><a name="07072565000145">The Government will ensure that the eCAF system is secure, and will therefore ensure it complies with rigorous security standards. Access to it will be granted only to authorised users who have undergone appropriate checks, including those provided by the Criminal Records Bureau. Practitioner use of the eCAF system will be audited to ensure information is only accessed where it is necessary for practitioners to do so, and so guard against inappropriate access by authorised users.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para11"><a name="07072565000148">The Government are planning to commit one-off implementation costs estimated to be &#163;44.5 million in total across the next six financial years (including  <br>

Operating costs, thereafter, will be &#163;6.4 million per year (including VAT).

 I have published today a consultation paper on Accounting for Leaseholders Monies which sets out proposals to amend the requirements under the 2002 Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act (the 2002 Act) for landlords to provide a regular statement of account for service charges to their tenants and for service charge monies to be held in separate designated bank accounts. A copy of the paper has been placed in the Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_411"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para13"><a name="07072565000151">The Government's view is that service charge payers are entitled to receive a certain minimum level of accounting information about the monies they provide. Measures contained in the 2002 Act set out to provide greater transparency and protection for service charge monies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para14"><a name="07072565000152">Following the introduction of the 2002 Act further consultation took place with stakeholders on the content of the regulations that would provide the specific detail of how the accounting provisions would operate. A full public consultation was undertaken in June 2004. Following detailed consideration of the responses to the June 2004 paper it has been decided that our proposals for the content of the regular statement of account, requirements of the certification process and for the holding of service charges in a separate account should be revised. This was in order to examine fully whether the objectives behind the legislation could be achieved without creating unnecessary burdens upon landlords and ultimately additional charges for leaseholders that were highlighted as arising under previous proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_413"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para15"><a name="07072565000153">The consultation runs until 4 October 2007 and the Government would welcome responses to their proposals up until that date.</p>

 On 27 March 2007 my hon. Friend, the then Minister for Local Government, announced that 16 of the 26 proposals from local authorities for the creation of unitary local government would proceed to stakeholder consultation. These proposals were in response to our &#147;Invitation to Councils&#148; issued on 26 October 2006.</p>

Since then we have reassessed the 16 proposals against the five criteria in our original invitation, having regard to all the further material and representations received as a result of that consultation and to all other currently available relevant information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_415"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para17"><a name="07072565000156">These five criteria are that change to future unitary structures must be affordable, and be supported by a broad cross section of partners and stakeholders; and the future structures must provide strong, effective and accountable strategic leadership, deliver genuine opportunities for neighbourhood flexibility and empowerment, and deliver value for money and equity on public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_416"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para18"><a name="07072565000157">My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, has now decided to proceed as follows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_417"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para19"><a name="07072565000158">She is minded to implement the nine unitary proposals listed in table 1 below, if and when the necessary legislative provisions in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, which passed this House on 22 May and is currently being considered in the other place, are enacted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_418"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para20"><a name="07072565000159">Her judgment is that there is a reasonable likelihood that all these proposals, if implemented, would achieve the outcomes specified by the five criteria, and we believe we can afford to implement them all. We do not therefore need to prioritise these proposals in order to decide which ones to implement, as explained in the written statement on the 27 March.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_419"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para21"><a name="07072565000160">These new unitaries, as they move towards implementation, will need to take into account our developing agenda for empowering citizens and communities and for stronger economic leadership, as set out in the Government&#146;s, Green Paper &#147;Governance of Britain&#148;, published on the 3 July, and the review of sub-national economic development and regeneration, published on the 17 July. Implementation will also need to take into account the recommendations of our Councillors Commission, when it reports in November.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_420"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para22"><a name="07072565000161">We recognise on the basis of the available information that in four cases - the proposals from Bedford borough council, Chester city council, Exeter city council, and Ipswich borough council&#151;there are risks to their achieving the outcomes specified by the affordability criterion. Accordingly, we are asking these councils to undertake further work and submit additional information on the financial viability of their proposals. We will have regard to this information along with all other relevant available information before taking final decisions, if and when the Bill is enacted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_421"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para23"><a name="07072565000162">Implementing Bedford borough&#146;s proposal means that we must consider the future local government structures for the remaining county area. We are satisfied that this area needs unitary local government, and we intend formally to invite all the other councils in Bedfordshire to propose a unitary solution that would meet our five criteria for that remaining area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_422"><a name="70725m0002.htm_para24"><a name="07072565000163">Once implemented these nine proposals, on the basis of councils&#146; current estimates, will save over &#163;150 million annually, giving councils opportunities for improved services and lower council taxes. The proposals open the door to creating new flagship councils which can lead the way on meeting today&#146;s challenges of promoting prosperity, empowering citizens and communities, and modernising local service delivery.</p>

 On 5 February 2003 the the Secretary of State for Defence announced the Government&#146;s agreement to a request from the US to upgrade the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System radar at RAF Fylingdales. The UK already makes a contribution to US capability in the area of missile warning, through our operation of the radar at RAF Fylingdales. That upgrade process is now complete and we expect that the radar will switch its operations to the new equipment from August 2007. There is no change to the existing UK-US mission for the radar and the station remains under full UK command. Its primary mission is to warn of ballistic missile attack, with secondary functions of space surveillance and satellite warning. The radar will contribute to the US ballistic missile defence system, alongside a global network of other US-owned sensors based on land, at sea and in space and the data it produces is shared between the UK and US military authorities. The UK will have full insight into the operation of the US missile defence system when missile engagements take place that are wholly or partly influenced by data from the radar at RAF Fylingdales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_431"><a name="70725m0003.htm_para0"><a name="07072565000207">Also, at RAF Menwith Hill, equipment will be installed and operated by the US Government to allow receipt of satellite warnings of potentially hostile missile launches, and will pass this warning data to both UK and US authorities. The data will also be fed into the US ballistic missile defence system for use in their response to any missile attack on the US. This will guarantee the UK&#146;s continued access to essential missile attack warning data, as well as enhancing the US&#146;s ability to deal with any attack aimed at their country.</p>

NATO has made no decisions about acquiring missile defence for the alliance, and we want to examine how the US system can be complemented and built upon to provide wider coverage for Europe. We have no plans to site missile interceptors in the UK but will keep this under review as the threat evolves. We also want to reassure Russia about the defensive nature and intent of the US system as it develops and to take forward alliance cooperation with them in the field of missile defence.</p>

 On 31 July, Operation Banner will come to an end; the Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy having delivered continuous support to the police and civil authorities in Northern Ireland for 38 years. It will have been the longest continuous deployment of UK Armed Forces in their history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_434"><a name="70725m0003.htm_para3"><a name="07072565000211">As we move into a new era with fewer than 5,000 troops resident in Northern Ireland, trained and available for deployment worldwide, the military will retain some limited but specific responsibilities with the capability to deploy in situations of extreme public disorder in support of the Police Service of Northern Ireland under a new operation to be known as Operation Helvetic.

After 1 August the vast majority of military support in Northern Ireland will be broadly comparable to the assistance that is currently provided in Great Britain, tailored for the particular circumstances in Northern Ireland. Additionally, whilst the Armed Forces are not responsible for maintaining national security in the UK, that does not mean that they would not and could not provide specific support in this area to a civil authority when requested to do so. Again the approach in Northern Ireland will be brought more closely into line with that on the mainland.</p>

essential flying training will continue in order to maintain the skills of the aircrew and, with Northern Ireland designated as Low Flying Area 19, the training emphasis will be similar to other areas within the UK. Helicopters will also continue to be used in Northern Ireland in support of the civil authorities. It is important to note that the civil authorities in Northern Ireland do not have access to large numbers of civilian helicopters and we will continue to provide support to them.</p>

The impact of the commitment since 1969 has been considerable on both the military themselves and on the MOD civilians supporting them. They and the community at large have suffered both death and injury. We should take this opportunity to remember the commitment, bravery and sacrifice of all those who have served over so many years in helping deliver the current, more settled and more optimistic circumstances.

 I am able to inform the House today of the findings of the Royal Air Force board of inquiry into the loss of the RAF Hercules XV206 in Afghanistan on 24 May 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_438"><a name="70725m0003.htm_para7"><a name="07072565000216">The purpose of a board of inquiry is to establish the circumstances of the loss and to learn lessons from it; it does not seek to apportion blame.</p>

The board has established that on 24 May 2006, an RAF Hercules C130K on a routine operational passenger and freight flight landed at Lashkar Gar Tactical Landing Zone. On landing the aircraft suffered significant damage to the front port main landing gear, resulting in debris puncturing the port wing fuel tanks, which in turn caused an uncontrollable wing fire leading to the loss of the aircraft. The board has concluded that these events followed the detonation of an explosive device buried under the surface of the tactical landing zone. Following extensive investigation the board concluded that the device was an anti-tank land mine.</p>

In addition, a redacted version of the main body of the board of inquiry report will also be available on the website. As you will appreciate, the safety of our people is a principal consideration and we have removed from the report any information that might endanger the security or capability of UK and coalition personnel or be of use to an enemy. We have, however, tried to be as open as possible and have carefully considered the public interest arguments both for and against disclosure of the information in the report. We have ensured that each redaction can be justified by an appropriate exemption in the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

The board made a number of recommendations that we will study closely. Indeed, we have acted on many of them already. The main recommendation was that we review the force protection procedures at tactical landing zones. Air Command and Permanent Joint Headquarters have developed revised force protection procedures and tactics to be employed at tactical landing zones in operational theatres. These are now being used by force protection teams on operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

The numbers of service personnel assessed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during the same period are around 0.3 per 1,000 strength or 0.03 per cent. of the total armed forces population.

It has configured our mental health services to provide community-based mental health care in line with national best practice&#151;establishing 15 military Departments of Community Mental Health across the UK (plus satellite centres overseas). It has introduced a Reserves Mental Health Programme to assess, and if appropriate, treat recently demobilised reserves. It has expanded the scope of its Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) at St. Thomas&#146;s hospital to provide assessments by an expert in military mental health for any veterans suffering from mental health problems since 1982.

Some respondents objected that this proposal was likely to deter those individuals appealing to the granting of liquor licenses in their neighbourhood. As a consequence, the definition has been amended so that it only applies to an appeal against a decision by a local authority to refuse a licence. The general fees which apply to miscellaneous magistrates civil proceedings will apply to an appeal against the granting of a licence.</p>

The recommendations are in three key areas&#151;the handling of freedom of information requests, the handling of judicial review applications and, finally, on Northern Ireland court procedures. He recommends that while FoI requests and judicial review proceedings create handling difficulties, both would benefit from greater strategic control and more effective controls over processing, these to be strengthened by regular review to identify and address problems arising. In respect of court procedure, Mr. Scott suggests consideration is given to the adoption of a pre-action protocol, similar to that in use in England and Wales.</p>

 In June 2003, the then Secretary of State for Transport committed the Government to establishing the Traffic Officer Service on England's motorways, reflecting the Highways Agency's change of focus to become a network operator. Since then, the Service has been rolled out in phases across the motorway network, supported by a strong partnership with the police. The Highways Agency has recently reported on the progress made during the period from April 2006 to March 2007. I am pleased to report that the Agency has now completed the full transfer of traffic management functions from the police and the Traffic Officer Service is now fully operational.</p>

 This statement is to update the House on the progress of the salvage operation for the MSC Napoli. Since the ship was beached in Lyme Bay on 20 January, an effective salvage operation has removed almost all of the fuel oil and all of the containers from the ship. The final container was removed on 17 May 2007. Only very small amounts of fuel oil, located in hard to reach sections of the ship, remain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_509"><a name="70725m0005.htm_para12"><a name="07072565000375">The most significant remaining task is the disposal of the ship and work on this is already underway. We were aware that our options for disposing of the ship would be dependent upon the condition of the ship itself and this could not be assessed properly while the ship was beached. Accordingly, the MSC Napoli was refloated on 9 July. A subsequent dive survey revealed that the hull was in an extremely fragile state. To reduce the risk of the ship breaking up in an uncontrolled manner, the Secretary of State's Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention (SOSREP) took the decision to re-beach the ship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_510"><a name="70725m0005.htm_para13"><a name="07072565000376">A small amount of oil leaked from the ship during this operation. Clean up procedures were put into operation immediately and while a number of birds are reported to have been oiled, we believe that the environmental impact was not severe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_511"><a name="70725m0005.htm_para14"><a name="07072565000377">Once it was apparent that the entire ship could not be removed from Lyme Bay, SOSREP's advice was that the best course of action was to separate the ship into two parts. The bow section of the ship is relatively intact and retains buoyancy. On the other hand, the stern section, which contains the ship's engines, cannot be floated. By separating the two sections of the ship, we would have the opportunity to reduce the impact on Lyme Bay's natural environment that would result from dismantling the entire ship in its current position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_512"><a name="70725m0005.htm_para15"><a name="07072565000378">Accordingly, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, with assistance from the Ministry of Defence, carried out a series of controlled detonations, using cutting charges, on the ship on 17, 18 and 20 July, with the aim of cutting the ship in two as cleanly as possible. Following the final set of detonations, the ship was separated on 20 July.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_513"><a name="70725m0005.htm_para16"><a name="07072565000379">The stern section of the ship will need to be dismantled in its current location. The ship owners are currently tendering a contract for this work and are drawing up a detailed time-line. Plans for this work will need to take into account the protection of the local environment of Lyme Bay.</p>

That is why we are setting up an independent body with the necessary skills and experience to get the policy design of personal accounts right, and to ensure that the interests of members remain at the heart of the scheme. As chair designate of the Delivery Authority, Paul will bring a proven track record and a wealth of experience in the financial sector. One of his first tasks will be to take part in the selection of the authority&#146;s chief executive.</p>
