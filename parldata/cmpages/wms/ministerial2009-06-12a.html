with the UK&#146;s policy for Afghanistan and Pakistan announced by the Prime Minister on 29 April 2009 and is essential to the long-term stability of Afghanistan. Following discussions on the NTM-A&#146;s tasks with my NATO colleagues this week, I can announce the UK will contribute to the mission by leading the ANA&#146;s combined arms training school. The school will be multinational and will provide &#147;train the trainer&#148; courses across Afghanistan for ANA instructors in junior officer, non-commissioned officer (NCO), infantry support weapons, armour and artillery training. The school represents a new stage in the development of the ANA&#146;s training. The UK will therefore be able to transfer some of its personnel already engaged in ANA training to the school and so there will be no need to increase UK force levels. The UK will also continue to provide mentoring teams for the ANA and ANP in Helmand province and ANA officer candidate training in Kabul.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="90612m0001.htm_para7"><a name="09061261000032">The GAERC will discuss the presidency&#146;s agenda for the June European Council. The European Council will focus on EU institutional issues, including Ireland&#146;s guarantees on the Lisbon treaty and Commission President Barroso&#146;s re-appointment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="90612m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09061261000033">The Council will also discuss the economic, financial and social situation, taking &#147;first decisions&#148; on financial regulation based on the Commission&#146;s proposals on the de Larosière report as well as examining the progress of the G20 summit outcomes. There will also be a discussion of climate change funding mechanisms in order to help develop an EU position ahead of the Copenhagen climate change conference in December. Illegal migration in the Mediterranean is likely to be discussed, as is the Ukraine/Russia gas dispute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="90612m0001.htm_para9"><a name="09061261000034">Finally, on external issues, we expect coverage of the situation in Afghanistan / Pakistan, the Middle East and Burma.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="90612m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09061261000035">The Government support these discussions at the June European Council. In particular, we welcome the continued co-ordinated EU response to the economic and financial situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="90612m0001.htm_para12"><a name="09061261000037">The Council is likely to take stock of the progress of accession negotiations with Croatia, delayed due to Slovenia blocking the nine chapters ready for opening or closing. The Government believe that bilateral disputes should not delay the accession negotiations. We continue to urge both countries to find a mutually acceptable solution to their territorial dispute and support the efforts of Commissioner Rehn to facilitate this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="90612m0001.htm_para15"><a name="09061261000040">The GAERC is likely to reiterate EU support for a two state solution in accordance with previous agreements between the parties; access to Gaza and a comprehensive, regional approach. We also expect Ministers to express their support for the US commitment to the MEPP, and reaffirm the EU&#146;s readiness to work in close co-operation with the US and other international partners towards achieving a lasting peace. The EU-Israel Association Council will take place in the margins of the GAERC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="90612m0001.htm_para17"><a name="09061261000042">Ministers may discuss Cuba on the occasion of the annual review of the EU&#146;s common position and the parallel review of the recently re-instated EU-Cuba political dialogue. The Council is likely to adopt conclusions which: renew the EU&#146;s commitment to the common position and dual track engagement with Government and civil society; confirm the continuation of the political dialogue; and express concern at the lack of concrete  <br>

progress on our human rights concerns. The Government remain concerned about the human rights situation in Cuba, but continue to support a policy of engagement. Continuation of the political dialogue will allow more time for it to achieve results.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="90612m0001.htm_para18"><a name="09061261000043"><i>Burma</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="90612m0001.htm_para19"><a name="09061261000044">On Burma, we expect the Council to discuss developments in the trial of Aung San Suu Kyi, and in particular the need for a robust EU response in the event of a guilty verdict. It is not yet clear whether a verdict will come before the GAERC. Were Aung San Suu Kyi to be subjected to a further period of house arrest, or worse, imprisoned, this would remove the last shred of credibility from elections planned for 2010. In such circumstances we would expect the Council to issue strong conclusions outlining the steps the EU planned to take in response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="90612m0001.htm_para20"><a name="09061261000045"><i>Western Balkans</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="90612m0001.htm_para21"><a name="09061261000046">On the Western Balkans, Ministers will agree conclusions on visa liberalisation, regional co-operation, and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). The UK is not a party to the Schengen agreement and so does not participate in decisions on visa liberalisation. On BiH, the EU will underline the importance of further reform, and reaffirm its commitment to the five objectives and two conditions that need to be completed before transition from the office of the high representative to a solely EU special representative-led mission can occur. Ministers may also discuss co-operation by the countries in the region with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="90612m0001.htm_para22"><a name="09061261000047">AOB</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="90612m0001.htm_para23"><a name="09061261000048"><i>Moldova</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="90612m0001.htm_para24"><a name="09061261000049">Ministers may discuss the EU&#146;s relationship with Moldova, and the current political uncertainty following the failure to elect a new President and the requirement for new parliamentary elections. They will emphasise the importance of holding free and fair elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="90612m0001.htm_para25"><a name="09061261000050"><i>Illegal Migration</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="90612m0001.htm_para26"><a name="09061261000051">There will be a short discussion of illegal migration in the Mediterranean region, at the request of Greece. We expect Ministers to focus on increasing and strengthening co-operation in Europe to tackle the increasing flows of illegal migration. The UK supports this and recognises the particular challenges that are faced by Greece and other Mediterranean countries. We are also keen to further the UK&#146;s bilateral relationship with Greece on migration through the provision of technical advice and assistance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="90612m0001.htm_para27"><a name="09061261000052"><i>Georgia</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="90612m0001.htm_para28"><a name="09061261000053">Ministers&#146; discussions are likely to focus on the continued role of the EU monitoring mission (EUMM), whose mandate is due for renewal in September. Ministers are also likely to take into account the outcome of discussions in New York on the renewal of the UN mission&#146;s mandate, and the possibilities for increased co-operation between international missions on the ground.</p>

While OSIB is an FCO/UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) initiative a great deal of its added value is the result of bringing together systematically a range of sources of information from across Government. The new product will cover issues such as political security risks, bribery and corruption, physical and personnel security, the terrorist threat and organized crime. It is presented in a co-ordinated and easily accessible way, including links to useful non-governmental web sites.</p>

Also, it will draw on, and complement, information provided by our Embassies and High Commissions, who in many cases already have arrangements in place to exchange information on security issues with locally based British companies and to provide information on request to business visitors.</p>

UKTI intend to establish shortly a joint advisory group, to be chaired by a business representative, comprising a cross section of business, and officials from the Government Departments most closely involved in the initiative. We anticipate that the joint advisory group will meet three times per year. It will provide direction to OSIB and facilitate collaboration with key international business security associations.</p>
