Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls):</b> The
Treasury has been working closely with the Financial Services Authority
and industry on the development of a UK covered bonds regime. UK
covered bonds are based on well-accepted market standards and benefit
from a high level of legal certainty. The object of Treasury and FSA
work is to ensure compliance with the Undertakings for Collective
Investment in Transferable Securities ('UCITS') Directive. To this end,
the Treasury intends to consult on secondary legislation at the
earliest possible opportunity, with implementation by the end of 2007,
earlier if possible. Such compliance creates a level playing field for
UK covered bonds in the EU and delivers the best possible risk weight
for UK covered bonds under the Capital Requirements Directive. Covered
bonds have the benefit
of:</p><a name="06062967000029"><ul><p class="tabletext">being a
highly liquid, medium to long dated and cost effective debt

Tax
Capping</h4><p><a name="06062967000033"><b><a name="06062967000160">The
Minister for Local Government (Mr. Phil Woolas):</b> On 27
March I made a statement to the House on council tax capping. In this,
I set out the action that the Government proposed to take, under the
Local Government Finance Act 1992, against two local authorities which
had set excessive budgets for 2006-07 according to the principles that
I announced, 27 March 2006, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 567-69.
Those two authorities were York city council and Medway borough
council, which were both &#147;designated&#148;, with a view to
capping them in year. I am making a statement today about the decisions
on both
cases.</p><p><a name="06062967000034">York
and Medway were given 21 days in which to challenge the maximum budgets
the Government proposed to set them in 2006-07, and to provide the
information we had requested. Both authorities challenged their
proposed maximum budgets and I met delegations from each of them to
hear their cases in person.</p><br><notus-date day="29" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>29 Jun 2006 : Column 14WS</b><br><p><a name="06062967000035">The
vast majority of authorities now appreciate the seriousness with which
the Government views the need to protect council tax payers against
excessive increases. The average band D council tax increase in England
for 2006-07, without the council-tax element of the Olympics, is 4.2
per cent. (with the Olympics, it is 4.5 per cent.). Over 99 per cent.,
of authorities have responded well to our message and have not set
excessive budgets. Despite the fact that the principles which the
Secretary of State used to determine excessiveness were tighter this
year than last, only two authorities exceeded them by more than trivial
amounts.</p><p><a name="06062967000036">I
can now announce how my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government, intends to proceed, having carefully
considered the representations York and Medway have made, both orally
and in writing, and having taken into account all relevant information.
These decisions have been based not only on the individual cases of
these particular councils, but also on the need, as a matter of public
policy, for authorities to restrain the demands on their council-tax
payers.</p><p><a name="06062967000037">In
putting forward their challenges, neither authority has, in the
Secretary of State&#146;s view, presented strong arguments as to why
an excessive increase was necessary, or demonstrated that the pressures
identified acted disproportionately upon them to any significant extent
compared to other authorities. We intend therefore to take action in
both
cases.</p><p><a name="06062967000038">After
careful consideration, we have decided to cancel the designation of the
two authorities and to &#147;nominate&#148; them instead with a
proposed notional budget for each authority at the level of the maximum
budget originally proposed when they were designated. For York city
council, the proposed notional budget for 2006-07 is therefore
&#163;97,484,000 and for Medway Borough Council
&#163;148,101,000.</p><p><a name="06062967000039">By
nominating the authorities in this way, the councils will be able to
avoid re-billing for this year, but it reduces their capacity to
increase council tax in the subsequent year and beyond. The notional
budgets which we propose setting will be used in future capping
comparisons. The authorities will have their budget increases next year
measured against the notional budgets rather than their actual, higher
budgets. This will provide their council-tax payers with extra
protection next
year.</p><p><a name="06062967000040">We
are writing to both authorities today informing them of these
decisions. Each authority will have 21 days from receipt of the
notification of nomination in which to challenge its proposed notional
budget. The Secretary of State will, of course, consider any challenge
that they make fully and
carefully.</p><p><a name="06062967000041">The
Government are continuing to deliver on its promise to take action
against excessive council tax increases. By 2007-08, Government grant
for local services will have increased by more than the rate of
inflation for 10 years in succession. That represents an increase of 39
per cent., in real terms since
1997.</p><p><a name="06062967000042">The
Government have already made it clear that it expects an average
council tax increase in England of less than 5 per cent., in 2007-08.
Authorities should remain in no doubt that the Government will not
hesitate to use their capping powers to deal with excessive increases
in future years, including requiring them to rebill, if this proves
necessary.</p><br><notus-date day="29" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>29 Jun 2006 : Column 15WS</b><br><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06062967000004">Defence</h3><h4 align="center"><a name="06062967000016">Support

2,077 cargo vehicles as part of the support vehicle contract which we
announced last
year.</p><p><a name="06062967000044">The
award of this option, which brings the value of the programme to
&#163;1.3 billion, will see the delivery of further tranche of
modern, more effective and more efficient fleet of trucks and
trailers&#151;a vital support capability&#151;to our armed forces.
This is in addition to the 5,000 vehicles we announced we were buying
last year&#151;the largest vehicle buy made by the MOD in over half a
century.</p><p><a name="06062967000046">The
support vehicle programme includes a contractor logistic support
package which will lead to a long term partnering arrangement
consistent with the DIS published last December. Importantly the
vehicles are specially designed so they can be quickly fitted with
&#145;armour kits&#146;, which will help protect drivers and crew
from blast and small arms

of play on the WTO agricultural negotiations and held an exchange of

the subject during its upcoming

Council held a public debate on the Commission's animal welfare action
plan. I stressed the importance of a strategic framework for both the
industry and consumers and urged the Commission not to view legislation
as the only option to raising welfare standards but to consider other
ways as well, such as codes of practice and assurance
schemes.</p><p><a name="06062967000054">The
Council held a policy debate on the presidency&#146;s work plan on
the welfare of chickens reared for meat production, aiming to tackle
outstanding issues on the Commission&#146;s proposal. I called for a
firm commitment to the establishment of a maximum stocking density of
38 kg per square metre within a specified timetable to ensure a level
playing field across the EU for producers and achieve real welfare
improvements. The presidency said that further work would be undertaken
by the incoming Finnish

Judgment)</h4><p><a name="06062967000066"><b><a name="06062967000164">The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Ms Rosie
Winterton):</b> I should like to set out the Government's
proposals for ensuring that the law for England and Wales on the
treatment and care of people suffering from a disorder or disability of
mind, who lack capacity and who need to be deprived of liberty, is
compliant with the European convention on human rights. Our proposals
will strengthen the rights of patients and those in care, as well as
ensuring compliance with the European convention on human rights
(ECHR).</p><p><a name="06062967000068">People
who suffer from a disorder or disability of the mind&#151;such as
dementia or autism&#151;and who lack the mental capacity to consent
should be cared for in the least restrictive regime possible. In some
cases, members of this vulnerable group need to be deprived of their
liberty for treatment or care because this is necessary in their best
interests in order to protect them from
harm.</p><p><a name="06062967000070">The
proposals are in response to the 2004 European Court of Human Rights
judgment involving an autistic man who lacked the capacity to consent
and who was kept at Bournewood hospital by doctors against the wishes
of his carers. The court found that he had been deprived of his liberty
unlawfully, and the Department of Health committed to introducing new
legislation to close the &#145;Bournewood
gap&#146;.</p><p><a name="06062967000072">In
order to inform our response I published a consultation document in
March last year that invited comments on options for closing the

and organisations who responded. Those who commented on the document
were broadly in favour of the Government's
proposals.</p><p><a name="06062967000074">I

likely to be affected by the Bournewood proposals are mainly those with

arrangements.</p><p><a name="06062967000077">Key

believe that these proposals will ensure compliance with the European

ensure that those people who lack capacity are properly protected. The
provisions will be introduced into the Mental Capacity Act 2005 through

hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), on 29
April 2004. I wish to express my gratitude to the hon. Mr. Justice
Keith, his advisers, and the inquiry team for their comprehensive
examination of the important issues which arise in this
case.</p><p><a name="06062967000101">Zahid
Mubarek was killed, completely without provocation, on 21 March 2000 by
his cell-mate, Robert Stewart, who was a known racist. The then
Director General of the Prison Service wrote immediately to
Mr. Mubarek&#146;s family to acknowledge that the service had not
protected him as it should have done and to offer an unreserved
apology. I would like to take this opportunity to offer my own
sympathies to the family, for whom this will have been a particularly
traumatic
time.</p><p><a name="06062967000103">There
have since then been a number of inquiries into the circumstances
surrounding this appalling case from which the Prison Service has
already learned much. The inquiry by Mr. Justice Keith is however the
most thorough examination which has been carried out and adds much to
our knowledge of the background to this
murder.</p><p><a name="06062967000105">I
welcome the report&#146;s recognition that much progress has been
made by the Prison Service in the last six years to address the

In particular I am pleased to note that the report finds that the
allegations that prison officers maliciously placed ethnic minority
prisoners in cells with known racists are not
substantiated.</p><p><a name="06062967000107">I

This is no criticism of the RAF, the primary role of 32 (The Royal)

onboard an aircraft with Austrian livery. There have also been
instances where aircraft have been used which have been unable to reach
a destination without an unplanned refuelling stop or where the age of

the agreement of the Palace, the Department for Transport will now be
taking the project forward. This will lead to competitive proposals
being sought from industry in the months ahead. It is anticipated that
one of the aircraft included in the improved service will be a second
hand airliner with the capacity to seat up to 70 passengers and the
other a small second hand aircraft with the capacity to seat up to 15
passengers. Both aircraft will contain basic, fit-for-purpose interiors
to allow the Royal Family and Government to undertake work while
en-route and will contain secure communications, which will address the
concerns raised in the Intelligence and Security Committee's 2002-03
Annual Report which commented that expenditure in this area is
justified.</p><p><a name="06062967000139">It
is anticipated that the new service will commence between the end of
2007 and early 2008. The new arrangements will result in 32 (The Royal)
Squadron aircraft no longer being used for routine non-defence related
flights. The squadron will, however, continue to be used to transport
VIPs into operational theatres where necessary and for the routine
travel of senior defence personnel, including MOD
Ministers.</p><p><a name="06062967000140">Sir
Peter has advised that the new arrangements will deliver a safe,
reliable and secure air travel service to the Royal Family and
Government and good value for money to the taxpayer. The new
arrangements will not increase the planned levels of public expenditure
as the estimated additional annual cost of &#163;2.7 million will be
met from a &#163;1.5 million contribution from the Ministry of
Defence, recognising 32 (The Royal) Squadron's greater future
deployability, and the remaining &#163;1.2 million will be
absorbed by those using the new service.</p><br><notus-date day="29" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>29 Jun 2006 : Column 21WS</b><br><p><a name="06062967000141">Copies of Sir

Regulation</h4><p><a name="06062967000146"><b><a name="06062967000170">The
Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):</b> A consultation
document and Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) on changes needed to
secondary legislation to implement provisions of Council Regulation
(EC) No. 1236/2005<sup>(1 )</sup>concerning trade in goods which could be
used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment was published on 2 November
2005 and the consultation period ended on 31 January 2006. The EC
Regulation 1236/2005 (&#147;the Regulation&#148;) enters into force
on 30 July 2006. The adoption of the Regulation represents a positive
step forward for Europe and demonstrates the commitment of all EU
Member States to introduce controls on the trade in this category of
goods, following the lead set by the UK in 1997.</p><p><a name="06062967000147">The Regulation
prohibits the import, export and transhipment of specified goods to
non-EU states, and the provision of technical assistance. The export
(etc) of other specified goods will be controlled by means of the
export licensing system operated by DTI.</p><p><a name="06062967000148">My
Department has given careful consideration to the comments made in
response to the public consultation. A summary of the issues raised and
the Government's response has been deposited in the House of Commons 
<br><notus-date day="29" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>29 Jun 2006 : Column 22WS</b><br>Library and is also available on the DTI website at
http://www.dti.gov.uk/europeandtrade/strategic-export-control/index
.html.</p><p><a name="06062967000149">The
Regulation is directly applicable in the UK. However some changes to UK
law are required to ensure a good fit between the Regulation and the
existing legal framework and to provide for licensing, penalties and
enforcement. The changes are described in more detail in the note I
have deposited in the House. An amending Order under the Export Control
Act 2002 will be laid before Parliament, to come into force on
30 July 2006 at the same time as the
Regulation.</p><p><a name="06062967000150">The
controls introduced by the Regulation largely mirror those already in
place in UK legislation. Where there is any difference, the Government
have aimed when implementing the Regulation to maintain the current
level of controls where it is possible to do so consistent with
Community law. We have also extended UK trade controls (on trafficking
and brokering) to all the goods now controlled by the Regulation
including ones not previously controlled in the UK. The Regulation will
introduce controls for the first time on some items such as gallows and
thumbscrews. Where possible, controls on intra-EC transfers will be
maintained.</p><p><a name="06062967000151">Concerning
changes to the scope of goods controlled by the Regulation, the
Government will work with EU partners on possible future amendments
regarding matters not covered by the Regulation. The consultation was
concerned with implementation of the Regulation as adopted in Brussels
rather than with a review of controls in this area per se. The
Government have already said that they intend in 2007 to carry out a
wider review of the export controls introduced in 2004 and will in that
context welcome views on the scope of controls on equipment used for
torture or internal repression. That consultation can consider whether
and how to control effectively other items which are difficult to
define with precision in
legislation.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06062967000011">Transport</h3><h4 align="center"><a name="06062967000026">Eddington
