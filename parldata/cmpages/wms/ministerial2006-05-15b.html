and
Skills</h3>Informal
Meeting of Education Ministers  17 March
2006<p><a name="0605152000016"><b><a name="0605152000077">The
Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning (Bill
Rammell):</b> The Scottish Executive Deputy Minister for
Enterprise and Lifelong Learning, (Mr. Allan Wilson), and Steven
Effingham, Divisional Manager of the European Union Division of the
DWP/DfES Joint International Unit represented the UK during the
informal meeting of EU Education Ministers in
Vienna.</p><p><a name="0605152000017">Ministers
discussed the European Commission's recent consultation on the European
Qualifications Framework (EQF). They broadly welcomed the Commission's
outline of the EQF, with many seeing the wide consultation process as
the correct way to ensure that the proposal is developed in a bottom-up
way with the support of all relevant
stakeholders.</p><p><a name="0605152000018">Ministers
agreed that the EQF should provide a lightweight and flexible mechanism
for supporting comparability&#151;not automatic recognition&#151;of
qualifications in different member states. They supported the idea of
establishing a European framework of eight qualification levels to
which national authorities could relate their
qualifications.</p><p><a name="0605152000019">Ministers
also supported the idea that the EQF levels would be accompanied by
descriptors of skills and competences that learners should have
acquired. They were concerned, however, that these descriptors should
not be too detailed, with many calling for a simplification and
refinement of the Commission's draft descriptors.</p><br></br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 38WS</b><br></br><p><a name="0605152000020">The UK believed
that the EQF could make a real contribution to the Lisbon process,
particularly if developed in consultation with stakeholders, and if the
needs of citizens were kept at the forefront. UK noted the link to
sectoral qualifications, and the potential for sectoral skills
frameworks also to be aligned to the
EQF.</p><p><a name="0605152000021">Most
countries flagged up the need for the EQF to be complementary to the
qualifications framework being developed for the European higher
education area under the Bologna
process.</p><p><a name="0605152000022">There
was general agreement that the EQF should undergo an extended phase of
piloting and testing before being fully rolled out. The Commission
agreed to present a paper summarising the main areas of agreement
between member states as a basis for moving forwards. The Commission
would then set up a technical working group with representatives of all
member states in order to work up the specifications of the EQF (in
particular the levels descriptors). The Commission intends to come
forward with a formal proposal for the EQF in the autumn of
2006.</p><p><a name="0605152000023">On
the European Institute of Technology, Ministers all agreed with the
Commission's analysis concerning the so-called &#147;knowledge
triangle&#148; of education-research-innovation, and Europe's poor
performance in connecting these elements and exploiting the economic
value of research outcomes. Most delegations welcomed the Commission's
communication on the European Institute of Technology as a contribution
to this debate. Most had questions concerning, inter
alia.</p><a name="0605152000024"><ul><p class="tabletext">The legal status
of the BIT under the
Treaties;</p></ul><a name="0605152000025"><ul><p class="tabletext">degree
awarding powers given that this is a national
competence;</p></ul><a name="0605152000026"><ul><p class="tabletext">funding

and the Framework Programme for

of resources to the BIT (benefits it for the sending
institution?).</p></ul><p><a name="0605152000030">Some
countries signalled strong scepticism. The UK, while enthusiastic about
the Commission's efforts to take forward the Hampton Court agenda,
stressed the need for more work with stakeholders, especially the
universities and business sectors. Setting up a new institution may not
be the best way forward. UK stressed the need to build on existing
partnerships, and suggested setting up an expert group to look at this
issue, and to produce recommendations on issues such as funding,
greater institutional autonomy and closer collaboration with
business.</p><p><a name="0605152000031">The
Commission concluded the discussion by assuring Ministers that
stakeholders would be consulted before the Commission came forward with
a proposal. The Commission confirmed that the legal basis would cover
education, research and competitiveness. Postgraduate degrees would in
fact be awarded by the participating institutions (possibly jointly
between member states), rather than by the BIT itself. Secondment of
resources would not mean amputation&#151;there would have to be clear
added value for the &#147;home&#148; institution. It was too early
to have a debate about location or financing, but there should be no
conflict with the European Research

the EIT would be).</p><p><a name="0605152000032">The EU financial
contribution would be discussed at the next revision of the financial
perspectives in 2008; however, the EIT would have to rely heavily on
private
funding.</p><p><a name="0605152000033">The
Austrian presidency placed particular emphasis on discussions with the
Western Balkans and widening the European area of
education.</p><p><a name="0605152000034">Ministers
stressed the importance of the Lisbon agenda for the Western Balkans
noting that their participation in programmes such as the Lifelong
Learning Programme, Tempus and Erasmus Mundus, would support essential
educational reforms in those countries. The European Training
Foundation had an important role in facilitating cooperation between
the Western Balkans and the EU in the field of education and
training.</p><p><a name="0605152000035">The
UK supported EU enlargement and welcomed bilateral cooperation with
Western Balkan countries on education issues. Qualification frameworks
in the UK devolved nations, for example the Scottish Credit and
Qualifications Framework, were a particular issue of interest where we
might share good
practice.</p><p><a name="0605152000036">The
Western Balkan Ministers expressed a strong interest in participating
in the work on the European Qualifications Framework as a means of
supporting reforms and the development of lifelong learning strategies.
The Western Balkan Ministers also shared the EU's priorities for higher
education reform, and were actively implementing the Bologna process in
their countries. The Ministers stressed the need for continued dialogue
between the EU and the Western Balkans on European education policy
matters and adopted a declaration setting out the key messages of their
discussions</p>Informal
Meeting of Youth Ministers  29-31 March
2006<p><a name="0605152000037"><b><a name="0605152000078">The
Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning (Bill
Rammell):</b> Simon Foster, European Union Division, DWP/DfES
Joint International Unit and Suzanne Chisholm, Youth Policy Officer,
Welsh Assembly Government represented the UK during the informal
meeting of EU Youth Ministers in Bad
Ischl.</p><p><a name="0605152000038">The
ministerial meeting ran alongside a youth event which started in Vienna
on 27 March with the young people moving to Bad Ischl on 29 March to
join the ministerial delegations for joint seminars and social events.
The UK sent a delegation of young people representing the different
nations.</p><p><a name="0605152000039">It
was acknowledged that a start has been made on implementing the
objectives of the European Youth Pact, primarily under the employment
guidelines and the European strategy for social inclusion, ensuring
that the concerns of young people were incorporated into other policy
areas. However, the European Council emphasized in its spring meeting
2006that further progress is needed regarding the
implementation of the European Pact for Youth. The 
<br></br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 40WS</b><br></br>emphasis of this conference was on what concrete action could be taken
to make sure that vision became reality.</p><p><a name="0605152000040">In the morning
session, European Youth Ministers discussed issues of information,
participation in democratic life and active participation of youth at
local, national and European levels. There was an exchange of views on
strategies for an improved implementation of youth policy objectives
under the White Paper &#147;A New Impetus for European Youth&#148;,
under the European Youth Pact, and within the open method of
coordination.</p><p><a name="0605152000041">The
Youth Ministers agreed that young people's voices must be heard at all
levels with all stakeholders involved. There was considerable
discussion on how to reach those young people who are currently
disengaged from the political sphere or not part of a formal
organisation. The UK gave examples of good practice at local level
using local initiatives and at national level through the diverse
representation on the Children and Youth Board set up to advise the
Minister for Children, Young People and Families and officials in the
Department on policy
development.</p><p><a name="0605152000042">The
European Youth Pact emphasises that young people and youth
organisations must be involved in European and national policy design
in such key areas as employment, education, social inclusion and
reconciliation of work and life. Active participation requires proper
access to quality information at all levels. The European Youth Portal
and the national youth portals were seen as well-suited for the
provision of youth-related information by many
delegations.</p><p><a name="0605152000043">Joint
working groups, with reports jointly presented by one minister and one
young person, were formed in the afternoon to discuss the topics
of:</p><a name="0605152000044"><ul><p class="tabletext">Youth and
jobs;</p></ul><a name="0605152000045"><ul><p class="tabletext">value and
significance of informal and non-formal
learning;</p></ul><a name="0605152000046"><ul><p class="tabletext">the future of
youth in Europe to the final plenary
session.</p></ul><p><a name="0605152000047">The
participating youth representatives adopted a special Youth Declaration
that was welcomed by the
Ministers.</p><p><a name="0605152000048">To
continue the participatory dialogue at EU level, the presidency has
submitted a proposal for creating an informal forum composed of the
current EU presidency, the two subsequent presidencies, the European
Commission and the European Youth Forum. This informal dialogue-based
forum should meet regularly, in particular before the Education, Youth
and Culture Council in autumn and in spring in Brussels to promote an
exchange of views and ideas between young people and the
presidency.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0605152000004">Home

House will understand that I can only provide the information available
to me at this time. Very detailed consideration of the casefiles and
other records by all agencies continues and further amendments may need
to be made to the figures. Thus, it remains subject to
change.</p><p><a name="0605152000053">I
am placing in the Library of the House a detailed note on the data that
are now available in relation to the 1,023 prisoners released from
prison without the consideration of deportation they should have
received.</p><p><a name="0605152000055">Progress
continues to be made in the operation to deal with the released foreign
prisoners. The operation is prioritising the serious cases
first.</p><p><a name="0605152000057">I
have widened the definition of serious offences to include all cases
where there has been any conviction for offences involving violence or
a sexual element. This includes armed robbery. As the operation has
progressed, detailed examination of the casefiles and other records has
to date identified 179 offenders who had previously been convicted of a
serious
offence.</p><p><a name="0605152000059">Of
these 179 offenders, 35 have been convicted of the most serious
offences, defined as murder, manslaughter, rape and child sex offences.
Of the four who had committed murder, three are now within our control.
Of the other 31 most serious cases which include rapists and child sex
offenders, 23 are now within our control or deported. Some eight of
these 35 had re-offended since release and had committed crimes that
did not involve violence or a sexual
element.</p><p><a name="0605152000061">Some
55 of the 144 other serious offenders are now under our control or
deported. Of these 144, nine are where a person has re-offended
following release and committed a crime involving violence or a sexual
element. A further 40 of the other serious offenders have also
re-offended since release, ten of the offences involving violence or a
sexual
element.</p><p><a name="0605152000063">All
of the 1,023 have now been assessed and consideration of the case for
deportation has started in 880 of the 1,023 cases, of which there was
an initial decision to deport in 649 of these. Some 203 are now under
either our control or have been deported or
removed.</p><p><a name="0605152000065">A
number of hon. Members have asked for a detailed breakdown of cases by
the prison from which they were released or by constituency. We intend
to be able to provide this information in due course but we are
currently prioritising the operational work on the consideration of the
cases and, where deportations orders have been made, detentions. I hope
hon. Members will understand.</p><br></br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 42WS</b><br></br><h3 align="center"><a name="0605152000005">Work and

Investigation Board, set up by the Health and Safety Commission to
supervise the investigation into the explosion and fire at Buncefield
oil storage depot, published a progress report on 9 May. The
investigation will include consideration of off-site and on-site risks,
both of which will be taken into account by the board when making
recommendations for future
action.</p><p><a name="0605152000068">Work
has been underway, since before the Buncefield incident, to consider
the implications of new information about major hazard sites which HSE
has gathered in compliance with the Control of Major Accident Hazard
Regulations (COMAH). The analysis of this information does not suggest
that there is an increased likelihood of an accident occurring at any
of these sites. It has, however, allowed HSE to understand the risks
with more
precision.</p><p><a name="0605152000070">The
Cabinet Office had been co-ordinating the process. Information and
analysis from the Buncefield investigation will be taken account of in
this work, which will be the subject of consultation with stakeholders
as soon as clear conclusions emerge, which is expected to be later this
