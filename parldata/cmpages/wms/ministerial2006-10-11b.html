(Mexico)</h4><p><a name="st_133"><a name="06101150000009"><b><a name="61011m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="06101150000025">The
Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (David
Miliband):</b> The Second Ministerial meeting of the
Gleneagles Dialogue took place last week in Monterrey, Mexico and was
jointly chaired by myself and the Minister for Energy, along with our
Mexican counterparts. The Foreign Secretary joined us for the first
session of the meeting and gave the opening speech (available at
www.fco.gov.uk).</p><p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="61011m0001.htm_para0"><a name="06101150000010">Overall,
the meeting achieved genuine progress but dramatised the need for
urgent global action. The chairs' conclusions reflect the stark facts
compellingly presented by Sir Nick Stern (a preview of his soon-to-be
published report on the economics of climate change), as well as the
presentations from the IEA and the World Bank. There were also
compelling presentations from civil society and business and input from
legislators via GLOBE. Together, they set out the investment needed
from public and private sources if we are to de-carbonise the world
energy economy, the economic justification for doing so, and the
frightening cost to us all if we do
not.</p><p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="61011m0001.htm_para1"><a name="06101150000011">The
unity of understanding, concern and purpose among the 17 key
energy-using countries that attended was unprecedented. In particular,
I was delighted to announce a joint UK-South Africa approach to finding
alternative international climate change frameworks to put before the
negotiators, and a joint UK-Mexico-Spain-Development Bank study testing
the applicability of the World Bank Energy Investment Framework to
large scale renewables projects in Mexico. In addition, the European
Commission, Germany and Japan all emphasised the importance of energy
efficiency. There was also widespread agreement on the vital importance
of carbon capture and sequestration which was seen as a key technology
for tackling emissions globally to
2050.</p><p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="61011m0001.htm_para2"><a name="06101150000012">We
have forged a deep and lasting partnership with both Mexico and South
Africa that will pay dividends in the negotiations to
come&#151;particularly at the 12th Conference of Parties in Nairobi
next month which forms the next step in discussions on international
climate change agreements under the UNFCCC.</p><br>

signified the engagement of the International Financial Institutions in
the climate change challenge. This marks a real movement from talk to
action: even if the costs for achieving decarbonisation appear very
large, the co-operation of the major developing countries is clearly
dependent on our contributing more help with their costs of adapting to
climate change than the developed world has managed so
far.</p><p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="61011m0001.htm_para4"><a name="06101150000014">Germany
announced that climate and energy would feature prominently in their G8
Presidency, with energy efficiency the primary focus. They also
announced that they would host the next Gleneagles Ministerial meeting
in late summer 2007, inviting energy, environment and economic
Ministers. The UK will continue working for strong outcomes in order to
ensure that the Dialogue continues to galvanise countries into taking
action that is ever more urgently
needed.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06101150000003"><a name="subhd_2"><a name="61011m0001.htm_dpthd1">Northern
