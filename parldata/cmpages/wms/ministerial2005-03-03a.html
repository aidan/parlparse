<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50303m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Paymaster General  (Dawn Primarolo): </b> 
 In parliamentary answers on 4 and 26 March 2003 and in letters to several hon. Members, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury explained changes that have been made to the rules governing the VAT treatment of state-regulated welfare agencies such as domiciliary care and independent fostering agencies. He explained that the changes would take effect from the date that the regulatory system and standards for welfare providers were implemented or, in the case of independent fostering agencies, on 1 April 2003. Following representations from a small number of businesses, Customs have issued a business brief clarifying the circumstances determining the time at which an agency becomes exempt. Copies are available in the House of Commons Library.

 On 14 February 2005, my noble Friend the Minister for Defence Procurement (Lord Bach) signed a statement of intent with the Secretary-General of the Iraqi Ministry of Defence which lays the foundation for co-operation on defence equipment matters in areas such as requirement definition, exchange of information, supplier identification, and the availability of commercial training.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50303m01.html_para0"><a name="stpa_0">It is HMG&#039;s aim to assist the Iraqi Government and armed forces to rebuild their country and to improve security and stability. In support of this, a non-legally binding statement of intent will be mutually beneficial for both Governments.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50303m01.html_spmin2"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Keith Hill): </b> 
 I am announcing today the publication of a consultation paper, entitled &quot;Planning Control of Mezzanine and other Internal Floorspace Additions&quot;, on draft provisions to be included in an amendment to the General Development Procedure Order 1995, and on the accompanying partial regulatory impact assessment.

<p>
<a name="50303m01.html_para3">Section 49 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 inserts new sections 55(2A) and 55(2B) into the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. These new sections bring into the meaning of development operations which have the effect of increasing the internal gross floorspace of a building. This would make such increases in floor space subject to planning control.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50303m01.html_para4"><a name="stpa_3">The Secretary of State by order can specify different circumstances under which this legislation would apply, and the draft order sets a threshold of 200m <sup>2</sup>  and applies it to retail floorspace.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50303m01.html_para5"><a name="stpa_4">It is not the Government&#039;s intention to halt mezzanine development. It is to bring under planning control any increases in internal floorspace above a specified level, so as to ensure the Government&#039;s objectives for town centres are not undermined by inappropriate development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50303m01.html_para6"><a name="stpa_5">The consultation will run until 26 May 2005. Copies of the consultation document will be made available in the Libraries of both Houses and from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s website www.odpm.gov.uk.

 The latest report on the implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong (Cm 6484) was laid before the House today and copies have been placed in the Library of the House. A copy of the report is also available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website: www.fco.gov.uk/.

 The BBC documentary &quot;Detention Undercover: the Real Story&quot; screened last night contained allegations of racism and mistreatment of detainees at Oakington immigration reception centre and during removal.
