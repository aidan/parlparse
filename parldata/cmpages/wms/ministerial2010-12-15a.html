 I would like to inform the House that today I will set out a series of new principles that the Government will use when introducing European measures into UK law. Copies of the guiding principles will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. These will end so-called gold-plating so that British businesses are not put at a disadvantage relative to their European competitors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_380"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para1"><a name="10121523000028">The key to the new measures will be the principle of copying out the text of European directives directly into UK law.

<p><a name="stpa_381"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para2"><a name="10121523000029">The new measures are part of a wider Government policy to tackle EU regulations, including: by working with business organisations to prioritise proposals in the European Commission's legislative work plan for 2011 and beyond, working closely with other European countries to push for more outcome-focused EU regulation, and improving how evidence is used by the European Parliament and Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para3"><a name="10121523000030">The main elements of the new Government principles are:</p>
<a name="10121523000131"><ul><p class="tabletext">Work on the implementation of an EU directive should start immediately after agreement is reached in Brussels. By starting implementation work early, businesses will have more chance to influence the approach, ensuring greater certainty and early warning about its impact.</p>
</ul><a name="10121523000132"><ul><p class="tabletext">Early transposition of EU regulations will be avoided except where there are compelling reasons for earlier implementation. This will ensure that British businesses are not put at a disadvantage to their European competitors.</p>
</ul><a name="10121523000133"><ul><p class="tabletext">European directives will normally be directly copied into UK legislation, except where it would adversely affect UK interests, for example, by putting UK businesses at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
</ul><a name="10121523000134"><ul><p class="tabletext">A statutory duty will be placed on Ministers to conduct a review of domestic legislation implementing a European directive every five years. This will allow businesses to influence any necessary improvements based on their own practical experience of applying the rules.</p>

 I am pleased to announce that I am today laying before Parliament the coalition Government's three-year-on response to the all party parliamentary inquiry into anti-Semitism (Command Paper Cm 7991).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para4"><a name="10121523000032">In May 2008 the previous Government published a progress report on the 35 recommendations in the all party parliamentary inquiry into anti-Semitism.

<p><a name="stpa_384"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para5"><a name="10121523000033">We believe the best way to tackle anti-Semitism is through effective implementation of strong legislation against racial and religious discrimination and racially and religiously motivated crime. This must be underpinned by policies and strategies which support an integrated society where people are able to take part in society to the full; get on well together and are treated fairly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para6"><a name="10121523000034">We have made significant progress against the 35 recommendations made by the all party parliamentary inquiry's constructive and comprehensive report through the cross-Government working group to tackle anti-Semitism which brings together civil servants from across Whitehall and members of the three major Jewish community organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_386"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para7"><a name="10121523000035">We have ensured that there is now agreement for all police forces to record anti-Semitic hate crimes and the first disaggregated statistics were published in November. Another key success has been the agreement by the Department for Education to fund counter-terrorism security needs of Jewish faith schools within the state sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_387"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para8"><a name="10121523000036">Despite the progress outlined in the report, there is no room for complacency and we will continue to take practical, effective action to stamp out anti-Semitism whenever and wherever it occurs. We are committed to increasing the number of hate crimes brought to justice, tackling anti-Semitism on university campuses, and challenging hate crime and extremism on the internet. We have agreed to continue our support of the cross-Government working group to tackle anti-Semitism and will report back to Parliament on any further progress.</p>

The Government are grateful to the Local Government Association for undertaking the role of "selector", and shortlisting 199 proposals in December 2009.

There was strong support from member states for increased effort in pooling and sharing, and I emphasised that this needed to be driven by voluntary national commitments to pragmatic solutions, using the example of the recent UK/France agreement. I also expressed a preference to revert to the traditional format of Defence Ministers and Foreign Ministers meeting together in the FAC to discuss common foreign security policy and common security and defence policy as a linked set of issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para25"><a name="10121523000055">I made clear that, in the current economic climate, with most member states including the UK reducing their defence budgets, I could not agree to an increase in the budget of the European Defence Agency (EDA) for 2011.

the armed forces in order to deliver the force structure we require for the future and to help address the legacy of unaffordability in the defence budget. I am now able to explain more fully those changes that affect the Royal Navy's surface fleet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para33"><a name="10121523000064">We announced that the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal would be decommissioned and accordingly, she will finally be withdrawn from service at the end of this month. We also announced that we would decommission either her sister ship HMS Illustrious or the landing platform helicopter HMS Ocean following a short study into which of these two ships was better able to provide the capability we require over the next few years. This work has now been completed and we have decided that HMS Ocean should be retained to provide our landing platform helicopter capability for the longer-term. HMS Illustrious will be withdrawn from service in 2014, once HMS Ocean has emerged from a planned refit and been returned to a fully operational state. This will ensure that we retain the ability to deliver an amphibious intervention force from the sea and maintain an experienced crew to support the later introduction into service of the new Queen Elizabeth class carrier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_413"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para34"><a name="10121523000065">The White Paper also explained that four frigates would be withdrawn from service in 2011. These are the remaining Type 22 frigates HMS Chatham, Campbeltown, Cumberland and Cornwall. Chatham will be withdrawn from service at the end of January 2011 and Campbeltown and Cumberland will follow on 1 April. HMS Cornwall will be withdrawn at the end of April once she has returned from her current operational deployment to the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_414"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para35"><a name="10121523000066">Other changes affect the Navy's amphibious ships. The Bay class amphibious support ship to be decommissioned will be RFA Largs Bay. She will  be withdrawn from service in April 2011. One of our two landing platforms dock will in future be placed at extended readiness while the other is held at high readiness for operations. From November 2011 the high readiness ship will be HMS Bulwark, and on current plans this will change to HMS Albion in late 2016 when Bulwark enters a refit period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_415"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para36"><a name="10121523000067">The final changes affect the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. The White Paper said that there would be a fleet of resupply and refuelling vessels scaled to meet the Royal Navy's requirements. With a smaller surface fleet these requirements are correspondingly lower, and hence we have decided to withdraw from service from April 2011 the auxiliary oiler RFA Bayleaf and the auxiliary oiler replenishment RFA Fort George.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_430"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para51"><a name="10121523000085">"Liberating the NHS: Legislative framework and next steps" shows how the Department has developed its plans in the light of consultation and sets out further detail on the reforms and a timetable for implementation. The document also sets out a timetable for implementation and explains how the consultation has shaped the health and social care Bill, planned for introduction in January. Overall, the document reaffirms the Government's commitment to reforming the NHS so that it:</p>
<a name="10121523000143"><ul><p class="tabletext">puts patients right at the heart of decisions made about their care;</p>
</ul><a name="10121523000144"><ul><p class="tabletext">puts clinicians in the driving seat on decisions about services; and</p>
</ul><a name="10121523000145"><ul><p class="tabletext">is focused on delivering health outcomes that are comparable with, or even better than, those of our international neighbours.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_431"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para52"><a name="10121523000086">The Department received over 6,000 consultation responses from patients and members of the public, clinicians, voluntary organisations, patient representative groups, local authorities, local involvement networks (LINks), NHS organisations and staff, independent providers, pharmacists, academics, professional bodies and royal colleges, think-tanks and trade unions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_432"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para53"><a name="10121523000087">Responses contained a broad mix of support, suggestions for improvement and critical challenge. The insights and suggestions we have heard in consultation have not only strengthened our belief that the reforms are necessary but have also helped us refine our proposals in several areas. In particular, the Government have decided to:</p>
<a name="10121523000146"><ul><p class="tabletext">significantly strengthen the role of health and well-being boards in local authorities, and enhance joint working arrangements through a new responsibility to develop a "joint health and well-being strategy" spanning the NHS, social care, public health and potentially other local services. Local authority and NHS commissioners will be required to have regard to this;</p>
</ul><a name="10121523000147"><ul><p class="tabletext">create a more distinct identity for Health Watch England, led by a statutory committee within the Care Quality Commission;</p>
</ul><a name="10121523000148"><ul><p class="tabletext">increase transparency in commissioning by requiring all GP consortia to have a published constitution;</p>
</ul><a name="10121523000149"><ul><p class="tabletext">change our proposal that maternity services should be commissioned by the NHS Commissioning Board;</p>
</ul><a name="10121523000150"><ul><p class="tabletext">extend councils' formal scrutiny powers to cover all NHS-funded services, and give local authorities greater freedom in how these are exercised;</p>
</ul><a name="10121523000151"><ul><p class="tabletext">phase the timetable for giving local authorities responsibility for commissioning NHS complaints advocacy services, and allow flexibility to commission from other organisations as well as from local Health Watch;</p>
</ul><a name="10121523000152"><ul><p class="tabletext">give GP consortia a stronger role in supporting the NHS Commissioning Board to drive up quality in primary care; and create an explicit duty for all arm's length bodies to co-operate in carrying out their functions, backed by a new mechanism for resolving disputes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_433"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para54"><a name="10121523000088">Equally important, the feedback we received through consultation has also helped us refine our approach to implementation, in order to create flexibility, empower local leadership, and support the significant cultural change and staff engagement that respondents highlighted would be needed to make our reforms a success. The Department has therefore decided to:</p>
<a name="10121523000153"><ul><p class="tabletext">allow a longer and more phased transition period for completing our reforms to providers;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_434"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para55"><a name="10121523000089">To take forward these changes the Department has put in place a single, integrated programme for the whole of the transition across the health and care system. This will help sustain performance under the existing regime at the same time as building the leadership to implement the changes. Transition will occur through a carefully designed and managed process, phased over the next four years, to allow for rapid adoption, system-wide learning, and effective risk-management. It will be aided by the creation of a number of specific time-limited transitional vehicles, with a focus on sustaining capability and capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_435"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para56"><a name="10121523000090">Alongside "Liberating the NHS: Legislative framework and next steps", the NHS chief executive, David Nicholson, has today published the NHS operating framework for 2011-12, which sets out the priorities for the next year. This includes how the NHS will go through a strong and stable transition over the next year to begin to deliver the vision of the White Paper. By the end of 2011-12 we expect NHS organisations to have made significant progress in moving towards a more liberated NHS. Organisations should be working across traditional boundaries to improve the quality of patient care while maintaining the quality and safety of NHS services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_436"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para57"><a name="10121523000091">I have also written today to every hon. Member in England detailing their PCT's allocations for 2011-12, which PCTs will use to deliver our vision for reform and our national priorities as set out in the operating framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_437"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para58"><a name="10121523000092">Total revenue investment in the NHS in 2011-12 will grow to over £102 billion. The allocations I am announcing today will provide PCTs with £89 billion to spend on the local front-line services that matter most, an increase of £2.6 billion, or 3%. This funding includes an increase of £1.9 billion in PCT recurrent allocations (including £150 million for re-ablement), £69 million in primary dental services, pharmaceutical services and general ophthalmic services non-recurrent allocations, and £648 million to support joint working between health and social care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_438"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para59"><a name="10121523000093">The recurrent allocations are based upon a revised weighted capitation formula that includes improvements, such as a new mental health formula. This lays the groundwork for the switch to allocations to GP consortia and local authorities from the NHS Commissioning Board and Public Health England respectively for 2013-14. These organisational changes will free the NHS from political interference, support the transfer of decision making and responsibility for local health services to the front line, and ensure that public health programmes are safeguarded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_439"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para60"><a name="10121523000094">PCTs and local authorities will use the funding for re-ablement and joint working to agree a work plan based on local joint strategic needs assessments to deliver services which may include current services, in particular telecare, re-ablement packages and home adaptations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_440"><a name="101215m0001.htm_para61"><a name="10121523000095">The allocations announced today place PCTs in a strong position to deliver the coalition Government's vision for reform, as originally set out in "Liberating the NHS" and today reaffirmed in "Liberating the  <br>

Up to 350,000 families remain displaced by protracted flooding on the right bank of the Indus in northern Sindh.

</ul><a name="10121523000160"><ul><p class="tabletext">Helping 200,000 children to resume education, through programmes costing £10 million involving Save the Children, Plan International and Hands.

</ul><a name="10121523000161"><ul><p class="tabletext">Supporting agricultural livelihoods and the wider rural economy that will benefit approximately 1 million people.
