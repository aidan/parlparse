<p><a name="st_0"><a name="1103211000024"><a name="110321m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="1103211000106"><b>The Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office (Mr Nick Hurd):</b>
 On 14 February, the Minister for the Cabinet Office and I published a strategy to grow the social investment market, giving charities and social enterprises access to new capital to help them to increase their impact. The strategy explained the central role of the big society bank as a cornerstone of the market, acting as both a champion and wholesale provider of capital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="110321m0001.htm_para0"><a name="1103211000025">In February we also announced that we would work with leading social investment experts to develop a proposal for the establishment of the big society bank as an independent private sector organisation. Since then, we have been engaging with the social investment sector, and we are pleased with the ideas coming forward. Today I would like to update the House on the next steps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="110321m0001.htm_para1"><a name="1103211000026">As we announced in February, Sir Ronald Cohen, former chair of the social investment taskforce, and Nick O'Donohoe, former global head of research at JP Morgan, are taking the lead on developing a proposal for a big society bank. They are engaging with the sector, and we expect that they will present their proposal to Government within the next few weeks. At that point, we expect to make an in-principle decision about whether the organisation they are proposing to establish could be the recipient of unclaimed assets from dormant accounts, subject to further development work and state aid approval. If the decision is made to go ahead, detailed set up work for the big society bank would then be able to commence, including recruitment of its chair and board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="110321m0001.htm_para2"><a name="1103211000027">By making this statement today we want to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to feed in comments on the development of the proposal, or on our approach more generally. Separately, we are currently working to secure the state aid approvals from the European Commission that would be needed in order to capitalise an independent big society bank with money from dormant accounts and to provide it with the flexibility it needs to grow the market. We are also working with the big lottery fund on interim arrangements that will enable investments to be made as soon as dormant accounts money becomes available in the summer, using existing state aid exemptions. We will make further announcements in due course.</p>

on those who are a danger to themselves and other road users, while avoiding unnecessary social and economic impacts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="110321m0001.htm_para37"><a name="1103211000070">We are convinced that our first priority must be to give the police the means to identify drug-drivers and compel them to give evidential samples for testing. It is just as dangerous for people to drive impaired by alcohol or drugs, and it is quite wrong that it is easier at present to get away with one than the other. There needs to be a clear message that drug-drivers are as likely to be caught and punished as drink-drivers and that drug-driving is as socially unacceptable as drink-driving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="110321m0001.htm_para38"><a name="1103211000071">We have taken the first steps to address this with a specification for drug testing equipment for the police. We aim to have this available for use later this year. We will-as Sir Peter suggested-examine the case for a new specific offence which would remove the need for the police to prove impairment on a case-by-case basis where a specified drug has been detected. The introduction of fixed thresholds for blood-alcohol as the test for drink-driving has delivered benefits to road safety that are clear for all to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="110321m0001.htm_para39"><a name="1103211000072">Our strategy is to focus resources and any legislative changes on measures which will have the most impact in reducing dangerous behaviours. There are therefore two main priorities-</p>
<a name="1103211000094"><ul><p class="tabletext">to continue the successful abatement of drink-driving and achieve similar success against drug-driving by giving the police effective tools to identify and proceed against drink and drug-drivers;</p>
</ul><a name="1103211000095"><ul><p class="tabletext">to streamline the enforcement process for drink and drug-driving to remove pressure on police and other enforcement resources.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="110321m0001.htm_para40"><a name="1103211000073">A staggering proportion of drink-drivers are well over the current limit-40% of those caught by the police are 2.5 times the limit. The proportion of drivers over the limit who are killed is the same. Their behaviour is entrenched and displays a flagrant disregard for the law and the safety of other road users. We have concluded that improving enforcement is likely to have most impact on these dangerous people, and will therefore be the most effective use of scarce resources, rather than lowering the prescribed alcohol limit for driving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="110321m0001.htm_para41"><a name="1103211000074">We will implement the following measures, bringing forward legislation where necessary at the earliest opportunity-</p>

 Today, I am announcing £836,000 of additional funding in this financial year to implement a number of small sustainable projects in the cycle towns and, separately, for three train operating companies to enhance their bike and rail schemes. This exceptional decision has been made possible due to prudent management of departmental expenditure, including additional efficiencies made this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="110321m0001.htm_para43"><a name="1103211000077">The chosen cycle town projects-Blackpool, Bristol, Cambridge, Colchester, Darlington, Derby, Exeter, Leighton Linslade, South Gloucestershire, Southend, Shrewsbury and Woking-have been assessed as capable of being delivered within the current financial year while offering value-for-money. I believe this additional funding will assist in meeting the overall aims of the project to get more people cycling safely. All the recommended projects fit well with the strategic objectives of the towns concerned and will increase the effectiveness of their existing programmes in generating additional cyclists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="110321m0001.htm_para44"><a name="1103211000078">The three train operating companies, Merseyrail, South West Trains and Northern Rail, have worked hard, in partnership with local authorities and other organisations, including Sustrans and Network Rail, to deliver high-quality infrastructure improvements accompanied by promotional activities. This is with the aim of encouraging more cycling to railway stations and to deliver improved integration of bike and rail journeys. This money will enable further enhancements to these schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="110321m0001.htm_para45"><a name="1103211000079">Today's announcement complements, and is in addition to, our recently launched local sustainable transport fund which allows local authorities to bid for a share of £560 million over four years, aimed at encouraging sustainable transport solutions, including cycling initiatives, that will create economic growth and cut carbon.</p>

 The Government are committed to a health and safety regime that is fair, balanced and proportionate.

good performing work places, frequently poor health and safety advice to businesses from badly qualified consultants, and a complex structure for regulation. To address these issues, the Government are today publishing their plans for the reform of the health and safety system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="110321m0001.htm_para47"><a name="1103211000082">We will clamp down on the rogue health and safety advisers who cost industry so much money by providing advice which often bears little relation to the actual requirements of legislation. To achieve this we have launched an official occupational safety and health consultants register for those health and safety practitioners who are properly accredited to one of the professional bodies in the industry. Those who do not have the requisite expertise and experience will be excluded from the register, making it easier for employers to access reliable, reputable advice. I am pleased to announce that the register will be open for the use of employers from today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="110321m0001.htm_para48"><a name="1103211000083">We will shift the focus of health and safety activity away from businesses that do the right thing, and instead concentrate efforts on higher risk areas and on dealing with serious breaches of health and safety regulation. Those organisations which pose a lesser risk and which meet their legal responsibilities will be left free of unwarranted scrutiny. This will mean a very substantial drop in the number of health and safety inspections  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="110321m0001.htm_para49"><a name="1103211000084">We will seek to clarify and simplify health and safety legislation, and in doing so ease the burden on business. We are today launching new "Health and Safety Made Simple" guidance to provide lower-risk small and medium-sized businesses with the essential information they need to achieve a basic level of health and safety management in their work place in a single, easy-to-use, package. We are also launching an immediate review of health and safety regulation overseen by an independent advisory panel chaired by Professor Ragnar Löfstedt, director of the King's centre for risk management at King's college London. The review will be asked to make recommendations by autumn 2011 for simplifying the current rules. We will also ask the review to consider whether changes to legislation are needed to clarify the position of employers in cases where employees act in a grossly irresponsible manner.</p>
