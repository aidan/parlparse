statement, I subsequently agreed a number of measures to ensure that
the inquiries would, while having the resources to establish the full
facts in each case, operate in a cost-effective manner. These measures
included maximum hourly rates payable for publicly funded legal
representation by counsel and solicitors; and a 40- hour cap on hours
that might be claimed in any given week. The chairmen of all three
inquiries have taken the need to ensure that the inquiries operate in a
cost-effective manner seriously, and I am grateful to them for
that.</p><p><a name="06102566000020">The
inquiry considering the death of Billy Wright is now underway under the
chairmanship of the right hon. Lord MacLean. Following representations
from him I granted his requests to be converted into an inquiry under
the Inquiries Act 2005 under section 15 of that
Act.</p><p><a name="06102566000021">Section
40(4) of the Inquiries Act contains a power for a Secretary of State to
place conditions or qualifications on any awards that the chairman of
the inquiry may make under section 40(1) and 40(2) in respect of
compensation, expenses or legal representation. After discussions with
the inquiry, I have decided today to issue the following notice of
determination under section 40(4) in respect of awards for legal
representation. This notice will not alter the substance of those
sections of the inquiry&#146;s costs protocols concerned with the
award of funding for legal assistance; but it will reinforce the limits
on hourly rates that may be claimed by legal
representatives.</p><p><a name="06102566000022">The
measures the notice contains have been discussed with the chairman of
the inquiry and I know will have the support of hon. and right hon.

public.</p><p><a name="06102566000023">The
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has determined under section
40(4) of the Inquiries Act 2005 that the power of the chairman of the
Billy Wright Inquiry to award amounts in respect of legal
representation under section 40(1) and (2) of that Act shall be subject
to the qualifications and conditions set out below, which supplement
and are in addition to the terms and conditions in the protocol for
representation and the costs of legal representation when funded at
public expense published by the inquiry on 12 January 2006 (&#147;The
Costs
Protocol&#148;).</p><p><a name="06102566000024">The

For the purposes of paragraph 9c of the costs protocol, the
maximum number of hours that can be charged in respect of each member
of a legal team of an represented party shall be 40 hours per week save
that the solicitor to the inquiry can authorise the exceeding of the 40
hour per week cap up to 60 hours for counsel during the oral hearings
and for a short period before they commence where he is satisfied that
such action is justified, for example, where the work involved in any
week clearly needs to exceed 40 hours.</p><br>
