 The Informal Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) took place in Porto on 14 and 15 September 2007.

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para0"><a name="0710083000024">The main discussion focused on the impact of an efficient public administration on overall competitiveness.

I set out that as a global issue, this demanded a global response and made proposals to EU finance ministers that we must remain fully engaged, acting with the wider international community, in strengthening arrangements for ensuring financial stability. I will also be making proposals at the meetings of the G7 and International Monetary Fund in October. Ministers continued the long-running discussion of how to take forward EU arrangements for financial stability, and considered ongoing initiatives to improve cross-border post-trading arrangements in Europe. The Informal Council also discussed the reform of quotas and voice in the IMF.</p>

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="0710083000048"><a name="71008m0001.htm_spmin2"><a name="0710083000169"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Alistair Darling):</b>
 The House will want to discuss the events in the international financial markets this summer. To assist this debate, I am making this written statement to set out a summary of what has happened and the action taken in response. I will make an oral statement later this week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para22"><a name="0710083000049"><i>International Financial Markets&#151;Recent Developments</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para23"><a name="0710083000050">Over recent years, the world economy and global financial markets saw an unprecedented period of stability and prosperity. This has been accompanied by: lower average long-term interest rates in advanced economies than at any time over the previous three decades; low default rates on borrowing; investors seeking higher returns; and lower premiums for riskier lending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para24"><a name="0710083000051">Since late July, global financial markets have suffered disruption and turbulence, triggered initially by problems in the US sub-prime mortgage market. Uncertainty over institutional exposure to potential losses on sub-prime mortgages caused reductions in liquidity across a range of financial markets. This uncertainty has been exacerbated by the fact that assets and liabilities have increasingly been managed off-balance sheet in complex structured investment vehicles and conduits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para25"><a name="0710083000052">In these circumstances, a range of asset-backed securities could no longer be sold or traded. These problems spread to money markets and funding costs increased for banks, with inter-bank lending spreads rising by up to 100 basis points in major financial centres and terms of lending shortened significantly. Bond, equity, commodity and foreign exchange markets around the world were affected as investors lost confidence and a re-pricing of risk began that is still continuing. In this way, even institutions with no direct exposure to sub-prime mortgages have been affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para26"><a name="0710083000053">These developments have affected economies and institutions across the world. Many banks and funds have suffered losses due to direct exposure to sub-prime mortgages and associated securities. For example, in the US a number of sub-prime mortgage lenders have had severe difficulties and funds holding large quantities of mortgage debt instruments were also affected. In Germany, two banks had to be helped after suffering from similar exposures. Banks elsewhere in Europe suspended the activities of funds after exposure to sub-prime products left them unable to value them appropriately. Funds in other countries, including Australia and Canada, have also been affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para27"><a name="0710083000054"><i>Impact on the Financial Sector</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para28"><a name="0710083000055">The UK entered the recent period of turbulence in the global financial markets in a strong position. The UK economy has seen 60 quarters of growth&#151;the  <br>

longest and most stable period of growth since records began&#151;and is expected to continue to grow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para29"><a name="0710083000056">Moreover, the banking sector in the UK has benefited from a period of strong growth which helped it build up healthy balance sheets and capital positions. Most major UK banks reported good profit results for the 2006 financial year and continued to report increases in pre-tax profits in their interim results for the first half of 2007. Throughout this period of growth and stability, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) continued to set capital requirements for all banks above the minima required by EU law and international standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para30"><a name="0710083000057">Direct exposures in the UK to losses from sub-prime mortgages have been less significant than in some other countries. However, because of the broader impact of the turbulence on global markets, some financial institutions have found themselves under funding pressure due to the seizing up of asset-backed commercial paper markets and the drying up of liquidity in the inter-bank markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para31"><a name="0710083000058"><i>Northern Rock Plc</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para32"><a name="0710083000059">Northern Rock Plc faced specific difficulties in these circumstances. Its recent problems were not caused by direct exposure to sub-prime mortgages in the US or the UK: indeed, it has a good quality loan book. Rather, its problems have been associated with wider conditions in the wholesale funding markets. The market for new securitisations had largely closed as investors&#146; demand for such assets fell across the world. Furthermore, the market conditions in August and September resulted in liquidity in the wholesale money markets drying up, with a shortening of duration of funding and an increase in its cost. The combination of these factors contributed to serious liquidity problems for Northern Rock Plc.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para33"><a name="0710083000060">Following advice from the Governor of the Bank of England and the chairman of the FSA that the position of Northern Rock Plc, given market conditions at that time, constituted a genuine threat to the stability of the financial system, I concluded that it was appropriate and necessary for the Bank of England to provide liquidity support to Northern Rock Plc. Northern Rock Plc issued a profit warning on 14 September. At the same time, the authorities issued a statement about the provision of a special liquidity facility to Northern Rock Plc.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para34"><a name="0710083000061">On 17 September, to put the matter of security of deposits beyond doubt, I announced that, should it be necessary, the Government, with the Bank of England, would put in place arrangements that would guarantee all the existing deposits in Northern Rock Plc during the current instability in the financial markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para35"><a name="0710083000062">Throughout this period the Treasury, the FSA and the Bank of England have worked together, and, as appropriate, with Northern Rock Plc, in line with their respective responsibilities, and continue to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para36"><a name="0710083000063"><i>Reforms</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para37"><a name="0710083000064">Global issues demand global responses, so the Government are working closely with their partners in the EU and internationally to ensure a coordinated international approach to financial market developments over the last two months. I made proposals to EU finance ministers that we must remain fully engaged, acting with the wider international community, in strengthening arrangements for ensuring financial stability.  <br>

I will also be making proposals at the meetings of the G7 and International Monetary Fund next week on the international response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para38"><a name="0710083000065">The UK has a system of depositor protection based on the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). Under the previous scheme only the first &#163;2,000 of people&#146;s savings and 90 per cent. of the next &#163;33,000 were guaranteed. As a first step in improving the level of protection for depositors, the FSA has decided that, with effect from 1 October, the FSCS will cover 100 per cent of deposits up to &#163;35,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para39"><a name="0710083000066">We must learn the lessons from recent events and reinforce our systems appropriately to meet our objectives of maintaining financial stability, competitiveness and confidence. I will therefore make a statement later this week bringing forward proposals on further reforms to give consumers confidence that their savings and deposits are accessible, safe and secure, and to handle banks facing difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="71008m0001.htm_para40"><a name="0710083000067">We will balance any need to make improvements as quickly as we reasonably can with the need to consult as fully as possible.

The report &#147;Better Buildings, Better Design, Better Education&#148; (DfES, 2007) showed that the Government&#146;s investment programme has already made a difference for pupils around the country. Since1997, over 1,100 schools have been built new or rebuilt, 27,000 classrooms built or improved, and thousands more schools have had real improvements to science laboratories, sports facilities and other building and ICT projects. In 2007-08, around 180 schools will be built new or rebuilt, including the first through &#147;Building Schools for the Future&#148;.</p>

We are continuing the successful balance of programmes, established in 2004. These are: devolved programmes for every school and local authority; our long-term strategic programmes for primary and secondary education; and targeted programmes for key national investment priorities. I will make a further statement next week to set out the detailed allocations against each of these programmes.</p>

This is crucial for the future aspirations of millions of young people as well as the economic future of the UK&#151;encouraging business start-ups, social enterprises and development of an enterprising workforce.

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para2"><a name="0710083000080">The conclusion of this work is that it is not cost effective to move the UKHO&#146;s 900 strong office workforce to Exeter, and in addition any such move would cause substantial disruption to both organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para3"><a name="0710083000081">I therefore confirm that the UKHO will remain in the Taunton area and that further work is on going to determine detailed options for the office.</p>

 The amount of low flying training carried out in the UK Low Flying System (UKLFS) during the training year April 2006 to March 2007 was the minimum required for aircrew to reach and maintain their ability to fly at low level. The number of low flying training hours booked in the UKLFS (excluding the rotary wing dedicated user areas, where different booking arrangements apply) was 37,717 hours, a decrease of 6,713 (15 per cent.) hours in comparison with the previous training year. This decrease can be mostly attributed to the high level of operational deployments and immediate training requirements for operations in the close air support role being undertaken at medium level rather than low level. Low flying hours have also reduced from aircraft retiring from service. The level of operational low flying by fixed wing aircraft reduced by some 6 per cent. when compared to the last training year.</p>

plan, control measures including a national ban on the movement of susceptible animals were put in place immediately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para22"><a name="0710083000103">DEFRA, Animal Health, local authorities, the voluntary sector and other partners across government, alongside the farming community, have worked hard to control and eradicate the disease. Working with the leaders of the farming and food chain industries, we have been able to identify welfare pressures, and on a risk basis allowed animal movements to take place under strict biosecurity conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para23"><a name="0710083000104">By 4 August we were able to confirm the strain of the virus as 01-BFS-67. As this strain was not currently circulating in animals, this pointed to the Pirbright laboratory site as a potential source of the outbreak. Therefore, I commissioned the Health and Safety Executive to investigate the potential release from the site, and Professor Brian Spratt to lead a team of experts in a review of biosecurity arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para24"><a name="0710083000105">On 7 September we published the investigation report from the HSE, the review report by Professor Brian Spratt, and the epidemiological report from the National Emergency Epidemiology Group in DEFRA. I have place copies of all these reports in the House Library. They all concluded that the cause of the outbreak was almost certainly the escape of live virus from the Pirbright facility. As the House will be aware there are three parties on the Pirbright site all of which are known to have been using the 01-BFS-67 strain during the period when infection was most likely to have occurred&#151;the Institute for Animal Health, a research institute sponsored and grant aided by the Biotechnology and Biological Science Research Council which also owns the land and buildings on the site; and two private companies Merial Animal Health Limited, and Stabilitech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para25"><a name="0710083000106">It cannot be said with complete certainty how the virus escaped from the Pirbright site. However, the reports concluded that the most likely route was accidental release from the drainage system that connects the vaccine production plant to the waste inactivation facility on another part of the site. It is thought that localised flooding alongside construction work may have resulted in effluent escaping from the system coming to the surface, and being transferred on the site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para26"><a name="0710083000107">Whatever the route of escape, it should not have happened and we are determined that it does not happen again. I have accepted all of the recommendations in the reports from the HSE and Professor Spratt, and I have called for a review of the regulatory framework for animal pathogens led by Sir Bill Callaghan. In addition a safety alert has been issued jointly by DEFRA and the HSE to the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens and all animal pathogen category 3 and 4 laboratories, reminding licence holders of their responsibilities. This will be followed by a round of inspections. A rigorous improvement plan has been developed for both Merial, and IAH to be implemented before full operations with live virus can re-commence. In addition a review led by BBSRC is assessing the funding, governance and risk management at IAH. I will keep the House informed of progress with both these reviews.</p>

highly unlikely that the virus had spread outside of the Surrey area. Under long standing international rules and European Union procedures, zone restrictions must stay in place for at least 30 days after preliminary cleansing and disinfection on the last infected premises and the completion of certain surveillance activity. We observed these procedures and carried out intensive surveillance going beyond Community rules in the area. Given that only two cases had been confirmed (on 3 and 6 August) we proceeded to lift the Surveillance Zone on the 8 September and with the unanimous support of the Commission and member states, trade restrictions were lifted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para28"><a name="0710083000109">Unfortunately, as we now know, there was undetected infection outside the surveillance zone. On 12 September following an investigation by Animal Health, Foot and Mouth Disease was confirmed in a third case in Surrey, and controls were re-imposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para29"><a name="0710083000110">On 25 September we created two FMD areas in Great Britain, a risk area in the south-east and a lower risk area in the rest of the country where farm to farm movements were permitted under licence. We have subsequently reduced the size of the FMD risk area and will continue to do so based on veterinary risk. On 4 October markets in the low risk area were able to start operating again under stringent biosecurity measures. I visited Skipton market last Thursday and was able to see the difference this will make to the farming industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para30"><a name="0710083000111">On 3 October the EU confirmed that the export of meat could resume from this Friday (12 October) from Scotland, Wales, and the north and south west of England. This is very welcome news for the farming and food chain industries. We will continue to work with the Commission to increase the areas from which exports can happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para31"><a name="0710083000112">The outbreak and its continuation has been a tremendous blow to the farming industry, especially given the time of year when the majority of livestock farmers need to move their animals and generate income. The economic impact of this outbreak on the farming community has been very significant and we have listened to the views of industry to take steps to alleviate economic and welfare pressures where ever possible. Indeed, working in partnership with the farming community has been an integral part of our approach to responding to this outbreak.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para32"><a name="0710083000113">I am acutely aware of the major challenges facing the livestock sector at this critical time of year. Officials are working very closely with the industry in facilitating the resumption of animal movements on a risk basis to ensure as far as possible the normal working of the industry. The measures we have taken to ease restrictions in the low risk area through farm to farm movements and opening markets have helped and the resumption of exports of meat will be of further assistance not just to those whose products are exported but to the market overall.</p>

determine whether this and the subsequent four cases were isolated incidents which could be controlled by culling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para34"><a name="0710083000115">On Friday 28 September the increase in cases indicated that the disease was circulating in our midge population and the Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer confirmed the presence on bluetongue in Great Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para35"><a name="0710083000116">Bluetongue is very different from FMD. It is spread by midges, rather than animal to animal, and we cannot stamp it out by slaughtering infected cases. However, we may be able to limit its spread. The cases we have seen so far are in a limited geographical area and seem to result from a single incursion which took place in August when FMD movement controls were in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para36"><a name="0710083000117">Midge activity should diminish significantly next month, which may halt further spread&#151;at least for the winter. We have therefore consulted a group of stakeholders from the sectors affected and they have agreed that for the time being we should apply the control and protection zone measures to clamp down on further spread.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para37"><a name="0710083000118">A clear understanding of the spread of the disease is now crucial to help the industry, with the support of government, to plan what may happen and what the appropriate response would be. That requires farmers in the zones to be vigilant and, for the sake of their industry, to report all new cases, so that we can monitor whether spread is occurring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para38"><a name="0710083000119">Over the coming weeks, the decision on whether to continue this approach will be kept under review with stakeholders. If disease becomes more widespread, our control strategy sets out that we would consider, with the farming industry, extending the bluetongue zones to a larger area. This is a difficult balance between permitting movements across a greater distance but also potentially increasing the risk of further disease spread. I recognise the hardship these controls impose in East Anglia. Our aim is to help implement the control strategy that industry representatives themselves recommend to us. The effects of bluetongue movement controls mean that it is vital that disease control decisions are taken by the industry and not just Ministers. In the longer term, we are also urgently planning with the industry how we could implement a vaccination programme should a vaccine becomes available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para39"><a name="0710083000120">The speed, commitment and professionalism of all those who have responded to these outbreaks has been remarkable, and I am sure the House will join me in expressing thanks for their efforts. The House will also understand the very real pressures faced by the farming community and the distress that this has caused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para40"><a name="0710083000121">I will keep the House updated on progress regarding the control and eradication of both FMD and the control of bluetongue.</p>

 The whole country will have been deeply disturbed by recent events in Burma. The brutal suppression of peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations across the country, including beatings, killings and arbitrary detentions of monks and civilians, has been deplorable. The Government are committed to working with all international partners in the search for an inclusive political process to bring reform in Burma.</p>

In 1988, pro-democracy demonstrations were violently suppressed by the military. Multi-party elections in 1990 were overwhelmingly won by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy. However, the military regime refused to implement these results.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="71008m0002.htm_para45"><a name="0710083000128">Aung San Suu Kyi has remained under house arrest since she and her supporters were attacked in May 2003. The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner has spent 12 out of the last 17 years under house arrest.</p>

It severely restricts freedom of expression, information, assembly and movement. Members of opposition parties are subject to harassment, arbitrary arrest and detention. Before the recent demonstrations there were already some 1,100 political prisoners in Burma. Forced labour, arbitrary killings, the use of child soldiers and systematic rape, unlawful detention and displacement have all been commonplace.</p>

called for the immediate release of those detained. I expressed the UK's solidarity with the protesters and warned the regime that it would be judged by how it responded to this peaceful movement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="71008m0003.htm_para1"><a name="0710083000133">In late September the demonstrations grew rapidly in size, led by large numbers of Buddhist monks. These demonstrations were peaceful and orderly. On 20 September Professor Ibrahim Gambari, the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General, briefed the UN Security Council in informal session, a development which I welcomed publicly, while expressing concern for the peaceful demonstrators. On 22 September demonstrators were permitted to walk past the house in which Aung San Suu Kyi is being held under house arrest. As the crisis developed, the Prime Minister and I issued a number of statements and spoke to many of our international counterparts urging against repression and calling for reconciliation. After the Prime Minister had written to the UN Secretary General and the President of the EU expressing concern, the EU issued a statement on 25 September warning that it would not hesitate to impose strengthened measures against the Burmese regime if they resorted to violence; and there were further informal Security Council discussions on 26 September.</p>

The security forces turned their guns on unarmed demonstrators. We do not know for certain how many people were killed but we fear it is many more than the regime has admitted. Monks and opposition leaders have been beaten and arrested. Many remain in detention and reports suggest that they are being held in appalling conditions. Through the indiscriminate use of force, the regime has suppressed the protests and forced people off the streets.</p>

The regime must immediately accede to the requests for urgent access for the Head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Burma, Professor Pinheiro. And they must engage with Ambassador Gambari in developing an inclusive political process for reform.</p>

October, and we pressed for the visit by Professor Gambari, to Burma to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi and the military leaders. We look forward to a return visit by Ambassador Gambari.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="71008m0003.htm_para8"><a name="0710083000140">The UK also pushed hard for a Special Session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, which, with strong UK involvement and support, passed a Resolution on 2 October deploring the violent repression of peaceful demonstrators and agreeing to send the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights, Professor Pinheiro, on an urgent mission to Burma to report on the human rights situation</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="71008m0003.htm_para9"><a name="0710083000141">Third, with our EU partners we have been working to strengthen sanctions against the regime. This will continue over the next week in the run up to the General Affairs Council on 15 October.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="71008m0003.htm_para10"><a name="0710083000142"><i>Future direction</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="71008m0003.htm_para11"><a name="0710083000143">We have three clear objectives, building on the work we have already been doing. The Prime Minister re-emphasised these objectives when he met Burma activists on Saturday 6 October&#151;the day of global action on Burma.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="71008m0003.htm_para12"><a name="0710083000144">First, the international spotlight must be kept firmly on Burma. We will continue to highlight the appalling recent events in Burma and use our diplomatic network to keep our international partners focussed on the need to address urgently the ongoing human rights abuses there. On 6 October the Prime Minister drew attention to a compilation of material by FCO officials, drawing together information on recent human rights violations in Burma from media, eyewitness and diplomatic sources. This can be found on the front page of the FCO Website: http://www.fco.gov.uk</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="71008m0003.htm_para13"><a name="0710083000145">Second, the regime must understand that it cannot turn the clock back to the dire situation before the recent demonstrations. We welcomed Professor Gambari's clear statement on 5 October that the status quo ante was both unacceptable and unsustainable. Recent events have demonstrated clearly that this would pose unacceptable risks to Burma's long-suffering population and to the region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="71008m0003.htm_para14"><a name="0710083000146">At its meeting on 5 October, members of the United Nations Security Council sent a clear signal that a process of national reconciliation leading to democracy, full respect for human rights and the rule of law is the only way forward. That process must involve Aung San Suu Kyi and leaders of the democratic opposition and ethnic groups. And it will need to have international legitimacy. We continue to support urgent and active UN engagement to pursue such a process, and are pressing for an early return visit by Professor Gambari to Burma.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="71008m0003.htm_para15"><a name="0710083000147">Third, we will galvanise and mobilise international support to put pressure on the regime. In addition to further engagement by the UN Security Council and the UN Secretary General, we also need all those with influence on the regime to use it to press for positive change. China and other key nations such as Thailand and India can play a crucial role. We appreciate the efforts China has already made in support of Professor Gambari's recent visit to Burma and we hope China will continue to use its influence on the regime to push for genuine dialogue with the political opposition. My recent meetings with Foreign Ministers of all three countries have provided the opportunity to explain the priority we give to this issue.</p>

I acknowledged the generosity of the offer, while suggesting that even more liberal Rules of Origin could help the negotiations.

They have strong backgrounds in management in the public sector, having both been Directors of Social Services in large local authorities where they had responsibilities both for services for children and for secure provision. More recently they have been involved in the NHS, where they currently both chair NHS Trusts. They both have considerable experience of participating in and chairing reviews in the NHS and in Social Services.

 The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 makes provision for a new appointments process for Justices of the United Kingdom Supreme Court. The Act brings these provisions into effect once the Court is operational. The new arrangements aim to increase public confidence in the appointments process by creating greater transparency of appointments and improving competition for these positions. I believe that it is sensible to adopt the new process from now on. This is because those newly appointed to the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords will spend the majority of their career in the Supreme Court.</p>

Accordingly, on 19 September the Commission issued a Communication dealing with costs, risks, procurement and governance, together with a proposal for amendment of the Galileo financing regulation and provision for funds to be transferred from the margin available under the Agriculture and Administration budget headings, to fund Galileo in the Competitiveness heading (1A).</p>

In the exchange, there was wide support for the Galileo project and for reaching an integrated decision by the end of this year. The Council Conclusions reflect these points. In the discussion I made clear the UK's strongly held view that the project should offer value for money for the Community, our opposition to a revision of the financial perspectives, and our firm view that, if the Community decides to proceed with a public procurement of Galileo, any additional funding should be found by reprioritisation within heading 1A.</p>

A decision was required prior to the participation of EU Member States in the IMO's Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) meeting, starting on 3 October. I welcomed the establishment of the data centre, while noting some remaining concerns on system integration and cost-sharing. We also presented these concerns in writing.
