<p><a name="st_0"><a name="41101m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Minister for the Cabinet Office  (Ruth Kelly): </b> 
 The report &quot;Analysis of Sickness Absence in the Civil Service 2003&quot; prepared for the Cabinet Office by Aon Limited shows that the headline figure for the average level of sickness absence was 10.0 days per staff year. This represents a 0.2 days per staff year increase over the equivalent figure of 9.8 days set out in the report for 2002. The report contains a comprehensive analysis of the 2003 figures by department/agency. Copies have been placed in the Library.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101m01.html_para0"><a name="stpa_0">Departments have established service delivery agreements, which contain their individual targets for reducing sickness absence. Overall, the civil service was targeted to reduce sickness absence by 30 per cent. (to 7.2 days per staff year) by 2003 against the 1998 baseline. In July 2004 my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced a review into the extent of short and long-term sickness within the civil service, and the results of that are due to be published shortly. Meanwhile, the Cabinet Office is continuing to work with other departments and agencies as they take forward their plans to reduce sickness absence.

 Draft regulations and formal guidance implementing the Road Transport (Working Time) Directive (2002/15/EC) have today been published. A short six-week consultation exercise has been launched seeking views on both documents. This follows a full consultation exercise earlier this year on how the directive should be implemented. We are placing copies of the documents in the Libraries of both Houses.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">Weekly working time is limited to an average 48 hours.</p>

 On 27 January 2004 as part of the Department&#039;s wider programme of reform, the then Secretary of State announced that the disability and carers service (DCS) would be assigned formal executive agency status. Work to establish the agency is now complete. It will retain its current title, the disability and carers service, and is launched from today with Terry Moran appointed as chief executive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41101m01.html_para19"><a name="stpa_19">The role of DCS is to support disabled people and carers by providing a customer-focused service that delivers disability and carer benefits efficiently.
