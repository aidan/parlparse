 Following Budget 2006, the Chancellor established a High Level Group to consider issues related to the international competitiveness of the UK financial sector, recognising the opportunities presented by emerging markets and the strength of international competition from other financial centres. As part of this work, the Chancellor asked Lord Levene, Graham Millwater and Andrew Kendrick to review the business processes of the London market. The Treasury too has been working closely with the Financial Services Authority and the, wholesale general insurance market to identify market led reform and modernisation that can enable the industry to remain competitive in a global market. The Treasury has also been developing its understanding of the business environment for this sector. The Treasury, Financial Services Authority and wholesale general insurance market will take stock again and assess progress in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="70621m0001.htm_para1"><a name="07062148000036">As part of this wider work on reforms of the London insurance market, Lloyd&#146;s of London has been working with the Treasury to identify areas where its corporate governance arrangements are out of step with modern practices. Following these discussions, the Treasury has decided to develop legislative proposals to modernise the governance arrangement for Lloyd&#146;s. These proposals will take the form of a Legislative Reform Order to amend Lloyd&#146;s Act 1982. The aim of the proposals will be to update the governance arrangements of the market to reduce costs and unnecessary bureaucracy. The Treasury will have extensive consultation with interested parties and intends to publish proposals in the New Year. Any proposals will meet the preconditions and restrictions of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006.</p>

 There are currently over 2.6 million Child Trust Fund accounts open of which around three-quarters have been actively opened by parents. The Government are committed to ensuring that all families, including lower income families, get the most from the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="70621m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07062148000039">The Government believe that credit unions have an important role to play in delivering the Child Trust Fund.

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="70621m0001.htm_para3"><a name="07062148000040">Where credit unions serve communities in low-income areas, they can be vital in targeting those encountering exclusion from mainstream financial services, helping clients obtain money advice in the course of providing a loan, and connecting people to other mainstream opportunities. The Government hope that credit unions will take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the Child Trust Fund to build on this success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="70621m0001.htm_para4"><a name="07062148000041">Child Trust Fund rules allow credit unions to offer both cash and Stakeholder accounts. The Government are encouraged that several credit unions have already chosen to provide these accounts: Leeds City Credit Union, Clwyd Coast Credit Union, Leicester Credit Union, Dragonsavers, Loans and Savings Abertawe and Bristol Credit Union, and are keen to see more do so in the future.</p>

 The Government are committed to ensuring that Building Regulations support the safety of hot water systems in the home. We have been working closely with the industry to develop guidelines and training notes to help ensure that those who install and maintain these systems are aware of the problems and dangers posed. I am very grateful to the industry for the work that has already been done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="70621m0001.htm_para10"><a name="07062148000050">However, it's clear we should do more as in the last six months there have been a number of tragic incidents as a result of defective hot water systems. I am therefore announcing today that I will undertake a new review of Part G of the Building Regulations to determine whether changes are needed, and can be made, that would improve the safety of these systems in the future. This review will cover the whole of Part G dealing with sanitary installations and the hot water systems that serve them as one package.

 My hon. Friend the Under Secretary of State for Defence and Minister for Veterans and I have recently reviewed the way in which current housing legislation impacts on those leaving the Armed Forces. This follows representations from Service personnel and others that the local connection provisions in housing legislation put Service personnel and those leaving the Armed Forces at a disadvantage when trying to access social housing.</p>

<meta name="Date" content="21 Jun 2007">

<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>21 Jun 2007 : Column 108WS</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="70621m0001.htm_para12"><a name="07062148000053">Local authorities in England are responsible for framing their own policies and procedures for allocating social housing. In deciding who gets priority for social housing, housing legislation allows local authorities to take into account whether someone has a local connection with their district. Not all local authorities take local connection into account. Where they do, the legislation can put Service personnel at a disadvantage since an individual cannot establish a local connection with an area through residence or employment there when serving in the Armed Forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="70621m0001.htm_para13"><a name="07062148000054">The Government are committed to aiding the effective transition of Service personnel to civilian life, and access to suitable housing is a vital part of this. Many will have bought their own home during their time in Service&#151;and the Ministry of Defence has several schemes in place to encourage this&#151;or will do so on leaving. However, for some Service leavers home ownership may not be an option and they may wish to apply for social housing. We believe it is important that the service they have given to their country does not place them at any disadvantage in this respect. The Government have therefore decided to make the necessary changes to housing legislation, at the earliest opportunity, to ensure that Service personnel are treated fairly and put on an equal footing with other people applying for social housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="70621m0001.htm_para14"><a name="07062148000055">The detail of how the change will be effected will need to await the outcome of the current review of housing policy which the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government announced, following publication of Professor Hills' wide ranging report on social housing on 20 February 2007. We will bring forward our proposals in due course.</p>

Specifically, as Lord Carlile recommended in his February 2006 report on the operation of the control order system, the Home Office has established a review group, with representation from law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to keep the obligations in every control order under regular (quarterly), formal and audited review.</p>

In both cases, the court accepted that the Secretary of State had reasonable grounds for suspecting that the individual was involved in terrorism-related activity. The Secretary of State is appealing these judgments.</p>

The Court of Appeal concluded that the obligations in <i>E&#146;s</i> control order did not cumulatively amount to a deprivation of liberty. It also judged that while there was a breach of the obligation to keep prosecution under review, the quashing of the order was not the appropriate remedy for this failure. Consequently the Court of Appeal allowed the Secretary of State&#146;s appeal against the High Court judgment, and upheld the control order.</p>

 The recent inquest into the death in 2004 of Adam Rickwood has drawn attention to a lack of clarity as to the powers of custody officers in secure training centres to restrain trainees, where it is necessary to do so. We have been asked by the coroner to rectify the position and clarify the rules.</p>

That continues to apply. The Youth Justice Board is working closely with all under-18 custodial establishments, including secure training centres, on all matters relating to the code of practice.</p>

<notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>21 Jun 2007 : Column 117WS</b><br>
on the design of the RTFO and the recent G8 communiqu&#233; which reinforces the need to establish international biofuel quality standards and avoid the possible negative side effects of biofuel development, I am today announcing that the Government:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="70621m0003.htm_para1"><a name="07062148000158">aims to reward biofuels under the RTFO in accordance with the carbon savings that they offer from April 2010, provided that this is compatible with World Trade Organisation rules and EU technical standards requirements, and is consistent with the policy framework being developed by the European Commission as part of the review of the biofuels directive, and subject to consultation on its environmental and economic impacts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="70621m0003.htm_para2"><a name="07062148000159">aims to reward biofuels under the RTFO only if the feedstocks from which they are produced meet appropriate sustainability standards from April 2011, subject to the same provisos and consultation as above and subject to the development of such standards for the relevant feedstocks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="70621m0003.htm_para3"><a name="07062148000160">will continue to work closely with out partners at a national, European and international level to develop robust standards for ensuring the sustainability of biofuels and to ensure that early consideration is given to the WTO implications of the UK&#146;s policy intentions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="70621m0003.htm_para4"><a name="07062148000161">will ask the RTFO Administrator to report to the Secretary of State every three months on the effectiveness of the RTFO&#146;s environmental reporting mechanisms, and on the carbon and sustainability effects of the RTFO. The Government will keep the RTFO under review in the light of these reports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="70621m0003.htm_para5"><a name="07062148000162">intends to set stretching indicative targets for the level of carbon and sustainability performance expected from all transport fuel suppliers claiming certificates for biofuels in the early years of the RTFO. These targets, which are included in the consultation paper we are publishing today, cover:</p>

<p><a name="70621m0003.htm_amdt0">the level of greenhouse gas savings that we expect to see from the biofuels used to meet the RTFO;</p>

<p><a name="70621m0003.htm_amdt1">the proportion of those biofuels that we expect to come from feedstocks grown to recognised sustainability standards; and</p>

<p><a name="70621m0003.htm_amdt2">the amount of specific information that we expect to be included in sustainability reports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="70621m0003.htm_para6"><a name="07062148000166">has asked the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership (LowCVP) to explore the feasibility of a voluntary labelling scheme to allow responsible retailers to show that their biofuels are genuinely sustainable. Any scheme would need to be compatible with WTO rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="70621m0003.htm_para7"><a name="07062148000168">Moving to mandatory carbon saving and sustainability requirements would require changes to the RTFO Order which, under the Energy Act 2004, would be subject to consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="70621m0003.htm_para8"><a name="07062148000169">The Government will make a further announcement in due course on how they intend to respond to the other issues that stakeholders have raised in response to the February 2007 consultation on the design and future evolution of the RTFO.</p>

<p><a name="st_68"><a name="07062148000170"><a name="70621m0003.htm_spmin0"><a name="07062148000202"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mr. Tom Harris):</b>
 The Department has announced today that London and Birmingham Railway Limited (a subsidiary of Govia) has been awarded the West Midlands franchise. The new franchise will begin on11 November 2007 and will increase capacity, improve performance and begin the introduction of smartcard technology by 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="70621m0003.htm_para9"><a name="07062148000171">The West Midlands franchise combines the current Silverlink County services between London Euston and Northampton with the West Midlands local and regional service groups of Central Trains,, The department will pay a subsidy of &#163;1,127 million over the seven-year 10-month franchise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="70621m0003.htm_para10"><a name="07062148000172">From December 2008, the franchise will operate new services as a result of extra capacity created by the &#163;8.1bn upgrade of the West Coast Main Line, including a new hourly semi-fast service between London and Crewe and extra services from Birmingham to Liverpool and Northampton. The franchise also delivers 217 new carriages by April 2010, as part of the Government's 1,000 new carriages on the network. They will replace existing rolling stock which will be freed for use in other parts of the country. The agreement also demands improved performance of 90.7 per cent punctuality by the end of the franchise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="70621m0003.htm_para11"><a name="07062148000173">The Government will continue to limit annual rises for regulated fares for the franchise in line with national policy, currently RPI+1 per cent. As with all franchises, unregulated fares are the responsibility of individual operators.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="70621m0003.htm_para12"><a name="07062148000174">On most routes in the West Midlands franchise area, London and Birmingham Railway Limited proposes to raise such fares by no more than RPI+1 per cent. per annum. However, on the London to Northampton route the operator plans to raise such fares by 3 per cent. over inflation. This change is expected to affect13 per cent. of total passenger journeys in the franchise area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="70621m0003.htm_para13"><a name="07062148000175">A single compensation policy for all passengers will be introduced during replacement rail franchises, commencing with the West Midlands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="70621m0003.htm_para14"><a name="07062148000176">With improving Passenger's Charter performance in punctuality and reliability the current discount system means that an increasing number of passengers receive no compensation for delays.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="70621m0003.htm_para15"><a name="07062148000177">Therefore discounts in renewal for season tickets valid between one month and one year in compensation for poor punctuality and reliability will be replaced by compensation based on delays to individual journeys, known as Delay/Repay. Under the new system, all passengers will be entitled to claim compensation for all delays, whatever their cause:</p>
<a name="70621m0003.htm_brev0"><a name="07062148000178"><ul><p class="tabletext">50 per cent. of the price paid for a single-leg journey delayed by between 30 and 59 minutes;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="70621m0003.htm_para16"><a name="07062148000182">The changes will also start to standardise disparate compensation arrangements for single, return and weekly season ticket holders on different train operators.</p>
