<a name="30115m01.html_spmin0"><B>The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs   (Mr. Jack Straw): </B> 
 Yesterday I chaired a meeting in London attended by representatives of the Quartet and Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. I am very grateful that they were able to attend and contribute. We were joined through a video link by Palestinian Authority Ministers and civil society representatives, as the Israeli Government had unacceptably denied permission for them to travel to London. This arrangement was no substitute for a face-to-face conference, but 1 believe the meeting to have been constructive and wide ranging. It will support and complement the efforts of the Quartet on the Roadmap towards a two state settlement.
<P>

<a name="30115m01.html_para0">Palestinian Reform is only one part of the work required to achieve a just and comprehensive peace, but it is an important part. It is clear that the Palestinians are committed to the reform of their institutions and have already started that process. But there remains much to be done, and they need support and encouragement. At the meeting they repeated their condemnation of violence against civilians as a means of achieving Palestinian ends and briefed us on their plans for a new Palestinian constitution, political, economic and administrative reform and the creation of a Palestinian state.

<a name="30115m01.html_para1">This is an objective the whole international community shares. The next step will be meetings in London in early February of the Taskforce on Palestinian Reform and of Quartet Envoys. It will take action from all sides, including Israel, to maintain momentum and implement the Roadmap.
<P>

<a name="30115m01.html_para2">I urge the leaders of all sides to demonstrate the courage necessary to realise their obligations towards one another and turn that realisation into a genuine process of negotiation.

<a name="30115m01.html_para3">I am placing in the Library of the House a summary of my understanding of the proceedings and outcomes from the meeting. The key elements were:
