 Today 2 June 2009, I am publishing the second Joint Strategic Framework for the engagement of the Governments of the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and Portugal with the African Development Bank. This framework sets out how the UK and its fellow constituency members will work with the African Development Bank to improve its effectiveness over the next three years to 2011. It replaces Joint Strategic Framework 1 (2006-08).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="90602m0001.htm_para17"><a name="09060255000036">This Joint Strategic Framework is written at a time of great opportunity but also of great challenge for the African continent. Overall economic performance in most African countries has been good, but progress towards the millennium development goals still needs to accelerate. The global financial crisis has introduced new pressures and uncertainties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="90602m0001.htm_para18"><a name="09060255000037">Slower global economic growth, more difficult credit conditions, and changes in the international aid architecture pose additional challenges to which the African Development Bank will need to respond. At the same time, the bank must be better able to deal with the longer-term challenges facing Africa, including climate change, development in fragile states, gender equality, ensuring that private sector growth has positive benefits for the poorest, and helping countries in Africa work and trade together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="90602m0001.htm_para19"><a name="09060255000038">In addition to the three-year objectives on bank effectiveness set out in the Joint Strategic Framework, the UK has several specific objectives for the African Development Bank over the next 12 months.</p>
