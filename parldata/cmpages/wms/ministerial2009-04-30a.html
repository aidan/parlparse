They will also consult on the proposals to make personal, social, health and economic education statutory that I announced on Monday 27 April.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="90430m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09043031000075">Sir Jim proposes a new core of essential skills for learning and life focused on literacy, numeracy, ICT and personal development and learning which is embedded across the whole curriculum. This will help ensure that all children leave school secure in the basics. Sir Jim&#146;s recommendations also include restructuring the primary curriculum into six broad areas of learning, within which essential subject content will be organised and become more distinct as children progress from Key Stage 1 to Key Stage 2.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="90430m0001.htm_para9"><a name="09043031000076">The areas of learning are:</p>

The curriculum content is set out in three clear phases to help teachers plan for progression. Sir Jim also recommends that a foreign language should become compulsory for the first time from age 7, building on the recommendation of the languages review carried out by the late Lord Dearing.</p>

the new curriculum from September 2011. These include promoting what Sir Jim has already seen as excellent practice in some of our best primary schools relating to teaching reading and encouraging children&#146;s spoken communication skills. He has also concluded that we should retain the two writing early learning goals as aspirational targets and that the Government should make available guidance and support to smooth children&#146;s transition from the EYFS to primary school, including supporting those children still working towards these goals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="90430m0001.htm_para13"><a name="09043031000080">Other recommendations relate to helping schools plan for implementing the new curriculum, such as the Government supporting teachers&#146; professional development needs to deliver our increased expectations around ICT. Given the fundamental nature of the changes and the important contribution that I expect the new curriculum to make to children&#146;s attainment and well-being, I have agreed that primary schools should be permitted an additional training day in 2010 to give every school the time and opportunity to plan for the new curriculum from September 2011. A full set of Sir Jim&#146;s recommendations and my response is set out in the annex to this statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="90430m0001.htm_para14"><a name="09043031000081">On the question of when summer-born children should start school, I have accepted Sir Jim&#146;s recommendation that children should ideally start school in the September immediately following their fourth birthday, possibly on a part-time basis for some children, but with parents having freedom to choose. He has taken account of the compelling evidence on the benefits to summer-born children from starting school at the same time as their peers and that the majority of local authority areas already operate a single point of primary school entry in September. Young disabled children and children with SEN in particular will benefit from starting school as soon as possible so that the right interventions are put in place to ensure that these children also make progress alongside their fellow pupils. I am mindful however, that compulsory school age does not start until the term after a child turns five and that some parents have a strong preference for their child&#146;s early years experience to take place outside a school setting. I therefore intend to make funding available across the maintained, private and voluntary sectors to enable all children to receive full time provision in education and childcare from the September after their fourth birthday. Alongside making that provision available, we will ensure that parents have clear information about the benefits of beginning reception in September and we will work to help schools and early years settings to smooth the transition for any children who move into reception after September.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="90430m0001.htm_para15"><a name="09043031000082">I am enormously grateful to Sir Jim for the rigorous, inclusive and evidence-based way in which he has undertaken this major review. He has consulted widely with subject experts, learned societies, teachers and other professionals, and his review is informed by excellent practice in our best schools and internationally. Throughout the review he has kept in the forefront of his thinking the interests of children and their parents. I am confident that his work will make a huge difference to millions of young people, helping to ensure their primary years equip them with the knowledge, skills and understanding they need to thrive in their future education and later lives.</p>

While much has been done to rectify these, the two reports indicate that work still needs to be done to ensure quality of care at the hospital reaches the highest standard. Swift and decisive action is being taken to ensure that is the case. Stafford hospital was exceptional, not typical, but all those working in the NHS can learn from this experience so that such events do not occur again elsewhere.</p>

 In order to offer further support to families on low incomes during the recession, the Chancellor&#146;s Budget report on 22 April included the announcement that additional funding has been made available for social fund loans. In addition, to ensure that money is directed to those who are in the most need, the Secretary of State will be making changes to the discretionary social fund. The changes will take effect from 27 April 2009 for applications and awards made within the south-west region and from 8 June 2009 for the east midlands region. This is because of the introduction of a requirement for third and subsequent living expense crisis loan applications to be usually completed at a face to face interview at a Jobcentre Plus local office. In addition, a customer will usually be limited to three non-aligned living expenses crisis loans within a 12-month rolling period. This will be where the first and subsequent awards are made within the south-west region on or after 27 April 2009 (8 June 2009 for the east midlands region). Customers in these regions will be advised of the three non-aligned loan limit before taking out their first and second loans. Subsequent loans will still be available for customers who require assistance to meet living expenses:</p>
