 In my written ministerial statement of 10 October 2006, I undertook to report to Parliament on a quarterly basis on the operation of the UK's asset freezing regime. This is the first of these reports and covers the period October-December 2006<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="70301m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07030147000023"><i>Asset-freezing framework</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="70301m0001.htm_para1"><a name="07030147000024">The following changes have been made to asset-freezing legislation:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="70301m0001.htm_para3"><a name="07030147000029">The Treasury has also strengthened the asset-freezing regime by agreeing, on the advice of law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to use closed source evidence in cases where there are strong operational reasons to impose a freeze but insufficient open source evidence available. I notified Parliament of this decision in October.</p>

As you know, on 7 September 2006 the Westminster City Council Planning and City Development Committee resolved unanimously to grant planning and listed building consent to the proposed renovation of Middlesex Guildhall in preparation for use as the UK Supreme Court. English Heritage fully supported the renovation plans.</p>
</ul><a name="70301m0001.htm_brev14"><a name="07030147000067"><ul><p class="tabletext">Consent was granted subject to the completion of a Section 106 agreement, which was then signed by both parties on  21 November 2006.

It is about the process, it is not about the content of the application. I am named as an Interested Party in the case, and my Department and I are fully supportive of Westminster City Council. Westminster City Council lodged their defence on 16 February, which we supported, in which they defend the decision. The courts are now deciding whether or not there is a case to be heard.</p>

The Council conclusions affirmed an EU commitment to an independent greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of at least 20 per cent. by 2020 and a conditional 30 per cent. reduction target in the context of an international framework, all using 1990 as the base year. The UK welcomes this agreement as it sends a strong signal to business thereby encouraging the investment necessary to put the EU on track to a low carbon energy future. It also sends a strong message to our international partners that the EU is willing to take the lead on the development of a post-2012 framework to combat climate change.</p>

very much welcomes the Council conclusions&#146; recognition that the EU needs mutually supportive climate change and energy strategies. On targets for biofuels and renewable energies, the conclusions confirmed the view taken earlier by EU Energy Ministers. The UK supports the importance of promoting eco-innovations if we are to move towards a low-carbon economy and the application of better regulation principles in order to ensure that we achieve our environmental goals in the most cost-efficient, transparent way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="70301m0001.htm_para24"><a name="07030147000079">Ministers agreed Council conclusions on the thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides.

The UK supported the inclusion of all flights arriving at and departing from the EU from the beginning of the scheme (and not according to the phased approach proposed by the Commission), calling for aviation to be included in the scheme promptly&#151;even before 2011 if practicable. The UK highlighted that, in a global industry a global solution must be the ultimate goal, but that the EU could not allow a situation where a failure to make progress globally prevented us from taking the positive action we know to be necessary. Given the international nature of aviation, the UK believes that a proportionate and workable scheme is not possible based on member state cap setting and we therefore supported a central EU-wide cap for aviation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="70301m0001.htm_para26"><a name="07030147000081">Ministers gave their initial views on the Commission&#146;s communication on a community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from cars. The UK supported the Commission&#146;s intention to bring forward mandatory proposals, although we highlighted the need for these to be based on thorough impact assessment and in full consultation with stakeholders. The UK noted that binding legislation did not need to be more costly or less flexible than voluntary targets. What is important is how the targets are implemented. The UK welcomed the complementary measures to reduce emissions proposed by the Commission, as these are consistent with the integrated approach, but stressed that these must not distract from the need for substantial further progress on new car fuel efficiency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="70301m0001.htm_para27"><a name="07030147000082">Ministers also gave their initial views on the soils thematic strategy and proposed directive. The UK supported the objectives of the thematic strategy as it sends a powerful message about the critical importance of soil to all aspects of human activity and to the sustainability of the plant&#146;s ecosystems, but stressed that the proposed directive should take account of existing legislation in the field and contribute to regulatory simplification. The UK also highlighted the possibility of significant compliance costs and urged member states and the Commission to learn from the lessons of implementing legislation in other areas.</p>

The UK voted in favour of the proposed Council decision based on the opinions of various scientific bodies (including the European Food Safety Authority and the UK&#146;s Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment) which have concluded that there is no new relevant scientific evidence in support of the safeguard action.</p>

<p><a name="st_67"><a name="07030147000103"><a name="70301m0002.htm_spmin2"><a name="07030147000161"><b>The Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn):</b>
 Four years after the invasion, progress on reconstruction and development in Iraq remains mixed. Prime Minister Maliki&#146;s Government is less than a year old and faces immense security, political and economic challenges. The escalating sectarian violence, which is for many Iraqis a daily reality, has displaced large numbers of people both within Iraq and the wider region. We are therefore responding to help meet urgent humanitarian needs across the country. But the critical priority now is for the Iraqi Government to end the violence, so that Iraq&#146;s rich resources can be invested in creating better services and opportunities for all Iraqi people. Only a political solution will break the destructive cycle of violence and Prime Minister Maliki has made tackling the violence his highest priority. It is vital therefore that we give this new and democratically elected Government every assistance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="70301m0002.htm_para10"><a name="07030147000104">But there are gains worth noting, and more importantly protecting. The most important achievement of recent years has been the establishment of a democratically elected Government, the first in Iraq for decades, replacing Saddam&#146;s brutal regime. Prime Minister Maliki&#146;s coalition Government was established following elections in which 76 per cent. of the population voted. The constitution was agreed in a referendum and will be reviewed later this year. The Council of Representatives has agreed a budget law, and will soon consider a hydrocarbons law to determine how Iraq&#146;s oil revenues will be managed. International support was crucial in helping run and monitor the elections, as well as funding outreach programmes to encourage participation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="70301m0002.htm_para11"><a name="07030147000105">Once a relatively wealthy country with high levels of education and healthcare, by 2003 Iraq had suffered more than 20 years of conflict, mismanagement and chronic under-investment. The 2003 conflict, the continued violence, including sabotage of key infrastructure, as well as low (but growing) levels of management capacity in Iraq&#146;s national and local government have slowed progress. However, reconstruction has continued and much has been achieved by the Government of Iraq, with support from the UK, US and a range of other donors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="70301m0002.htm_para12"><a name="07030147000106">With international community support Iraq has made some improvements to basic services. Over  5 million children have received life-saving vaccinations and Iraq is now spending 30 times more on healthcare compared to pre-war levels. Over 5,168 schools have been rehabilitated and a further 450 are in progress. More than 100,000 primary and 40,000 secondary teachers have been trained. Unfortunately the violence is seriously affecting Iraq&#146;s health and education systems, as talented professionals are targeted or choose to leave the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="70301m0002.htm_para13"><a name="07030147000107">There has also been progress on the economic front. The Iraqi economy rebounded quickly in 2004, and dollar income has continued to grow, almost doubling by 2006. Income growth has mainly been driven by  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="1 Mar 2007">

<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>1 Mar 2007 : Column 101WS</b><br>
rising oil prices, so the challenge now is to convert more of the windfall earnings from oil to productive investments in public services and infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="70301m0002.htm_para14"><a name="07030147000108">The UK is one of the first major donors to Iraq to fully disburse our Madrid pledge of &#163;544 million since 2003. The further pledge of &#163;100 million announced by the Chancellor is on top of this, bringing the total UK commitment to &#163;644 million. From our own resources, we have funded major electricity and water projects in southern Iraq. For example, DFID has repaired the Al Hartha power station chimney and ensured the equivalent of 24 hours electricity to 85,000 households (enough to supply a city the size of Cardiff with 24-hour power). By the time these projects are complete, we will have added or secured 470MW to the national electricity grid, and improved access to water for about a million people. These projects will have employed around 450 people, generated almost 100,000 workdays and secured around 17,000 workdays per year for operation and maintenance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="70301m0002.htm_para15"><a name="07030147000109">But there is still a long way to go. The major focus of our effort now is in helping the Iraqi Government to take the lead in investing in critical services and infrastructure. The Iraqi Government needs to do more to provide basic services for its people and protect those at risk. And it needs to make a start on some of the economic reforms that will unlock more money to invest in better public services and infrastructure in the longer term. We and other donors are providing support to help them to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="70301m0002.htm_para16"><a name="07030147000110">Much of the work done to get development in Iraq back on track goes unnoticed; the backroom, unglamorous slog of getting the right policy advice on tough issues such as drafting and redrafting budgets, setting up systems to manage central Government business, and dealing with milestones such as regular IMF reviews. But it is paying off. With help from donors, including DFID, the Iraqi Government has stayed on track with its stand-by arrangement, therefore meeting the conditions of the Paris club debt reduction deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="70301m0002.htm_para17"><a name="07030147000111">This work is hugely important because it puts Iraqis in the lead. With oil revenues of $30 billion (93 per cent. of the national budget) in 2007, there is no shortage of resources in Iraq. Iraq has the resources to finance its own development. The challenge is spending it effectively. What has been lacking is the capacity of Iraqi institutions to deliver. Thanks in large part to our work in Basra and Baghdad, this is beginning to change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="70301m0002.htm_para18"><a name="07030147000112">Iraq&#146;s Deputy Prime Minister recently held a meeting with the Basra Governor and Provincial Council and a range of relevant national Ministers to set out Iraqi plans for the development of the province. For the first time, Basrawis heard from their own Government how much money was to be invested in their area, when and on what. This sort of transparency is vital to building a culture of trust and accountability between Government and people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="70301m0002.htm_para19"><a name="07030147000113">Large numbers of civil society initiatives are springing up throughout Iraq. There are over 250 newspapers and magazines launched since the fall of the regime and more than 2,500 registered Iraqi NGOs. These range from groups focused on reconciliation, to groups promoting women&#146;s rights and organisations trying to enhance political participation. DFID&#146;s  <br>

support for Iraqi NGOs has encouraged poor and marginalised sections of Iraqi society to engage in the political process by fostering partnerships between international NGOs to provide advice and support to other Iraqi grassroots organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="70301m0002.htm_para20"><a name="07030147000114">While these achievements are important, and a credit to the Iraqis and their partners who work so hard in the face of enormous risks and challenges, there is much still to do. Our objective remains to develop the capacity of the democratically elected Government of Iraq, and to increase their ability to provide security and basic services to the Iraqi people.</p>
