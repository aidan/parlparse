the Secretary of State and I made a commitment to ensure progress
against the local and national recommendations made in that report.
This commitment to maintain an ongoing involvement and focus on

in Cornwall and the need for significant change locally, as well as the
need to ensure that the circumstances that led to those events do not
occur
elsewhere.</p><p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="61106m0001.htm_para5"><a name="06110613000020">As

was placed on special measures following a recommendation by the
Healthcare Commission. Although the special measures apply directly to
Cornwall Partnership Trust, the trust, Cornwall and Isles of Scilly
Primary Care Trust, NHS South West and Cornwall county council have
developed an action plan to deliver on the recommendations stemming
from the investigation&#146;s findings. The strategic health
authority, the Healthcare Commission and Commission for Social Care
Inspection have agreed this action plan and the local NHS and county
council in Cornwall are working in partnership to deliver on the action
plan. Progress is subject to quarterly reviews between the Department,
the Commissions, the local NHS and Cornwall County Council and covers
both the special measures and all the local recommendations in the
Commission&#146;s joint inspection report. The multi-agency action
plan identifies both critical early actions to particular and immediate
change as well as actions for longer-term sustainability. The external
team appointed on the recommendation of the Healthcare Commission will
remain in place for a period of twelve months, as recommended in the
report. Progress against these actions will be subject to a review by
the regulators in July 2007 that will report back to my right hon.
