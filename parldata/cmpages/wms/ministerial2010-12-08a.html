<a name="subhd_1"><a name="101208m0001.htm_sbhd0"><a name="10120858000009"><h4 align="center">Higher Education Funding and Student Finance</h4>

<p><a name="st_221"><a name="10120858000017"><a name="101208m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="10120858000078"><b>The Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (Vince Cable):</b>
 I am today announcing further improvements to the proposed package of reforms to higher education funding and student finance in England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="101208m0001.htm_para0"><a name="10120858000018">Our proposed reforms were announced by the Minister for Universities and Science on 3 November. They will introduce a significantly fairer and more progressive new system in which no eligible student has to pay upfront fees, there is a better deal for students while they are studying, and a fairer system of repayments for those who have completed their studies and are realising the benefits of a university education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="101208m0001.htm_para1"><a name="10120858000019">Since that announcement, we have continued to discuss the proposals in detail with Members of Parliament, universities, students and other stakeholders. In the light of those discussions, we have decided to make three further enhancements to the package to ensure that the package is as progressive as we can make it for full-time students, while at the same time providing better support for part-time students.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="101208m0001.htm_para2"><a name="10120858000020">First, the proposals announced on 3 November already make significant steps to improve the support available for part-time students. For the first time, eligible part-time students would qualify for loan support for their tuition costs on the same basis as full-time students. These changes have been welcomed by many as a critical measure in redressing long-standing discrimination against part-time students. However, discussion with the higher education sector has highlighted that the proposed threshold of 33% intensity for full loan entitlement may inadvertently deprive a significant number of learners from receiving support. We therefore propose that the level of intensity be reduced to 25%-that is, any eligible student studying for more than a quarter of their time will be eligible for full loan support for their tuition costs. This will better reflect the way that many part time courses are structured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="101208m0001.htm_para3"><a name="10120858000021">Secondly, we have been keen to ensure that there is adequate protection for lower earning graduates in our new system. One critical component of this protection is the income threshold at which graduates start repaying, and the way that threshold is then uprated in future years. As announced on 3 November, that income threshold will be £21,000 as from 2016, compared with the current threshold of £15,000. Our modelling to date has assumed that that threshold should be uprated every five years in line with earnings. In order to give better protection for those on lower incomes, we now propose that the uprating should instead be made every year. Around a quarter of graduates will be better off in this new, more progressive regime than under the current regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="101208m0001.htm_para4"><a name="10120858000022">Thirdly, we have reviewed the repayment position of students and graduates under the existing student finance system. The current income threshold for repayments was first announced by the previous Government in 2004, and has never since been uprated. The effect is that the value of that threshold has been declining with inflation, with graduates required to start paying at relatively lower levels of income. That is not fair to existing students and graduates. So we have decided that the £15,000 income threshold for those in the existing system should be uprated annually in line with inflation from 2012 to 2016.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="101208m0001.htm_para5"><a name="10120858000023">These improvements further enhance a reform package which will put higher education funding and student finance on a sustainable footing, improve the quality and viability of our university system, offer more progressive support to those on lower incomes both while studying in higher education and when repaying as graduates, and contribute to paying down the deficit.</p>

 I am pleased to announce that we are today publishing the cross-Government drug strategy "Reducing Demand, Restricting Supply, Building Recovery-Supporting People to live a Drug Free Life".

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="101208m0001.htm_para43"><a name="10120858000069">I am also inviting the views of the Lights Finance Committee, which includes representatives of the payers of light dues, on what an appropriate level of dues for the future would be that balances the need to reduce demands on the shipping industry with the need to maintain essential aids to navigation. I have asked the committee to report its conclusions to me by February 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="101208m0001.htm_para44"><a name="10120858000070">Sustainable economic growth also requires investment in training and skills. I am therefore also pleased to be able to announce that, despite the difficult public spending climate, the Government will continue to provide a partial financial contribution towards the cost of training seafarers under the existing support for maritime training scheme, with the remainder of those costs being met by employers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="101208m0001.htm_para45"><a name="10120858000071">Within its spending review settlement the Department for Transport has been able to allocate some £12 million to support maritime training in the next financial year. I intend that the majority of this money should be focused on supporting initial training for cadets studying at junior officer level (SMarT 1). I estimate that this will enable the Department to contribute to the training of up to 1,000 new cadets starting their training during the next academic year. In order to provide reassurance,  I can also confirm that we will make funding available beyond next year for all cadets starting SMarT 1 training in 2011-12, and those already undergoing SMarT l training, for the duration of their studies to officer of the watch certificate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="101208m0001.htm_para46"><a name="10120858000072">In addition, I intend that funding should also remain available next year for ratings training and for ratings to officer conversion training and I anticipate that some  <br>

funding should be available to support the first instalment of SMarT 2-helping those SMarT 1 officer cadets who are also working towards foundation and other degrees, higher national diplomas or Scottish diplomas to complete their studies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="101208m0001.htm_para47"><a name="10120858000073">For the remaining parts of the SMarT programme, including SMarT 2 training beyond the first instalment, the Government believe that in current circumstances it is more appropriate that the cost of this additional training should be met in full by employers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="101208m0001.htm_para48"><a name="10120858000074">During the year I intend to commission a review of the support for maritime training scheme to consider the continuing requirement for Government support for training and skills development in this sector and how best to spend any continuing Government funding. I will report back to the House on the terms of reference for the review in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="101208m0001.htm_para49"><a name="10120858000075">In current fiscal circumstances, the Government have also had to look hard at other areas of taxpayer support to shipping.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="101208m0001.htm_para50"><a name="10120858000076">The current crew relief costs scheme (CRCS) provides limited financial assistance to shipping companies towards the cost of officers or ratings joining or leaving their ships abroad. Shipping companies gain many benefits from the employment of British officers and ratings and, in light of this, the Government have come to the conclusion that continuing to provide commercial shipping companies with a subsidy to meet part of the costs of fares for seafarers can no longer be justified. The current CRCS will therefore cease on 8 March 2011. However, under the Merchant Shipping Act, the Secretary of State, with the consent of the Treasury, will still be able to provide financial assistance in respect of travel and other costs in exceptional cases. I am also inviting those with an interest in CRCS to submit suggestions for how the Department may be able to provide non-monetary assistance to encourage the continued employment of UK seafarers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="101208m0001.htm_para51"><a name="10120858000077">The Department for Transport also currently provides a financial contribution towards the costs of the confidential hazardous incident reporting programme for shipping (CHIRP) which provides an outlet for mariners to voice safety concerns. However, the scheme has not gained the traction hoped for in the commercial shipping and fishing sectors and there are other services established by the industry such as the Nautical Institute's mariners' alerting and reporting scheme. I have therefore concluded that the Department should cease to provide financial support for this scheme at the end of this financial year. The Department will work closely with the commercial, fishing and recreational sectors to see how confidential reporting opportunities might be provided in the future without financial assistance from Government.</p>
