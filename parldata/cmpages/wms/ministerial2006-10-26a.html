Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls):</b> The
Treasury has been working closely with the DTI and industry in
developing a regime dealing with liability in damages for damage
suffered by reliance upon certain financial disclosures to be made
under FSA disclosure rules implementing the Transparency Obligations
Directive
(2004/109/EC).</p><p><a name="06102669000015">After
the Government&#146;s decision to establish a statutory regime for
liability in damages to third parties in respect of disclosures under
the Transparency Directive, industry made representations to Government
that the establishment of this regime, added to other developments in
law and regulation, could have serious and unwanted repercussions for
issuer liability for disclosures made other than under the Transparency
Directive (for example, in response to the FSA disclosure rules). The
Government therefore consulted with key stakeholders over the summer.
Responses confirmed that, while an extension of the statutory regime
was in principle desirable, this is an extremely complex area in which
it is vital that the Government get their policy
right.</p><p><a name="06102669000016">The
consultation and Government response to this consultation can be found
at the following web

this consultation, amendments have been made at the report stage of the
Companies Bill (passed by the Commons and now in front of the Lords) to
have the following
effect:</p><a name="61026m0001.htmbrev_122"><a name="06102669000019"><ul><p class="tabletext">extend
the scope of the statutory liability regime for financial disclosures

officers;</p></ul><a name="61026m0001.htmbrev_124"><a name="06102669000021"><ul><p class="tabletext">change
the territorial coverage of the regime to ensure the liability regime
covers all issuers for whom the UK is home member state as well those
issuers for which the UK is not home member state but whose securities
are traded on a regulated market situated or operating in the UK;

markets.</p></ul><p><a name="06102669000023">In
relation to the last provision, it will be important for the Government
to be able to act quickly to resolve uncertainties in the law relating

the significance of these proposals for the future of financial markets
in the UK and the breadth of the power proposed, the affirmative
procedure has been
chosen.</p><p><a name="06102669000024"></p><p><a name="06102669000025">To
inform the Government&#146;s decision on the further changes to the
law for issuer liability, if any, are required, the Government have
decided to conduct a formal review of the liability of issuers in
respect of damage or loss suffered as a consequence of inaccurate,
false or misleading information disclosed by issuers or their
managements to financial markets (including to their own shareholders
or bondholders) or of failure to disclose relevant information promptly
or at all. This will take into account both existing regulatory
obligations and penalties, including criminal penalties, and the
potential for liability in damages under existing common law
jurisprudence. It will also need to look at the position in other EU
member states and more widely in the jurisdictions of other substantial
financial services markets. Professor Paul Davies QC, the Cassel
Professor of Commercial Law at the London School of Economics, has
agreed to conduct this review. Detailed terms of reference will be
published
shortly.</p><p><a name="06102669000026">If
the review recommends that the Government should introduce a statutory
regime for liability in damages of issuers in respect of financial
disclosures or that changes should be made to any regime that exists
following the enactment of the provisions currently in the Companies
Bill the Government will, when it publishes its response to the
review:</p><a name="61026m0001.htmbrev_126"><a name="06102669000027"><ul><p class="tabletext">consult

Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Alistair
Darling):</b> The European Commission presented in January
2006 a proposal for a directive on the exercise of voting rights by
shareholders in EU companies whose shares are traded on regulated
markets in the EU. My Department is today launching a formal
consultation on the proposal. The consultative document will be placed
in the Libraries of the House and will be available on the DTI
website.</p><p><a name="06102669000031">The
directive aims to enhance shareholder rights and corporate governance,
with the purpose of improving capital flows, lowering the cost of
equity capital, and helping to make companies more
competitive.</p><p><a name="06102669000032">This
proposal is one of the measures put forward in the Company Law Action
Plan of May 2003. The exercise of shareholder rights across borders is
important to improve governance, market confidence, and the opportunity
for cross border investment. Our objective is to agree a directive that
improves standards across the EU in such a way as to benefit both
companies and investors. Our objective for this

<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 95WS</b><br>directive is to agree an approach which improves standards across the EU
to the benefit both companies and their shareholders, without imposing
unnecessary costs or bureaucratic restrictions, and taking full
advantage of the opportunities of modern communications technology. We
believe that the right approach is to set out clear principles but to
leave flexibility in the way that individual Member States and
companies apply
them.</p><p><a name="06102669000033">The
UK has the largest and leading equity market in Europe, and the most
dispersed shareholder structure. Consequently, the regime of
shareholder rights is well developed and shareholders in UK listed
companies, whether or not they are based in the UK, face no significant
barriers to exercising their rights; but we can still improve, and it
is important that we play our part in improving the exercise of
shareholder rights across the
EU.</p><p><a name="06102669000034">The
process of voting at company general meetings differs widely across
Member States, and is often a complex procedure. It is further
complicated when shares are held across EU borders. The European
Commission believes that existing EU legislation does not deal
effectively with cross-border voting problems. We agree, and we support
the proposal for a directive in this
area.</p><p><a name="06102669000035">This
directive introduces measures to make sure that investors get the
information they need, and that they can always exercise their rights
at general meetings&#151;even when they are not able to attend it in
person, as is often the case where investors are not based in the same
EU member state as the company whose shares they hold. The consultation
that my Department is publishing today asks a wide range of questions
about the scope of the directive and suitability of the measures
proposed. We welcome views from all stakeholders with an interest in
this important
topic.</p><h4 align="center"><a name="61026m0001.htmstpa_2"><a name="06102669000009">Small Business
Support</h4><p><a name="06102669000036"><b><a name="61026m0001.htm_spnew446"><a name="06102669000078">The
Minister for Industry and the Regions (Margaret Hodge):</b>
There are now 4.3 million businesses in the United Kingdom&#151;the
highest number ever recorded. There are 600,000 more businesses, and
employment in small and medium sized enterprises has risen by over a
million since
1997.</p><p><a name="06102669000037">Our
small business sector continues to become more dynamic, and our
business environment is now one of the best in the world for starting
and growing a business. The World Bank&#146;s &#147;Doing Business
2007&#148; report ranks the UK sixth in the world, and ahead of all
other EU member states, in terms of the ease of doing
business.</p><p><a name="06102669000038">The
Government are determined that the environment for businesses and
entrepreneurs builds on this competitive edge. It is therefore vital
that Government&#151;national, regional, local&#151;understands,
and responds to, businesses&#146; needs, and takes stock of the way
we support
them.</p><p><a name="06102669000039"><i>The
Small Business
Service</i></p><p><a name="06102669000040">Six
years ago the Government established the Small Business Service (SBS)
as a dedicated team within Government on small business
issues.</p><br>

<notus-date day="26" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>26 Oct 2006 : Column 96WS</b><br><p><a name="06102669000041">The SBS is
estimated to be saving business at least &#163;85 million annually.
It has tackled a wide range of issues: reinvigorating the Enterprise
Insight campaign and firmly establishing our national Enterprise Week;
bringing together on line for business more than50 Departments
and agencies under the internationally acclaimed
www.businesslink.gov.uk portal; starting a pioneering website:
www.supply2.gov.uk&#151;to make it much easier for small businesses
to supply to the public sector; successfully launching the first phase
of Enterprise Capital Funds to help the development of high-growth
small businesses; and modernising the Small Firms Loan
Guarantee.</p><p><a name="06102669000042">It
has championed the introduction of just two annual commencement dates
for new legislation affecting business; and local Business Link
operators have doubled their customer base, and achieved high levels of
customer satisfaction which have been maintained following the
transition from national to regional
management.</p><p><a name="06102669000043">It
is essential that the SBS delivers results thatmatter to
business and keep the UK internationally competitive for business. I
have decided that the SBS should become a smaller, sharply focused
policy unit that will have close links with business and with other
parts of Government, including in particular HM Treasury. It will also
lead time-limited projects like its current business support
simplification programme. Its focus will be on the issues where
Government action can influence the business environment; and on
support for our entrepreneurs&#151;the people who make the difference
in firms large and
small.</p><p><a name="06102669000044">The
SBS will advise Ministers on enterprise policy across Government, and
on ways in which policies can be small business-friendly. It will
retain specialist expertise in key areas, including: business support
policy; small business finance; specific enterprise policy issues
including increasing entrepreneurship among women and ethnic
minorities; and research, statistics, analysis and performance
evaluation.</p><p><a name="06102669000045">On
behalf of Ministers, it will have policy responsibility for the
Government&#146;s investments in a range of business
support&#151;including Business Link, Enterprise Insight, and access
to finance funds. It will maintain its strong international links on
enterprise, especially with other EU member states and with the United
States.</p><p><a name="06102669000046">The
SBS will not deliver services&#151;support programmes should wherever
possible be run close to customers, regionally or locally&#151;and it
no longer needs the status of being a &#147;next steps&#148;
executive agency. From April 2007, it will operate as a policy unit
within the DTI&#146;s Enterprise and Business
Group.</p><p><a name="06102669000047"><i>Business
support</i></p><p><a name="06102669000048">The
current arrangements for publicly funded support schemes for businesses
in England also need to be streamlined. At present they are confusing
for business, and often not the best use of public funds. Much has
already been done within my Department and our Small Business Service
to simplify support arrangements. The number of separate schemes has
been reduced from well over a hundred to just
six.</p><p><a name="06102669000049">The
SBS will continue to lead the major programme to simplify the many
schemes and programmes that are funded elsewhere in Government, and
regionally and

from
business</i></p><p><a name="06102669000051">I
pay tribute to the unstinting advice and support that Ministers and the
Small Business Service receive from the large number of business owners
and others who give their time and advice generously. The Small
Business Council, the Ethnic Minority Business Forum and the Small
Business Investment Task Force all help to shape the
Government&#146;s thinking on business issues. It is important that
the small business voice into Government is strong and coherent, and
there is scope for the current arrangements to be simpler. I have
therefore asked the Small Business Service to work with these groups,
and with the main business representative organisations, to consider
how the voice of business people can most effectively reach into
Government in the
future.</p><p><a name="06102669000052">I

Compensation Recovery
Scheme.</p><p><a name="06102669000062"></p><p><a name="06102669000063">The
Compensation Recovery Scheme is aimed at ensuring that injured parties
are not compensated twice&#151;once through the compensation payment
they receive from the employer or insurer and again through the
benefits system. The scheme also helps ensure that compensators fulfil
their own obligations and are not subsidised by the taxpayer. Benefit
paid out for the same accident, injury or disease for which the
compensation is being made is normally recovered from the compensator
by the Department for Work and
Pensions.</p><p><a name="06102669000064"></p><p><a name="06102669000065">Federal
Mogul has become insolvent under the United States of America&#146;s
insolvency legislation. As a result of this it is not in a position to
meet, in full, its liabilities to its employees arising from asbestos
related diseases. A trust fund has been set up to meet part of these
liabilities. However, employees are only likely to receive around
twenty pence of every one pound they are due. The unprecedented step to
exempt this particular trust recognises the unique position in which
former employees of Federal Mogul&#146;s UK subsidiaries (Turner
&amp; Newall and associated companies) have found
themselves.</p><p><a name="06102669000066"></p><p><a name="06102669000067">Exempting
the trust from the normal compensation recovery rules means that more
money will be available to meet the needs of the victims and their
families who have been affected by these diseases. All the funds in the
trust will be available for compensation payments on top of benefits
paid&#151;we feel it is important to ensure that their already
reduced compensation payments are not reduced further. The cost to the
Government is estimated to be &#163;10 million over the next three
years.</p><p><a name="06102669000068"></p><p><a name="06102669000069">These
