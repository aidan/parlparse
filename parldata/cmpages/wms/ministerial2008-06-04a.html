 The Minister for Science and Innovation, my hon.

Our approach has been to fund the new activities proposed in the PwC report through savings released through efficiency gains in other areas of the Commission&#146;s work. We have worked with the RCEP to identify areas where RCEP could make such savings which include:</p>

The realisation of these savings, and hence the implementation of the review recommendations, will clearly depend on RCEP achieving value for money with regard to the way it uses its resources.</p>
