Minister for Housing and Planning (Yvette Cooper):</b> During
the passage of the 2004 Housing Bill the Government made commitments to
consider whether it is possible to devise an approach to overcrowding
that provides for some incremental improvement in standards over a
period; and to consult on how the new section 216 powers could be used
to amend the statutory overcrowding standards in Part X of the Housing
Act
1985.</p><p><a name="06071465000025">The
Government are today publishing a discussion document on
&#147;Tackling Overcrowding in England&#148; which sets out options
for revising the outdated definition of overcrowding and developing
long-term solutions. This document is designed to stimulate and garner
ideas about how best we can tackle the problems of overcrowding. DCLG
officials will be actively engaging stakeholders in discussions, which
will conclude on 15 September 2006. Copies of the document have been
placed in the Libraries of both
Houses.</p><p><a name="06071465000026">The
Government are also providing a &#163;51 million package for tackling
overcrowding and increasing the number of settled homes for people in
temporary accommodation. The funding announced today is focused on two
key
areas:</p><p><a name="06071465000027">&#163;21
million will be made available for immediate action to tackle
overcrowding, by increasing the supply of family homes in London. This
could include converting existing homes to create extra bedrooms;
adding extensions to existing council stock; building or purchasing
additional homes, or buying back right to buy homes. Five coordinators
will also be funded to work across London to tackle the most immediate
problems of
overcrowding.</p><p><a name="06071465000028">Some
&#163;30 million will also be provided to fund an extra home pilot,
which could help to deliver up to an extra 1,000 settled homes for
families who are currently in temporary
accommodation.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06071465000003">Defence</h3><h4 align="center"><a name="06071465000011">Annual

Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne):</b> I am pleased
to announce that I am today publishing the Ministry of Defence's Annual
Report and Accounts 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 82WS</b><br>2005-06. It combines the Department's Annual Performance Report and
Departmental Resource Accounts in a single document that provides a
comprehensive overview of the MOD's financial and non-financial
performance. For a third successive year the Comptroller and Auditor
General has approved the accounts without qualification. For the first
time, this year we have achieved this in time for publication before
the summer
recess.</p><p><a name="06071465000031">The
report shows that once again the Armed Forces and the Ministry of
Defence delivered what they were required to do during a busy and
challenging year. It reflects the broad and diverse range of operations
and tasks undertaken during the year, including a number in support of
the output of other Government Departments. It details the progress the
Ministry of Defence has made towards achieving the Public Service
Agreement and efficiency targets agreed with Her Majesty's Treasury in
the 2004 Spending Review, and in delivering the capabilities and
reformed force structure set out in the July 2004 Command Paper
&#147;Delivering Security in the Changing World: Future
Capabilities&#148;. It also sets out the defence contribution against
the Government's wider sustainability
goals.</p><p><a name="06071465000033">Copies

Ship Dock
(Auxiliary)</h4><p><a name="06071465000035"><b><a name="06071465000175">The
Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne):</b> My noble
Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State and Minister for
Defence Procurement (Lord Drayson) has made the following written
ministerial
statement.</p><a name="06071465000036"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I
wish to inform the House of developments in the Landing Ship Dock
(Auxiliary) (LSD(A)) programme. The Ministry of Defence has reached a
full and final settlement for the closure, by mutual agreement, of its
contract with Swan Hunter (Tyneside) Limited in Newcastle for the
design and construction of two of the
vessels.</p></ul><a name="06071465000037"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
programme is to deliver a new class of Landing Ship Dock (Auxiliary) to
replace the ageing Landing Ship Logistic, used to deploy Amphibious
Task Groups, vehicles and equipment directly into potentially hostile
operational areas. Beyond their primary role to support amphibious
operations, the vessels will provide wider support to joint operations
by providing strategic sealift at high readiness, support to
humanitarian and peace keeping operations and sea based support to
deployed land formations. The total programme is for four vessels, two
designed and constructed by Swan Hunter with a further two built by BAE
SYSTEMS.</p></ul><a name="06071465000038"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
LSD(A) programme is well advanced. RFA MOUNTS BAY, the first ship built
by BAE SYSTEMS, has completed Sea Trials and been accepted by MOD.
CARDIGAN BAY, the second BAE SYSTEMS ship, is due to be accepted in
August. LARGS BAY, the first of the Swan Hunter vessels, was accepted
off contract in April but this was over two years later than the
original contract schedule. Initial indications are that the vessels
will deliver excellent capability once in
service.</p></ul><a name="06071465000039"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
major programme issue has been, however, the poor performance and cost
growth at Swan Hunter, which has also impacted on the costs of the
ships being built by BAE SYSTEMS. Swan Hunter were awarded the LSD(A)
contract in December 2000. It subsequently became apparent that Swan
Hunter had underestimated the complexity of the 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 83WS</b><br>programme and were unable to control costs effectively and, in
December 2004, the contract value was uplifted by &#163;84
million. Swan Hunter was also expected to improve their management
performance. However, costs have continued to rise and this funding has
been consumed without LYME BAY, the second Swan Hunter ship being
completed.</p></ul><a name="06071465000040"><ul><p class="tabletext">Although
the construction of LYME BAY is well advanced, we cannot predict her
acceptance date nor her cost to completion with any confidence in the
current contractual arrangements. Sustaining the current contract with
Swan Hunter no longer provides value for money for the taxpayer, and to
continue would be likely to lead to more delay and further cost
overrun.</p></ul><a name="06071465000041"><ul><p class="tabletext">It
has therefore been mutually agreed with the management of Swan Hunter
that the contract should be closed. BAE SYSTEMS will instead provide
Lead Yard Services and Design Authority until completion of the
programme and will complete the construction of LYME BAY at Govan on
the Clyde. There has been significant cost escalation on this programme
and we now expect the revised combined contract values to be
approximately &#163;600 million. The details of the commercial
agreements currently remain confidential, but the relevant cost data
will be released once it is possible to do so. The new arrangements
bring far more certainty to the programme, both in cost and
timescales.</p></ul><a name="06071465000042"><ul><p class="tabletext">Our
priority has always been effective delivery of the required military
capability, which we have attempted to achieve through successful
completion of the contract with Swan Hunter. The company has been given
every encouragement and opportunity to succeed, through additional
funding and time. While the workforce itself has performed well, with
excellent workmanship, we no longer have adequate confidence in the
company's ability to complete the contract within an acceptable
timescale or cost. We therefore have no choice left. It would be
fundamentally incompatible with our obligations to the taxpayer, or
indeed the principles of the Defence Industrial Strategy, for us to
continue with this state of
affairs.</p></ul><a name="06071465000043"><ul><p class="tabletext">We
will be doing what we can to minimise the impact of this decision on
the region. Discussions are underway with the Trade Unions, local MPs,
and others regarding the way ahead. The Ministry of Defence is also
working with the Department of Trade and Industry and the Regional
Development Agency, One North East, to identify opportunities for the
workforce including the apprentices currently employed within the
company. We expect that a number of the main sub-contractors will be
re-employed by BAE SYSTEMS to complete CARDIGAN BAY and LYME
BAY.</p></ul><a name="06071465000044"><ul><p class="tabletext">While
the need for this decision has been unwelcome, we now look forward to
introducing all four ships to service and providing our Armed Forces
with the high level of capability and support they have the right to
expect&#148;.</p></ul><h4 align="center"><a name="06071465000013">Porton
Down</h4><p><a name="06071465000045"><b><a name="06071465000176">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. Tom
Watson):</b> On 21 November 2000 the then Minister for
Veterans Affairs (Dr Lewis Moonie) announced a package of measures
intended to address emerging concerns that some Porton Down Volunteers
might have suffered unusual ill health because of their participation
in trials at the Chemical Defence Establishment, Porton Down. The
Ministry of Defence (MOD) has sought to address these concerns through
a number of measures. These include a Historical Survey of the Porton
Down Service Volunteer Programme 1939-1989 (the period of most interest
to volunteers) which is published today. It sets out a full description
of the size and shape of the studies in which volunteers took part, and
explores their ethical aspects. Also, the 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 84WS</b><br>MOD is funding an independently run epidemiological study, overseen by
the Medical Research Council, to assess the incidence of cancer and
mortality among former Porton Down volunteers. The study is expected to
report in 2007 and it is hoped that the results will be published in
peer reviewed literature shortly
thereafter.</p><p><a name="06071465000047">Copies
of the Historical Survey will be placed in the Library of the House and
it will also be available on the MOD website
at:</p><p><a name="06071465000048">http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/Issues/PortonDownHistoricalSurvey.htm.</p><p><a name="06071465000049">The
Survey has been conducted by MOD officials who had no previous
professional contact with Porton Down. No member of Porton Down staff
was involved in determining the ground the survey should cover or the
documents which were to be consulted. Porton Down's advice has been
sought in order to clarify explanations of scientific matters (for
example, the effect of agents and treatments on physiology and the
metrics used to measure doses and exposures). They have not had any
further editorial
involvement.</p><p><a name="06071465000051">I
would like to place on record my deep appreciation of Professor Sir Ian
Kennedy's contribution as the independent supervisor to this project. I
know that
the</p><p><a name="06071465000052">survey team
appreciated his valuable guidance. Sir lan's assessment of Porton
Down's conduct appears at the end of the survey. It draws on the
descriptions ofthe trials conducted by the Chemical Defence
Establishment, the information presented on how service volunteers were
recruited, and on Dr Alasdair Maclean's analysis of ethics
codes/guidelines and practice. No attempt has been made by the MOD to
summarise Sir lan's assessment, to avoid any inadvertent changes in
meaning or
language.</p><p><a name="06071465000054">Sir
Ian identifies a small number of trials spread over several decades
which he considers amount to serious departures from what should have
been done. However, he is clear that they are few in number. Sir Ian
also warns that these studies must be viewed in the historical context
of both the Second World War and the Cold War. The MOD welcomes Sir
lan's view that &#145;a very great debt of gratitude is clearly owed
to those who volunteered to take part in the research at Porton and to
those who carried it
out'.</p><p><a name="06071465000056">The
MOD takes the health of veterans very seriously indeed. We are seeking
to address the concerns of former volunteers who are worried about
their health and it is for this reason that the MOD established an
independent Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) at St Thomas' Hospital
in London. Attendance at the MAP is free of charge but is conditional
on the provision of details of participation in the Porton Down Service
Volunteer Programme and access to individual NHS medical records. If
volunteers have concerns about their health and are interested in
attending the MAP they should contact Porton Down on their Helpline
number (0800 7832521) in order to obtain their records of attendance.
Volunteers also have the opportunity to inspect their own records
relating to the trials in which they took part at Porton Down.
Alternatively, they can contact the MAP direct on the MAP Helpline 0800
169 5401 or ask their GP for a referral. The MOD welcomes the
publication of this Historical Survey today as being complementary to
these existing resources.</p><br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 85WS</b><br><h4 align="center"><a name="06071465000014">UK Gulf Veterans' Mortality
Data</h4><p><a name="06071465000057"><b><a name="06071465000177">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. Tom
Watson):</b> As part of the Government's continuing commitment
to investigate Gulf veterans' illnesses openly and honestly, data on
the mortality of veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict are published
regularly. The most recent figures for the period 1 April 1991 to 30
June 2006, are published today as a national statistic on the Defence
Analytical Services Agency
website.</p><p><a name="06071465000059">The
data for Gulf veterans are compared to that of a control group known as
the 'Era cohort' consisting of armed forces personnel of a similar
profile in terms of gender, service, regular/reservists status and
rank, who were in service on 1 January 1991 but were not deployed to
the Gulf. As in the previous release, the &#145;Era' group has been
adjusted for a small difference in the age-profile of those aged 40
years and over, to ensure appropriate
comparisons.</p><p><a name="06071465000060">Key
points to note in the data
are:</p><a name="06071465000062"><ul><p class="tabletext">There
have been 784 deaths among the Gulf veterans and 796 in the
age-adjusted Era comparison
group.</p></ul><a name="06071465000063"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
784 deaths among Gulf veterans compare with approximately 1,265 deaths
which would have been expected in a similar sized cohort taken from the
general population of the UK with the same age and gender profile. This
reflects the strong emphasis on fitness when recruiting and retaining
service
personnel.</p></ul><p><a name="06071465000065">These
statistics continue to confirm that UK veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf
conflict do not suffer an excess of overall mortality compared with
service personnel who did not
deploy.</p><p><a name="06071465000066">The

Commissioning Framework&#148; and &#147;A Stronger Local
Voice&#148;, which sets out the Government's plans for the future
arrangements to support public involvement in health and social
care.</p><p><a name="06071465000117">The
update on health reform sets out a clear vision: to develop a
patient-led NHS that uses available resources as effectively and fairly
as possible to promote health, reduce health inequalities and deliver
the best and safest possible
healthcare.</p><p><a name="06071465000119">The
centrepiece of the update publication is a framework for commissioning.
It will act as a manual for new primary care trusts to achieve
excellence in the way they secure healthcare for their local
people.</p><p><a name="06071465000121">Commissioning
is the means by which we secure the best possible healthcare
and outcomes, including reduced health inequalities, within the money
made available by the taxpayer. Commissioning itself
is not 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 89WS</b><br>new, but stronger primary care trusts and the acceleration of
practice-based commissioning&#151;together with the powerful new set
of incentives and mechanisms introduced by the health
reforms&#151;provide the opportunity for far more effective
commissioning that will benefit patients and taxpayers
alike.</p><p><a name="06071465000122">Effective
commissioning will
require:</p><p><a name="06071465000124">Real
community engagement and stronger voice for patients achieved through
increased choice, widespread involvement and greater opportunity to
influence changes to
services:</p><a name="06071465000125"><ul><p class="tabletext">clinical
engagement through practice-based commissioning;</p></ul><a name="06071465000126"><ul><p class="tabletext">improved information to support
commissioning;
and</p></ul><a name="06071465000127"><ul><p class="tabletext">commissioning
levers through choice, payment by results and robust
contracts.</p></ul><p><a name="06071465000129">The
reorganisation of PCTs, the moves towards universal coverage of
practice-based commissioning, and the establishment of the specialist
commissioning groups will provide the basic architecture for
commissioning NHS
services.</p><p><a name="06071465000131">The
Department of Health will be seeking views from the NHS and partner
organisations over the summer on the key proposals to inform final
decisions. Views are sought on options for contracting in the NHS, a
governance and accountability framework for practice-based
commissioning and triggers for
petitions.</p><p><a name="06071465000133">The
framework sets out the development programmes we are making available
to all PCTs as they build on the good commissioning practice that
already exists. We also issued yesterday an OJEU notice to procure a
framework agreement and call-off contract which will enable PCTs to
draw on private sector expertise to support their commissioning. This
does not in any way affect or relate to PCT directly provided services.
PCT Boards will be entirely free to choose to what extent, if any, they
make use of the call-off contract. In all cases the PCT board remains
accountable and responsible for all commissioning
decisions.</p><p><a name="06071465000135">This
commissioning framework focuses on commissioning NHS services, and in
particular commissioning hospital services. This is the first step in
making commissioning truly effective. We know that joint commissioning
of services with local authorities and commissioning for health and
well-being are important too. A second framework covering these wider
issues will be published in
December.</p><p><a name="06071465000137">The
commissioning framework is supported by an update on the other elements
of the reform programme: choice, provider reform, workforce, system
management, tariff and other financial incentives and
information.</p><p><a name="06071465000139">Effective
commissioning will require real community engagement. The commissioning
framework will therefore work alongside &#147;A Stronger Local
Voice&#148;, which sets out the Government's plans for the future
arrangements to support public involvement in health and social
care.</p><p><a name="06071465000141">These
include plans to build on patient and public involvement forums through
the creation of local involvement networks (LINks). The networks will
provide a flexible vehicle for communities and groups to engage with
health and social care organisations, 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 90WS</b><br>and will promote public accountability in health and social
care through open and transparent communication with commissioners and
providers.</p><p><a name="06071465000143">We
also plan to simplify and strengthen the legislative requirements
currently set out in Section 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001,
to clarify the duties on all NHS bodies to involve and consult patients
and the public on all services they provide or commission. There will
be a new duty placed on commissioners to respond to what patients and
the public have
said.</p><p><a name="06071465000145">I
believe that the new environment being created by the reforms, using
incentives and commissioning, will mean that commissioners become
advocates for patients and taxpayers, driving up the quality, fairness,
responsiveness and value for money of NHS
services.</p><p><a name="06071465000146">Copies

Regulation</h4><p><a name="06071465000147"><b><a name="06071465000182">The
Secretary of State for Health (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</b> The
Shipman Inquiry, chaired by Dame Janet Smith, examined the
circumstances surrounding the murders of some 250 patients by Dr.
Harold Shipman, a general
practitioner.</p><p><a name="06071465000149">Following
the publication of &#147;The Shipman Inquiry: Fifth Report&#148; in
December 2004, which was highly critical of the General Medical Council
and the broader arrangements for medical regulation, my noble Friend
The Minister of State, Lord Warner commissioned a review. Shortly
thereafter, the Department of Health elected to conduct a parallel
review of the arrangements in place for the regulation of the other
healthcare professions in order to provide consistency of approach and
in recognition of the blurring of traditional job roles in
healthcare.</p><p><a name="06071465000151">The
review of medical regulation was conducted by Sir Liam Donaldson, Chief
Medical Officer for England. His report, &#147;Good Doctors, Safer
Patients&#148; is published today, along with the parallel
departmental review of non-medical regulation. Both reports focus upon
the protection of the interests and safety of
patients.</p><p><a name="06071465000153">&#147;Good
Doctors, Safer Patients&#148; is a rigorous and thorough report,
taking into account systems of regulation in other high-risk
industries, systems in operation in other jurisdictions and the views
of the profession and the public. It is the first comprehensive review
of medical regulation for over 30 years. There are 44 recommendations.
The parallel review of non-medical regulation followed a similar
process.</p><p><a name="06071465000155">Among
the key themes raised in the two reports are: changes to the governance
and accountability of the professional regulators; the importance of
operationalised standards against which to regulate; the appropriate
legal standard of proof; the introduction of an independent
adjudicator; a spectrum of revalidation across all clinical
professions; and, devolution of some regulatory powers to the local
level.</p><p><a name="06071465000157">Professional
regulation is a complex area. I very much welcome the publication of
these reports and the authoritative contribution that they
make.</p><br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 91WS</b><br><p><a name="06071465000159">Today, I am

Westminster, comments on the reports are invited on a UK wide basis.

Government announced that they agreed with the Low Pay Commission's
recommendation that the accommodation offset should apply in all
situations, but believed that legislative measures were not required.
