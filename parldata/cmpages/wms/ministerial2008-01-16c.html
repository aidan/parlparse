The overall package ensures an environmentally effective scheme, most notably by ensuring that the emissions cap has been set at the average of 2004-6 emissions, in line with UK ambition. The package agreed at Council also includes: a 2012 start date in one phase; 10 per cent. auctioning for 2012, with the figure for 2013 onwards to be decided as part of the review of the EU ETS; and a de minimis clause that applies only to commercial air transport operators. The UK supports the agreement reached.</p>

Several member states (including the UK) did not consider that the changes went far enough to resolve outstanding concerns, notably in relation to provisions on contaminated land and soil sealing, or to bring the proposals into line with the principles of better regulation and subsidiarity. The UK nevertheless made it clear that it remained supportive of the aims of the Commission&#146;s thematic strategy for the protection of soil and of the need for all member states to take action to improve efforts to preserve this vital natural resource.</p>

 The organ donation taskforce has today presented a report making a number of recommendations to increase organ donation rates in the UK. The recommendations largely concentrate on the infrastructure required in order to enable the UK to maximise its potential for organ donation rates. The taskforce believes that if implemented in full, a 50 per cent. increase in donation rates is achievable over five years.</p>

<p><a name="st_91"><a name="08011696000015"><a name="80116m0001.htm_spmin2"><a name="08011696000063"><b>The Leader of the House of Commons (Ms Harriet Harman):</b>
 The 2007 Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB) Triennial Review of Parliamentary Pay, Pensions and Allowances was published today. The Government have considered the SSRB report and will today table motions that will be debated in the House on 24 January. The Commons will debate and vote on resolutions to express their views. Final implementation of any opinion on pay is dependent on the Common&#146;s agreement to an additional resolution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="80116m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08011696000016">This debate and decision will take place in the context of the current public sector pay policy. MPs and Ministers are paid by the public purse. The Government have committed to ensuring that public sector pay awards remain consistent with the continued achievement of the inflation target of 2 per cent. The Government believe that the principles that apply to public sector pay deals should also apply to MPs to entrench economic stability by holding down inflationary expectations and helping to maintain the economic stability we have seen over the past decade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="80116m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08011696000017">This statement sets out a summary of the Government&#146;s position, which proposes that changes to MPs&#146; pay and pensions are consistent with the outcomes sought elsewhere in the public sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="80116m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08011696000018">The Government believe that there should be a clear, transparent and independent mechanism for setting the pay and pension of MPs. It is inappropriate that MPs should vote on their own pay and pensions. The Government therefore intend to examine options that find objective criteria for determining the appropriate comparator used for MPs&#146; pay awards within a framework that does not require MPs to vote in future years, and accordingly has asked Sir John Baker, CBE&#151;the retiring chair of SSRB&#151;to conduct a review and make proposals on options for consideration. It would be a significant constitutional reform for MPs to be explicitly removed from the process of voting on and determining their own pay and pensions. In some other countries, elected representatives&#146; pay and pensions are determined entirely independently of the legislature. We hope to draw on this international experience so as to find a suitable mechanism that will work within our parliamentary system. We intend this work to be completed so that the House can resolve it before the summer recess.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="80116m0001.htm_para7"><a name="08011696000019">The Government are tabling a motion in relation to MPs&#146; pay for the year 2007-08 and seeking the House&#146;s support for Sir John Baker&#146;s review. There will be separate motions on pensions and allowances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="80116m0001.htm_para22"><a name="08011696000042">SSRB makes a number of recommendations aimed at limiting the cost to the taxpayer of Parliamentary pensions. These include the 50:50 sharing between Members and the Exchequer of future increases or decreases in pension cost pressures, and restricting the underlying Exchequer contribution to the scheme, other than in respect of the deficit identified at the last valuation, to a maximum of 20 per cent. of payroll. The SSRB also recommends that there should be a review of parliamentary pension provision if the costs are rising significantly such that the 20 per cent. cap on the Exchequer contribution is likely to be breached. These recommendations are consistent with the approach being taken in public service pension schemes generally and the Government accept them. The Government propose that the detail of the arrangements should be worked up in consultation with the trustees of the parliamentary pension scheme so that it can be taken into account by the Government Actuary in his 2008 valuation of the scheme.</p>

The Government accept this recommendation with respect to Prime Ministers and Lord Chancellors. The Government do not propose to implement this recommendation with respect to future Commons Speakers, as they consider the position of Speaker to be substantially different from that of a Prime Minister or Lord Chancellor.</p>
