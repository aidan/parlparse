Ministers from the previous Administration agreed a comprehensive package of measures including a European financial stabilisation mechanism of up to €500 billion with parallel support from the IMF. Ministers also expressed a strong commitment to ensuring fiscal sustainability and enhanced economic growth in all member states, and agreed that plans for fiscal consolidation and structural reforms would be accelerated, where warranted. They underlined the need to make rapid progress on financial market regulation and supervision, particularly in derivative markets and on the role of credit rating agencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="100603m0001.htm_para9"><a name="10060337000020">As a follow up to the extraordinary meeting, Ministers took note of additional consolidation measures outlined by Spain and Portugal in their 2010 and 2011 budgets. The Commission will evaluate these measures in June within the framework of the excessive deficit procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="100603m0001.htm_para10"><a name="10060337000021"><i>Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFM) Directive</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="100603m0001.htm_para11"><a name="10060337000022">ECOFIN reached a political agreement on the AIFM directive to establish a framework for monitoring the risks posed by alternative investment funds while allowing fund managers to market their funds throughout the EU single market. In a statement in the minutes of the Council, the Council notes the concerns expressed by some member states on certain aspects of the presidency's proposed general approach, in particular as regards to the third-country provisions. It invites the presidency  to start negotiations with the European Parliament on the basis of this general approach, taking into account the concerns expressed by member states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="100603m0001.htm_para12"><a name="10060337000023"><i>Draft 2011 budget</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="100603m0001.htm_para13"><a name="10060337000024">The Commission presented its draft 2011 budget, including a total of €142.6 billion in commitment appropriations (+0.8% compared with 2010) and €130.1 billion in payment appropriations (+5.8% compared with 2010). For many member states, the EU has agreed that national budgets should be cut to meet consolidation targets and bring deficits under control. The Government believe that the proposed increases in the EU budget must therefore be reduced and a freeze in spending should be considered before the UK can give its agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="100603m0001.htm_para14"><a name="10060337000025"><i>Economic policy guidelines</i></p>

The draft recommendation, together with a draft decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the member states, forms integrated guidelines setting a framework for structural reforms to be carried out by the member states. These will return to ECOFIN in June for agreement before being endorsed by the European Council on 17 June.</p>

This formed the basis for further discussions at an EU task force chaired by President Van Rompuy on 21 May, where representatives from the 27 member states discussed the measures needed for an improved crisis resolution framework and better budgetary discipline in the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="100603m0001.htm_para18"><a name="10060337000029">The Government agree that one of the key lessons of the crisis is that ex ante surveillance of economies needs to be improved at both the domestic and European level. As a single market, co-operation and co-ordination must be maintained among all member states. The Government will be an active participant in this debate but have made it clear that when it comes to national budgets, the first port of call is not the Commission but national Parliaments.</p>

10 years; and in particular, the employment guidelines and social inclusion target. Her Majesty's Government are still considering the proposals for a Europe 2020 strategy but there are some significant reservations about the implications of the proposals, including the balance of competence between member states and the European Union.

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="100603m0001.htm_para31"><a name="10060337000043">The presidency also will seek political agreement on a proposal for a Council decision on the position to be taken by the Community within the Association Councils established by the agreements with Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Israel. The UK is not opted in to these decisions which cover social security provisions with the six countries. We have significant concerns that the proposal goes beyond the original provisions and extends social security coverage in a way we find unacceptable. I intend to make a brief intervention at the Council which reiterates the UK concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="100603m0001.htm_para32"><a name="10060337000044">The presidency also will seek four sets of Council conclusions-on adequate pensions and social inclusion; new skills for new jobs; advancing Roma inclusion; and active ageing-and a Council resolution on a new European disability framework for adoption.

The Italians will raise also, as an information point, their ideas on simplifying the delivery rules of the European social fund (ESF). There also will be information on conferences held under the Spanish presidency and a presentation by the incoming Belgian presidency.</p>
