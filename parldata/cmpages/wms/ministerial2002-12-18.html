<a name="21218m01.html_spmin0"><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Mr. Elliot Morley): </B> 
 From 1 January 1999 all British registered fishing vessels over 10 metres in length and catching more than 2 tonnes of quota stocks have had to demonstrate an economic link with fisheries-dependent communities in the United Kingdom. This link can be demonstrated in a number of ways, for example by vessels landing at least 50 per cent. by weight of their quota catch into the UK or by employing a crew of whom at least 50 per cent. are normally resident in a UK coastal area.
<P>

<a name="21218m01.html_para0">In 2001, 1,438 vessels caught more than 2 tonnes of quota stocks and in each case achieved a satisfactory economic link, primarily through landings into the UK. The arrangements have resulted in UK-registered but foreign-owned vessels continuing to land and incur expenditure at UK ports. Additionally some 500 tonnes of quota was made available for re-distribution to the UK fleet.
<P>

<a name="21218m01.html_para1">A full report by the Fisheries Departments in the United Kingdom on the operation of the economic link measures in 2001 and their impact has been placed in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21218m01.html_spmin1"><B>The Secretary of State for Education and Skills   (Mr. Charles Clarke): </B> 
 Today we are publishing our National Languages Strategy.
<P>

<a name="21218m01.html_para2">To date the focus for language learning has been targeted at secondary schools, when for many it is too late to excite and motivate the desire to learn another language This has resulted in a declining number of people post-16 studying languages and a shortage in the number of language teachers at both primary and secondary level.
<P>

<a name="21218m01.html_para3">We want to increase flexibility in the curriculum at Key Stage 4 to give pupils the opportunity to pursue additional vocational routes, and therefore we have decided that Modern Foreign Languages should be an entitlement at Key Stage 4 and not a compulsory subject. We must recognise that our current system is not delivering the language learning system that is required in the 21st Century. It is our responsibility as a government to take steps to reverse this trend and re-build the capacity to deliver language learning at all levels, starting in primary schools and continuing to adult learning.




<P>
<P>18 Dec 2002 : Column 52WS<P>

<P>

<a name="21218m01.html_para4">The strategy that we are publishing today looks beyond the classroom in order to maximise and promote language learning opportunities. Our strategy will be geared towards both motivating individuals to learn&#151;the push factor&#151;while at the same time ensuring that high quality and appropriate opportunities are available&#151;the pull factor. Creating the appetite for learning while at the same time broadening and enriching the options available, are the two key planks of our languages strategy.
<P>

<a name="21218m01.html_para5">The starting point of this strategy is to provide a flexible system of language learning for all, to develop the capacity of the system so that every pupil at Key Stage 2 has the opportunity to study at least one foreign language by the end of this decade, and ensure that language learning has a key place in the transformed secondary school of the future.
<P>

<a name="21218m01.html_para6">Our strategy therefore has three overarching objectives: to improve teaching and learning of languages, including delivering an entitlement to language learning for Key Stage 2 pupils by 2010, making the most of e-learning and ensuring that opportunity to learn languages has a key place in the transformed secondary school of the future; to introduce a national, voluntary recognition system, to complement existing qualification frameworks and give people credit for their language skills; and to increase the number of people studying languages in further and higher education and in work-based training by stimulating demand for language learning, developing Virtual Language Communities and encouraging employers to play their part in supporting language learning.
<P>

<a name="21218m01.html_para7">We face a number of challenges, but we are committed to improving language learning. Our strategy proposes a number of measures to address these issues.
<P>

<a name="21218m01.html_para8">First, we recognise that there is a shortage of modern foreign language teachers at secondary level, and relatively few primary teachers have been trained to teach languages. We will work with the Teacher Training Agency, with teachers and with other professionals and language experts to build a new pool of primary language teachers and other language specialists who can support language learning.
<P>

<a name="21218m01.html_para9">But we must also recognise that our strategy alone is not enough to deliver our ambitions. We will extend and revitalise the Language Assistants programme and there will be more opportunities and incentives for language undergraduates to work in schools. But even this is not enough. We must, and we will, draw on the diversity of skills of language speakers within the community and other education institutions. We will do this by providing a short XTeaching a Foreign Language" qualification, to give people the additional teaching skills and recognition to work with teachers in the classroom.
<P>

<a name="21218m01.html_para10">Secondly, there is little provision that targets individual learners, enabling them to learn at their own pace, and few opportunities for recognition at various stages of their learning either in school, further education, higher education or the workplace. We will introduce a new voluntary recognition system to 



<P>
<P>18 Dec 2002 : Column 53WS<P>
complement existing national qualification frameworks and the Common European Framework. This will give people credit for their existing as well as newly-acquired language skills and form a ladder of recognition from beginner level to a standard which sits alongside GCSE, A level and NVQ national qualifications.
<P>

<a name="21218m01.html_para11">Thirdly, we are aware that too many schools and teachers are working in isolation, without access to support networks. LEAs will have a key role to play in supporting schools in the implementation of the strategy. We propose that LEAs should be the co-ordinators of primary language learning programmes, ensuring that every primary school has a language co-ordinator and that by the end of the decade every Key Stage 2 pupil is offered the opportunity to study at least one foreign language.
<P>

<a name="21218m01.html_para12">LEAs will provide expertise, commitment and a strong co-ordinating role drawing together headteachers; local Specialist Language Colleges; the Centre for Information on Language Teaching and Research (CILT) Comenius Centre networks; other schools with language strengths; Higher Education Institutions; business; and language speakers within the community and other education institutions.
<P>

<a name="21218m01.html_para13">Finally, we acknowledge that whilst more schools are using ICT in language teaching, its use is underdeveloped in over three-quarters of primary schools and a third of secondary schools. We will continue to work with public and private sector providers to raise the quality and widen the range of online teaching and learning materials. We are determined to make the most of opportunities to collaborate with other countries by looking at how twinning can add to the learning experience.
<P>

<a name="21218m01.html_para14">We will appoint a National Director for Languages to champion language learning and drive forward our strategy which will run alongside the Government's overall Primary Strategy to raise standards of literacy and numeracy in primary schools.
<P>

<a name="21218m01.html_para15">Our strategy will be supported by direct investment, which will rise to #10 million per year by 2005&#150;06. It will also benefit from our broader programmes to support the school workforce, invest in school improvement, and raise standards of teaching and learning, and from programmes managed by our key partners.
<P>

<a name="21218m01.html_para16">Languages should take their proper place at the heart of initiatives and activities to further the wider social, economic and political agenda. To do this we must recognise the limitations of the current system and build the capacity to deliver a more flexible, responsive system of learning which embeds learning in primary schools and provides provision tailored to the needs of individuals of all ages, throughout their lives.

 To provide regular external scrutiny of youth offending teams (Yots) a new joint inspection programme has been developed by Her Majesty's Inspectorates of Probation, Constabulary and Prisons, the Social Services Inspectorate (England and Wales) and the education inspectorates, (OFSTED for England and ESTYN for Wales) in consultation with the Home Office and the Youth Justice Board.

<a name="21218m01.html_para18">It will assess the impact Yots and partner organisations have on offending, help to improve their performance and inform the further development of the YJB's effective practice and quality assurance strategy.

<a name="21218m01.html_para19">Led by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation, the inspection team will include representatives from the full range of inspectorates concerned with Yots' work. They will aim to inspect all Yots in England and Wales over a five to six year cycle.

 I have considered the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee's (DPTAC) recommendations on the scheme which were based on the responses to the discussion paper circulated to key disability organisations and others earlier this year. I have also discussed those recommendations with my colleagues in the devolved administrations and the Northern Ireland Office who have responsibility for the Scheme.
<P>

<a name="21218m02.html_para0">We are proposing to take forward most of the recommendations that were made. A summary of our responses on each of the recommendations has been placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="21218m02.html_para1">There are a number of areas in which we have undertaken to look at amending primary legislation, in particular to ensure that the tools needed for effective enforcement are available to local authorities and the police. We will be seeking opportunities to introduce those changes as soon as possible.

<P>

<a name="21218m02.html_para2">We recognise the need to ensure that badges are only issued to those who most need them but we are not yet convinced that criteria for eligibility need to be restricted by law. With the devolved administrations and the Northern Ireland Office, we would prefer to see much clearer and stronger guidance issued to local authorities, as the issuing bodies, on how they should undertake that function. If, after a period of monitoring the impact of that guidance, it is clear that there are still problems with the policy on issuing, we would consider legislation at that stage. We will, in co-operation with the devolved administrations, be setting up a working group shortly to help us draw up common guidance that each administration will use.
<P>

<a name="21218m02.html_para3">Further research is required in a number of areas, for example, to consider the setting up of a national database of badge holders. My Department will be taking that forward, in collaboration with the devolved administrations and the Northern Ireland Office, as part of our research programme.

 The Stage 1 Report of the Quinquennial Review (QQR) of the Defence Intelligence and Security Centre (DISC) Defence Agency has today been published and copies of the report placed in the Libraries of the House.




<P>
<P>18 Dec 2002 : Column 58WS<P>

<P>

<a name="21218m02.html_para22">I announced terms of reference for Stage 1 of this review in the reply I gave on 20 July 2001 (<i>Official Report</i>, column 710W) to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow Maryhill (Ms McKechin).
<P>

<a name="21218m02.html_para23">In line with central guidance on QQRs, the principal question addressed during Stage 1 has been whether the Ministry of Defence continues to require an in-house intelligence and security training capability The clear conclusion from Stage 1 is that the provision of defence intelligence and security training is essential; the events of September 11 and subsequent operational activity has confirmed this. Following careful analysis of the current arrangements for delivering this training and taking into account the requirements and views of training sponsors and customers, it is clear that the DISC remains a cost effective means of delivering this function.
<P>

<a name="21218m02.html_para24">The study concluded that the Agency performs this function well, but identified two issues that have reduced its overall effectiveness. These relate to the dual role of the Chief Executive (who is also Director of the (Army) Intelligence Corps) and to a lack of clarity around the margins of the Agency's function concerning the provision of operational manpower and of policy type advice. The study has clarified that the core role of the DISC should be the provision of intelligence and security training The QQR team addressed this in its Stage 2 work and identified a range of specific solutions to these issues.
<P>

<a name="21218m02.html_para25">In relation to the issue of dual-hatting, the Agency's Owner has already taken steps to mitigate diversion of the Chief Executive's (CE) efforts. A separate study has been commissioned to review the Command and Control arrangements for the DISC and for Intelligence Corps units, and to develop a framework for the command and control of the DISC that will separate the appointments and thereby de-conflict the various responsibilities of the CE. This will provide a clear distinction between the CE as a customer and as a provider, removing any confusion or conflict between the two roles. The study will report in February 2003 and its findings will inform both the DISC Key Targets for Financial Year 2003&#150;04 and bids for funding.
<P>

<a name="21218m02.html_para26">In relation to a lack of clarity around the margins of the Agency's function, the Owner is also taking steps over the next few months to transfer the Agency's operational role. The precise timing and nature of this will be determined as part of implementation of the recommendations of the Strategic Defence Review New Chapter. Additionally, the Owner has taken action to constrain the extent to which the DISC provides advice on intelligence matters to a level that is commensurate with its training role.
<P>

<a name="21218m02.html_para27">The study also noted that the central issues affecting the core role of the DISC must be considered in the context of implementing the pan-MOD Defence Training Review (DTR) and the two strands of work co-operated closely throughout the QQR. DTR will rationalise the provision of individual education and training in MOD, including intelligence and security 



<P>

training and is thus approaching the functions of the DISC from a broader perspective. Recent decisions on the early implementation of DTR at Chicksands have increased the significance of this work The proposed joint Security, Languages, Intelligence and Photography (SLIP) Defence Training Establishment (DTE) that will subsume the DISC is to be implemented with effect from April 2003 as an early demonstration of the progress towards rationalisation that DTR will bring.

 On the evening of Monday 16 December, the Department of Health completed its purchase of the largest remaining independent US plasma collector, Life Resources Incorporated. This will secure long-term supplies of non-UK blood plasma for the benefit of NHS patients, and ensure that the current global plasma shortage will not reduce the availability to National Health Service patients of life-saving plasma products. An independent option appraisal conducted by KPMG concluded that this purchase was the most cost-effective way of achieving these objectives.
<P>

<a name="21218m04.html_para0">Plasma is used to manufacture products for the treatment of a wide range of conditions. Every year the NHS uses:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Around 45 per cent, of the plasma products needed by the NHS in England and Wales are manufactured by the NHS-owned Bio Products Laboratory. The remainder are purchased by the NHS on the open market from third party commercial suppliers. In 1998, the Government instructed BPL to stop using UK plasma to make these products because of concerns about the theoretical risk from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. Since then, BPL has purchased plasma from the United States. The US has no reported cases of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy and is the only country able to supply the quality of plasma that BPL needs in sufficient quantity. The US collects 60 per cent, of the world's plasma and supplies between 35 per cent.&#150;45 per cent, of the plasma products used in Europe alone.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="21218m04.html_para1">Up to now these supplies have been dependent on contracts with US plasma collection companies. Over the past two years most of these companies have been purchased by commercial manufacturers wishing to secure their own plasma supplies. This radically reduced the amount of US plasma that BPL could buy under contract and threatened our ability to supply sufficient non-UK plasma products to NHS patients.
<P>

<a name="21218m04.html_para2">Without continuing secure supplies of US plasma, BPL faced shutdown by 2004 with a consequent removal of massive volumes of plasma products from the NHS market. Independent market analysis by KPMG demonstrated that commercial suppliers would not be able to provide sufficient, secure supplies of plasma products to the NHS if BPL closed. Immediate action was therefore needed to secure long-term supplies of high quality, US plasma for BPL.
<P>

<a name="21218m04.html_para3">The Department of Health has purchased the trade and assets of Life Resources for an up front payment of #48.8 million with a further #21 million tied into the performance of the company up until the end of 2006. The Department has paid a commercial price for the business assets based on same analysis as a private sector purchaser would have undertaken.
<P>

<a name="21218m04.html_para4">Life Resources has supplied BPL with plasma since 1999. It has extremely high quality and safety standards overseen by the US Food and Drugs Administration and the UK Medicines Control Agency. All the company's collection centres are inspected by BPL on a rolling two year programme. BPL's team also inspected every centre prior to the purchase.
<P>

<a name="21218m04.html_para5">An effective corporate governance regime has been established for the ongoing management of Life Resources. The company will be run by its existing US management team and report to a US parent company, DCI Biologicals Incorporated. DCI Biologicals will 



<P>
<P>18 Dec 2002 : Column 65WS<P>
report to a UK parent company, Plasma Resources Ltd. The Board of Plasma Resources Ltd is chaired by Richard Douglas, the Department of Health's director of finance and investment.
<P>

<a name="21218m04.html_para6">The Government has appointed Mr Philip Gushing as non-executive chair of DCI Biologicals. Mr Gushing is highly qualified for this role. His previous positions include Chief Executive of Inchcape (1996&#150;9) and Chief Executive of Vitec Group PLC (2000&#150;1). He is also currently Chairman of Paragon Print and Packaging Limited, Spalding, Lincs, and a non executive director of Ikon Office Solutions Inc, Philadelphia, USA. He was appointed to Chair DCI because of his extensive international business experience, including a career involving American operations since 1977. He also has extensive international acquisitions experience built up over 20 years.
<P>

<a name="21218m04.html_para7">This deal is a logical extension of the existing relationship between the NHS and an established US plasma supplier, Life Resources, and is a pragmatic solution to the problem of securing supply.
