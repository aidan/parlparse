 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State issued a written ministerial statement on 20 July, <i>Official Report</i>, column 96WS about the discovery of a backlog of conduct cases which had been identified by the General Social Care Council (GSCC). He announced that we would be asking the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence (CHRE) to undertake a review of the GSCC's conduct functions. CHRE today published the report of its review of the GSCC. The Government welcome this report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="91104m0001.htm_para7"><a name="09110484000026">CHRE's report sets out a series of serious operational failings in the conduct function by the GSCC, which investigates complaints about social workers. Insufficient attention was paid to a growing backlog of conduct cases, despite additional funding being provided by the Department for three years to enable GSCC to address a growing number of complaints. Of particular concern was the decision to suspend, for a period of time, any new referrals to the GSCC's professional conduct committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="91104m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09110484000027">The Government have today broadly accepted all of the recommendations made by CHRE and a full response to its report is available at:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="91104m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09110484000029">I met with the GSCC's Chair, Rosie Varley, on behalf of both the Department of Health and the Department for Children, Schools and Families to express Ministers' concerns about the issues raised in the report and to set out clear expectations for the GSCC going forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="91104m0001.htm_para11"><a name="09110484000030">Significant progress has already been made in handling cases on receipt of complaints and addressing any ongoing risks to the public resulting from the poor management of conduct since July. Ministers have been assured by the Chair of the GSCC that all cases are now routinely risk-assessed and allocated to a responsible manager who ensures that risk is continually reviewed as new information arises. Interim suspension orders, which suspend the registration of social workers against whom serious complaints have been made while they are investigated, are now being applied for where appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="91104m0001.htm_para12"><a name="09110484000031">The GSCC has also begun the process of reforming its operational processes and strengthening its infrastructure to support performance management of its conduct function. A remedial plan to address the backlog of cases is now in place and Ministers have asked for monthly reports on progress to be provided to the Department.</p>

<p><a name="st_85"><a name="09110484000035"><a name="91104m0001.htm_spmin2"><a name="09110484000093"><b>The Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism (Mr. David Hanson):</b>
 The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) marked a major step in the protection of privacy. Prior to RIPA, many of the more intrusive techniques which it regulates could be used by any public authority and authorised at any level, for any purpose. There was no comprehensive system of independent oversight, no independent judicial complaints mechanism available in relation to all these techniques, and no means by which Parliament could prescribe the ranks of authorising officers or limit the purposes for which the techniques could be used. In addressing this situation, RIPA ensured that only specified public authorities could continue to use certain key techniques to protect the public, and only if they could do so compatibly with the European convention on human rights and, particularly, the article 8 right to respect for private and family life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="91104m0001.htm_para16"><a name="09110484000036">Nevertheless, a small number of local authorities have authorised techniques under RIPA in circumstances when most of us would say it was not necessary or proportionate for them to do so. In order to prevent this happening again, my Department published on Friday 17 April a consultation paper entitled "Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000: Consolidating Orders and Codes of Practice". This paper set out proposals to ensure that techniques regulated in RIPA can continue to be used when they are necessary and proportionate, but that there is no repetition of the small number of cases when they have been misused.</p>

in the consultation document as soon as possible. The secondary legislation, and the related codes of practice, will include measures to:</p>
<a name="91104m0001.htm_brev21"><a name="09110484000085"><ul><p class="tabletext">a) clarify the test of necessity and proportionality so techniques will not be used for trivial purposes such as investigating dog fouling or people putting bins out a day early;</p>

</ul><a name="91104m0001.htm_brev24"><a name="09110484000088"><ul><p class="tabletext">d) require constituents' communications with MPs on constituency business to be treated as confidential information, and therefore subject to authorisation by a higher rank of officer;</p>
</ul><a name="91104m0001.htm_brev25"><a name="09110484000089"><ul><p class="tabletext">e) treat covert surveillance of legal consultations as "intrusive" rather than "directed" surveillance, meaning that it can only be carried out by a very limited number of public authorities, primarily the police and intelligence agencies, and only with independent approval;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="91104m0001.htm_para19"><a name="09110484000039">Following a proposal by the Local Government Association, I intend to require each local authority to appoint a single official to be responsible for ensuring that all authorising officers are of an appropriate standard. This new role will have to be filled by a member of the corporate management team to whom authorising officers will report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="91104m0001.htm_para20"><a name="09110484000040">A number of respondents suggested that the key to effective and appropriate use of RIPA techniques was training, rather than the rank of authorising officers. With this in mind, I have asked my officials to work with the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Local Government Association and the Local Authorities Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services to establish a package of accredited training for local authority authorising officers, and, in addition, to prepare bespoke written guidance on how local authorities should use RIPA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="91104m0001.htm_para21"><a name="09110484000041">It is absolutely clear that a wide range of public authorities need to be able to authorise key techniques under RIPA in order to protect us from those who would do us harm. It is equally clear that public authorities must respect our right to privacy and only use techniques under RIPA when it is necessary and proportionate to do so. I believe the measures outlined in the summary of responses will ensure that both objectives can be met.</p>

 I have received the Twenty-second report of the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC).

The IMC note that the completion of devolution could be a potent intervention "because policing and justice would no longer be a point of contention across the political divide" but rather be "a platform for co-operation against those trying to undermine the peace process". The Government remain committed to do all they can to provide a solid foundation for a devolved Department of Justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="91104m0001.htm_para27"><a name="09110484000050">There is no evidence that the additional special grant funding is insufficient in total to meet the costs of the new concession. However, I am aware of some distributional issues that have arisen that have led to around 30 (out of over 260) travel concession authorities at risk of a significant shortfall in funding.

Any revised grant distribution developed after the consultation will be published in the form of a special grant report which will itself then be the subject of parliamentary scrutiny in due course.</p>

These changes make no change to either the services pass holders are entitled to use, or to who can receive the concession. Concessionaires themselves should therefore not notice any difference in the service they receive, under the proposals suggested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="91104m0001.htm_para31"><a name="09110484000054">The introduction of free off-peak local bus travel throughout England from 1 April 2008 has given the opportunity for greater freedom and independence to around 11 million older and disabled people. No older or disabled person in England now need be prevented from local bus travel by cost alone and the scheme represents a major step forward in tackling social inclusion for some of the most vulnerable people in our society.</p>

 I am pleased to announce our intention to introduce amending regulations to align the payment arrangements for state pension and pension credit with the arrangements for working age benefits.</p>

DWP customers would also be able to keep the same payday and pattern of payments when they reach pension age.</p>
