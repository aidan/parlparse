<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="61207m0001.htm_para5"><a name="06120763000040">These documents are supported by regulations made on 1 October 2006 which made the Environment Agency a statutory consultee for planning applications in flood risk areas. This reinforces implementation of PPS25 by ensuring that the agency is able to advise on all applications where flood risk is an issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="61207m0001.htm_para6"><a name="06120763000041">Flooding from rivers and tidal water is set to increase in frequency and intensity as a result of known climate change. The substantial upgrading from PPG25 in PPS25 is an important climate change adaptation measure. It forms part of the Government&#146;s &#147;Making Space for Water Strategy&#148; and delivers on a project jointly launched by my right hon. Friend the Member for Streatham (Keith Hill), the then Minister for Housing and Planning, and my hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley), the then Minister for Environment and Agri-environment in March 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="61207m0001.htm_para7"><a name="06120763000042">PPS25 is therefore a key part of our developing programme of responses to the challenge of climate change. It complements a comprehensive packageof planning policy and building standards to be announced shortly that will chart a course towards zero carbon development, and embed carbon reduction principles in future development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="61207m0001.htm_para8"><a name="06120763000043">PPS25 also strongly supports the strategy for housing set out in PPS3 on 29 November. In our drive for increasing housing supply and in particular by making more use of previously developed land, we need a strong set of tools to assess flood risk. We must avoid those areas where housing development is never going to acceptable. But we must also identify those where, with good design and local mitigation measures, it is possible to manage the risk and still build safely.</p>

It will also test the potential to carry ground attack weapons.</p>

 The House will be aware that the United Nations General Assembly discussed a sustainable fisheries resolution in New York from 16 to 23 November. Of particular interest was the section of the draft resolution relating to bottom fisheries, notably bottom trawling, and their impacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems. For too long the international community has turned a blind eye to the devastation which can be caused by this practice, but an improved scientific understanding of its impact on sensitive ecosystems in our deepest oceans, and proven evidence of the damage it causes, gave me hope that the international community would take the opportunity offered by the UNGA discussions to agree truly significant and effective measures to stop this destructive activity and protect seamounts, cold water corals, hydrothermal vents and similar vulnerable ecosystems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="61207m0002.htm_para0"><a name="06120763000202">I visited the UN last month to seek to persuade others of the importance of UN leadership in taking far-reaching measures. With the help of Commissioner Borg and other EU allies we developed an EU position based firmly on the precautionary approach including reversing the burden of proof. This means that countries would need to show that their fishing operations were not damaging vulnerable ecosystems, or the sustainability of fish stocks before they allowed them to operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="61207m0002.htm_para1"><a name="06120763000203">The outcome of the meeting was a significant improvement on where we were in October. The resolution agreed a programme of actions required of regional fisheries management organisations including a requirement that they adopt the reverse burden of proof before authorising their members to fish in the deep seas, this formulation is repeated for situations where regional fisheries management organisations&#151;RFMOs&#151;are being established. Flag states operating in non-regulated waters have a clear deadline of 31 December 2008 either to apply the RFMO process to their own vessels or choose to prohibit fishing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="61207m0002.htm_para2"><a name="06120763000204">While there is now a framework in place to end destructive bottom fisheries over the next two years, I am bitterly disappointed that we were not able to go  <br>

further and agree a more accelerated and stronger package of measures to end this destructive, unregulated deep-sea fishing which is wrecking so many marine creatures and habitats. I am, however, grateful for the support of many countries who have helped to achieve a significant shift in how the oceans are governed, but time is running out for the sensitive and vulnerable ecosystems threatened by this practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="61207m0002.htm_para3"><a name="06120763000205">We will continue to press for effective worldwide action and, with the European Union, we will ensure that everybody meets their responsibilities to prevent this kind of fishing destroying in minutes what has taken thousands of years to develop, and that high seas fisheries are founded on a clear sustainable basis.</p>

2005 are now available. These figures show that forthe period between April 1999 and December 2005 the total number of ASBOs issued (as reported to the Home Office by HMCS) was 9,853. Of those ASBOs issued, 56 per cent. were to adults and 41 per cent. to juveniles (3 per cent. of ASBOs are age unknown). Some 42 per cent. were orders on application and58 per cent. were orders on conviction.</p>

As indicated in the statement on 3 November 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 52-53 WS, a joint exercise between Her Majesty&#146;s Courts Service andthe Home Office has been undertaken to refine and improve further the collection of these data. We contacted local agencies such as Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships, the British Transport Police, social housing providers, and the courts themselves to cross reference and reconcile the differing sources of data. This exercise showed a degree of under-reporting of some 18 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="61207m0002.htm_para16"><a name="06120763000240">The data published today have been amended to reflect the results of the data improvement exercise. It is clear, however that these figures are an estimate, and although we believe they are very close to the true figures, we cannot eliminate the possibility of a continued degree of under-reporting using the current data collection system. For this reason, we have worked closely with HMCS to develop an action plan to improve the data collection process, which means that data published from next year will be quality assured to the required level.</p>

However, re-calculating these figures to make them consistent with current data gives a breach rate of 47 per cent. for juveniles and 38 per cent. for adults(42 per cent. overall). This has itself now changed, for the period to Dec 2005, to 47 per cent. overall (57 per cent. for juveniles and 41 per cent. for adults).</p>

The initial stages of that work have indicated that it is now appropriate to carry out a wider-ranging assessment of the ways in which the Government can help employers and individuals to resolve employment disputes as quickly as possible. There is evidence that changes to the various components of the current system could produce real benefits for businesses and individuals, by reducing the time, cost and stress involved in settling disputes.</p>

This concentrates specifically on trust and security in the ubiquitous information society of tomorrow. It reflects presidency concerns on information security issues and also the conclusions of the I2010 Information Society Conference, the presidency hosted in Helsinki on28 September. I intend to give my endorsement tothis resolution as the actions it outlines for the Commission, member states and stakeholders are all consistent with the accepted need to engender trust, security and confidence in the on-line transactions we all increasingly carry out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="61207m0003.htm_para1"><a name="06120763000273">The presidency will then introduce an exchange of views on the proposal for a regulation on roaming on public mobile networks within the Community. This draft regulation, adopted in July, and on which I recently wrote to the European Scrutiny Committees, seeks to reduce the level of roaming charges across the Community in a harmonised manner. While there has been a general consensus amongst member states that regulatory intervention is justified, there has been considerable concern on the detail of the Commission's draft, particularly regarding the imposition of retail price control. Indeed the UK, along with several other member states, believes that the current draft, if adopted, may unintentionally have consequences which might damage some consumer interests. In my intervention I will warmly endorse the objectives of the Commission but note the shortcomings of their approach, highlighting the UK-tabled amendments including the introduction of a sunrise clause on the imposition of a retail cap.</p>
