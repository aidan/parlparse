The NAPDB report adds to the evidence base to help us address the complex factors that determine malnutrition-for example, loss of appetite associated with age and/or illness, including absorption problems or the need for assistance in eating and drinking.

I am pleased to lay before Parliament the first annual report of the Identity Commissioner. His early impression, that the Identity and Passport Service are "doing a pretty good job", is welcome. But the Identity Commissioner is not complacent; neither am I. I endorse his priorities for scrutiny in the coming year: data-sharing; exploiting the benefit of identity cards; and the security and integrity of the technology of the National Identity Service. I look forward to seeing the result of his work in the coming months.</p>

On 4 January we extended eligibility to people across the North-West and since 8 February, young people aged 16 to 24 living in London have also been able to apply for an identity card. Furthermore, over 21,000 people throughout the UK have registered an interest in applying for an identity card and I have made a commitment that anyone who registers their interest through the Directgov website before 30 June will be able to apply for an identity card. Identity cards are a convenient and universal proof of age as well as a credit-card sized alternative to the passport when travelling in Europe.</p>

 This ministerial statement sets out the Government's decision on the question of compensation for pleural plaques, following their consultation on the issue. A full summary of the submissions we received during that consultation will be published shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="100225m0001.htm_para25"><a name="10022580000059">On 17 October 2007 the Law Lords upheld a Court of Appeal decision that the existence of pleural plaques-small localised areas of fibrosis caused by exposure to asbestos fibres, found within the pleura of the lung-does not constitute actionable or compensatable damage. Prior to that, people had been able to bring claims for compensation for pleural plaques since the 1980s</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="100225m0001.htm_para26"><a name="10022580000060">In the light of representations made by individuals and organisations who strongly disagreed with the Law Lords' decision, and in recognition of the concerns that existed, the Government published a consultation paper on the issue which sought views on a number of options in response to the ruling, including whether to overturn the House of Lords' judgment and legislate so that pleural plaques would again be compensatable under civil law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="100225m0001.htm_para27"><a name="10022580000061">In total the Government received 224 responses to its consultation paper. In addition, reports were received from the chief medical officer (CMO) for England and Wales and the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council (IIAC) reviewing the medical evidence on pleural plaques. Very helpful further discussions have also taken place with key medical experts in relation to the medical evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="100225m0001.htm_para28"><a name="10022580000062">This has confirmed that the presence of pleural plaques is an indicator that a person has been exposed to asbestos. Given that exposure to asbestos increases the risk of developing a serious illness, a diagnosis of pleural plaques can give rise to an understandable sense of anxiety and unease. However, while the exposure to asbestos has resulted in an anatomical change, in the great majority of cases pleural plaques do not in themselves produce any significant physiological change or loss of  <br>

lung function, and only very rarely give rise to physical symptoms. In such rare cases it is still possible for individuals to bring a civil claim for damages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="100225m0001.htm_para29"><a name="10022580000063">There is no available medical evidence to show that pleural plaques become malignant or lead to mesothelioma or other asbestos-related diseases. Current evidence indicates that it is a person's exposure to asbestos that produces any increased risk of developing a serious asbestos-related disease rather than the pleural plaques themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="100225m0001.htm_para30"><a name="10022580000064">The chief medical officer has invited the British Lung Foundation and the British Thoracic Society to develop information materials for health care professionals, and an information leaflet for people diagnosed with pleural plaques, to ensure that consistent and accurate information is provided about the condition to help allay concerns as far as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="100225m0001.htm_para31"><a name="10022580000065">On the basis of medical evidence received during the course of this review, including authoritative reports from the CMO and the IIAC, we are unable to conclude that the Law Lords' decision should be overturned at this time or that an open-ended no-fault compensation scheme should be set up. While the current medical evidence is clear that pleural plaques are a marker of exposure to asbestos, and that exposure to asbestos significantly increases the risk of asbestos-related disease, any increased risk of a person with pleural plaques developing an asbestos-related disease arises because of that person's exposure to asbestos rather than because of the plaques themselves. However, if new medical or other significant evidence were to emerge, the Government would obviously reassess the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="100225m0001.htm_para32"><a name="10022580000066">While we cannot, for the reasons outlined above, restore the previous position, we do acknowledge the unique position of those individuals who had already begun, but not resolved, a legal claim for compensation for pleural plaques at the time of the Law Lords' ruling in October 2007. Such people would have had an understandable expectation that their claim would result in compensation and many had made plans accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="100225m0001.htm_para33"><a name="10022580000067">The Government have decided to make payments of ¬£5,000 to individuals in this limited category under an extra-statutory scheme. The payment broadly reflects the level of compensation likely to have been received if pleural plaques had continued to be compensatable. Detailed arrangements relating to the operation of this extra-statutory scheme will be announced shortly. The scheme will apply to England and Wales, where the Ministry of Justice has responsibility for civil law. An information telephone line will be available by the end of the week and the number will be published at: www.justice.gov.uk/about/pleural-plaques.htm. The Government regard this as a unique situation and as not setting any precedent for any other circumstances where litigants may be disappointed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="100225m0001.htm_para34"><a name="10022580000068">A significant consequence of the House of Lords' decision has been that people diagnosed with plaques can no longer bring proceedings to establish liability for negligent exposure to asbestos. This was useful for some individuals later diagnosed with mesothelioma, as prior establishment of liability expedited their new compensation claim. This is of particular importance where conditions like mesothelioma are concerned, as patients frequently die very soon after diagnosis, leaving little time to trace records and obtain compensation. The Government believe it is imperative that steps are taken to improve the speed of payment for compensation claims for mesothelioma and other serious asbestos-related diseases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="100225m0002.htm_para2"><a name="10022580000071">In addition, in November 2009 we introduced the Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Bill into Parliament under a new procedure for Law Commission Bills. The Bill will enable claims against insolvent employers to be brought direct against the employer's insurer. This will simplify court procedures and remove the need for dissolved companies to be restored to the register of companies. The Bill is expected to become law in this Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="100225m0002.htm_para3"><a name="10022580000072">Further to these initiatives we are also taking action to deal with the problem of people who develop a serious asbestos-related disease but are unable to obtain full compensation because they cannot trace the employer's insurer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="100225m0002.htm_para4"><a name="10022580000073">This problem has been recognised for some time, and since 1999 the Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the Lloyds Market Association have committed to a voluntary code of practice for tracing EL insurance policies. However, while the tracing service has led to some improvements, there are still many individuals who are left without help-3,210 of them in 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="100225m0002.htm_para5"><a name="10022580000074">That situation is clearly unsatisfactory and the Government are therefore consulting on two proposals to improve matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="100225m0002.htm_para6"><a name="10022580000075">We believe that an essential first step is the creation of a UK-wide Employers' Liability Tracing Office (ELTO) to manage an electronic database of EL policies and to operate the existing tracing service. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has agreed to drive forward this work to help claimants and their representatives, informed by the outcome of the consultation. The new office will initially be launched on a voluntary basis but we would ultimately like it to be a requirement on all insurers to publish relevant policy details on the ELTO.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="100225m0002.htm_para7"><a name="10022580000076">The ELTO will initially be populated with existing trace data but new and renewed policies will be included shortly afterwards.

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="100225m0002.htm_para8"><a name="10022580000077">We have every expectation that the ELTO will deliver significant results, creating a database of records that will help many thousands of people trace policies and receive compensation in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="100225m0002.htm_para9"><a name="10022580000078">However, even with an ELTO there will be some people, especially those who suffer from long-tail diseases like mesothelioma, who are unable to trace their insurance records and thus are denied full compensation. The Government therefore propose to establish an Employers' Liability Insurance Bureau (ELIB) providing a compensation fund of last resort for individuals across the UK who are unable to trace EL insurance records.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="100225m0002.htm_para10"><a name="10022580000079">The consultation, published on 10 February, examines what an ELIB should cover, the impact of an ELIB on insurers and employers, how much should be paid by way of compensation, limitations on claiming from the ELIB, and what more can be done to ensure that employers who are legally obliged to obtain ELCI do so. The Government will consider fully the responses to the consultation before determining next steps towards the introduction of an ELIB.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="100225m0002.htm_para11"><a name="10022580000080">A mandatory ELTO and an ELIB should, in time, provide a comprehensive framework for supporting people who develop a serious asbestos-related disease. However, in recognition of the need for action now, the Government are taking a series of steps to increase the upfront payments that are currently made to mesothelioma sufferers and their dependants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="100225m0002.htm_para12"><a name="10022580000081">The Government will increase payments made under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979 by 1.5 per cent., even though the retail prices index showed negative growth. In addition, we will increase payments made due to mesothelioma under the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 so that they equal payments made under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="100225m0002.htm_para13"><a name="10022580000082">The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is also amending regulations to increase payments to all dependants under the 1979 Act and the 2008 Act by up to ¬£5,000, so that their awards are closer to those paid to sufferers. All of these increases will come into effect on 1 April 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="100225m0002.htm_para14"><a name="10022580000083">The fact that the UK has one of the highest rates of death from mesothelioma in the world is a legacy of our industrial heritage and the part that asbestos played in it.

 In October 2007 the European Court of Justice decided that disability living allowance (care component), attendance allowance and carer's allowance ("disability benefits") should be classified as sickness benefits under Regulation EC 1408/71.

 I am pleased to inform the House that, from April 2010, a series of increases will be made to lump sum payments paid to individuals suffering from mesothelioma and certain other qualifying diseases under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979 and the 2008 mesothelioma scheme. Together, these schemes mean that all people suffering from mesothelioma can receive lump sum awards from the Government quickly after diagnosis, in addition to weekly state benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="100225m0002.htm_para30"><a name="10022580000103">There is no requirement on Government to uprate payments under the schemes, but we have previously committed to increasing payments in line with those to state benefits. We have laid regulations to increase payments under the 1979 Act by 1.5 per cent. from 1 April this year, despite the negative growth in the retail price index. This will increase the value of such payouts to these very vulnerable people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="100225m0002.htm_para31"><a name="10022580000104">I can announce also that we are increasing the level of payments made through the 2008 mesothelioma scheme to bring them up to those under the 1979 Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="100225m0002.htm_para32"><a name="10022580000105">The 2008 scheme was introduced to provide up-front financial support to those people who previously were not eligible for help from the Government's other compensation schemes. The scheme is funded by compensation recovery-compensation recovered from individuals who are successful in a civil damages claim but who have already received a payment under the 1979 Act or 2008 scheme. When we started the scheme in 2008 we set awards at a level consistent with the amount of recoveries we expected to make; a lower rate than the 1979 Act. We made it clear, however, that we intended to bring 2008 scheme payments to the same level as those under the 1979 Act at the earliest opportunity. Our expectation was that we would be able to do this in the scheme's third year of operation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="100225m0002.htm_para33"><a name="10022580000106">I am pleased to inform the House that we are able to honour our promise sooner than expected and will be increasing payments to 1979 Act levels from April 2010, only 18 months after the 2008 scheme started. This means that those receiving a lump sum payment for mesothelioma will receive the same amount whether they were exposed to asbestos at work or exposed elsewhere, such as through washing their partner's clothes or by living close to an asbestos factory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="100225m0002.htm_para34"><a name="10022580000107">Finally, I am announcing an increase in the level of payments made to most dependants under both the 1979 Act and the 2008 scheme.</p>
