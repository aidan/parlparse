 Following the publication of the 18th report part 1 of the School Teachers&#146; Review Body (STRB) (Cm 7546) on 31 March 2009, to which I responded in a statement of that date, I have today written to consultees with the outcomes of my consultation on the report and my response. Copies of the letter are available in the Vote Office, the Printed Paper Office, the Libraries of the House, and at: www.teachernet.gov. uk/pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="90623m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09062368000015">I shall be taking forward the recommendations on the teachers&#146; pay award and pay ranges for excellent teachers for September 2009. Informed by the consultation I will implement interim changes to leadership pay that will better enable reward for system leadership roles. In this regard I am making one change to the recommended approach. I want to ensure that there are appropriate incentives for heads becoming responsible for the very largest federations of schools. I am not, therefore, accepting the STRB recommendation that there should a cap of 20 per cent. on the salary increase that is available to heads who take on permanent responsibility for running a number of schools.</p>

These are interim arrangements while the STRB look in greater depth in the coming year at new pay arrangements for school leaders that will recognise and reward the vital contribution that they will make to the delivery of our vision of the 21st century school.</p>

 The provision of armoured fighting vehicles to our forces has attracted considerable interest among hon. Members and the British public. I am today announcing the MOD&#146;s new armoured fighting vehicles sector strategy and how it links to the defence industrial strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="90623m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09062368000019">The defence industrial strategy set out the Government&#146;s approach to the delivery of the capabilities required by our armed forces now and in the future, recognising the important contribution that the defence industry makes. Building on the principles of the DIS, the new AVF sector strategy lays out further guiding principles which will shape MOD&#146;s relationship with industry, setting the context for individual project decisions and contributing to a coherent sector programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="90623m0001.htm_para4"><a name="09062368000020">In our strategy, we have changed the emphasis on how we meet our operational sovereignty requirements, making clear that it is not necessary to retain industrial capabilities in the UK in order to achieve appropriate operational sovereignty. We plan to make greater use of the global market, particularly within the EU and NATO, so long as we have assured access to the appropriate capabilities and expertise to design, modify, maintain, repair, overhaul, assemble, integrate and test our armoured fighting vehicles. Of course our critical requirement for affordability and value for money will remain. We continue to have a requirement to manufacture certain UK-specific critical sub-systems onshore and we will retain onshore the ability to maintain, repair and overhaul our vehicles, making use of the Defence Support Group. However where bids we receive offer comparable value for money, I will always take into account employment and industrial considerations in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="90623m0001.htm_para5"><a name="09062368000021">Contrary to our present position which normally involves manufacturers or lead contractors retaining the exclusive right to the use of the design information of platforms or systems we acquire, we will in future in principle wish to acquire at the outset rights over design information, as well as assured access to relevant design knowledge, sufficient to allow third party modification of designs where appropriate, and to permit routine maintenance repair and overhaul activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="90623m0001.htm_para6"><a name="09062368000022">Our strategy will generally be to procure base vehicles which can provide a suitable platform for the systems we require and which allow for modification and enhancement in the light of future developments in technology and future operational requirements. This strategy will cover the whole of our AFV fleet, both legacy and future. As an intelligent customer, we need to be able to define technical standards and architectures and make intelligent decisions about using the right technologies and integrating them using best systems engineering practice. Where we do not have these in-house, we will need to source independent advice from elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="90623m0001.htm_para7"><a name="09062368000023">We owe a great debt to the men and women of the armed forces who operate in hostile environments, risking their lives to secure freedom and to ensure that international terrorism, which threatens us all, is not allowed to take hold. We must ensure that they receive the very best  <br>

support and the very best equipment for the roles they are undertaking. In this statement today, I have outlined a new strategy, one which will enable us to make the best procurement decisions in support of our armed forces. I believe that once the strategy is fully implemented it will ensure that we give our armed forces the armoured fighting vehicles they need and deserve to do their jobs as safely and effectively as modern technology can provide at best value for money for the UK taxpayer.</p>

 In my oral statement to the House on 18 June I warned that the threat to the UK posed by floods, heat waves and coastal erosion presents a great challenge which we need to plan for. According to the UK climate change projections, the UK faces warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers, with more drought, heat-waves, flooding and sea-level rise. The results illustrate how important it is for the country to plan for the impacts of climate change. The projections underline that cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to limit future climate change is essential for the UK&#151;as for the rest of the world.</p>

As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made clear, we are prepared to provide further support to help rebuild Zimbabwe should there be further progress by the Zimbabwean Government in meeting their commitments to deliver political and economic reform. The Zimbabwean Government have made some progress in delivering reform, notably on the economic front, but much more needs to be done to deliver improved services and security to ordinary people. This includes work to implement IMF recommendations and reform the Central Bank; to reform the constitution as a prelude to new elections; to promote respect for human rights, freedom of the media and the repeal of repressive legislation; and to stop land seizures.</p>
