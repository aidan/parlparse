 Budget 2006 announced that the second Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) would be informed by a series of policy reviews. One of the reviews announced at the Budget was a joint HM Treasury and Department for Education and Skills policy review of children and young people.

 The Agriculture Development scheme (ADS) is an Exchequer-funded, competitive scheme which has operated in its present form since 2003 to help farmers and other bodies within the food chain to improve their competitiveness through better marketing. Details of the projects that have been supported under ADS may be found on DEFRA's website. The projects that have been supported have, in all cases, been ones that were originally proposed by bodies within the industry itself. The priorities of the scheme have been the encouragement of co-operation and collaboration benefiting primary producers, giving backing to benchmarking and the spread of best practice, promotion and development of assurance schemes, and opening up new markets.</p>

I should like to pay tribute to the energy and commitment of those who have been responsible for delivering these projects, and for achieving these results.</p>
