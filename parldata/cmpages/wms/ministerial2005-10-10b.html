 The Government have today laid before Parliament the following instrument: Solicitors (Compensation for Inadequate Professional Services) Order 2005.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m01.html_para9"><a name="stpa_8">The Order, made under paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 1A to the Solicitors Act 1974, will raise the maximum limit on the compensation which the Law Society&#039;s Council may direct a solicitor to pay on a complaint of inadequate professional service. The limit is raised from &#163;5,000 to &#163;15,000 with effect from 1 January 2006.

This means that a complainant frequently has to retain the services of a further solicitor in order to get redress from the solicitor who generated the original complaint. This can be a lengthy and expensive process for a consumer. Raising the limit will enable a far greater proportion of complainants to obtain adequate redress without the need to resort to court proceedings.

<a name="51010m02.html_sbhd0"><h4 align=center>University Air Squadrons Study</h4>












<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51010m02.html_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Don Touhig): </b> 
 A Royal Air Force study has been conducted to determine the appropriate size, shape and disposition of the university air squadrons. The study was commissioned against the background of proposed changes to the future size of the RAF, and of the planned tri-service military flying training system in partnership with industry. The results of the study have been carefully considered and I have decided that university air squadron students will no longer undertake elementary flying training while at university, and that elementary flying training will take place on a standard basis for all pilots, after initial officer training.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m02.html_para0"><a name="stpa_14">There are 14 university air squadrons located at 12 airfields across the UK, with a total undergraduate membership of some 1,000. Presently, the main university air squadron roles are to attract high calibre graduates into the RAF and to deliver the RAF&#039;s elementary flying training task. Elementary flying training is the first stage of RAF pilot training and is currently undertaken by all pilot university air squadron members during the course of their degrees and by direct entrant RAF pilots over a six-month period following initial officer training.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m02.html_para1"><a name="stpa_15">The study concluded that university air squadrons should continue to play an important role in engaging university students in RAF experience, but their focus should subtly shift to put more effort into leadership and personnel development training, nurturing recruitment to all branches. Flying will be available to all university air squadron members on a voluntary basis, but undergraduates will no longer be required to undertake formal elementary flying training during their university period. Up to 10 hours a year of structured light aircraft flying will still be available to all university air squadron undergraduates, including those in ground branches. In future, ex-university air squadron graduates joining the RAF as pilots will now undertake elementary flying training alongside other direct entrant pilots.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m02.html_para2"><a name="stpa_16">Overall, the changes will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the flying training pipeline and, for the university air squadron undergraduates, lessen the conflicting pressures to achieve a good degree and the highest standard during elementary flying training. They will create a fairer system, and resolve the inherent inefficiencies caused by undergraduates&#039; elementary flying training being spread over such a long period. University air squadrons will now be able to concentrate on the recruitment and personal development of all potential officers regardless of branch preference.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m02.html_para3"><a name="stpa_17">With effect from autumn, the following airfields will no longer be used for elementary flying training and overall flying hours are expected to reduce: RAF Benson, RAF Cosford, RAF Leuchars, RAF Colerne, RAF Leeming, Glasgow Airport, Boscombe Down, RAF Woodvale and RAF St Athan. RAF Cranwell will see a slight reduction in flying due to a reduced requirement to train instructors, whilst RAF Wyton and RAF Church Fenton will see some increase due to the establishment of new training squadrons to meet the elementary flying training task.






<br>&nbsp;<br>10 Oct 2005 : Column 5WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m02.html_para4">Light aircraft flying for university air squadron members will, however, continue and in some cases, particularly for those in ground branches, be enhanced. If implemented in full, these changes will result in a reduction of 21 RAF posts, but I do not envisage any other significant job implications.

<a name="51010m02.html_sbhd2"><h4 align=center>Lyons Inquiry and Council Tax Revaluation</h4>












<p><a name="st_8"><a name="51010m02.html_spmin2"><b>The Minister of Communities and Local Government  (Mr. David Miliband): </b> 
 The Government announced on 20 September 2005 an extension of the scope and length of Sir Michael Lyons&#039; independent inquiry into local government funding so that he can consider issues relating to the wider functions of local government and its future role.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m02.html_para5"><a name="stpa_18">Sir Michael Lyons has discussed with Ministers his work so far and his initial conclusion is that well founded recommendations on possible reforms to the funding of local government cannot sensibly be made in isolation from proper consideration and understanding&#151;not only by Government but by the population at large&#151;of the developing role and functions of local government. He has made clear that any proposals for reform of the funding system raise complex issues, and the Government have agreed that they need to be set firmly and explicitly within the wider context of a clear, shared understanding of the role of local government, and of councils&#039; accountability to service users, residents, and taxpayers. My right hon. Friends the Deputy Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer have therefore extended the terms of reference of Sir Michael&#039;s inquiry so that he can consider issues relating to the functions of local government and its future role, as well as, and prior to, making recommendations on local government funding. His work will inform the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m02.html_para6"><a name="stpa_19">Sir Michael will issue a series of discussion documents and produce his final report at the end of 2006. To set the scene for this work, Sir Michael will in Autumn 2005 set out his preliminary thinking and publish research and analysis undertaken so far, drawing out the relationship of local government function to finance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m02.html_para7"><a name="stpa_20">The Government have also announced that they intend to introduce legislation to postpone the revaluation of council tax in England. The case for council tax revaluation&#151;that it is right to maintain a fair alignment between house prices and council tax bands&#151;is linked to wider questions about the structure 





<br>&nbsp;<br>10 Oct 2005 : Column 6WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

of the council tax, and to the operation of council tax benefit. It is also relevant that there are a number of other imminent changes in the local government finance system, including the move to three year budgets, the review of the local government finance formula, and the creation of a dedicated schools budget. We have reached the view, therefore, that to proceed with the current timetable for council tax revaluation in England would not be sensible. We propose to legislate to substitute for the current revaluation date of 2007 a power to set a date for revaluation by secondary legislation. This will provide for revaluation to take place in such a way as to take full account of Sir Michael Lyons&#039; work on the functions of local government as well as its financing. The Government do not believe that revaluation will occur during this Parliament. I regret that the Government could not make this announcement while Parliament was sitting. However, having reached the decision to postpone revaluation, it was necessary to announce it immediately so that the preparatory work could be stood down and costs kept to a minimum. A copy of the press notice issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, which announces the Government&#039;s decision, and which includes the extended terms of reference for Sir Michael Lyons&#039; inquiry, has been placed in the House Library.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m02.html_para8"><a name="stpa_21">The future of local government is critical to the future of the country, and the Government are determined to ensure that a sustainable and secure funding base supports the changing and challenging role for local government now being developed.

 The Government are today publishing the detailed programme for commencement of parts 1&#150;4, 6 and 7 of the Housing Act 2004. Appendix 1 sets out a phased introduction of the provisions from November this year leading to a common commencement date of 6 April 2006 for all these provisions except for certain enforcement measures and the new tenancy deposit arrangements, which will follow later in 2006.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m02.html_para9"><a name="stpa_22">The Government have previously announced a provisional timetable for introducing these provisions as from late autumn 2005. We are now in a position to confirm the full timetable, starting with the laying of the HHSRS regulations next month and completing tenant deposit protection in October 2006. This will maintain the momentum established with local authorities and landlord bodies over recent months to equip each to carry out their responsibilities effectively and at least cost to local taxpayers and tenants as from the due commencement date.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m02.html_para10"><a name="stpa_23">By announcing this timetable, we are able to give certainty as to when the new provisions will be coming into force and enable all sides to prepare fully.

 The 2005 UN world summit took place in New York from 14&#150;16 September. My right hon. Friends the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for International Development and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs attended for the Government. At the initiative of the UK and other UN member states, the summit included a session devoted to financing for developments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para5"><a name="stpa_29">Overall, the summit delivered a worthwhile package of reforms and commitments. The full text of the outcome document is available at www.un.org/summit2005. Negotiations on the document were at times difficult, reflecting the ambitious agenda and divergence of views between UN member states on several issues. As EU presidency, the UK played an important role in these negotiations. Follow-up work is now underway in several areas to implement the agreements reached.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para6"><a name="stpa_30">The reforms agreed included:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">Agreement on the responsibility to protect, acknowledging that the international community should act if states fail to protect their populations from the worst atrocities:</p>
</ul>
<p>

genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity;

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">Good language on development and climate change, with several important Gleneaglesoutcomes endorsed and new EU commitments welcomed by the broader UN membership.These include the need to accelerate progress towards the millennium development goals andto address the special needs of Africa;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">Agreement to create by the end of this year a new peace-building commission, to close an institutional gap in the UN&#039;s conflict architecture and assist countries emerge from conflict;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">Agreement to establish a new human rights council, to replace the much-maligned Commission for Human Rights;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">Endorsement of further work to strengthen UN effectiveness in operational activities for tackling humanitarian crises and to ensure more coherent international institutional arrangements for environmental action;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">Endorsement of UN secretariat reforms underway and a mandate to the Secretary-General to make proposals for further reforms in such areas as ethics, accountability/oversight, and financial and human resource management; and</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">Unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestation and, separately, unanimous adoption by the Security Council of the UK&#039;s Security Council resolution to prohibit by law incitement of terrorism.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para7"><a name="stpa_31">In some areas the outcome text did not meet our aspirations. Stronger language on terrorism, stating that the targeted killing of civilians is never justified and constitutes an act of terrorism, proved out of reach. 





<br>&nbsp;<br>10 Oct 2005 : Column 9WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

Efforts to secure strong language on non-proliferation and disarmament (following disappointment at the non-proliferation treaty review conference) were unsuccessful. The EU pushed for more extensive reforms of the UN secretariat. Furthermore, opposition from some countries prevented more detailed modalities being agreed for the new human rights council.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para8"><a name="stpa_32">Some have criticised the summit&#039;s outcome document as modest. However, as the Prime Minister said in his speech at the summit, &quot;if we did what we have agreed on doubling aid, on opening up trade, on debt relief, on HIV/AIDS and malaria, on conflict prevention so that never again would the world stand by, helpless when genocide struck, our modesty would surprise. There would be more democracy, less oppression. More freedom, less terrorism. More growth, less poverty.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para9"><a name="stpa_33">The Government are committed to the full and early implementation of the reforms. We will continue to work towards achieving reforms where we wanted to see greater progress.

<a name="51010m03.html_sbhd6"><h4 align=center>Financial Protection for Air Travellers</h4>












<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51010m03.html_spmin6"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Ms Karen Buck): </b> 
 The Government have decided not to implement the Civil Aviation Authority&#039;s recommendation for a &#163;1 levy on all air passengers departing the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para14"><a name="stpa_38">The Government wish to thank the CAA for the enormous effort it has put into its analysis. But the attractions of the CAA scheme are outweighed by the disadvantages.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para15"><a name="stpa_39">First, the levy would be compulsory. The Government do not believe that it should compel citizens to protect themselves against the failure of an airline. The Government do not require citizens to take out medical insurance or an E111, although it is wise to do so. We do not require people to insure their house contents, although most people choose to do so. Even in car insurance, the legal requirement is limited to third party liabilities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para16"><a name="stpa_40">Secondly, there is no logical reason why the State should organise refunds for this one group of consumers. The Government do not have schemes to refund those who order furniture from a store which goes bankrupt, or lose money to cowboy workmen, or make unfortunate stock-market investments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para17"><a name="stpa_41">That is why, on balance, we do not think it right to extend ATOL beyond the requirements of European law although we do wish to reduce its bureaucracy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para18"><a name="stpa_42">ATOL stems from the early 1970s when a family holiday abroad tended to be organised as a package and travel abroad was infrequent. It involved putting at risk a significant proportion of family income in advance of the holiday being taken. These days overseas travel is a lot more routine. UK residents made a record 41 million holiday trips abroad in 2003 compared with fewer than 7 million in 1971.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para19"><a name="stpa_43">Next, the levy would reduce but not eliminate the difference in protection given to package and independent travellers. There would still be a 2-tier system, as people who assemble their own packages would have cover for their flight but not for loss of accommodation or car hire.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para20"><a name="stpa_44">The Government appreciate that the Package Travel Regulations impose costs on tour operators which they see as an unfair competitive advantage for scheduled airlines. But the levy would replace this imbalance with another. The same &#163;1 would purchase cover for the traveller who buys a low-cost flight to Europe for under &#163;30 and for the traveller (perhaps the more affluent person) who books a 2-week package in the Far East or the Caribbean. The budget traveller pays a much higher percentage of his outlay to ensure there is enough money in the pot to refund to the long-haul package passenger should his tour operator fail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para21"><a name="stpa_45">The Government wish to respond to the two arguments it has heard why airline passengers should be given special protection compared to other consumers in the economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para22"><a name="stpa_46">First, some travellers think they are protected when they are not, especially as the distinction between a package and independent travel is not always clear. The Government has committed itself to reduce regulatory 





<br>&nbsp;<br>10 Oct 2005 : Column 11WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

burdens on business and only regulate where necessary in a light touch manner . A levy is a heavy-handed instrument to solve the problem of informing a population which has easy access to a multitude of information sources. Travellers are showing increasing sophistication in shopping around on the internet; and 170,000 households now have a holiday home abroad, about double over 10 years. Travel-in Europe has become particularly familiar since we have been part of the European community&#151;whether for school trips, sports events, weekends, holidays or business.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para23"><a name="stpa_47">The Government have already been working with the CAA and the airline industry to improve consumer information about insurance cover when booking flights. UK airlines have helped us develop a basic message for passengers making online bookings, and some have told us of plans to offer specific insurance as well as posting a message.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para24"><a name="stpa_48">This is in addition to the information that is already available from the Air Transport Users Council, the CAA and other sources including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The FCO is going to update its website shortly to explain the protection available under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 if flight tickets are paid for by credit card. And some tour operators &quot;sell&quot; the protective benefits of a package more vigorously than others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para25"><a name="stpa_49">The second reason why air passengers are said to need special protection is that they may become stranded abroad in large numbers. The Government realise that not all travel insurance covers insolvency, but some does. The CAA&#039;s assessment and the example of EUjet this summer show that people will generally find their way home by other routes. Of course, they may incur some expense and inconvenience, particularly if they are not insured, but it is not fair to impose a levy on all air passengers just to provide cover for this. In the case of EUjet other, low-cost airlines stepped in to help and have told the Government they intend to learn lessons from the experience to improve the effectiveness of future voluntary rescue efforts. Similarly, when Swissair arid Sabena failed, other full-service airlines honoured the homeward tickets of passengers abroad.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para26"><a name="stpa_50">The Government have been encouraged by the willingness expressed by airlines to put in place improvements to ensure travellers are able to make informed decisions about the need for insurance, and by airlines1 assurances that they would continue to take voluntary action on repatriation. The Government will be talking further to airlines in the coming weeks to ensure that effective voluntary measures are put in place as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m03.html_para27"><a name="stpa_51">Nevertheless we recognise that the current bonding system for tour operators can be a barrier to market entry and tie up capital. The Government are therefore asking the CAA to review whether the system of ATOL bonds could be replaced with a less burdensome means of meeting tour operators&#039; obligations to package holiday-makers under the Package Travel Directive, while at the same time replenishing the Air Travel Trust Fund following the passage of the Civil Aviation Bill.

Inefficient practices were creating unnecessary delays at each stage of the claims process and the council was failing to ensure that the evidence provided by its customers met the requirements of the verification framework. The percentage of claims decided within 14 days of receiving all information and the time taken to process changes of circumstances had both deteriorated during 2004&#150;05.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m04.html_para6"><a name="stpa_58">Bridgnorth district council had a strong anti-fraud culture and gave a high priority to combating benefit fraud. The council had a history of prosecuting fraudsters even before the introduction of financial incentives through the SAFE scheme.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m04.html_para7">Benefit assessment staff generated a high number of fraud referrals and there were a number of good practices within the fraud team, such as well-structured interviews under caution. Although there were no written procedures covering counter-fraud work and limited management checking, the fraud team was well motivated and had achieved a high output of sanctions and prosecutions, particularly in relation to the caseload. This was very impressive in comparison with other similar sized local authorities. There were some weaknesses in earlier fraud investigations but BFI was satisfied that these had since been addressed. BFI was also satisfied that payments under the SAFE scheme had been properly claimed.
</p>

<p>

<a name="51010m05.html_para1"><a name="stpa_74">The loss of a number of experienced staff during the early part of 2004&#150;05 put further pressure on the service and led to a backlog of claims. This was cleared in January 2005 when the old IT system was closed down, but data conversion problems meant that when the new benefits IT system went live in March 2005, a further backlog existed. Despite continuing IT problems, the council were working hard to clear a backlog of benefit cases and, if the backlog is excluded, the council were clearing new claims within the DWP standard of 36 days. The standard of verification of claims was good.

However, these management controls need to be linked to systematic management checking and individual and team targets to ensure that the performance improvements are sustained.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m05.html_para4"><a name="stpa_76">Today we publish the Department&#039;s principles of welfare reform, which contain the values and principles which shape the Government&#039;s vision of the future welfare state. A copy has been placed in the Library, and copies are available to hon. Members in the Vote Office.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m05.html_para5"><a name="stpa_77">Our values of equality, opportunity, fairness and social justice underpin these principles. We have already moved away from a passive social security system which could be caricatured as encouraging welfare dependency. The next stage of welfare reform will be designed not only to help people to return to work, but also progress in work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m05.html_para6"><a name="stpa_78">The Government will help people achieve success for themselves and their families by building the necessary skills and assets for future personal security. It will provide support, nationally and locally, and help individuals fulfil their potential.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51010m05.html_para7"><a name="stpa_79">Our core principles are to:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">help people to help themselves by offering a ladder to self-reliance and self-determination, not merely a safety net in time of need;</p>
</ul>

<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">balance rights with responsibilities, while recognising the need for support and care where appropriate;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">recognise our mutual interdependence and obligation to each other, promoting solidarity between generations, and the importance of using the resources of Government to help people cope with rapid economic and social change;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">ensure the role of the state is active, liberating and enabling;</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">address the root causes of poverty and overcome intergenerational disadvantage and exclusion;</p>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">contribute to a stable and growing economy through investment in the potential of every individual, and flexibility of support in and out of work.</p>
