 I am pleased to announce that the review by Government (the UK Government and the devolved administrations) of the long term management of the UK's solid low level radioactive waste (LLW), started on 18 March 2005, has been completed and that the revised policy statement is being published today. Copies of the policy statement have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="70326m0001.htm_para27"><a name="0703265000052">The LLW policy review process complements the ongoing work Government are carrying out on the policy for the management of higher activity radioactive wastes under our Managing Radioactive Waste Safely programme, following recommendations made by the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) in July 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="70326m0001.htm_para28"><a name="0703265000053">The public consultation on the review of solid LLW management policy was held between 28 February 2006 and 31 May 2006. Some 150 responses were received and a summary of the Government's response to them is also being placed in the Library of the House. As made clear when the consultation was announced, unlike the higher activity wastes, paths for the long term management and disposal of LLW already exist but the review was needed for the following principal reasons:</p>
<a name="70326m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="0703265000054"><ul><p class="tabletext">With the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA's) decommissioning and clean-up programme underway, there will be greatly increased arisings of LLW over the coming decades, and this is already starting to happen;</p>
</ul><a name="70326m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="0703265000058"><ul><p class="tabletext">there will be insufficient long term capacity at the national LLW disposal facility near Drigg in Cumbria to deal with this waste, and the future capacity of this facility is currently under review;</p>
</ul><a name="70326m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="0703265000061"><ul><p class="tabletext">while other disposal routes for certain types of LLW have been used (eg by disposal on or near the site of arising, by controlled and uncontrolled burial to landfill and by incineration), the availability of these other routes has diminished in recent years;</p>
</ul><a name="70326m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="0703265000066"><ul><p class="tabletext">finding small scale treatment and disposal routes for the least radioactive LLW, which are very important for the non-nuclear sectors (hospitals, research and education establishments, and the oil and gas industry) is proving increasingly difficult.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="70326m0001.htm_para29"><a name="0703265000070">The revised policy puts providing public safety at the forefront of dealing with LLW, and recognises that much LLW has very low levels of radioactivity and can be disposed of in a variety of ways while posing a negligible risk to human health or the environment. The revised policy will:</p>
<a name="70326m0001.htm_brev5"><a name="0703265000071"><ul><p class="tabletext">require very high levels of safety to be maintained through the use of a risk assessed approach, and the preparation of plans and safety cases that are acceptable to the regulatory bodies (including the Environment Agencies and the Health and Safety Executive);</p>
</ul><a name="70326m0001.htm_brev6"><a name="0703265000076"><ul><p class="tabletext">allow greater flexibility in the management of the wide range of LLW that already exists, and will arise in future from the NDA's activities and other nuclear and non-nuclear industry arisings;</p>
</ul><a name="70326m0001.htm_brev7"><a name="0703265000079"><ul><p class="tabletext">seek to minimise the amount of LLW for disposal by application of the waste hierarchy applied in other areas of waste management - avoidance of generation, minimisation, reuse and recycling - prior to disposal;</p>

 Producer responsibility under the UK WEEE Regulations will begin from1 July 2007. Non-statutory Guidance to assist business affected by the regulations to understand their obligations and identify the most appropriate method to discharge them was published in February 2007. This document will be reviewed and amended on a regular basis to ensure clarity in light of experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="70326m0002.htm_para0"><a name="0703265000137">In the early part of 2007 the DTI held a series of road-shows for producers and distributors across the UK. In addition the environment authorities arranged seminars for prospective Producer Compliance Schemes and the Distributor Take-back Scheme (DTS) operator held workshops to raise awareness of the opportunities the regulations offer Local Authorities. This awareness raising activity was supplemented by a number of placed articles and features in the trade press.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="70326m0002.htm_para1"><a name="0703265000138">It is encouraging to see the active engagement of all affected parties involved. For example:</p>

</ul><a name="70326m0002.htm_brev1"><a name="0703265000140"><ul><p class="tabletext">There is evidence of increased investment by the waste management and treatment sector to increase the existing capacity to deal with WEEE as it arises; and</p>
</ul><a name="70326m0002.htm_brev2"><a name="0703265000141"><ul><p class="tabletext">Distributors and local authorities are working with the DTS operator to develop a network of designated collection facilities using the existing local authority waste collection infrastructure.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="70326m0002.htm_para2"><a name="0703265000142">A public awareness campaign will begin in the coming months to inform consumers of the regulations and the positive role they can play in ensuring WEEE is separately collected, treated and reprocessed to the standards required by the regulations to secure the environmental benefits the WEEE system will offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="70326m0002.htm_para3"><a name="0703265000143">At the time of laying the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Regulations (WEEE) 2006  (SI 3289), the Government indicated that they were considering introducing partial producer responsibility from 1 April 2007.

Libraries the grant determination under Section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003 in respect of this grant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="70326m0002.htm_para6"><a name="0703265000148">This statement and the grant determination set out how the Department for Transport (DFT) intends to allocate the money for the first year (2007-8).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="70326m0002.htm_para7"><a name="0703265000149">Funds will go to a total of 3,231 schools. The grant is targeted mainly at primary schools, and more than one in six primary schools across the country will receive this funding. 1,903 schools will receive grants to start or significantly expand walking buses, and another 1,328 will receive grants to set up other walking initiatives. This new investment is expected to see the number of walking buses across England triple.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="70326m0002.htm_para8"><a name="0703265000150">Funding in years two and three will be dependent on individual schools demonstrating they have saved the required number of extra car trips and expect to continue doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="70326m0002.htm_para9"><a name="0703265000151">These payments are being made as part of the Government's Travelling to School project to reduce car use for journeys to school. DFT is providing the money and is working closely with the Department for Education and Skills (DFES) and the Department of Health to integrate walking buses and other walking initiatives into the Healthy Schools initiative and promote healthier lifestyles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="70326m0002.htm_para10"><a name="0703265000152">The grants will be paid through DFES to Local Authorities (LAs) for onward transmission to the successful school through the DFES Standards Fund. This has been identified as the grant mechanism that is simplest to administer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="70326m0002.htm_para11"><a name="0703265000153">The grant determination sets out the amount each LA will receive. The amount distributed to each LA is based on the number of schools in their area that have made the required commitment and demonstrated a reasonable expectation of saving five return trips per school day for a walking bus, which will receive &#163;1,000 a year. Other walking initiatives must save 2.5 return trips on average and will receive &#163;500 a year.</p>

 The Depleted Uranium Oversight Board (DUOB) was established in 2001 to oversee a screening programme for veterans of the 1991 Gulf conflict and subsequent Balkans operations concerned about possible exposure to depleted uranium. Testing based on the analysis of urine samples for trace quantities of uranium isotopes was offered between 2004 and 2006. A total of 496 applicants completed the test.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="70326m0002.htm_para14"><a name="07032768000331">The final report of the DUOB is now available and can be accessed from the website www.duob.org.uk</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="70326m0002.htm_para15"><a name="07032768000333">The board was unable to achieve complete consensus on the interpretation and significance of the test results. However, no evidence of the excretion of depleted uranium was found in the urine of any of the test participants. According to mainstream scientific and medical opinion, this means that none had suffered an exposure to DU of sufficient magnitude likely to cause a risk to their health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="70326m0002.htm_para16"><a name="07032768000334">I welcome these findings and believe they will have provided valuable reassurance and peace of mind to the veterans concerned.</p>
