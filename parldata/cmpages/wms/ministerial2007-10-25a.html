<a name="subhd_1"><a name="71025m0001.htm_sbhd0"><a name="07102554000012"><h4 align="center">Children Act (Section 58 Review)</h4>

<p><a name="st_66"><a name="07102554000023"><a name="71025m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="07102554000084"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Kevin Brennan):</b>
 Today I am publishing the results of the review of section 58 of the Children Act 2004. Section 58 removed the availability of the defence of reasonable punishment from parents and those acting in loco parentis who are charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm, wounding or grievous bodily harm, or cruelty to a child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="71025m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07102554000024">The Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport, my right hon. Friend, the Member for Barking (Margaret Hodge) said during the passage of the Children Act 2004, &#147;I can give a clear commitment that two years after clause 56 comes into effect we will review the practical consequences of those changes to the law, and will also seek parents&#146; views about smacking. We will lay a copy of the results before Parliament&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="71025m0001.htm_para1"><a name="07102554000025">The Government have carried out a public consultation, survey of parental opinion, survey of children and young people, and sought additional evidence, in order to meet the commitments of the review. The review found that smacking is becoming a less commonly used form of discipline as more parents recognise that there are more effective and acceptable methods of disciplining children. While many parents say they will not smack, a majority of parents say that smacking should not be banned outright. Many organisations however support legislation to ban smacking. The police have discretion to deal with cases as they consider appropriate, taking into account factors including the evidence available, the public interest and the best interests of the child. The law is clear and section 58 has improved protection for children, but there appears to be a lack of awareness across different audiences about the scope and application of the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="71025m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07102554000026">In response, the Government will retain the law in its current form, in the absence of evidence it is not working satisfactorily. We will also do more to help with positive parenting. We also welcome the bulletin issued by the Crown Prosecution Service to all their staff reminding them of section 58 and where appropriate reminding them to bring it to the attention of courts, juries, and defence lawyers, and recommend that the police take similar action and remind staff of section 58, particularly staff in Child Abuse Investigation Units.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="71025m0001.htm_para3"><a name="07102554000027">Today I have placed copies of the review report and the supporting evidence in the House Library and online at: www.dcsf.gov.uk/publications/section58review. They are also available to Members from the Vote Office.</p>

 I am today launching a consultation seeking views on the mechanism for allocating the Housing and Planning Delivery Grant (HPDG).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="71025m0001.htm_para4"><a name="07102554000029">This grant will provide more support for communities and local councils who are doing their bit to promote more housing and will help local authorities to respond to the local housing needs of their community. The grant totals &#163;510 million over the three years, 2008-09 to 2010-11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="71025m0001.htm_para5"><a name="07102554000030">The proposed grant will offer extra funding for councils that identify at least five years worth of good sites ready for housing and a further 10 years worth for future development. All local planning authorities will be eligible for the planning element of the grant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="71025m0001.htm_para6"><a name="07102554000031">It will also provide extra help for those communities and councils that are doing most to support more homes. In areas where the number of homes is growing by more than 0.75 per cent. a year, councils will be able to get extra funding per home from the Housing and Planning Delivery Grant in addition to infrastructure funding and developer contributions. However in order to be eligible for funding councils will need to be able to demonstrate they are taking action to bring empty homes back into use as well as supporting more new homes. We are also proposing that qualification for the grant should depend on a local planning authority having an effective empty homes strategy in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="71025m0001.htm_para7"><a name="07102554000032">This money is about extra support for those councils who are already doing their bit, ensuring that more housing is delivered to meet the needs of this and future generations. The first payments will be made next year.</p>

It also delivers against Recommendation 18 of Kate Barker's &#147;Review of Housing Supply&#148;, which called for a housing growth incentive for local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="71025m0001.htm_para9"><a name="07102554000034">The detailed proposals are contained in a consultation paper will be published later today on the website of the Department for Communities and Local Government www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/deliverygrantallocation.

We have now let a risk reduction contract with Metrix which seeks to increase confidence in our ability to amend training courses quickly and efficiently over the life of the main contract in response to changes in training needs. It is anticipated that we will be in a position to commit to the final developmental phase of the project in the spring of next year with a view to signing the main contract within a further year. Construction at the St. Athan site would then start in 2009, with the aim of completing the final phase by 2013.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="71025m0001.htm_para11"><a name="07102554000037">The work to explore possible synergies and economies of scale across the programme as a whole has concluded that there are insufficient efficiencies to move forward on this basis. We therefore continue to consider a range of options for package 2, which aims to provide training for Logistics and Personnel Administration, Police and Guarding, Security, Languages, Intelligence and Photography. These options vary from adaptations to Metrix&#146; original PFI proposals through to a full conventional procurement. The work to develop an affordable project will continue to focus on how best to improve our accommodation and training facilities, and meet our commitments following the review by Nicholas Blake QC to improve the support, welfare and wellbeing of our trainees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="71025m0001.htm_para12"><a name="07102554000038">We continue to manage the implications for our people sensitively and in full consultation with trades unions and staff. For package 1, our civilian staff in scope will continue to be required to transfer to the new partner, although no moves will take place before 2011. For package 2, training will continue to be delivered at the package 2 sites under current arrangements for at least the foreseeable future. We now plan to take forward more detailed negotiations with the Metrix consortium to press ahead with package 1. The work on package 2 will be conducted in parallel and a further update on both packages will be provided next year.</p>

I am pleased to report that the majority of these have been met, although a strategic Headquarters Planning Element (PLANELM) for the Africa Standby Force (ASF) within the AU is yet to be fully established according to the criteria laid down in the 2005 ASF Roadmap. This has been due to the need to respond to other urgent demands in the region including the diversion of HQ personnel to planning for the AU mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and the continuing demands of AMIS (Darfur).</p>

The 2 May 2007 High-level Education conference in Brussels agreed on the need for more, better, and faster support for education and to identify ways to ensure long-term predictability in planning and financing. At the Heiligendamm summit, the G8 reaffirmed its commitment to &#147;Education for All&#148; and that countries will not be thwarted in their achievement of this goal by lack of resources, and that the G8 will continue to work with partners and other donors to meet this years Fast Track Initiatives (FTI) financing gap of $500 million.

Roughly, half of which is being used to tackle AIDS, and a quarter of the money is going to each of TB and malaria. Contributions from constituencies including the private sector enabled the GFATM to fund all proposals that were recommended for funding.

The UK has played a pivotal role in developing and attracting support for the Aid for Trade concept, in the context of WTO negotiations as well as in the international donor community. The EU will adopt a new AFT strategy in the autumn. The UK has also increased its support significantly. We will provide $750 million per year by 2010 (up 50 per cent. since 2005) and we are making good progress towards this target. A Global Aid for Trade Review will be held at the WTO in November, which will look at developing country needs and whether all donors are meeting their commitments. The UK has called on traditional and new donors to support the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) for Aid for Trade for Least Developed Countries (LDC) and we have committed up to 20 per cent. or &#163;38 million to this.

Monterrey survey by the European Commission showed that the EU has exceeded its ODA commitments for 2006 (ODA/GNI was 0.41 per cent. against a commitment to 0.39 per cent.). The DAC reports show that global ODA flows have increased by 31 per cent. since 2004, and total aid to Africa rose in 2006, but the DAC 2007 report states that total ODA fell between 2005 and 2006 by 5 per cent. A further fall in 2007 is likely. Rapid increases in non-debt ODA will be needed to meet the commitments for 2010 and beyond made at Gleneagles and the Barcelona EU summit.</p>

 The Government published a draft Coroners Bill in June 2006 in which it proposed to give coroners discretion to impose on the media anonymous reporting in some inquest cases. Since the Bill was published, this strand of policy has been subject to extensive consultation with all those with an interest. Those consulted include the voluntary sector, bereaved families and media organisations, as well as coroners and others who work within the service. As a result of the consultation, the Government have reconsidered the policy and decided to remove this clause from the Bill, and retain the current rules about the reporting of inquests. The Bill will be brought before Parliament as soon as time allows.</p>

Five new postcodes, introduced as a result of Royal Mail Postcode changes, and one business postcode which includes a residential address have been included in the scheme and 39 postcode to weather station linkages have been changed on the advice of the Meteorological Office following representations made by hon.
