<p><a name="st_94"><a name="08071086000024"><a name="80710m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="08071086000209"><b>The Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):</b>
 I represented the UK at the informal Energy Council that took place in Paris on 4 to 5 July. This was held back to back with an informal Environment Council, reflecting the priority the French are giving to the climate change and energy package during their presidency. Both meetings were chaired by Jean-Louis Borloo, French Minister for the Environment and Energy. The European Parliament rapporteurs for the various elements of the package were also present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="80710m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08071086000025">The main focus of discussion was the renewables directive, including specific debates on biofuels and the flexibilities required for the EU to achieve the 20 per cent. renewable energy target in a cost-effective way. National experiences were also exchanged on energy efficiency and Ministers received a presentation on energy security by Claude Mandil, former head of the IEA, commissioned by the French to produce a report to inform the forthcoming EU strategic energy review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="80710m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08071086000026">During the debate on renewables, there was a large degree of consensus on the importance of meeting the targets cost-effectively. There was also widespread recognition that this can only be achieved with some level of exchange between member states allowing countries with potentially expensive domestic renewables resource to buy them more cheaply elsewhere in the EU. There was general agreement among ministers that a UK/Germany/Poland proposal for a system of exchange between member states represented a promising way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="80710m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08071086000027">A short debate on biofuels followed. I used the opportunity to highlight the key findings of the Gallagher review. There was a discussion on the perceived link between the increased use of biofuels and food prices. It was emphasised that the 10 per cent. objective in the draft directive is for the use of renewable energy in transport, and not a 10 per cent. share of biofuel in transport fuel by 2020; so electric vehicles could also play a part in achieving this target. Several member states agreed that the proposed sustainability regime proposed for biofuels should be more demanding in order to ensure genuine sustainability of biofuels and highlighted the importance of the availability of second generation biofuels in this regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="80710m0001.htm_para3"><a name="08071086000028">Earlier we had a debate on energy efficiency with representatives of NGOs, business and MEPs. There were several presentations on what individual member states were doing domestically (I spoke about the UK&#146;s carbon reduction commitment scheme), and a general agreement that more effort had to be put into energy efficiency both at national and EU level.</p>

 I answered the hon. Member for Fareham&#146;s parliamentary question on 12 June 2008 (<i>Official Report</i>, column  414W) on BERR departmental training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="80710m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08071086000030">We said that the staff training costs incurred by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform&#146;s Agencies were &#163;1,714,000 in the last 12 months and &#163;8,443,000 for the previous five years. This figure was also quoted in my letter of 12 June 2008, to the hon. Member for Fareham. A copy of this letter was placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="80710m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08071086000031">These costs were taken from the Department&#146;s consolidated resource accounts for the years in question, which for 2007-08 were in draft at the time of my reply. Furthermore, the consolidated resource accounts do not include the expenditure of Companies House, whose accounts are published separately. Using updated figures, staff training costs for the Department&#146;s agencies were &#163;1,999,000 for 2007-08, and &#163;8,774,000 for the previous five years.</p>

 I am pleased to announce that the School Food Trust, in partnership with LACA (Local Authority Caterers&#146; Association) has released provisional findings from the third annual survey of take up of school meals, reporting on the 2007-08 financial year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="80710m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08071086000033">In primary schools take up in 2007-08 was 43.6 per cent., an increase of 2.3 percentage points on the value reported for 2006-07 of 41.3 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="80710m0001.htm_para8"><a name="08071086000035">The values reported for 2005-06 were 42.3 per cent. in primary schools and 42.7 per cent. in secondary schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="80710m0001.htm_para9"><a name="08071086000036">These figures illustrate that the number of primary school children eating school meals rose by roughly 88,000 from 2006-07 to 2007-08. The number of secondary school pupils eating school meals fell by roughly 38,000 over the same period. This is partly explained by a 2 per cent. drop in numbers of pupils on roll in secondary schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="80710m0001.htm_para10"><a name="08071086000037">Average meal price in primary schools in 2007-08 was &#163;1.66, compared to &#163;1.63 reported for 2006-07, an increase of 1.8 per cent. Average ingredient costs were 61 pence per meal, 7 per cent. higher than in 2006-07 (57 pence). Average labour costs were 1.08 per meal, very similar to the 1.09 reported for 2006-07.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="80710m0001.htm_para11"><a name="08071086000038">In secondary schools, the average meal price is based on the value of a free school meal, which in 2007-08 was &#163;1.78, compared to &#163;1.72 reported for 2006-07, an increase of 3 per cent. Average ingredient and labour costs as a percentage of total service expenditure were 36.5 per cent. and 48,6 per cent. respectively.</p>

Fifteen authorities submitted bids totalling some &#163;46.9 million and I am now pleased to announce that all of those bids have been successful. This means that schools in West Sussex, Swindon, North East Lincolnshire, Lincolnshire, North Somerset, Dorset, Wigan, Harrow, Hillingdon, Plymouth, Buckinghamshire, Bournemouth, Northamptonshire, Kingston-upon-Thames, and Worcestershire will have new school kitchens over the next three years.</p>

 I am today publishing a consultation on proposals to improve planning policy statement 6: &#147;Planning for Town Centres&#148; (PPS6). Copies of the consultation are being placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="80710m0001.htm_para31"><a name="08071086000059">Busy town centres with a wide range of shops are vital to communities large and small, rural and urban.

biggest ever changes to strengthen Britain&#146;s border security as we complete implementation of a system of triple checks: stronger overseas checks and wider pre-arrival screening; tougher checks at the UK border itself; and strong new measures within the UK&#151;against illegal immigration, organised crime and other threats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="80710m0002.htm_para1"><a name="08071086000111">We believe our tough checks abroad, working with foreign Governments, are amongst the most important. Overseas controls start with fingerprint visas, pre-arrival watch list checks and officers stationed overseas at key crossing points. As part of these overseas defences our visa waiver test helps us determine whether our visa regimes are in the right places. The test was announced in March 2007. Travel from every country beyond the European economic area and Switzerland was measured against a range of criteria including illegal immigration, crime and security concerns. The test has been taken forward in close collaboration with other Departments across Whitehall. We have now reached the final stage of the test.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="80710m0002.htm_para2"><a name="08071086000112">Our assessment found that there was a strong case for introducing a visa regime for a number of currently visa-free countries, based on the current level of risk posed to the UK by sufficient numbers of their nationals, or travellers claiming to be such. A visa regime is a simple but very effective immigration, crime and security control measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="80710m0002.htm_para3"><a name="08071086000113">We recognise that we have historic, economic and political ties with the countries being examined; the introduction of a visa regime is a significant step and a decision we do not take lightly. For this reason, we will now enter a period of detailed dialogue with the Governments concerned to examine how risks can be reduced in a way that obviates the need for a visa regime to be introduced. This activity will last for six months. During this period, countries identified will need to demonstrate a genuine commitment to put into effect credible and realistic plans, with clear timetables, to reduce the risks to the UK, and begin real implementation of these plans by the end of the dialogue period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="80710m0002.htm_para4"><a name="08071086000114">The countries we are working with through the mitigation process are: Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Lesotho, Malaysia, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela. Promising and constructive dialogue has already begun with a number of countries but more is required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="80710m0002.htm_para5"><a name="08071086000115">The test also indicated that a number of changes were possible for countries currently with visa status. Over the next six months, we will study the options further to see how the visa process can be more closely calibrated to the risks nationals from these countries pose, with consequent benefits for legitimate travellers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="80710m0002.htm_para6"><a name="08071086000116">We expect the first consequent changes from the test to be introduced in 2009. The British Government are determined to operate a firm but fair immigration policy. It gives a high priority to treating all foreign nationals coming to or present in the UK with dignity and respect, and the highest legal standards. However, it expects all visitors to the UK to play by the rules. The UK will always welcome genuine visitors, whether business, tourist, student or family, but will continue to take all steps necessary to protect the security of the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="80710m0002.htm_para13"><a name="080710103000001">In order to ensure appropriate behaviour offenders can earn access to certain privileges, particularly during their time in custody. These advantages must be earned and offenders must take responsibility for their behaviour and take the opportunities for reform offered to them through commitment, hard work, and delivery against the aims of their sentence plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="80710m0002.htm_para14"><a name="08071086000138">The existing Incentives and Earned Privileges (IEP) scheme in prisons is a fundamental part of achieving this. It categorises offenders according to their behaviour into basic, standard and enhanced level, and these levels directly equate to the earned privileges they then have access to. This has been a valuable policy which has played an important part in securing order and control in prisons. There is now a need to build on this and ensure a consistent, firm approach is developed alongside it which sees offenders being required to commit to their own reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="80710m0002.htm_para15"><a name="08071086000145">Under the new proposals offenders will not only need to demonstrate basic compliance, but must show commitment beyond this in both achieving sentence planning objectives and in making reparation to the community wherever the opportunity arises. It is important that the public understand and have confidence in the basis on which prisoners are granted enhanced privileges in custody. The scheme I am announcing will deliver this objective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="80710m0002.htm_para16"><a name="08071086000151">On 21 July 2008, three pilots will commence in prisons and one in the community, all in the West Midlands. The pilots will introduce a standard format for the compacts for evaluation. I also propose an &#147;End of Custody&#148; report for short sentence prisoners which will summarise the offender&#146;s time in custody based on effort and achievement and provide those who have shown commitment to their own improvement with evidence to take into the community. The pilots will run for an initial six months with the aim of rolling out across all prisons and probation next year.</p>

 The Government are today publishing a consultation document and accompanying impact, assessment on the European Commission proposal for a regulation on the CO2 emissions of new cars, putting in place a framework to encourage industry to develop greener, more fuel efficient cars.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="80710m0002.htm_para20"><a name="08071086000157">The UK is urging the Commission to adopt a longer term target of 100 grammes of CO2 per kilometre, as part of the Government&#146;s wider strategy to address the issue of climate change. This proposal has the potential to deliver a cut in CO2 emissions from new cars of about 40 per cent. over the next 12 years, and by 2020 could reduce the running costs for consumers buying new cars by about &#163;500 a year, a particularly important consideration at a time of rising oil prices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="80710m0002.htm_para21"><a name="08071086000159">The European Commission&#146;s own proposals for a target of 130 grammes of CO2 per kilometre by 2012 are expected to deliver annual CO2 savings of just over 6 million tonnes a year in the UK by 2020. Achieving the UK-proposed target of 100 grammes of CO2 per kilometre by 2020 would save an additional 5 million tonnes of CO2 by 2020. In total, this is equivalent to around a third of the total projected CO2 savings from domestic transport, or around 2 per cent. of the UK&#146;s current overall CO2 emissions.</p>

document. The UK strongly supports a move to mandatory CO2 targets for new cars; this would be better for the environment and better for consumers. We would like to see a strong environmental outcome and for this reason we have been taking the lead at the European level for a longer term target of 100 grammes of CO2 per kilometre by 2020 to be added to the regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="80710m0002.htm_para23"><a name="08071086000161">We also want to avoid unfair competitive distortions between car manufacturers. We support the Commission&#146;s approach for setting CO2 targets for individual car manufacturers, and we also welcome the proposed derogation for manufacturers who only sell cars in small volumes. We believe that it is also important to add a provision to the regulation to ensure that &#145;niche&#146;  <br>

manufacturers (those that only make a narrow range of vehicle types) whilst being subject to challenging targets, are not unfairly penalised.</p>

This consultation closes on Friday 3 October 2008, but in the interim the Government will continue their discussion and negotiations at the European level, during which we may have to take further decisions on our negotiating position. We therefore encourage early responses from stakeholders.</p>
