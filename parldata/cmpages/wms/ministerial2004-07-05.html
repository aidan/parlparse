<p><a name="40705m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport  (Tessa Jowell): </b> 
 I have today placed the independent review of BBC Online by Philip Graf in the Libraries of both Houses, together with a copy of the letter I have written to the Chairman of the Governors. The report is also available electronically on the Department&#039;s website www.culture.gov.uk.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40705m01.html_para0">In response to the review, I have asked the BBC to consider all of Philip Graf&#039;s recommendations, and to respond fully by the end of October 2004. I have asked that the Governors&#039; response include a redrafted version of Online&#039;s remit and a statement of how the corporation intends to involve the independent sector along the lines set out by the report.

<p>
<a name="40705m01.html_para2">The reviews will begin immediately and will run concurrently. In accordance with conditions that I laid down when giving my approval for the BBC to develop these new digital services, both reviews will include both a period of public consultation and a market impact study. I have asked both reviewers to submit their reports to me by the end of August 2004.
