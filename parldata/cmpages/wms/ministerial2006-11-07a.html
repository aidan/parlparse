Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Meg Munn):</b> Today I have published the outcome
of the &#147;Review of Planning Enforcement&#148; that has been
carried out by the Department for Communities and Local Government.
There was a high level of response to the review&#151;around 500 of
those consulted sent in replies and recommendations to our questions
about enforcement&#151;whether it was working, and what might be done
to improve
it.</p><p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="61107m0001.htm_para12"><a name="06110741000037">There
was strong agreement amongst consultees that the current statutory
framework for enforcement remains fit for its purpose. There was no
need to introduce stronger provisions, or to make unauthorised
development a criminal offence, and enforcement should remain at the
discretion of local
authorities,</p><p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="61107m0001.htm_para13"><a name="06110741000038">The
introduction of temporary stop notices was an early outcome of the
Review of Planning Enforcement. It is now over eighteen months since we
gave local planning authorities the power to issue a temporary stop
notice to require the immediate cessation of a breach of planning
control for a period of 28 days. This has proved a popular enforcement
tool for local planning authorities. Over 300 were used in 2005-06 to
stop unauthorised development, protect the environment and to speed up
the process of
enforcement.</p><p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="61107m0001.htm_para14"><a name="06110741000039">Temporary
stop notices have proven a welcome and helpful measure in speeding up
the enforcement process. They have been used successfully to stop a
wide variety of unauthorised development, including: damage to listed
buildings, trees, wildlife sites; unauthorised landfill, quarrying,
tipping, processing and storage of waste, clay extraction; building new
houses, flats, garages, barns; Gypsy sites; access roads and
engineering and building
works.</p><p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="61107m0001.htm_para15"><a name="06110741000040">The
review has, however, highlighted that enforcement does not have a high
profile in authorities and that there is a lack of resources and
trained staff working in this area. In taking forward the
recommendations of the review, therefore, our focus is on how we can
encourage and support proactive approaches to enforcement in

complaints about breaches, proactive monitoring, or taking measures
that prevent the necessity of repeated interventions, helps to create a
quality, fully rounded planning service which in turn delivers
sustainable outcomes. I want all authorities to regard enforcement as
an essential element in their
service.</p><p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="61107m0001.htm_para16"><a name="06110741000041">To
that end, we are looking at working with the Planning Advisory Service
and the National Association of Planning Enforcement to provide
opportunities and events that promote the importance of enforcement and
provide workshops and training around some of the key elements. We will
be encouraging authorities to share ideas at these events, with the aim
of producing a benchmark of good practice, and some &#145;golden
rules&#146; of enforcement. And we are working, through our culture
change programme, on identifying training and career structures for
staff working in enforcement, and raising its profile in
authorities.</p><p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="61107m0001.htm_para17"><a name="06110741000042">We
have also accepted recommendations in the review to look at some longer

Guide.</p><p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="61107m0001.htm_para18"><a name="06110741000043">There
are also some areas where we will commission further work, following

with the LGA to see whether there is scope for extending planning fees
to cover aspects of
enforcement.</p><p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="61107m0001.htm_para19"><a name="06110741000044">Publication

three things. First we will improve the way that the system serves the
public interest and meet bereaved families&#146; concerns. The Bill
will give families involved in the inquest process a clear legal
standing in the system. We will also give families new rights through a
new complaints and appeals system, enabling them to challenge a
coroners&#146; decision, and the introduction of a Charter for
Bereaved People which lays out the level of service families can
expect. Secondly we will strengthen coroners&#146; work. The Bill
will establish a proper appointments system for coroners, who will have
to be legally qualified and will have to work full time as coroners,
instead of having another job and working part time as coroners.
Thirdly, we will create a national structure for coroners&#146; work.
For the first time there will be a chief coroner who will provide
national leadership for coroners, as the Lord Chief Justice does for
judges. This will be supported by national standards, a coronial
advisory council, a proper inspection system and national training for
coroners and their
officers.</p><p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="61107m0001.htm_para26"><a name="06110741000053">I

not record sufficient detail to allow distinction between procedures to
remove tattoos and procedures to treat other skin conditions. The
answer was based on a mistaken attempt to estimate the number of
tattoos from the information on the wider grouping of skin procedures.
That attempt was intended to be helpful, but ended up being misleading
because it is not possible from the existing data sets to say with any
precision how many tattoos are removed by the NHS each year, and
secondly, because clinical advice is that it is likely to be a far
smaller number than the figure

Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality (Mr.
Liam Byrne):</b> I am today announcing changes which the Home
Office is making to the Highly Skilled Migrant
Programme.</p><p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="61107m0002.htm_para9"><a name="06110741000142">We
believe that properly managed migration is in the interests of the UK
and that we should aim to attract the brightest and the best from
around the globe. The Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP), which
was launched in 2002, has played a crucial role in ensuring that we do
this. It allows individuals with exceptional skills to come to the
United Kingdom to seek work or opportunities for self-employment.
Highly skilled migrants contribute to the economy and help to create
opportunities for UK workers. The UK has benefited from the
contribution which they make and it is important that we continue to do
so.</p><p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="61107m0002.htm_para10"><a name="06110741000143">That
is why we are making changes to the programme today, which will build
on its past success to make it more effective in attracting the most
highly skilled migrants to the UK. We will do this by introducing more
objective and transparent criteria which lead to the award of points
under the scheme. Some of the current points scoring criteria are
subjective, and so are difficult for prospective applicants to measure
themselves against and for caseworkers to judge. We are replacing them
with a set of more objective attributes, which will award points for
previous academic and professional qualifications, previous earnings,
and age, as well as bonus points for previous work (or study, in some
cases) in the UK. Holders of MBA degrees from certain institutions will
still be able to receive all of the points necessary to be approved,
for having that qualification. We are also introducing a mandatory
English language requirement, outside the points structure, for both
initial and extension applications under HSMP. It is right that those
who come to work in highly skilled jobs should be able to speak
English, which is integral to labour market
success.</p><p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="61107m0002.htm_para11"><a name="06110741000144">We
are also making a change to the requirements for those who have already
been granted leave under HSMP and who apply to extend it. The current
extension test is that applicants should have taken all reasonable
steps to become lawfully economically active in the UK. We are
replacing this with a points test and a mandatory English language
requirement, similar to those faced by applicants applying to the
programme for the first time. These tests will make it easier to
curtail abuse within the scheme and will ensure that applicants who are
granted further leave under the HSMP have demonstrated their ability to
make a contribution to our
economy.</p><p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="61107m0002.htm_para12"><a name="06110741000145">I
am also announcing new rules relating to the verification of documents
submitted in HSMP applications. This will give entry clearance officers
and caseworkers three key new
powers:</p><a name="61107m0002.htm_brev0"><a name="06110741000146"><ul><p class="tabletext">We
will specify the documents which applicants are required to provide as
evidence of their points claims and of their English language ability.
This is to ensure that we are able to verify documents independently,
and will help to discourage abusive applications. It will also make the
application process easier for &#145;bona fide&#146; applicants,
maintaining the UK&#146;s competitive advantage as a destination for
high achievers.</p></ul><br>

applications outright when documents which are not genuine have been
submitted, whether or not they are material to the application. Such
applicants should not be able to qualify under the scheme and are
unlikely to benefit the
UK.</p></ul><a name="61107m0002.htm_brev2"><a name="06110741000148"><ul><p class="tabletext">We will
also be able to refuse cases where we have reasonable grounds to
suspect that documents are not genuine, which remain after we have
applied verification
checks.</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="61107m0002.htm_para13"><a name="06110741000149">These
policies will not disadvantage genuine applicants, but will help to
ensure that the scheme is both robust against abuse and targeted
towards those who will benefit the
UK.</p><p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="61107m0002.htm_para14"><a name="06110741000150">We
will make sure that the amended programme is kept under
review.</p><p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="61107m0002.htm_para15"><a name="06110741000151">As
of tomorrow, the current HSMP rules will be deleted and the programme
will then be suspended for 27 days. We are taking these steps to avoid
a rush of speculative applications by people who would wish their
applications to be considered under the old rules, which is what
happened after the publication of the Command Paper on the points-based
system. The suspension will enable us to make the transition
effectively to the new rules and ensure that current levels of customer
service are maintained when the new arrangements are introduced. In the
interests of good customer service, we have made sure that this will
not disadvantage applicants substantively. Applications made for leave
to remain under HSMP during the suspension period will not be returned;
they will be accepted as valid and will be considered against the new
rules after the suspension period. This means that nobody&#146;s
leave will expire because of the suspension, provided that they make
in-time applications. Migrants in this situation will also be given the
chance to submit new evidence to show that they meet the new rules.
Guidance on the new arrangements will be published
tomorrow.</p><p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="61107m0002.htm_para16"><a name="06110741000152">We
also recognise that there will be people who are currently working or
self-employed in the UK, but who may not be able to meet the new test
for extending their leave. Many of these people will have been of real
benefit to the UK, and we do not want to lose their contribution. We
are therefore introducing specific transitional arrangements for people
who have been self-employed or working as an independent contractor,
but who will not be able to extend their leave under the new test. For
people who have been employed, but cannot extend their leave under
HSMP, we will make it easier for them to switch into work permit
employment.</p><p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="61107m0002.htm_para17"><a name="06110741000153">These
changes are good for applicants, because they will make the application
process easier, clearer and more objective. They are good for the UK,
because they will keep us competitive in attracting skilled workers who
will be successful in the labour market. And they are good for
employers, who will be more able to recruit highly skilled migrants.
They will therefore bring HSMP closer in line with the
Government&#146;s aims for migration, including supporting an
objective set by the IND Review to &#145;boost Britain&#146;s
economy by bringing the right skills here from around the
world&#146;. These changes will ensure that the HSMP remains one of
our flagship immigration schemes. And I am confident that they will
help us to maintain public confidence in our immigration system, and to
make the case for managed migration where it is in the interests of the
UK.</p><br>
