In response to proposals from some member states to create a permanent EU body that could react quickly to disasters, the Foreign Minister suggested that the EU should analyse lessons learned from Haiti before drawing any conclusions on possible new permanent structures. The High Representative agreed. In the short-term, Ministers agreed to establish a small cell of officials in Brussels to co-ordinate military and civil deployments to Haiti, while leaving open the possibility of moving it to the field at a later date.</p>

Discussion would focus on the key themes of security, development and governance and the regional framework/international architecture. He emphasised that EU support would be essential to secure a strong communiqué, and hoped that the EU would prioritise work to upgrade the delivery of its civilian effort, including through swift implementation of the EU action plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Minister also stressed that Pakistan was a priority too: the upcoming summit would be key to EU-Pakistan relations and the EU should encourage Pakistan to work with it to develop a five-year engagement plan.</p>

 The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence, my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Bill Rammell), the Minister responsible for the armed forces, and I wish to make the latest in the series of quarterly statements to the House about the inquests of service personnel and others who have died overseas. We continue to hold in the highest possible regard all of our service personnel who are or have been involved in the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our deepest sympathies lie, of course, with the families of those personnel who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. It is again a cause of particular sadness that since our last statement a further 28 service personnel have lost their lives in Afghanistan.</p>

The coroner transfers inquests for service personnel to a coroner closer to the bereaved family, where possible. It is helpful that the district continues to benefit from the experience and expertise of David Masters, who retired as coroner on 31 March 2009 but has been appointed as an assistant deputy coroner by his successor, David Ridley.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="100202m0001.htm_para41"><a name="10020247000056">There are 113 open inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel who died in Iraq and Afghanistan whose bodies were repatriated after 1 April 2007 (55 involving deaths in the last six months). Of these, Mr. Ridley has retained 56 inquests, whilst 53 inquests are being conducted by coroners closer to the next of kin, and four inquest transfers are pending. At 25 January, two recent fatalities had been repatriated but the inquests were yet to be opened. Two recent fatalities awaited repatriation and inquest opening.
