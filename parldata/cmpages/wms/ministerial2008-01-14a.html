 The Government are today announcing the allocation of an additional &#163;11.5 million to the Disabled Facilities Grant programme for 2007-08. The programme has proved to be highly successful with funding to local authorities more than doubling from &#163;57 million in 1997 to &#163;138 million now. These additional funds for the current year will help assist local authorities in meeting existing demand for the provision of adaptations. A table detailing the additional funds provided to individual authorities has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

 The Harrier GR9 and the Tornado GR4 are both currently providing invaluable support to our forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have signed two contracts on 21 December 2007, appointing BAES as the Prime Contractor, which will deliver further significant capability upgrades to both the Harrier GR9 and the Tornado GR4. Under the programmes, both aircraft will receive improved secure communications and tactical data links, and the Paveway IV precision-guided bomb will be integrated on to Tornado. These upgrades will enhance the ability of these aircraft to support future operations by improving survivability, increasing situational awareness and lowering the risk of fratricide and collateral damage. The combined value of the programmes, through life, is &#163;548 million.</p>
