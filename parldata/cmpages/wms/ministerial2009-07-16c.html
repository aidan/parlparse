 My noble Friend, The Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs, Lord Young of Norwood Green, at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has made the following statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="90716m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09071651000070"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="90716m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09071651000072">The theme of this informal meeting was labour market inclusion looking ahead to post-2010. The informal looked at maintaining employment and promoting mobility, upgrading skills and matching with labour market needs and increasing access to employment. Working time was also discussed over a Ministers-only lunch which I attended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="90716m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09071651000073">In the opening session, member states agreed on the importance of active social security and labour market policies. They stressed the importance of ensuring help for those moving between jobs and those already outside the labour market. While the crisis tested member states&#146; resolve to conduct further reforms, now was the time to prepare Europe for the economy of the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="90716m0001.htm_para4"><a name="09071651000074">Following on from the opening session, the meeting was split into three workshops, each devoted to a specific challenge: Workshop 1&#151;Managing the impact of the financial crisis by increasing access to employment, Workshop 2&#151;Facilitating access to employment by efficient reforms in the labour market and Workshop 3&#151;Increasing employment through an active social security policy. I participated in Workshop 3 to present the UK approach to the reform of incapacity benefit and said that reform was ongoing. Others member states warned against repeating the mistakes of the past that caused long-term structural damage to economies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="90716m0001.htm_para5"><a name="09071651000075">The presidency concluded that it saw these discussions as feeding into its work on the post-2010 strategy. The commission concurred. While the current Lisbon strategy remained the right framework for action, its forthcoming revision would need to take better account of the social dimension. The commission would set out initial views in its forthcoming consultation document.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="90716m0001.htm_para6"><a name="09071651000076">The meeting concluded with a private Ministers-only lunch discussion on the working time directive. Following the failure of negotiations on the directive, some member states insisted that any new proposal would need to deal with the opt-out. The UK along with Germany, Poland and others disagreed. A few member states urged caution   <br>

and saw no point in proceeding if failure was clear from the outset. The Commission underlined the need to respect European Union law. Preliminary discussions would be needed with the European Parliament before deciding how to proceed. The presidency concluded that the majority of member states use the opt-out but that a way forward would need to be found.&#148;</p>

The Government have published clear guidance to enable local authorities and other agencies to make effective use of the wide range of enforcement powers available to them. They now look to local authorities to be proactive in taking the lead in addressing the shortfall by identifying, in consultation with local communities, appropriate locations for sites which will have the twin benefits of creating homes for Gypsies and Travellers, and reducing the number of unauthorised developments which can be the cause of local community tensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="90716m0001.htm_para45"><a name="09071651000124">The identification of authorised sites will also enable local authorities to reduce the costs of enforcement action related to unauthorised encampments, as well as providing access to even stronger enforcement powers when there are available pitches to which unauthorised campers can be moved. The savings from the reduction in enforcement action can then be deployed to other services to the benefit of the broader community, or reduced levels of council tax.</p>

Our definition of &#147;energy use&#148; will cover both energy uses currently regulated by the Building Regulations and other energy used in the home. Homes meeting the new requirements will be cheaper to run because of high energy efficiency requirements, and occupants will be less vulnerable to rising gas and electricity prices. These homes will have better controls, including smart meters, so that people can more easily manage and reduce energy use. Technology for people to generate their own low carbon heat and electricity, with payments for surpluses will be designed and built into new zero-carbon homes or developments as a matter of course.</p>

Our consultation quoted two standards to illustrate our ambitions in this area. Respondents welcomed the proposition that energy efficiency should be the first priority, although many argued that the standards quoted were not suitable as a minimum regulatory standard to apply to every new home in England and that we do not have an appropriate established energy efficiency standard for the purpose of zero-carbon homes. I accept this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="90716m0002.htm_para14"><a name="09071651000141">I have decided to set that level to be as ambitious as possible for on-site carbon mitigation, while being technically achievable. This will therefore be 70 per cent. of regulated energy use, based on the assumptions laid out in our consultation document. We will consider updating this as necessary in the light of technical changes, such as developments to the standard assessment procedure energy assessment tool, to maintain this overall level of ambition and provide continued certainty to industry.</p>

I have decided to indicate now those approaches that commanded broad support. We will consider with stakeholders the practical arrangements that would be required to permit them to be put in place and to ensure that standards are achieved in practice.

For the next two years I am providing &#163;60 million start up funding from the growth fund for this work for the four locations identified today. This is additional to mainstream funding for services. We expect that the bulk of investment in these schemes will be from the private sector, but eco-towns will also benefit from similar levels of public investment to any comparable large housing scheme and this will include continued growth funding over the period of major development.</p>

    On 15 May 2008, <i>Official Report</i>, column 66WS, my predecessor announced 
    that Headquarters Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (HQ ARRC) and its intimate supporting 
    elements would move to Innsworth in Gloucestershire in the summer of 2010. 
    At that time Cosford in Shropshire was our preferred site for 1 Signal Brigade 
    (1 Sig Bde) and 102 Logistic Brigade (102 Log Bde) and our aim was to close 
    Rhine Garrison and Munster Station by 2015. This would leave three enduring

The programme team responsible for the moves from Germany to the UK has therefore examined alternative site solutions and today I am announcing that the preferred site for 1 Sig Bde is now Stafford. This decision will need to be confirmed following scrutiny of the detailed plans for the move and the programme team will now focus on drawing up these plans, which will include a competition for the infrastructure and construction requirements at Stafford, with a view to occupation from 2013. The team will continue to consult all interested parties including the local county and borough councils, health and education providers and the trade unions.</p>

Stafford is already the home of 22 Signal Regiment (22 Sig Regt) and moving other elements of 1 Sig Bde (7 and 16 Sig Regts) there provides a synergy that will be important to the Department and should also be beneficial to the local community.</p>

DEDP 09 sets out the authoritative framework, looking forward to 2030, for the coherent development of the estate to meet the future needs of defence, and the priorities for investment and rationalisation arising from it.

Today&#146;s Green Paper sets out the next step in this process. We would like to see an enduring shift in the way in which public bodies think about the armed forces community, so that their special circumstances are taken into account at all stages, from policy formation to service delivery.

In these areas the Devolved Administrations will wish to consider the responses to this consultation in respect of devolved matters and determine a way forward that is appropriate for them, in consultation with their strategic partners.

 In July last year DEFRA launched an open consultation to seek the views of a range of stakeholders on the principle of whether some members of National Park and Broads Authorities should be directly elected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="90716m0003.htm_para25"><a name="09071651000195">The majority of the national park authorities&#146; membership comprises local authority and parish councillors selected by their respective councils, with the remainder being appointed by the Secretary of State in recognition of the national interest. The Broads Authority has a different membership structure under its own primary legislation to reflect the broads&#146; navigational interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="90716m0003.htm_para26"><a name="09071651000196">During the passage of the Broads Authority Private Bill the question arose of whether there should be parish members on the Broads Authority. As a result this issue was included in the consultation on direct elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="90716m0003.htm_para27"><a name="09071651000197">A total of 490 responses were received to the consultation. The strongest support for the principle of direct elections came from respondents within the Broads Authority and New Forest national parks for reasons of local democracy and local representation in relation to planning decisions, but there was very little support for larger authorities to accommodate directly elected members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="90716m0003.htm_para28"><a name="09071651000198">Most stakeholders considered that direct elections would not lead to any improved effectiveness or efficiency of national park authorities, including the authorities themselves. Many national park authorities, local authorities and parish councils expressed concern that direct elections in place of their members would have the effect of disenfranchising the local authorities and parish councils which the park authorities work with leading to the effect of serious repercussions in relation to their influence with other bodies, particularly at regional and national level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="90716m0003.htm_para29"><a name="09071651000199">There appeared to be no consensus on which category of members to replace to accommodate directly elected members. All categories of members have provided a significant contribution to the effective working of the Authorities. However, many individuals who live in the parks and MPs have raised the issue of democratic accountability and local representation for local communities in the parks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="90716m0003.htm_para30"><a name="09071651000200">I have been impressed with the range of community engagement that already occurs, and having carefully considered the responses I have decided not to make any changes to the current membership arrangements. I am proposing ways of improving the accountability of the national park authorities and to apply more consistently some of the examples of best practice across all parks.</p>

 I am today announcing the Government&#146;s response to the Law Commission&#146;s report on Housing: Proportionate Dispute Resolution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="90716m0005.htm_para5"><a name="09071651000261">The Law Commission published its report on 13 May 2008. This follows a major programme of work on the reform of housing law. Unlike most other Law Commission reports, this report does not focus solely on reform of substantive law but rather looks at the broader social issues of how housing problems arise and how they might be better addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="90716m0005.htm_para6"><a name="09071651000262">The report makes recommendations in three broad areas: (i) better advice and assistance (ii) non-formal (that is, not involving a court or tribunal) dispute resolution and (iii) formal dispute resolution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="90716m0005.htm_para7"><a name="09071651000263">The Government broadly accept all of the Commission&#146;s recommendations on the provision of better advice and assistance. Substantial progress has already been made in improving advice provision and encouraging early engagement, for example, by promoting and signposting court users to the community legal advice helpline and the community legal advice website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"><a name="90716m0005.htm_para8"><a name="09071651000264">The report recommends that promotion of mediation and alternative dispute resolution is an important component of non-formal dispute resolution. The Government are committed to promoting mediation and using alternative dispute resolution as a tool to ensure court action is a last resort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="90716m0005.htm_para9"><a name="09071651000265">The Law Commission also recommends the transfer of jurisdiction for a number of different types of cases, including stand-alone disrepair cases, from county courts to tribunals.

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="90716m0005.htm_para10"><a name="09071651000266">The Government also reject the Law Commission&#146;s recommendation that the county court should have powers to grant interim relief pending the outcome of a local authority internal review in homelessness cases. It is usual for parties to have to exhaust all alternative remedies before coming to court. This is a key feature of our policy of encouraging early resolution of disputes/problems, with the court only being used in the last resort. Local authorities are empowered to take decisions on homelessness applications and there are statutory procedures that are in place to ensure that this is done fairly. The Government consider that there is a significant risk that any changes in this area would be exploited to circumvent these procedures to the detriment of those who are genuinely homeless and in priority need.</p>

 The tribunals service was created in April 2006, bringing together the administrative support for over 23 tribunals from across government into a single organisation so that tribunals were visibly independent of original decision makers, and to bring improved quality and efficiency in the provision of administrative and management support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"><a name="90716m0005.htm_para12"><a name="09071651000269">The provisions of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007&#151;TCE Act&#151; followed these administrative changes and created a new judicial and legal framework, bringing together a range of formerly separate tribunals into a new unified two-tier tribunal structure&#151;the first-tier and upper tribunal&#151;under a senior president, Lord Justice Carnwath. The first-tier and the upper tribunal were established under the TCE Act on 3 November 2008, with the first-tier tribunal being the first-instance tribunal for most jurisdictions. The upper tribunal mainly, but not exclusively, reviews and decides appeals from the first-tier tribunal. It also has the power to deal with judicial review work delegated from the High Courts of England and Wales and Northern Ireland and from the Court of Session.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"><a name="90716m0005.htm_para13"><a name="09071651000270">The TCE Act has provided a cohesive statutory framework for a unified tribunal system dealing with nearly 600,000 cases a year which is committed to improvement and innovation for the benefit of the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"><a name="90716m0005.htm_para14"><a name="09071651000271">The TCE Act also contains provisions for the jurisdictions of most existing tribunals administered by the tribunals service to transfer into the new two-tier structure. The main exception to this is the system of employment tribunals, which will remain as a distinct pillar within the tribunals system. The structure is designed to be flexible so that, in the future, when Parliament decides to create a new appeal right or jurisdiction, it will not be necessary to create a new tribunal to administer it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="90716m0005.htm_para15"><a name="09071651000272">Both the first-tier and upper tribunal are divided into chambers that group together jurisdictions, and their judiciary, dealing with like subjects or where  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_370"><a name="90716m0005.htm_para18"><a name="09071651000275">Everyone who holds a judicial office within the tribunals service, including those who have or will be transferred into one of the new chambers, have been asked to take the oath of allegiance. So far 2,622 judges have taken the oath.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"><a name="90716m0005.htm_para19"><a name="09071651000276">The new judicial structure allows for the flexible deployment of judges, known as &#147;cross ticketing&#148;, within and across the new chambers. This will mean that suitably qualified judiciary can hear cases in jurisdictions other than the one to which they were first appointed without the need for a further Judicial Appointments Commission competition. This will reduce the costs of training and support. It will also enable the flexible deployment of judiciary to meet fluctuations in workloads between jurisdictions; it will encourage greater consistency of standards and approach across previously disparate jurisdictions; it will assist where there are difficulties in finding judges for particular locations and where there are recruitment difficulties in smaller jurisdictions. Working with the judiciary, the tribunals service has identified &#163;6 million of efficiency savings relating to judicial activity in 2009-10 in areas such as reducing adjournments and more effective deployment of judges. A further &#163;10 million in 2010-11 is now being sought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"><a name="90716m0005.htm_para20"><a name="09071651000277">The judges within this new structure are currently subject to widely differing rates of remuneration inherited from the tribunals from which they have transferred or will transfer and which have or will be abolished. Under the existing arrangements, therefore, many office holders will find themselves doing effectively the same job as each other for what would be unequal pay. This would hamper effective operation of the system and the delivery of efficiencies as well as leave pay inequalities in place. To address these issues, in March 2007 the Government commissioned the Senior Salaries Review Body to propose a pay structure for the tribunals judiciary following implementation of the TCE Act. The SSRB delivered its report No.66, Review of Tribunals&#146; Judiciary Remuneration, in November 2008. The report includes 18 recommendations and proposes a single salary structure for tribunals judiciary linked to that already in operation for the courts judiciary and some tribunal judges. The report and the Government&#146;s response to each of the 18 recommendations have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="90716m0005.htm_para21"><a name="09071651000278">The Government broadly accept those SSRB recommendations in relation to legally-qualified salaried and fee-paid tribunals judiciary, as an important step in  <br>

supporting the tribunals service and the new judicial structure. Addressing the issues identified by the SSRB enables the tribunals system to operate as effectively and efficiently as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"><a name="90716m0005.htm_para22"><a name="09071651000279">While the Government recognise and support the important role played by non-legally qualified members, it has decided not to implement those recommendations that apply to non-legal members. In taking this decision, account was taken of the level of increases being recommended by the SSRB and the lack of market-based justification in the current economic and public expenditure climate. The Government will be prepared to review any specific recruitment and retention issues, which might arise, with any targeted salary or fee supplements being paid at the discretion of the Lord Chancellor. The Government will keep under review the arguments for drawing a link between the pay of fee-paid and salaried judiciary and that of non-legal members in the light of recruitment and retention data and the overall economic climate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"><a name="90716m0005.htm_para23"><a name="09071651000280">The impact of this new pay structure will see no change for over 92 per cent. of the salaried judiciary and 37 per cent. of legally qualified fee-paid members. Non-legally qualified members pay will be unaffected by these changes. Pay costs are expected to be no more than &#163;160,000 in the current year and &#163;400,000 incrementally in the remaining four transitional years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="90716m0005.htm_para24"><a name="09071651000281">The creation of the tribunals service and the implementation of the TCE Act have been major steps in delivering improved services to tribunal users and a more effective and efficient system. Rationalisation of the judicial structure and, as a consequence, judicial pay is a key part of that.</p>

of the Criminal Defence Service. Funding will be available to prisoners with serious concerns about their treatment under the civil scheme, subject to passing the relevant civil funding code criteria.

This follows the rise in failed judicial review applications, many of which are funded through legal aid.

 Revised operational guidance to police forces on the issue of penalty notices for disorder for retail theft and criminal damage has been published today. Copies will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

The latest version of the guidance was issued in March 2005. In view of concerns raised over the inappropriate use of PNDs, we have now issued strengthened revised guidance on retail theft. This restricts use of the disposal to first-time offenders who are not substance mis-users where the value of goods stolen is less than &#163;100 or where damage caused is less than &#163;300. The definition of retail theft has also been tightened to ensure that the disposal can be considered only for cases of shoplifting where normally the goods recovered are fit for re-sale.</p>

This is recognised in the FOI Act by provision at section 46 for guidance to be issued in the form of a code of practice. The first code of practice was issued in November 2002, nearly seven years ago. Much has changed since then, not least the increased use of information technology to create, store, share and publish records and other information. These changes have made it necessary to update the guidance and today the Lord Chancellor is issuing a revised code of practice.</p>

 I have today published the 10th report of the independent Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. The report provides an account of the work of the committee in giving advice about appointments that Ministers and senior Crown servants wish to take up after leaving office. The report covers the period 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009. Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

It has recently completed a public consultation exercise on the revised codes of practice, and on all public authorities able to use certain techniques regulated in RIPA, the ranks at which those techniques can be authorised, and the purposes for which they can be used.

<p><a name="st_131"><a name="09071651001148"><a name="90716m0009.htm_spmin2"><a name="09071651001403"><b>The Prime Minister (Mr. Gordon Brown):</b>
 I am today laying before the House the Government&#146;s &#147;Road to 2010&#148; plan (Cm 7675). This is a strategy that will lead us into the 2010 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) review conference and beyond. The &#147;Road to 2010&#148; covers every dimension of the nuclear issues that are facing us today and sets out how the UK will play a leading role in tackling them. Next year&#146;s conference provides an opportunity to renew and re-invigorate the bargain at the heart of the NPT which grants states access to civil nuclear power in return for a commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons, and places a responsibility on nuclear weapons states to show leadership on the question of disarmament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"><a name="90716m0009.htm_para6"><a name="09071651001149">The UK remains committed to the reduction and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons, and to ensuring that nations have access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. All states, including Iran and North Korea, have a right to such access&#151;and we are ready to help, so long as these states reject the development of nuclear weapons. To promote the development of cost-effective civil nuclear technology which cannot be diverted for use in weapons programmes, we are launching a nuclear science centre of excellence. This centre will enhance collaborations between academia, industry and Government, both domestically and internationally, to focus on this important and difficult task. The Government are committing &#163;20 million over the first five years to this centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_402"><a name="90716m0009.htm_para7"><a name="09071651001150">All nuclear material must be held securely, to prevent it falling into the hands of terrorist groups or hostile states. The UK believes that nuclear security must become the fourth pillar of the global nuclear framework, alongside civil power, non-proliferation and disarmament. Momentum for greater nuclear security is growing, with President Obama announcing a nuclear security summit in the spring of next year, which the UK will take a full part in. In order to help reduce the risk that material will be lost or stolen, the UK is making an offer to assist any nation with security improvements should they request our help. This assistance could be in the form of using our expertise to strengthen security, for example through improving facilities or through training personnel. To improve our defensive measures, the Government are also providing an additional &#163;3 million to maintain our world-leading forensics and detection capability at the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE).</p>

enable progress on non-proliferation and multilateral disarmament. In the first instance, steps must be taken to improve transparency of current weapons capabilities, as we seek greater control to prevent expansion of those capabilities. The second stage is verifiable multilateral reductions in arsenals. Finally, we must work globally both to establish the security conditions that will enable a world free from nuclear weapons and to overcome the technical and policy challenges associated with the complete abolition of nuclear weapons. For our part, as soon as it becomes useful for our arsenal to be included in a broader negotiation, Britain stands ready to participate and to act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_405"><a name="90716m0009.htm_para10"><a name="09071651001153">There is growing momentum across the globe to tackle these strategic challenges. The UK has been a civil and military nuclear power for many decades and so we have a great deal of expertise to offer. As we head towards next year&#146;s NPT review conference, I am committed to making the UK a leading nation in the drive to develop credible answers to the nuclear questions that face us today. It is vital that we make progress&#151;I believe this strategy sets out what the UK can do alone and in partnership with other countries in the period up to the conference and beyond to bring us the security and prosperity we seek in the decades to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_415"><a name="90716m0010.htm_para2"><a name="09071651001246">The failure of XL leisure group in September 2008 and the effects of the recession have caused serious financial difficulties for the air travel trust fund (ATTF), which meets the insolvency protection costs of the ATOL scheme. To help address this, between April and June this year, the CAA consulted on possible increases to the ATOL protection contribution (APC) paid by travel companies to the ATTF. The consultation looked at a range of possible increases to the current charge of &#163;1 per passenger to between &#163;2.50 and &#163;3.50 per passenger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_416"><a name="90716m0010.htm_para3"><a name="09071651001247">Following the consultation, the CAA provided advice to the Secretary of State recommending the APC be increased from &#163;1 to &#163;2.50 per passenger with effect from 1st October 2009. After careful consideration, I have decided to approve the recommended increase. I am aware of the extra burden this will place on travel companies and consumers at difficult times, which is why I have agreed to an increase at the bottom of the range consulted on by the CAA. I believe this strikes the right balance between ensuring the future financial stability of the ATTF while keeping additional burdens on travel companies and consumers as low as practicable. I believe that &#163;2.50 for the protection that ATOL provides represents a good deal for consumers&#151;it is cheaper than stand-alone airline failure insurance and represents less than 0.5 per cent. of the average ATOL holiday price. The CAA intends to review the rate of the APC before the ATTF moves into surplus, projected to be by the spring of 2012.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_417"><a name="90716m0010.htm_para4"><a name="09071651001248">The increased APC will allow the ATTF access to additional commercial credit facilities which will benefit from an increased and extended Government guarantee that the Government have agreed to in principle. The Government also intend to consult on reforms to the ATOL system in the autumn to make it fairer and more understandable for consumers. A copy of the CAA&#146;s advice to the Secretary of State and a summary of consultation responses will be placed in the House Library.</p>
