ECOFIN agreed that, to safeguard banking sector stability, measures to deal with impaired assets could usefully complement agreed instruments, consistent with principles set in October 2008. ECOFIN will continue to monitor this issue closely.

 This is to announce a new procedure where HMRC suspect that there are serious indirect tax irregularities, knowing involvement in transactions that form part of a Missing Trader Intra Community (MTIC) fraud and have reason to believe dishonest conduct has occurred, where neither criminal investigation nor the Civil Investigation of Fraud procedure outlined in Code of Practice 9(2005) is appropriate.</p>

 I am today placing in the House Library two reports that were published on Monday 16 February 2009 which form an important part of our overall approach to removing unnecessary bureaucracy in policing. These are &#147;Reducing the Data Burden on Police Forces in England and Wales&#148; by Sir David Normington, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, and the interim report by Jan Berry, the new independent Reducing Bureaucracy Advocate, entitled &#147;Reducing Bureaucracy in Policing&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="90223m0002.htm_para4"><a name="0902233000141">On the same day the Home Secretary announced the next step in common sense policing, by scrapping a police timesheet freeing up an estimated 260,000 police hours to focus on cutting crime and driving up public confidence. Police officers will no longer have to complete an annual analysis form accounting for their activity&#151;a step which alone frees up approximately 150 extra officers and staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="90223m0002.htm_para5"><a name="0902233000142">Both these documents form part of our overall approach to reducing the burdens placed on police forces and reforming processes to free up officers to deal with the issues that matter to people. The Government have rightly committed themselves to freeing up police time to work with communities to tackle the issues that matter to local people. This involves cutting red tape  <br>

and dramatically reducing administrative tasks that can take up so much time&#151;including the collection of data by the Home Office and others. This agenda was at the heart of the Policing Green Paper, &#147;From the Neighbourhood to the National: Policing our Communities Together&#148;, published in July last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="90223m0002.htm_para6"><a name="0902233000143">The Green Paper set out a clear commitment to reduce the data collection burden placed on police forces in England and Wales and Sir David Normington&#146;s review sets out how the Green Paper&#146;s commitment to reduce by up to 50 per cent. the amount of data collected by the Home Office are to be achieved.</p>

We have now committed &#163;80 million to delivering an ambitious target to put in place 30,000 mobile data devices by March 2010, and the second round of funding awards were announced on 29 December 2008.</p>

Recent falls in the investment portfolio of the General Lighthouse Fund have reduced the capacity of the fund to defer or spread these increases in dues, which are being kept to the minimum necessary to deliver next year&#146;s funding requirement. The Government have a statutory responsibility to ensure that the fund is maintained at an appropriate level to meet the operating requirements of the General Lighthouse Authorities. Failure to deliver safe maritime conditions would adversely affect the business interests of commercial enterprises and the safety of vessels and their crews.</p>

A payment is valid for a rolling month from the day of payment. Through this consultation we are seeking views on a range of options for raising the necessary money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="90223m0003.htm_para7"><a name="0902233000213">We have worked with the shipping industry over many years to reduce the costs of providing general aids to navigation and the General Lighthouse Authorities are rightly proud of their operational and financial performance where light dues rates have not had to rise since 1993 and have actually fallen by over 40 per cent. against RPI over that period. This has been achieved through major efficiency gains made by the General Lighthouse Authorities resulting in lower operational costs of over 20 per cent. in the last decade. We will continue to work with the industry and the General Lighthouse Authorities further to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the service.</p>
