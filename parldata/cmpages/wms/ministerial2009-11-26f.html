 My noble Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, Lord Mandelson, has today made the following statement.</p>
<a name="91126m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="09112624000400"><ul><p class="tabletext">I am today announcing the publication of the UK Composite Strategy.</p>
</ul><a name="91126m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="09112624000401"><ul><p class="tabletext">Fulfilling a commitment made in our policy document "New Industry, New Jobs", this strategy sets out the role Government have to play to help build a globally competitive composites industry here in the UK.</p>
</ul><a name="91126m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="09112624000402"><ul><p class="tabletext">Advanced composites, such as carbon fibre, are light-weight, higher performance materials. Their use to reduce weight in automotive, aerospace and other transport applications can deliver savings in running costs and more significantly, carbon emissions-helping increase resource efficiency and drive our shift to low carbon vehicles. The strength and stiffness of advanced composites also make them an ideal material for the production of the new generation of larger wind turbines.</p>
</ul><a name="91126m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="09112624000403"><ul><p class="tabletext">The UK already has a developed expertise in using composites in aerospace and high-performance cars, but future significant growth in the composite industry will be driven by more mass market, high volume cost effective production. Government's new composite strategy comprises a package of measures to strengthen Britain's composites capability, to build its composites capacity and to improve the sector's sustainability. Our aim is to enable more UK manufacturers to secure an increased share of this growing market.</p>
</ul><a name="91126m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="09112624000404"><ul><p class="tabletext">The strategy includes proposals to:</p>
</ul><a name="91126m0001.htm_brev5"><a name="09112624000405"><ul><p class="tabletext">Strengthen leadership in the fragmented composites sector through the establishment of a composite leadership forum. A BIS Minister will chair this forum, which will involve key companies and industry stakeholders;</p>
</ul><a name="91126m0001.htm_brev6"><a name="09112624000406"><ul><p class="tabletext">Develop future technical and manufacturing capabilities in composites through a more coordinated approach to skills development;</p>
</ul><a name="91126m0001.htm_brev7"><a name="09112624000407"><ul><p class="tabletext">Raise awareness of the cross-sector commercial opportunities composites present through a supply chain initiative. This will be led by the regional development authorities alongside the composite centres of excellence;</p>
</ul><a name="91126m0001.htm_brev8"><a name="09112624000408"><ul><p class="tabletext">Develop rapid manufacturing capability, with Government investment of £16 million to create a cross-sectoral national composite centre in the Bristol region. The centre will deliver world-class innovation in the design and cost-effective rapid production of composites across all sectors. A £6 million Technology Strategy Board challenge will also be set to spark innovation solutions in this area;</p>
</ul><a name="91126m0001.htm_brev9"><a name="09112624000409"><ul><p class="tabletext">Increase sustainability and recycling of composites, with a new consortium of Government, business and other key stakeholders to prioritise work on issues such as improving recycling processes and applications for recyclate.</p>
</ul><a name="91126m0001.htm_brev10"><a name="09112624000410"><ul><p class="tabletext">As the market evolves, so will our approach. We will continue to work with businesses, industry bodies, trade unions, academics, regional development agencies and devolved Administrations to deliver these proposals.</p>
</ul><a name="91126m0001.htm_brev11"><a name="09112624000411"><ul><p class="tabletext">Further details of the strategy will be available to the House later today.</p>

commitments made in the Government's response to the Matthew Taylor review published on 25 March 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="91126m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09112624000040">In September 2007, the Prime Minister asked the hon. Member to undertake a review on how land use and planning can better support rural businesses and deliver affordable housing and to report to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Minister of State for Housing and Planning. The final report of the review, with detailed recommendations, was published in July 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="91126m0001.htm_para9"><a name="09112624000041">Our response welcomed the review and set out our proposals to take forward most of the review's 48 recommendations to continue to encourage a prosperous rural economy and improve the delivery of affordable rural homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="91126m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09112624000042">The Rural Masterplanning Fund prospectus invites rural local planning authorities to bid for expert technical support to assist them in masterplanning to achieve the sustainable expansion of small or medium-sized settlements, and sets out the terms of the competition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="91126m0001.htm_para11"><a name="09112624000043">The consultation paper seeks views on our draft guidance to local authorities on how to encourage landowners to bring forward land for affordable housing in rural areas. The guidance proposes: either allowing landowners the ability to refer family members or employees for tenancies to a percentage of the homes provided on their land, as long as they meet housing need and local connection criteria; or allowing them to keep the freehold of the land while leasing it to a housing association.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="91126m0001.htm_para12"><a name="09112624000044">The Matthew Taylor Review Implementation Plan provides an update on progress in implementing each of the recommendations of the Matthew Taylor review.</p>

 I am today publishing the Government's formal proposals on distribution of formula grant to English local authorities for 2010-11, together with information on the allocations of all specific and special grants that can be announced in advance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="91126m0001.htm_para14"><a name="09112624000047">The proposed figures for formula grant allocations that I am publishing today are unchanged from those that were first proposed in January 2008. That is in line with the Government's policy on three year settlements, which is that we will not change the proposals for formula grant first published in January 2008, except in entirely exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="91126m0001.htm_para15"><a name="09112624000048">The importance of maintaining that commitment is twofold. First, central and local government work together, with other local partners, in service delivery. It is vital to give local government a settled financial platform on which to build those relations and those services. Secondly, this is continued recognition of the importance of the services delivered by local authorities and the pressures on those services, such as social care and waste management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="91126m0001.htm_para16"><a name="09112624000049">Total formula grant for 2010-11 will be £29 billion, of which redistributed business rates will be £21.5 billion, RSG £3.1 billion and police grant, £4.4 billion. Formula grant will be £747 million or 2.6 per cent. higher than in 2009-10 on a like for like basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="91126m0001.htm_para18"><a name="09112624000051">In the 10 years up to 2007-08 we increased total Government grant to English local authorities by 39 per cent. in real terms, with an above inflation increase for local government in each year. There will be a further total increase over this three-year settlement of £8.6 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="91126m0001.htm_para19"><a name="09112624000052">I am pleased that the average band D council tax increase this year was 3.0 per cent.-the Government expect to see it fall further next year while authorities protect and improve front line services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="91126m0001.htm_para20"><a name="09112624000053">We expect the average band D council tax increase in England to fall to a 16-year low in 2010-11. We remain prepared to take capping action against excessive increases set by individual authorities and requiring them to rebill for a lower council tax if necessary. We are already capping the police authorities of Cheshire, Leicestershire and Warwickshire in advance of 2010-11 because of previous excessive increases set by these authorities. My officials are today writing to the three police authorities setting out their proposed maximum budget requirements for 2010-11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="91126m0001.htm_para21"><a name="09112624000054">Today's announcement on the final year of the first ever three-year settlement delivers on the Government's promise to provide financial stability to local government and recognises the important role of councils in providing real help now to communities in the current economic climate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="91126m0001.htm_para22"><a name="09112624000055">Today also marks the start of a period of statutory consultation with local government on formula grant distribution and I welcome their responses. Consultation closes on 6 January 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="91126m0001.htm_para23"><a name="09112624000056">I will be making available full supporting information on the Communities and Local Government website at: http://www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/1011/grant.htm</p>

These conclusions are part of a range of initiatives, suggested in 2007 by the Commission Communication on a European agenda for culture in a globalising world, which call for culture to be considered in broader aspects of the Council's work-in this instance education and digitisation.

These conclusions encourage the promotion of media literacy through formal and informal education, while recognising member state competency on educational policy. They demonstrate our commitment to policies which will support ways of containing the risks of the internet without excessive regulation and which will help realise the creative, educational and economic potential of the internet. The UK welcomes these conclusions and I intend to support their adoption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="91126m0001.htm_para29"><a name="09112624000063">There will then be a discussion of a presidency paper on the digitisation of cultural content in Europe. The paper asks a series of questions on the main challenges faced by Europe in making its cultural heritage better available online. I will intervene to outline the UK view on the main issues that need to be addressed by European initiatives to encourage the digitisation of cultural works, how Governments and the EU can help facilitate private initiatives and public-private partnerships for making cultural works digitally available and what can be done by member states and national institutions to make important digitised material widely available.</p>

There will also be an information point from the Slovenian delegation on improving the position of publishers who issue books in languages with small numbers of speakers. The Austrian delegation will raise an issue concerning the protocol amending the Council of Europe convention on transfrontier television. I do not foresee a need to intervene on any of these.</p>

 I have today placed in the Library our proposals for allocation of police grant for England and Wales for 2010-11. I intend to implement the proposals on police grant subject to consideration of any representations and the approval of the House. Copies are also available in the Vote Office.</p>

Policing and reducing crime remain top priorities for this Government. We have continued to work hard to maintain the police grant at the best possible level as well as to provide secure and stable funding across policing, crime and drugs. We are committed to investing in the police so they have the tools and powers to fight crime and make communities safer.</p>

This three-year settlement was received positively by police authorities and forces, as a means of providing greater certainty and improving medium-term planning. The Government face more challenging financial circumstances than expected at the time the three-year settlement was announced. The Home Secretary has however decided to prioritise funding for the police. I will therefore be implementing the substantial increases in police revenue funding set out in the three-year settlement in line with our statement in November 2008.</p>

between 1997-98 and 2010-11. This is almost a 20 per cent. increase in real terms. This investment has helped to expand local policing significantly. There has been considerable achievement over the last 10 years investing in an improved mix of more officers and more police staff. The police workforce has increased by 30.9 per cent. (56,590) since 1997 to 239,607 in March 2009; a record number. This includes substantial growth in police staff (41.8 per cent.) that has freed police officers from back-office and support roles for the frontline.</p>

Through effective engagement with their local community, other community safety service providers, representatives from the private sector and community organisations, neighbourhood policing teams ensure that local concerns are dealt with efficiently. Neighbourhood policing teams play a prominent part in delivering the commitments made in the Policing Pledge and in achieving the single top-down target of public confidence in police and councils to deal with crime and antisocial behaviour issues that matter locally, both of which require effective partnership working at the neighbourhood level. It is for individual police forces and authorities to ensure the effectiveness of neighbourhood policing in their area. The Government will hold forces to account for progress through the public confidence target, which has increased from  45 per cent. in March 2008 to 50 per cent. in July 2009. The Government are working with ACPO and APA colleagues to ensure forces deliver on the Policing Pledge, drawing on the recent inspection work by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC).</p>

Focusing on delivery of the Policing Pledge, the confidence target and protective services; and addressing our wider approach to tackling crime and antisocial behaviour in the context of the current financial climate, the Policing White Paper will give fresh impetus to the Government's vision for the future of accountable, professional and citizen focused policing, working effectively with partners nationally and locally.</p>

Her report includes recommendations for a range of Government agencies, a study on the custody process, and a review of  the implementation of the recommendations made in the Flanagan review.

 The "Identity and Passport Service Framework Agreement" is being published today in line with HM Treasury and Cabinet Office guidance.

 The Justice and Home Affairs Council is due to be held on 30 November and  1 December 2009 in Brussels. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Justice,my noble Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice, Lord Bach, and the Scottish Lord Advocate, Elish Angiolini, intend to attend on behalf of the United Kingdom. As the provisional agenda stands,  the following items will be discussed:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para1"><a name="09112624000363">The Council, beginning in Mixed Committee with non-EU Schengen states, will receive an update from the presidency on the current state of play on the implementation of the regulation establishing the Visa Information system (VIS). The UK does not participate in that regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para2"><a name="09112624000364">The presidency will update Ministers on arrangements for the first milestone test for the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II). The UK welcomes the update and will seek to ensure that the test is well-planned and managed, ideally taking place before the end of 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para3"><a name="09112624000365">The Council will have an orientation debate on the Commission's proposal for establishing an EU agency for the management of large-scale IT systems. The Commission carried out an impact assessment which endorsed the need to create an agency. The UK supports the need for an agency and wishes to take part in the adoption and application of this proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para4"><a name="09112624000366">Finally, the Mixed Committee will be asked to adopt legislation giving Schengen visa liberalisation to Serbia, the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia and Montenegro. While the UK does not participate in the EU visa regime, we maintain an interest in all visa issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para5"><a name="09112624000367">Following Mixed Committee, the Council will be asked to adopt a decision authorising the presidency to sign, on behalf of the EU, an agreement between EU and Japan on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters (MLA). The presidency has recently concluded negotiations on this agreement and UK objectives in relation to this were met. The UK is therefore content for such a decision to be adopted, subject to the views of the Parliamentary Scrutiny Committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para6"><a name="09112624000368">The presidency will present the draft future JHA work programme (the Stockholm Programme) and there will be a general debate with interior items on day one and justice on day two. Ministers will be expected to agree the draft programme which will be adopted at the December European Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para7"><a name="09112624000369">Measures contained in the programme aim to ensure that every citizen can have confidence that, wherever they are in the EU, judicial decisions made in a civil court in their favour can be enforced, criminals will face justice and all defendants are guaranteed a fair trial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para8"><a name="09112624000370">The programme will result in an EU where children are safer, where data are shared sensibly, where we facilitate legal travel but clamp down on illegal immigration, where mutual recognition is the cornerstone of judicial co-operation, where member states co-operate on counter-terrorism and combat organised crime, and where we work closely with external countries on JHA and beyond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para9"><a name="09112624000371">There will be a state of play discussion on the Common European Asylum System, which is likely to focus on the recently published asylum procedures and qualification directives. Since December 2008 the European Commission has been proposing measures to deliver the second phase of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). The proposals on the procedures (which sets out minimum standards for deciding asylum claims, including rules on such things as interviews and appeal rights) and qualification (which sets out the circumstances in which applicants will qualify for international protection) directives were published by the Commission on the 23 October 2009. The presidency will want to gauge member states' initial reactions to the new proposals. The UK believes these directives are not necessary at this time as they undermine the migration pact and will be seeking to ensure that language in these directives aligns with the conclusions in the migration pact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para10"><a name="09112624000372">Over lunch, Interior Ministers will hold a discussion on the location of the European asylum support office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para11"><a name="09112624000373">The presidency will present the outcomes and action points of the EU-US ministerial troika and of the EU-Western Balkans ministerial forum. There will also be a presentation on the preparation of the EU-Russia ministerial Permanent Partnership Council (PPC), due to be held on 2 December in Stockholm. The UK supports the presidency's efforts in these areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para12"><a name="09112624000374">There will be a presentation on the six-monthly report by the counter-terrorism co-ordinator (CTC). The CTC has recently revised the counter-terrorism action plan and after receiving comments from member states will present the action plan to the Council. The UK supports efforts made by the CTC to continue to drive forward EU co-operation on CT, and is particularly appreciative of his efforts with priority third countries, such as Pakistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para13"><a name="09112624000375">The presidency is seeking to adopt the Council decision on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme. The US Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP) currently uses payment information carried through the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) system to identify and trace terrorist finance and facilitators. This agreement is needed because of a restructuring of SWIFT. The UK supports the Council decision subject to the views of the Parliamentary Scrutiny Committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para14"><a name="09112624000376">The presidency is seeking to approve the proposal for an information management strategy for EU internal security. The strategy should allow enhanced project management and improved data security. The UK supports the latest draft which calls for a strategic approach across the areas of law enforcement, judicial co-operation and border management and is content for its approval  at Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para16"><a name="09112624000378">The presidency will provide Justice Ministers with information on the current state of play of working group negotiations on the proposed framework decision on combating the sexual abuse and exploitation of children and child pornography. The Government support this measure, but due to the changes brought about by the Lisbon Treaty, this proposal will no longer be taken forward as a framework decision. The Commission are likely to retable this proposal as a directive after the Lisbon Treaty comes into effect. The Government will update the Scrutiny Committees about this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para17"><a name="09112624000379">Justice Ministers will also have an orientation debate about the negotiations that have been taking place at official level about a proposed framework decision on transfer of proceedings in criminal cases. This proposal, too, will no longer be taken forward as a framework decision after the Lisbon Treaty comes into effect. It would need to be represented as a directive, but it is unclear in what timescale this will happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para18"><a name="09112624000380">The Council will then have an orientation debate to clarify the way forward on the draft framework decision on combating trafficking of human beings following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. The presidency will also seek to adopt the action orientated paper (AOP) on human trafficking. The UK welcomes the approach adopted in the AOP, which creates a more coherent and proactive approach to combating trafficking by EU member states in partnership with third countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para19"><a name="09112624000381">Finally on the justice agenda, the presidency are expected to inform the Council on the state of play on e-justice.</p>

 I have placed in the Library of the House the third annual report to Home Office and HM Treasury Ministers on the Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) regime to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para20"><a name="09112624000383">The report has been prepared by multi-agency Committee, under the chairmanship of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), which includes the financial services sector, police, other law enforcement agencies, and the Financial Services Authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para21"><a name="09112624000384">The Government note the continuing progress that SOCA and the other participants are making to ensure that the reporting system is operating so as to help deter, detect and disrupt those involved in these crimes and in holding them to account. The Government also welcome the Committee's development of a long-term strategy to increase the value and impact of the SAR regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="91126m0003.htm_para22"><a name="09112624000385">The overall goal is a SARs system that addresses the threats to the UK from crime and terrorism, contributes to the reduction of harm and the recovery of the proceeds of crime while minimising the costs of compliance to industry and others.</p>

 My right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, Lord Adonis, has made the following ministerial statement:</p>
<a name="91126m0003.htm_brev3"><a name="09112624000415"><ul><p class="tabletext">On 1 July 2009, <i>Official Report</i>, column 21WS I informed the House that National Express East Coast (NXEC) was expected to default on their franchise to operate rail services on the east coast main line and that in consequence I would establish a state company to ensure continuity of service from the date that the company ceased operations.</p>
</ul><a name="91126m0003.htm_brev4"><a name="09112624000416"><ul><p class="tabletext">The NXEC franchise was terminated on 13 November when a state company, East Coast, took over the service with minimal disruption. I have since announced that the East Coast Company will manage the franchise for two years, until November 2011, so that the Government can review options for a new franchise and consult widely before it is re-let.</p>
</ul><a name="91126m0003.htm_brev5"><a name="09112624000417"><ul><p class="tabletext">The termination of the NXEC franchise on 13 November is a default under the National Express East Anglia (NXEA) franchise. Having considered the relevant facts, I yesterday notified NXEA that their franchise will terminate on 31 March 2011, without the extension to 2014 which would otherwise have happened. The process for securing a new operator will start immediately so that after full consultation a new franchise can begin from April 2011.</p>
</ul><a name="91126m0003.htm_brev6"><a name="09112624000418"><ul><p class="tabletext">In determining the future of the C2C and NXEA franchises, my overriding concern has been to minimise disruption to passengers and staff, and cost to the taxpayer, while ensuring that train companies stand by their commitments. I judge these objectives are best served by:</p>
</ul><a name="91126m0003.htm_brev7"><a name="09112624000419"><ul><p class="tabletext">Terminating NXEA's franchise in 2011, causing them to for go three years of profit; and</p>
</ul><a name="91126m0003.htm_brev8"><a name="09112624000420"><ul><p class="tabletext">Beginning the re-franchising process immediately so that a new operator is in place in early 2011.</p>
</ul><a name="91126m0003.htm_brev9"><a name="09112624000421"><ul><p class="tabletext">However, my judgment is that the public interest would not be served by terminating the franchises immediately, necessitating state management during the re-franchising period and three operators in two years.</p>
