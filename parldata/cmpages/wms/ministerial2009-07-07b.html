 The armed forces are an essential element of our national security. They provide the ultimate defence against direct threats to the UK and its overseas territories.

 I told the House on 5 May 2009, <i>Official Report</i>, column 19 that I had met representatives from the all party parliamentary group for genocide prevention, and they had made a very powerful case for the inclusion of genocide as an extraterritorial offence within our law. Since then I have consulted widely with colleagues about the best way to proceed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="90707m0001.htm_para11"><a name="09070745000030">Serious crimes of this nature are best dealt with in the country where the crimes took place. That is where the evidence will be most easily accessible, and where witnesses will be easier to contact. It is also the best solution because witnesses and survivors can see justice being done. Failing that, these crimes should be dealt with by international courts or tribunals where they exist. However, there may be circumstances where these options are not available. We have therefore decided that we should strengthen domestic law in this area.</p>

It is that date from which the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia had jurisdiction to try offences under the tribunal&#146;s statute adopted by the United Nations Security Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="90707m0001.htm_para13"><a name="09070745000032">Making these changes will be quite complex. The offence of genocide, along with offences of war crimes and crimes against humanity, is contained in the International Criminal Court Act 2001. From 2001, we have jurisdiction to try those crimes in the UK if committed by a UK national or resident wherever they took place. The 2001 Act is based on the Rome statute of 1998 establishing the International Criminal Court. While international law existed in respect of all these areas earlier, the offences in the 2001 Act may be wider than those recognised before the Rome statute and any change will need to take account of this.</p>

<p><a name="st_93"><a name="09070745000035"><a name="90707m0001.htm_spmin5"><a name="09070745000054"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Paul Clark):</b>
 I am today publishing a consultation entitled &#147;Merchant Shipping - Public Consultation on the Merchant Shipping (Watercraft) Order 200X&#148; which sets out proposals to regulate the safe use of all watercraft by bringing them into the scope of the merchant shipping legislation. The proposals also aim to clarify the process for registering them on the UK ship register.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="90707m0001.htm_para16"><a name="09070745000036">The changes are being considered following a Court of Appeal ruling in 2005 (R v Goodwin) where an accident between two jet skis resulted in serious injuries to one of the riders. The Court ruled that watercraft used simply for having fun on the water, such as jet skis (also referred to as personal watercraft), were not within the definition of &#145;ship&#146; in the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 (MSA). This meant that such watercraft and their users were not covered by the MSA and related legislation, including offences related to conduct endangering ships, structures or individuals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="90707m0001.htm_para17"><a name="09070745000037">The consultation paper has two elements:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="90707m0001.htm_para18"><a name="09070745000038"><i>Safe use of watercraft</i><i>&#151;</i>At present there is no overarching power of enforcement to prosecute those who use certain watercraft neglectfully, causing accidents or endangering the safety of others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="90707m0001.htm_para19"><a name="09070745000039">We are committed to protecting all users of our waters so they can pursue their activities in safety. The proposal to bring all watercraft within relevant provisions of the MSA and related legislation would allow us to take action against the owners and users of watercraft who carry out reckless or dangerous activity on the water. These proposals would bring such craft within the scope of safety requirements, including alcohol and drug offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="90707m0001.htm_para20"><a name="09070745000040"><i>Clarifying the process for registering watercraft on the ship registe</i><i>r&#151;</i>As a result of the Goodwin decision, there is also no power for owners of certain watercraft to register their craft on the UK ship register. We are proposing that those sections of the MSA which provide for registration and registration regulations apply to all watercraft so that owners can register them if they choose to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="90707m0001.htm_para21"><a name="09070745000041">The consultation will close on 29 September 2009.</p>
