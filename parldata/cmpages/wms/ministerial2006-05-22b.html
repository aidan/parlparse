Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs (Ms Harriet
Harman):</b> My noble Friend the Secretary of State, has made
the following written ministerial
statement:</p><p><a name="06052328000012">&#147;Today
I have deposited copies of The Freedom of Information Act
2000&#151;First Annual Report on the operation of the Freedom of

both

Education Applications
Process</h4><p><a name="06052328000014"><b><a name="06052328000049">The
Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning (Bill
Rammell):</b> I am delighted to announce today the response to
the Department for Education and Skill's consultation on Improving the
Higher Education Applications Process. This response is issued on
behalf of myself and my ministerial colleagues in Scotland, Wales and
Northern
Ireland.</p><p><a name="06052328000015">The
consultation exercise that has led to today's publication was
undertaken following a recommendation in the 2004 report from the
Admissions to Higher Education Review Group. That Group, chaired by
Professor Steven Schwartz (former VC Brunei University), considered the
principles that should underpin a fair and transparent admissions
process and made a number of recommendations to the sector and to
Government. One recommendation to Government was to
-</p><a name="06052328000017"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Set
up a high-level implementation group as soon as possible to achieve
PQA&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052328000018">Charles
Clarke, former Secretary of State for Education, in a statement to this
House on 14 September 2004, accepted that recommendation and put in
place the structures to fulfil that
recommendation.</p><p><a name="06052328000019">For
the last 18 months, the Department for Education and Skills has been
consulting with key stakeholders in the education sector on how this
could be achieved. A public consultation was launched on 9 September
2005 that included a number of proposals for reform to the current
application system and offered for consideration two models of
post-qualification application (PQA).</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 68WS</b><br><p><a name="06052328000020">Having analysed
and considered the response to that consultation, we are pleased to
recommend a number of reforms which will make the system fairer for
students and more efficient for higher education institutions.
Responses identified strong support in principle for a move towards a
system of PQA, but also many practical obstacles to implementing such a
system.</p><p><a name="06052328000021">We
believe that the reforms we recommend for 2008-09 will realise some of
the key benefits of PQA and lay firm foundations for further steps in
that direction. Crucially, the proposed new system for 2008-09 will
offer those students who achieve higher grades than required by their
first firm conditional offer the chance to seek an alternative place
that best matches their aspirations and circumstances. We want to build
on the step-change that these early reforms represent and, in light of
experience of them, commit to working for the introduction of PQA from
2012. We have recommended a further review in 2010-11 to facilitate
that
objective.</p><p><a name="06052328000022">In
summary, the reforms
would:</p><a name="06052328000023"><ul><p class="tabletext">provide
more and better information on which HEIs can base their admissions
decisions;</p></ul><a name="06052328000024"><ul><p class="tabletext">involve
students submitting, and HEIs considering, fewer initial applications,
thereby reducing administrative
burdens;</p></ul><a name="06052328000025"><ul><p class="tabletext">ensure
applications are considered on the basis of a gathered field, creating
a more equal chance for all students arid reducing the temptation for
them to place early, ill-researched
applications;</p></ul><a name="06052328000028"><ul><p class="tabletext">give
students better feedback on their applications, allowing them to make
better informed decisions about their HE
options;</p></ul><a name="06052328000030"><ul><p class="tabletext">give
those who have failed to gain an offer with their initial applications
better opportunities to continue applying in search of a
place;</p></ul><a name="06052328000032"><ul><p class="tabletext">result in
fewer students needing to enter Clearing;
and</p></ul><a name="06052328000033"><ul><p class="tabletext">offer those
students who achieve higher grades than required by their first firm
conditional offer the chance to seek an alternative place that best
matches their aspirations and
circumstances.</p></ul><p><a name="06052328000036">We
have recommended the establishment of a delivery partnership, involving
representatives from higher and further education, schools and other
interested stakeholders, to introduce these recommendations for the
2008-09 academic year. The delivery partnership will also be tasked
with assessing the impact of those changes after they have had time to
bed down and to review again a move towards a full PQA
system.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06052328000004">Home

Policy Review
Launch</h4><p><a name="06052328000038"><b><a name="06052328000051">The
Minister of State, Department for Transport (Dr. Stephen
Ladyman):</b> I am pleased to announce today, in conjunction
with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales and Northern
Ireland, and with Andrew Davies AM, the Welsh Assembly Government
Minister for Enterprise, Innovation and Networks, the launch of a
review of ports policy covering England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
(Ports policy in Scotland is being progressed separately by the
Scottish Executive through its National Transport Strategy and
subordinate freight
strategy.)</p><p><a name="06052328000039">We
undertook, in the White Paper &#147;The Future of Transport&#148;,
to:</p><a name="06052328000040"><ul><p class="tabletext">"review our
policy framework to keep track of wider changes affecting ports and to
ensure we continue to have the right basis for their sustainable
development", [paragraph
7.28]</p></ul><p><a name="06052328000041">That
is the intention of this review. We publish today a discussion
document, &#147;Ports Policy &#151;Your Views Invited&#148;,
aimed at stimulating wide debate during a consultation period spanning
the coming three
months.</p><p><a name="06052328000042">The
review covers a broad range of policy issues. Based on new forecasts of
demand for port facilities, which the Department's consultants MDS
Transmodal are publishing alongside the discussion document, our
discussion document starts from the broad principles which we see as
informing Government involvement in the seaports sector following this
review.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 70WS</b><br><p><a name="06052328000043">It
includes coverage of the national, regional and local policy
dimensions; expected capacity requirements; inland and coastal
connections by road, rail and water; safety, security and environmental
issues; competition at national and international level; governance and
accountability; how the country's smaller ports can make the most of
their opportunities, and whether there is scope for improving ports
planning
procedures.</p><p><a name="06052328000044">The
House is aware that our original intention had been to await decisions
on the three proposed major container terminals at Felixstowe South,
Bathside Bay and London Gateway. The first two have been approved, but
the London Gateway decision is taking longer than originally expected
to determine. We do not want to delay the review: our view is that we
need to press on with addressing important questions affecting ports
policy for the longer
term.</p><p><a name="06052328000045">We
shall, in close liaison with our partners in Government, carefully
consider all responses to the discussion document. The aim is then to
develop a policy statement in the first half of
2007.</p><p><a name="06052328000046">Alongside
the discussion document, the Department is also publishing the
conclusions of the municipal ports review, Opportunities for ports in
local authority ownership. This has been developed in close liaison
with DCLG, with the British Ports Association and with the municipal
ports themselves. I am grateful for their contributions. The review
highlights opportunities for real improvements in ports' management and
performance, and I look forward to its recommendations being taken
forward. Copies of all documents will be placed in the House Library,
and can be found on the Department's website
www.dft.gov.uk.</p>
