<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60328m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs  (Bridget Prentice): </b> 
 My right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor, has made the following written ministerial statement:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;On 1 April 2006, I will launch the Tribunals Service. The new agency brings together the tribunals already administered by DCA with five others from across central Government. It is the culmination of a major programme of work that has involved extensive engagement with tribunals, other Government Departments and stakeholders to ensure a seamless transition and minimal disruption to users. The formation of the agency is the first major shake-up of the UK tribunals system for over fifty years and will ensure the manifest independence of the tribunals from those whose decisions they are reviewing.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">The Tribunals Service will work to make the whole system of administrative justice more efficient, effective and accessible for users. Over time, it will test a range of methods of dispute resolution to create a service that ensures the public can get their problems addressed by the most suitable means.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">The following table sets out the key performance targets which I have set for the Tribunals Service for 2006&#150;07:</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>

the local government pension scheme in England and Wales, subject to the outcome of the statutory consultation exercise which began on 5 December 2005 and which ended on 28 February 2006. A summary of the responses received will be placed on the ODPM/LGPS website.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m02.html_para3"><a name="stpa_4">The local government pensions scheme is a guaranteed, final salary pension scheme open primarily to employees of local government but also to those who work in other organisations associated with local government, including, higher and further education institutions. It is also a funded scheme, with its pensions funds being managed and invested locally within the framework of regulations provided by Government. In deciding on the regulations needed to ensure that all members&#039; pensions are safe, and prudently funded, the Government have to take account of the advice of actuaries, as well as the views of representatives of employers and members, and other interested parties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m02.html_para4"><a name="stpa_5">My 2 December statement made clear the Government&#039;s intention to secure the scheme&#039;s continued affordability and viability, without placing an unfair burden on taxpayers. The Government remain committed to that objective, and also to providing an equality-proofed scheme which is flexible and attractive in its provisions to employees and employers, both now and in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m02.html_para5"><a name="stpa_6">To fulfil the Government&#039;s objective for the scheme, considerable efforts have been made to reform and to plan its future, within the framework provided by the Tripartite Committee. The Government, with the cooperation of the local authority employers and trades unions, want to see the provision of good quality pensions for all local authority workers. The Tripartite Committee provides the right framework for key interests to seek agreement, through analysis and transparent discussions, on the way ahead for the scheme and for any new benefit structure. However, in regulating the scheme, the Government are required by the scheme&#039;s governing regulations to secure its on-going solvency and compliance with the law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m02.html_para6"><a name="stpa_7">It is intended to place before Parliament the necessary amending regulations to implement what was outlined in my 2 December statement. These will introduce significant and well supported flexibilities into the scheme&#039;s legal framework to reflect the simplified tax regime provided by the Finance Act 2004. It is the Government&#039;s wish also to strike a fair and proportionate balance between the extent and the cost of any affordable and legal safeguards for existing scheme members. To ensure compliance with European Union age discrimination legislation, set out in Council directive 2000/78/EC, and to secure ongoing cost stability, the rule of 85 will be removed from the Scheme with effect from 1 October 2006. We remain firmly committed to ensuring the protection of those members born before 31 March 1953 who would have satisfied the rule by their 60th birthday.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m02.html_para7"><a name="stpa_8">Such an approach, within the current scheme&#039;s framework, is seen as being both affordable and legal, and it maintains the consistent stance taken by the Government that no additional costs associated with these regulations should fall on taxpayers.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m02.html_para8">Looking ahead, the Government are committed to reforming the scheme to ensure it meets the challenge of a changing workforce both within and around local government in England and Wales. Discussions with scheme interests are proceeding to support the preparation of a policy discussion paper on a new-look scheme for consultation later in the year. Any reforms of the scheme must recognise, of course, that it already has a normal retirement age of 65, that it is funded and financed in a specific way and, crucially, that any new arrangements must continue to be both affordable and legal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m02.html_para9"><a name="stpa_9">A key element of these discussions, which have already begun within the framework provided by the Tripartite Committee, will be to address positively the concerns expressed about the position of existing scheme members who contrast their particular circumstances with the agreement reached in October 2005 by other, but unfunded, public service pension schemes. The Government intend that these reforms can be guided by the principle that up to half of the savings achieved by the final removal of the rule of 85 can be recycled into the development of whatever benefit package is felt by the stakeholders and membership to be appropriate for the new-look 2008 scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m02.html_para10"><a name="stpa_10">Going forward, the Government, given their regulatory responsibilities for the solvency and viability of the scheme, remain firmly committed to the provision of affordable and sustainable, good quality pension arrangements in the local government pension scheme, as indeed it believes so too are all the interested parties connected with its present and future.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60328m03.html_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Margaret Beckett): </b> 
 I am pleased to announce that the Government and the devolved Administrations have today published the &quot;UK Climate Change Programme 2006&quot;, to update the programme that we introduced in 2000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m03.html_para0"><a name="stpa_11">The UK has one of the best records of any country in tackling greenhouse gas emissions, and we have already met our Kyoto target for 2010. The programme sets out the Government&#039;s commitments at international and domestic levels to meet the challenge of climate change. It also sets out our approach to strengthening the role that individuals can play. Progress in all three areas is regarded by the Government as essential.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m03.html_para1"><a name="stpa_12">Our review over the past eighteen months has evaluated how effective our existing policies have been and analysed a range of possible new policies to contribute towards our national climate change goals. We are introducing a range of policies to strengthen our domestic delivery. Among these are measures to support increased generation from renewable sources, encourage the installation of energy efficiency measures in households, provide more reliable consumer product information, support more sustainable transport choices, introduce higher standards for efficiency in buildings and finance energy efficiency measures for public sector organisations.






<br>&nbsp;<br>28 Mar 2006 : Column 58WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m03.html_para2">Today we are also consulting on the draft of the &quot;UK&#039;s National Allocation Plan&quot; for the second phase of the EU emissions trading scheme. The scheme is a central element of the energy supply and business sectors&#039; contribution to our policies to tackle climate change. It will be used to make a significant contribution to our national emissions reduction target.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m03.html_para3"><a name="stpa_13">These policies are expected to reduce the UK&#039;s emissions of the basket of greenhouse gases to 23&#150;25 per cent. below base year levels, around twice our commitment to reduce emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. It is also expected to reduce the UK&#039;s carbon dioxide emissions to 15&#150;18 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. The review, and policies introduced already, could reduce carbon emissions by 7&#150;12MtC by 2010. This would take the Government close to their domestic target of a 20 per cent. reduction by 2010. The Government still believe that the UK can achieve this target. This is an on-going process and the Government will in future report annually to Parliament on emissions, future plans and progress on the domestic climate change agenda. We believe we can reach the 20 per cent. target with support from all sections of the economy and society, not least by the collective action of individuals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m03.html_para4"><a name="stpa_14">At international level, we will maintain our leadership role, and build on progress achieved through the G8 Summit in Gleneagles, the European Union and the Montreal Climate Change Conference. Our aim is to secure agreement to the action and long-term goal needed to establish an effective future international regime to tackle climate change. As part of this, in partnership with the European Union, we will enhance our efforts to help India, China and other developing countries evolve as low carbon economies.
</p>

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60328m04.html_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Fiona Mactaggart): </b> 
 On 17 November 2005 I made a statement about developments at Styal prison following the tragic series of deaths of six women there and further work planned relating to women offenders. I outlined in that statement a great deal of work that is underway in respect of women who come into contact with the Criminal Justice System, in particular, changes made at Styal and other women&#039;s prisons and the Women&#039;s Offending Reduction Programme (WORP), which is co-ordinating and implementing a comprehensive programme of work to address the complex range of factors that affect women&#039;s offending.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m04.html_para8"><a name="stpa_41">I said that it was timely to take stock of the work being done and to look again at the measures in place to ensure that we are doing everything possible for the especially vulnerable group of women who come into contact with the criminal justice system. I undertook to make a further announcement when the scope of this review had been determined and I am now able to make that further announcement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m04.html_para9"><a name="stpa_42">I am pleased to announce that Baroness Jean Corston has agreed to undertake this review. Jean recently chaired the Joint Committee on Human Rights and instigated its valuable and comprehensive Inquiry into Deaths in Custody in 2003.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m04.html_para10"><a name="stpa_43">The review will be focused on those women in whom a multitude of risk factors coexist and which could lead them to harm themselves in prison. This could, for example, encompass women with serious mental illness or serious drug addictions; women with other mental health problems such as personality disorder, which can be exacerbated by prison and increase their vulnerability; and those women who are persistent low-level offenders, living chaotic lives. It will look at provision for such women at each occasion they come 





<br>&nbsp;<br>28 Mar 2006 : Column 62WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

into contact with the criminal justice system, for example, at police stations, at court, on remand, on sentencing, during sentence in the community, in prison and on release.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m04.html_para11"><a name="stpa_44">I stress that the review will complement rather than replicate the work underway and will seek to build on the vast amount of work and knowledge that already exist. For example, WORP aims to provide a more appropriate and joined-up response in the community to the particular factors that impact on women offenders. The Together Women Programme will trial an integrated approach to routing women to appropriate services to meet their needs at various stages of their offending history. Baroness Corston&#039;s review will seek to build on this work, focusing on identified gaps in provision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m04.html_para12"><a name="stpa_45">Part of the review will profile the characteristics and histories of some of the women who have died in custody in recent years (particularly those at Styal) and look at the pathway through the criminal justice system that led them to that point. It is hoped that some of those families sadly bereaved by these deaths might be willing to share their experiences with the review and provide an insight into the events that led to custody. This element of the review could provide a strong contribution to learning lessons and may be of some small comfort to those bereaved families.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m04.html_para13"><a name="stpa_46">The review will be assisted by a small advisory reference group, with some wider groups and themed seminars. Baroness Corston is establishing her advisory group, which is likely to include, for example, Prison Reform Trust, Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, Women in Prison, INQUEST and NIMHE. Senior officials from the Home Office Women&#039;s Offending Reduction Programme, the Prison Service Women&#039;s group and the National Offender Management Service Safer Custody Group will also sit on the reference group. A wider group of people and organisations, whose expertise will be vital to the review, will also be invited to contribute both directly and through meetings and seminars.

 On the 28 March 2006, I am publishing the Government&#039;s &quot;Microgeneration Strategy&quot;. Publication fulfils the requirement under the Energy Act 2004 to publish a strategy for the promotion of microgeneration within 18 months of commencement of the relevant section.

the new rooftop mounted turbines), micro-hydro, heat pumps, biomass, micro combined heat and power and small-scale fuel cells.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m04.html_para16"><a name="stpa_49">A study commissioned by the DTI from the Energy Saving Trust (EST) suggested that by 2050, microgeneration could provide 30&#150;40 per cent. of the UK&#039;s electricity needs and help to reduce household carbon emissions by 15 per cent. per annum. In 2004 there were approximately 82,000 microgeneration installations in the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m04.html_para17"><a name="stpa_50">The objective of the microgeneration strategy is to create conditions under which microgeneration becomes a realistic alternative or supplementary energy generation source for the householder, for the community and for small businesses. If this can be achieved we will start to see the level of growth in installations required for microgeneration to make the significant contribution to our energy goals that is its potential.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60328m04.html_para18"><a name="stpa_51">The strategy contains a wide range of actions, varying from the &#163;80 million low carbon buildings capital grant programme, improvements to existing communications activity, a review of the permitted development regime to a pilot to assess the benefits of smart metering combined with microgeneration.

This re-determination increases the Government&#039;s grant this year to TfL by &#163;19.453 million, and primarily reflects my Department&#039;s contribution to Crossrail costs in 2005&#150;06, additional funding for TfL&#039;s Urban Bus Challenge projects in 2005&#150;06, and the residual balance of the SRA&#039;s budget for the East London Line extension from 2004&#150;05.
