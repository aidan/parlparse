<a name="07052363000007"><h4 align="center"><i>Wednesday 23 May 2007</i></h4>
<a name="subhd_0"><a name="07052363000002"><a name="70523m0001.htm_dpthd0"><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase">Culture, Media and Sport</h3>
<a name="subhd_1"><a name="70523m0001.htm_sbhd0"><a name="07052363000008"><h4 align="center">Education, Youth and Culture Council</h4>

<p><a name="st_114"><a name="07052363000014"><a name="70523m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="07052363000072"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Mr. Shaun Woodward):</b>
 The Education, Youth and Culture Council will be held on 24-25 May in Brussels. I will be representing the UK on 24 May when Culture and Audiovisual issues will be taken. Education and Youth issues will be taken on25 May.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="70523m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07052363000016">The first item on the agenda concerns the Council Conclusions on the contribution of the cultural and creative sectors to the achievement of the Lisbon objectives. Following the publication of a study on the Economy of Culture in Europe prepared for the European Commission last year, there has been an impetus within the Culture Council to ensure that the importance of the cultural and creative sectors (particularly in employment terms) remains on the political agenda of the EU. At the beginning of this year the German presidency proposed a set of draft Council Conclusions for negotiation by the Commission and member states based on that report's recommendations. These have been finalised at official level and the Council is now expected to adopt the Conclusions at this meeting. I intend to support the adoption of these Conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="70523m0001.htm_para1"><a name="07052363000017">The presidency will then seek to reach political agreement on proposals to amend the Television Without Frontiers Directive. The proposals before the Council are a significant improvement on those which the European Commission originally published in December 2005. In particular, their scope is considerably narrower. Instead of applying potentially damaging regulation to a very wide range of iternet and other new media services as the December 2005 proposals would have done, the amended proposals will apply only to television and television-like on demand services, in particular video-on-demand. They will also meet the Government's requirements in other respects, in particular by preserving the &#147;Country of Origin&#148; principle for assigning jurisdiction over cross-border services and by cutting down detailed EU regulation of television advertising. I therefore intend to endorse these proposals in the Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="70523m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07052363000018">Under Any Other Business, the Council is invited to adopt a decision on the selection of two member states with a view to the nomination by the Council of two experts in the selection panel for the European Capital of Culture Community Action. The presidency will provide information regarding the ongoing work on the Third Work Plan for Culture. The presidency will also provide feedback on expert conferences in the field of culture and the &#147;More trust in content&#148; expert conference organised by the German presidency. The Commission will do a presentation on a European agenda for culture in a globalising world. I do not expect to intervene on any of these items.</p>

Nor is there any transparency between what is paid for an item and the cost of services. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that the underlying cost structures have changed quite significantly; for instance, manufacturing processes have become more efficient and low-cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"><a name="70523m0001.htm_para22"><a name="07052363000051">The volume and complexity of the responses are such that the Department has decided that it needs more time to analyse the information provided.This analysis needs to take account of commentsmade about the Department&#146;s proposals regarding reimbursement for items and on the proposed levels of remuneration for particular services&#151;such as home delivery and product customisation.</p>

 The Department for Transport has received a request from Cross-London Rail Links Ltd (CLRL) for additional funding of &#163;6,525,000 to contribute towards the cost of utility diversion work at Tottenham Court Road station, one of the planned interchange stations for Crossrail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="70523m0001.htm_para30"><a name="07052363000063">The funding is required to enable CLRL to contribute an agreed 50 per cent. share of the costs of utility diversion work at Tottenham Court Road station: this preparatory work is part of a London Underground Ltd (LUL) project to relieve congestion by constructing a new ticket hall plaza. The plaza project has been designed to accommodate the planned future Crossrail interchange, the powers for which are contained in the Crossrail Bill. LUL intends to start main construction works on the plaza as soon as possible after the Crossrail Bill gains Royal Assent, expected in the next session. In order to do this, LUL have had to commence work on the diversion of utilities, for which they possess the necessary planning permission.</p>

These packages of measures will be eligible for funding from the Transport Innovation Fund, which will provide up to &#163;200 million per year from 2008.
