Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs (Ms Harriet
Harman):</b> The review of the Child Care Proceedings System
in England and Wales is published today. It was commissioned in
&#147;A Fairer Deal for Legal Aid&#148; in July 2005 as a joint
piece of work between the Department for Education and Skills and the
Department for Constitutional Affairs. Its recommendations aim to
deliver improvements in the outcome of proceedings, particularly for
children, and to ensure that all resources in the system are used in
the most timely, effective
way.</p><p><a name="060518139000017">Recommendations
for improvement fall into five main areas: helping families (ensuring
families and children understand proceedings); better informed
resolution (ensuring applications are only made after all safe,
appropriate alternatives to court have been explored); preparation for
proceedings (improving the quality and consistency of section 31
applications); during proceedings (improving the quality of case
management); and inter-agency working (encouraging closer professional
relationships).</p><p><a name="060518139000018">The
full and timely implementation of the recommendations made is critical.
To ensure this takes place, I will be chairing a ministerial delivery
group, which will include DfES and Welsh Assembly Ministers. The
purpose of this group will be to ensure a high accountability for
progress on the implementation of the review and reduction in delay
generally in handling care applications. There will also be a delivery
board of senior officials, which will deal with more detailed
implementation

Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office(Mr. David
Hanson):</b> The Government have received a thematic
inspection report from the Chief Inspector of Criminal Justice in
Northern Ireland, Mr. Kit Chivers. The report, "Avoidable Delay: A
thematic inspection of delay in the processing of criminal cases in
Northern Ireland", has today been
published.</p><p><a name="060518139000033">The
Government accept the core findings of the report that cases are taking
too long. The timeliness with which the 'criminal justice system
dispenses justice is an important element in its effectiveness and
efficiency and in maintaining and raising public confidence. I
therefore welcome this report and its
findings.</p><p><a name="060518139000035">In
line with the findings in the report, we have setup a

Secretary of State for Trade and Industry(Mr. Alistair
Darling):</b> I have today proposed the basis of the financial
framework for Royal Mail that the Government as shareholder have, in
principle, agreed with the company. This will fulfil our commitment to
see a publicly owned Royal Mail restored to good health and providing
customers with an excellent service and its employees with rewarding
employment. It will give Royal Mail the freedom it needs to use its
financial resources as it sees fit so that it can invest to succeed in
a fully competitive and tightly regulated
market.</p><p><a name="060518139000039">The
Government intend to exercise their powers under section 72 of the
Postal Services Act 2000 to release &#163;850 million of reserves
that Royal Mail has built up through past profitable performance so
those funds can be transferred to a special account, the pension escrow
account, upon which the pension fund trustees could draw, should Royal
Mail fail as a business. When the pension fund deficit has been
recovered and Royal Mail's balance sheet strengthened by successful
operation, it is expected that the escrow 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 66WS</b><br>fund will be released and surplus cash may be returned to the Government
as shareholder. This arrangement provides confidence to pensions and
sustainable financial framework for Royal
Mail.</p><p><a name="060518139000040">Government have
agreed in principle to extend the existing debt package such that
&#163;900 million is available for use by the Royal Mail. This will
allow the company to embark on an investment programme so that
itcan transform its effectiveness, secure the efficiency
improvements required under the regulatory settlement and successfully
compete in a newly liberalised
market.</p><p><a name="060518139000041">As part of
the overall financing arrangements for Royal Mail, Social Network
Payments of &#163;150 million per annum for the next two years and
any further support for the post office network for the period from
2008 will be met from voted expenditure. The level of any support after
2008 will depend on decisions on the future of the Post Office network
and we will be consulting about
this.</p><p><a name="060518139000042">I am confident
that these proposals will enable Royal Mail to implement its ambitious
transformation plans to secure a successful future in a competitive
market under the regulatory
regime.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="060518139000007">Transport</h3><h4 align="center"><a name="060518139000015">London

re-appointed as PPP Arbiter until December 2010. Mr. Bolt was
originally appointed as Arbiter on 31 December 2002 for a four-year
term, and this appointment has now been extended for a further four
years. This extension will provide continuity in the lead up to, and
during, the PPP periodic review that must be completed by October 2010.
The periodic review will enable London Underground and the PPP
companies to determine the outcomes and prices paid under the PPP
contract for the next seven and a half years after
2010.</p><p><a name="060518139000044">The PPP Arbiter
appointment is made by the Secretary of State under sections 225 to 226
of the Greater London Authority Act 1999. The Arbiter's principle role
is to ensure that any differences between the PPP parties, particularly
during a PPP review, about the price to be paid to the PPP companies or
about economy and efficiency can be resolved independently, swiftly and
with certainty.</p><p><a name="060518139000045">Chris
