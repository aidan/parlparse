<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50719m01.html_spmin1"><b>The Paymaster General  (Dawn Primarolo): </b> 
 The Government propose to bring forward legislation in the next available Finance Bill to exempt from tax certain payments made in relation to bank accounts of holocaust victims, as described below.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m01.html_para0"><a name="stpa_0">The HM Revenue and Customs extra-statutory concession, A100, introduced on 8 May 2000, provides a tax exemption for compensation payments made by UK banks under their scheme called &quot;Restore UK&quot;. The scheme is designed to identify and compensate claimants to dormant accounts opened by holocaust victims and frozen during World War II under the Trading with the Enemy Act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m01.html_para1"><a name="stpa_1">Since the introduction of the extra-statutory concession it has come to light that comparable payments may be made to holocaust victims or their heirs in respect of moneys held by the banks of other countries. For example, claims may be made by victims or targets of Nazi persecution or their heirs through the Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) for Dormant Accounts in Switzerland in respect of moneys deposited in Swiss banks in the period before and during the Second World War. The CRT was established as a consequence of the Holocaust Victims Assets Litigation in America.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m01.html_para2"><a name="stpa_2">The CRT awards made to the holocaust victims or their heirs and any comparable payments made by the banks of other countries are outside the scope of ESC A100, because it is available only for payments made under the &quot;Restore UK&quot; scheme run by UK banks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m01.html_para3"><a name="stpa_3">Following discussions between the Association of Jewish Refugees and HMRC, the Government propose to bring forward legislation in the next available Finance Bill. The legislation will exempt from income tax and capital gains tax payments made to holocaust victims or their heirs when they are broadly comparable to the awards made under the &quot;Restore UK&quot; scheme run by UK banks. This will include any amount designed to cover interest and inflation by increasing the account balance to make it a fairer reflection of the amount

<br>&nbsp;<br>

originally deposited. The exemption will be available whenever the award or payment was made, so long as the criteria set out in the legislation are met.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m01.html_para4"><a name="stpa_4">The proposal is that there will be a provision in the legislation so that anyone who has included a qualifying payment in their self assessment tax return and paid tax will be able to reclaim the tax, even if the normal time limit for amending the assessment has passed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m01.html_para5"><a name="stpa_5">The proposed legislation will also clarify the effect of the exemption for inheritance tax (IHT) purposes. Present-day recipients of these payments often derive their claim through intervening potential claimants who are now dead. The existing extra-statutory concession aims to ensure that the IHT affairs of these predecessors need not be re-opened because an account has been rediscovered. The Government propose that, when the accounts of holocaust victims or their heirs are rediscovered and compensation payments are made in respect of them, legislation in the Finance Bill will include an exemption from death duties for intervening potential claimants who died before the respective award scheme was opened for claims.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m01.html_para6"><a name="stpa_6">At the same time as bringing forward legislation to provide a tax exemption for compensation payments that are broadly comparable to the &quot;Restore UK&quot; scheme, the Government propose to take the opportunity to put on a statutory footing the exemption currently available under ESC A100 for payments made by UK banks. So that too will be included in the proposed legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m01.html_para7"><a name="stpa_7">UK building societies may participate in the &quot;Restore UK&quot; scheme and ESC A100 applies to any compensation payments made by them to holocaust victims or their heirs. The proposed exemption will include payments by the building societies of other countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m01.html_para8"><a name="stpa_8">More information about the proposed tax exemption and guidance for anyone who thinks they may be able to claim back tax already paid on an exempt award is in the news release published by HM Revenue and Customs today at www.hmrc.gov.uk/individuals/holocaust.htm/

<a name="50719m01.html_sbhd2"><h4 align=center>Public Expenditure</h4>












<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50719m01.html_spmin2"><b>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury  (Mr. Des Browne): </b> 
 In June 1997, the incoming Government launched a comprehensive spending review (CSR). The CSR was the most fundamental and in-depth examination of Government spending and priorities ever attempted. Moving beyond the short-termism engendered by the old annual planning cycle and building on the platform of stability provided by the new fiscal code, the CSR set long-term aims and objectives for each Department and put in place a public expenditure and performance management framework within which these long-term ambitions could be achieved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m01.html_para9"><a name="stpa_9">The CSR set the Government&#039;s priorities for the long-term: sustainable growth and employment; fairness and opportunity; efficient and modern public services. To support this longer-term approach to public spending, the CSR introduced a series of key reforms to modernise the public expenditure framework including firm three-year departmental spending plans, separate current and 





<br>&nbsp;<br>19 Jul 2005 : Column 55WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

capital budgets, and outcome-focused public service agreements to support delivery and improve departmental accountability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m01.html_para10"><a name="stpa_10">The CSR allocated significant additional resources, backed by reform, to the Government&#039;s key priority areas, with over 50 per cent. of the increase in departmental expenditure limits and local authority spending being allocated to education and health. In the ten years to 2007&#150;08, subsequent Reviews in 2000, 2002 and 2004 have built on the objectives, reforms and priorities first established in the CSR.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m01.html_para11"><a name="stpa_11">The framework for managing public expenditure established by the CSR has also proved robust. Three year spending plans have been set and delivered in successive spending reviews. The separate management of current and capital spending has allowed public sector net investment to rise from 0.8 per cent. of GDP in 1996&#150;97 to 2.2 per cent. by 2007&#150;08.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m01.html_para12"><a name="stpa_12">Over the last decade the Government have shown how one can deliver a strong economy and sound public finances at the same time as sustained and substantial growth in investment in public services. Looking forward, there are new challenges Britain will need to address in order to lock in these benefits for the decade to come, including:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">a rapid increase in the old age dependency ratio as the &quot;baby boom&quot; generation reaches retirement age;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">the intensification of cross-border economic competition as the balance of international economic activity shifts toward rapidly growing emerging markets such as China and India;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">an acceleration in the pace of innovation and technological diffusion and a continued increase in the knowledge-intensity of goods and services;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">continued global uncertainty with ongoing threats of international terrorism and global conflict; and</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">increasing pressures on our natural resources and global climate from rapid economic and population growth in the developing world and sustained demand for fossil fuels in advanced economies.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m01.html_para13"><a name="stpa_13">These changes will have fundamental and far-reaching implications for public services and will require innovative policy responses, coordination of activity across departmental boundaries and sustained investment in key areas. While reaffirming the Government&#039;s commitment to their key objectives and building on the long-term framework the Government have put in place, it is right that the Government should periodically re-examine their public spending allocations in fundamental ways.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m01.html_para14"><a name="stpa_14">With the start of the next spending review period coming a decade after the first, the Government propose to launch a second comprehensive spending examining what the investments and reforms initiated to date have delivered and what further steps must be taken to ensure that Britain is fully equipped to meet the challenges of the decade ahead. This review will:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">take a zero based approach to assessing the effectiveness of Departments&#039; existing spending in delivering the outputs to which they are committed;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">examine the key long-term trends and challenges that will shape the next decade and assess how public services will need to respond; and</p>
</ul>
<p>







<br>&nbsp;<br>19 Jul 2005 : Column 56WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">look at how the public expenditure framework can best embed and extend ongoing efficiency improvements and support the long-term investments needed to meet these challenges.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m01.html_para15"><a name="stpa_15">The review will complement the work of the long-term reviews already underway into the future of transport, skills, pensions and local services.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m01.html_para16"><a name="stpa_16">A report will be made on these public spending challenges in 2006. The Government will report on the next three-year spending review covering 2008&#150;09, 2009&#150;10 and 2010&#150;11 in 2007 and will hold departmental allocations to the agreed figure already announced for 2007&#150;08.

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50719m02.html_spmin0"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 Last week&#039;s attack on London was an affront to all democracies. Just as there should be no safe haven for those who perpetrate terrorism, so there should no hiding place for those who finance terrorism. To deliver this requires action in the UK, across Europe and globally.

<p>
<a name="50719m02.html_para1"><a name="stpa_18">Blocking terrorists&#039; access to the financial system is a critical preventive measure; and freezing funds already in the system prevents those funds being used to perpetrate atrocities. In the UK, our financial institutions have to date frozen over &#163;370,000 in forty five accounts. In order better to integrate efforts within the UK to disrupt terrorist finance, I can announce that the Treasury has established an inter-departmental asset freezing working group to identify and vet appropriate targets for asset freezing action under Treasury powers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m02.html_para2"><a name="stpa_19">While four years ago just 30,000 reports of suspicious transactions relating to terrorist financing and money laundering were sent to the National Criminal Intelligence Service, last year 150,000 suspicious transaction reports were made. Of those relating to terrorist finance, between 20 to 30 per cent. subsequently either led to a longer-term investigation, or contributed substantially to an existing investigation. It is essential that the suspicious transactions regime be both proportionate and effective. The Home Secretary and I have asked Sir Stephen Lander to report by March 2006 on how these investigations of suspicious transactions can be best pursued under the new Serious and Organised Crime Agency.

It has considered fire safety in all types of premises including dwellings, residential care homes and warehouses. It has also considered the important role that sprinklers and other types of fire protection measures may have, particularly if the provision is targeted at buildings where the occupants are most vulnerable to fire. The proposed changes would help to ensure an even higher level of fire safety for both building occupants and firefighters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m03.html_para3"><a name="stpa_32">However, any changes must be fully justified and taken forward in a robust and efficient manner. To this end we are also seeking further evidence to support a number of the proposals, particularly in terms of the costs and benefits that they may have. A partial regulatory impact assessment detailing the impacts of the proposals has been published as part of the consultation package.

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="50719m03.html_spmin2"><b>The Minister for Local Government  (Mr. Phil Woolas): </b> 
 I am pleased to announce the broad outline of how the Government intend to implement three-year finance settlements for local government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m03.html_para5"><a name="stpa_34">The move to three-year settlements will provide greater financial certainty and stability for local government, council tax payers, businesses and other local partners. Three-year settlements will provide local government with the same certainty and planning horizons that departments already benefit from through our reformed public spending system. They will be a vehicle for greater long term coordination across central government towards local government services. The benefits for local people should be improved service delivery and greater stability in future council tax.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m03.html_para6"><a name="stpa_35">In December, ODPM published a consultation paper, &quot;Three-year Revenue and Capital Settlements&quot;, which sought views on the Government&#039;s proposals for the implementation of three-year settlements for local government in England. The consultation fulfilled a commitment in the 2004 building regulations to consult on these proposals with local government and other stakeholders with a view to agreeing settlements for 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 during 2005. The consultation ended on 11 March 2005. Some 186 responses were received and they broadly welcomed the principle of introducing three-year allocations for revenue and 





<br>&nbsp;<br>19 Jul 2005 : Column 61WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

capital funding. A summary of responses was published on 30 June and copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m03.html_para7"><a name="stpa_36">The consultation paper stated the Government&#039;s intention to move to three-year settlements for local government by the end of the current Parliament. The first settlement, to be announced in autumn 2005, will cover the two remaining years of building regulations 04 (2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08). From 2008&#150;09, three-year settlements will be fully aligned with the spending review cycle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m03.html_para8"><a name="stpa_37">Following consideration of the consultation responses, implementation will proceed along the following broad principles:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">A move to greater certainty in forward indications of local authority council tax levels. This will be based on further discussions with local government to ensure maximum forward looking information for council tax payers.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">Specific revenue grants will generally be allocated on a three-year forward basis.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">For formula and revenue grant, we will align all aspects of three-year settlements with the existing spending review round, with firm three-year allocations being announced for the first full spending review cycle after three-year settlements are introduced. To make these settlements more forward looking, stable and predictable we will use projections of changes in population and council tax base; and will not, except in entirely exceptional cases, retrospectively amend any year&#039;s settlement.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">Capital funding, whether in the form of grant or supported borrowing, will generally be allocated on a three-year forward basis with exceptions for some small bid-based programmes, funding for emergencies and funding for large one-off projects.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">The formulae proposed for the 2006&#150;07 housing revenue account subsidy (HRAS) Determination will remain unchanged for the 2007&#150;08 HRAS determination. Stock and other data about individual authorities will as usual be updated for 2007&#150;08 by means of the base data return to be issued in 2006.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m03.html_para9"><a name="stpa_38">To ensure local authorities and council tax payers gain the maximum benefits of three-year settlements, Government Departments will work to ensure that their funding is either moved to a firm three-year basis or designed to offer authorities as much forward certainty as possible. The principles outlined above will be applied by government departments, in conjunction with local government, as they finalise the details of the settlement in the run up to its announcement in the autumn.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m03.html_para10"> The priority goal for Government policy on local government finance is stability and certainty so that Local Authorities, their partners and the public have reasonable expectations of income and expenditure levels and trends.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m03.html_para11"><a name="stpa_39">To that end I am today moving that policy forward with the introduction of three year settlements for local government. It is an opportune time to review the basis on which we distribute formula grant to local authorities in England. Formula grant underpins the provision of a wide range of local services and is not hypothecated, so that decisions on local priorities can be made by local authorities. We have already introduced a degree of stability in the formulae for grant distribution; these were last changed for 2003&#150;04, and we made clear then 





<br>&nbsp;<br>19 Jul 2005 : Column 62WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

that we would not change the underlying methodology for a period of three years. From 2006&#150;07, we therefore have the opportunity to change the distribution system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m03.html_para12"><a name="stpa_40">We want to take this opportunity to consider four main issues. First, the formulae that we use to distribute grant are designed to reflect the relative circumstances of local authorities, as well as the policy or operational context for local authority services. There have been developments over the years which mean that some formulae are simply out of date in that, for example, they still use old data such as that from the 1991 census.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m03.html_para13"><a name="stpa_41">Secondly, we need to establish a firm basis for the introduction of three year settlements for local government. As part of that agenda, we need to find ways of making the finance settlements more forward looking to reflect growth in population.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m03.html_para14"><a name="stpa_42">Thirdly, we are examining ways of distributing grant that do not involve&#151;or appear to involve&#151;second-guessing councils&#039; spending and taxation decisions, to clarify accountability and responsibility for local choices.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m03.html_para15"><a name="stpa_43">Finally, the system needs to reflect the change that is taking place in Government funding for schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m03.html_para16"><a name="stpa_44">Following the last review of grant distribution formulae, the Government have run a number of research projects and have been working with local government and other interested parties to consider possible changes to the formulae which could be introduced once the freeze had ended. The official level Settlement Working Group, consisting of representatives from all types of local authority in England along with interested parties from central Government, has considered some 75 technical papers together with research reports over that period. Separate technical groups have examined the formulae for the Police, Fire and Rescue services. I am grateful to all those who assisted the Government whether by contributing to these discussions or helping with the research and survey work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m03.html_para17"><a name="stpa_45">Following on from that work, the Government are now launching public consultation on options for change to the formula grant system. I am today publishing the consultation document on the ODPM website at:

<a name="50719m03.html_para18"><a name="stpa_46">http://www.local.odpm.gov.uk/finance/0607/consult/index.htm.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m03.html_para19"><a name="stpa_47">Copies have been placed in the Vote Office and the Library of the House. We look forward to receiving views on our proposals. The consultation period will close on 10 October and the Government will then decide on the shape of the formula grant system from 2006&#150;07 onwards.

 In February 2005, the Government published &quot;Controlling our Borders: Making migration work for Britain&quot;, a five-year strategy for immigration and asylum. I would like to update the House today on progress in three key areas: the development of a points-based scheme for managed migration; the introduction of new policies on limited leave, active review, and settlement for refugees; and the commencement of citizenship tests for new UK citizens.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m05.html_para0"><a name="stpa_91">We are publishing today a consultation document, &quot;Selective Admission: making migration work for Britain&quot;, which is the next step in development of a single points-based system for all routes to work, train and study in the UK. There is no doubt that skilled migrants continue to make a substantial contribution to our prosperity. Migration helps to fill gaps in the labour market, especially in public services such as health and education, and increases investment, innovation and entrepreneurship in the UK. International students contribute significantly to our education system and account for some &#163;5 billion in exports value a year. We have to ensure that the system is focused towards those with the skills and talent this country needs, so migration works for Britain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m05.html_para1"><a name="stpa_92">The existing system is complicated and has developed over many decades. It needs to be simplified so that the general public can understand clearly the basis on which migrants are admitted, and why; so that employers, educational institutions and applicants find it swift, un-bureaucratic and value for money; and so that decision-makers find it straightforward to administer. The key tests for the system are that it should be operable, robust against abuse, objective, flexible to our changing economic circumstances, cost effective, transparent, useable and compatible with EU and international legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m05.html_para2"><a name="stpa_93">In order to keep the system robust against abuse, a key principle is that all those who benefit from migration, not just the Government but also employers, educational institutions and migrants themselves, should play a part in helping to ensure that it is not abused. We are consulting on a system of sponsorship which should help to ensure that we only admit those who meet our criteria, that people stick to the terms of their leave to enter while they are here and leave when

<a name="50719m06.html_sbhd5"><h4 align=center>Rail Freight</h4>












<p><a name="st_25"><a name="50719m06.html_spmin5"><b>The Secretary of State for Transport  (Mr. Alistair Darling): </b> 
 As prosperity and the demand for goods grow, efficient freight transport is increasingly vital to the UK economy. The Railways Act 2005 has placed responsibility for rail freight in England with the Department for Transport and, with the repeal of section 206 of the Transport Act 2000, the SRA&#039;s 2001 Rail Freight Strategy will cease to be in force. It is important, therefore, that the Government restate clearly their objectives for rail freight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m06.html_para4"><a name="stpa_106">The Ten Year Plan for Transport, published in 2000, forecast potential growth in rail freight of up to 80 per cent. to 2010. This was interpreted by many as a target, though we had always made it clear that actual growth would depend on a number of factors&#151;in particular, the success of rail freight operators in winning business in highly competitive markets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m06.html_para5"><a name="stpa_107">In fact, although it is now recognised that the 80 per cent. forecast is unlikely to be met, growth in the rail freight market has been impressive. Rail freight is a thriving and competitive private sector industry, and since privatisation (1995), levels of freight moved have increased by 55 per cent. (measured in tonne km). Rail freight&#039;s market share also increased over the same period from 8.5 per cent. to 11.5 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m06.html_para6"><a name="stpa_108">The Government welcome this growth and wish to see it continue. Our clear policy aim is to see goods being moved in a sustainable way, which maximises benefits to the economy and to society. For instance, because they generally have less impact on society than road transport, rail and water freight can bring substantial benefits. In 2004&#150;05, the rail freight industry moved the equivalent of over 7 million lorry journeys and saved 1.43 billion lorry kilometres, delivering significant reductions in pollution and congestion. We believe rail therefore has a crucial role to play in goods transport alongside other modes, and we wish to see freight travelling by rail instead of road wherever this makes most sense.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m06.html_para7"><a name="stpa_109">This aim can be delivered most effectively by a competitive and dynamic private sector rail freight industry, and this is borne out by the growth since 





<br>&nbsp;<br>19 Jul 2005 : Column 72WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

privatisation, which has been driven by real on-rail competition throughout the industry, including several new entrants to the market. We will not dictate to the industry how it should run its business or become involved in operational issues. Where disputes occur with other parts of the railway, they should be resolved through established rail industry dispute procedures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m06.html_para8"><a name="stpa_110">But the Government do have a role to play and a relationship with the rail freight industry. Rail freight companies run on the same tracks as the publicly specified passenger railway, so the Government have to be mindful of their needs. And the Government recognise and wishes to encourage the important environmental and economic benefits that rail freight can bring.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m06.html_para9"><a name="stpa_111">We will therefore ensure that our policies and regulations do not put unnecessary obstacles in the way of future growth; we will continue to provide financial support where it is affordable and offers the greatest environmental, congestion and safety benefits when assessed alongside support for other modes; and we will ensure that in specifying the passenger railways, we recognise and take into account the consequences of our decisions upon the rail freight industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m06.html_para10"><a name="stpa_112">To achieve this, we will:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m06.html_para11"><a name="stpa_113"><i>Continue to support the principle of incremental access charges for freight operators</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m06.html_para12"><a name="stpa_114">Rail freight&#039;s ability to compete against road and other modes is dependent upon stable and affordable charging for access to the network. The Government support this and believe it is best achieved through the principle of freight operators paying charges which reflect only the costs that they impose upon the network (in line with the charging principles set out in EU Directive 2001/14). We will therefore work with the rail industry to ensure this remains the case&#151;for instance, providing clear-guidance if and when the level of freight charges is reviewed by the ORR.

<p>
<a name="50719m06.html_para14"><a name="stpa_116">In order for rail freight companies and their customers to invest, they need certainty about where and when they can run trains on the network. The Government will work with the industry to develop robust demand forecasting and modelling tools, and to ensure that it understands the needs of the freight industry when developing its high level output specification and other key policies. We will ensure that our appraisal methodologies treat freight and passenger interests equitably, and we have also committed through the Railways Act to ensuring that appropriate compensation will be provided should the contractual interests of freight companies or others be impaired by changes in outputs. In addition, we welcome Network Rail&#039;s decision to produce a national freight utilisation strategy, which will act as a key input to the route utilisation strategies, and also the ORR&#039;s recently published policy that UK freight operators should be eligible for access contracts of up to ten years (and longer in exceptional circumstances).

In the meantime, the Department will consider in consultation with the industry the most appropriate future form for Company Neutral Revenue Support and other grant programmes (which may include opening funding to flows originating from the Channel Tunnel) within the Sustainable Distribution Fund, and seek renewed state aids clearance.

Once that has been completed, we will consider with the industry how we can support, fund and accommodate change. This could be through reallocations of capacity within the existing network which make sense for both passengers and freight, incorporating incremental freight benefits into planned renewals, or considering how freight-specific enhancements might be taken forward by either the private sector or, in the long-term, the Government (subject to strict affordability and value for money criteria).

The Railways Act gave increased powers to support rail freight to the devolved administrations, and we will work with them (and with other partners such as TfL and the Passenger Transport Executives) to ensure that policies relating to rail freight across the UK are consistent.

 On the 6 July last year the Secretary of State announced a consultation on the issue of building a new expressway to run parallel with the M6 between Birmingham and Manchester as an alternative to the widening proposal announced to the House in December 2002.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m07.html_para0"><a name="stpa_125">The consultation, which sought views on whether the Highways Agency should carry out more detailed development work and a feasibility study, closed on 21 October 2004. Approximately 9,500 responses from a range of stakeholders were analysed. A breakdown of the responses has been placed in the Library of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m07.html_para1"><a name="stpa_126">The M6 is an important transport artery linking the midlands and the north-west. An investment of &#163;7.6 billion has been made to upgrade the west coast main line, part of which runs through this artery. However, the Government have accepted the need for more road capacity, as shown by the midlands to Manchester multi-modal study. The issue is how best that capacity can be provided taking full account of the impact of construction&#151;through a widening scheme, or via an expressway running broadly parallel to the existing route.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m07.html_para2"><a name="stpa_127">Providing additional capacity to the M6 between Birmingham and Manchester, whether in the form of widening the existing motorway or a tolled expressway, will require a huge investment. It is vital that we examine the options carefully and choose the right way to provide the capacity needed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m07.html_para3"><a name="stpa_128">The Secretary of State has considered the views expressed in the consultation. While it is clear that there is no consensus in favour of the expressway proposition, the option is no more than an outline at this stage. More evidence on the widening and expressway propositions is needed before a decision on a preferred option can be taken.

Both expressway and widening options will be worked up in parallel. The next stage is a decision on which option to take to public inquiry, following further consultation on the options. I have asked the Highways Agency to provide further advice with a view to taking that decision next year. Whichever option is chosen, the financial, economic and environmental appraisal work to be carried out over the coming year will be required

<a name="50719m07.html_para5"><a name="stpa_130">The work on widening will examine the technological and physical practicalities of locking in the benefits of that additional capacity. This will involve considering a number of measures, which could be used individually or in combination, such as access management; segregated lanes for priority traffic; speed controls; and pricing on the new capacity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719m07.html_para6"><a name="stpa_131">The expressway would take around a year longer to bring to public inquiry than the widening proposal, because of the need to appoint a concessionaire. However, this additional time would be made up during construction, because the expressway would be built alongside the existing motorway. In contrast, widening the existing motorway would involve extensive traffic management during construction, which would lengthen the construction timescales by about a year. Our current best estimate is that work on the widening scheme could start on the ground in 2011 with the scheme opening to traffic in 2016; and that work on the expressway could start on the ground in 2012 with the scheme opening to traffic in 2016. This is in line with the estimated delivery date of the widening as reported by the midlands to Manchester multi-modal study.
