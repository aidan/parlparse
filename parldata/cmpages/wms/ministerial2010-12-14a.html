 My noble Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (Baroness Wilcox) has today made the following statement:</p>
<a name="101214m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="10121439000187"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The Telecommunications Council took place in Brussels on  3 December and was chaired by the Belgian presidency.</p>

An official from BIS also attended.</p>

</ul><a name="101214m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="10121439000190"><ul><p class="tabletext">In order to inform and shape the debate, Ministers were asked to consider three questions on this issue and I enclose the full text within annex A to this statement. In summary, they covered issues related to: stimulating competition; the impact of new technologies; and whether a cap on retail data prices was an appropriate course of action.</p>
</ul><a name="101214m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="10121439000191"><ul><p class="tabletext">I understand that the discussion was positive in nature and below is a summary of the main points made during the debate:</p>
</ul><a name="10121439000228"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Commission and most member states see the introduction of greater competition in the EU roaming market as the way to decrease what are regarded as relatively high prices for consumers;</p>
</ul><a name="10121439000229"><ul><p class="tabletext">However, price regulation was seen by both the Commission and most member states as the least preferred option;</p>
</ul><a name="10121439000230"><ul><p class="tabletext">A recognition that the recently agreed telecommunications framework package would not be re-opened in respect of mobile roaming;</p>
</ul><a name="10121439000231"><ul><p class="tabletext">Technology was seen as one way that might allow for a diversity of approaches to tackle this issue and would, therefore, bring down prices over time for consumers; and</p>
</ul><a name="10121439000232"><ul><p class="tabletext">It was preferable to adopt a solution that was based on a multi-stakeholder approach.</p>
</ul><a name="101214m0001.htm_brev5"><a name="10121439000192"><ul><p class="tabletext">The UK's contribution to the debate was as detailed in my pre-Council statement and confirmed the UK's views that a solution may not necessarily involve regulation featuring retail price controls and that the UK preferred a solution based on a multi-stakeholder approach. I am pleased to report that these points were noted by Commissioner Kroes during her summing up of the debate.</p>

release of certain spectrum bands and how to overcome problems associated with this; and the role of the EU in international spectrum negotiations.</p>
</ul><a name="101214m0001.htm_brev9"><a name="10121439000196"><ul><p class="tabletext">The presidency began with a progress report on this item and was followed by Commissioner Kroes giving a short presentation of her views. The main points of which were:</p>
</ul><a name="10121439000233"><ul><p class="tabletext">She noted the importance of spectrum to both citizens and business-the main drivers being its contribution towards improving the EU's global competitiveness and the social and quality life improvements it could bring through applications such as e-health;</p>
</ul><a name="10121439000234"><ul><p class="tabletext">Thus, it was no longer sustainable to "do nothing" and that it was important that member states needed to agree the bold proposals within the RSPP;</p>
</ul><a name="10121439000235"><ul><p class="tabletext">She also noted that many member states have specific issues with the proposed deadlines for clearing and authorising specific spectrum bands;</p>
</ul><a name="10121439000236"><ul><p class="tabletext">However, she indicated that she regarded the clearance of the 800 MHz spectrum-that currently associated with analogue television broadcasting-as a key step in making the Commission's broadband strategy targets a reality (in particular the target associated with 30+Mbps-Ref: EM 13874/10) and she was keen not to see the stated deadline of 1 January 2013 slip;</p>
</ul><a name="10121439000237"><ul><p class="tabletext">She proposed that the Commission should have a greater role in international and bilateral negotiations regarding spectrum; and</p>
</ul><a name="10121439000238"><ul><p class="tabletext">Briefly covered the proposal to produce an inventory of spectrum currently used in the EU.</p>
</ul><a name="101214m0001.htm_brev10"><a name="10121439000197"><ul><p class="tabletext">She concluded by stating the importance of reaching an early agreement on the RSPP.</p>
</ul><a name="101214m0001.htm_brev11"><a name="10121439000198"><ul><p class="tabletext">Member states' interventions then followed. The main points of UK's intervention were:</p>
</ul><a name="10121439000239"><ul><p class="tabletext">Stressing the overall positive nature of the RSPP and its proposals;</p>
</ul><a name="10121439000240"><ul><p class="tabletext">We recognised that many member states, including UK, had issues regarding the deadline associated with the release of spectrum and that UK preferred an extension to the deadline associated with release of 800 MHz from January 2013 to January 2015;</p>
</ul><a name="10121439000241"><ul><p class="tabletext">UK also has concerns regarding the proposals covering "block sizes" of spectrum;</p>
</ul><a name="10121439000242"><ul><p class="tabletext">UK wished to review the Commission's proposal on a spectrum inventory before commenting further but proposed that any inventory should cover both public and private spectrum holdings; and</p>
</ul><a name="10121439000243"><ul><p class="tabletext">That we regarded that matters relating to international spectrum negotiations as mainly a member state competency and that should remain the case.</p>
</ul><a name="101214m0001.htm_brev12"><a name="10121439000199"><ul><p class="tabletext">Other member states' interventions noted that the RSPP proposal was critical in making a positive contribution to the wider Europe 2020 strategy and generally shared UK's concerns and supported our position on both spectrum release deadlines (especially for member states who share borders with non-EU states) and an increased role for the EU in international negotiations. However, a number of member states requested Commission assistance with negotiations with non-EU neighbours.</p>
</ul><a name="101214m0001.htm_brev13"><a name="10121439000200"><ul><p class="tabletext">There was general support for UK's call for local circumstances to be taken into account when considering spectrum release deadlines. Several member states indicated concerns regarding the necessary resource to undertake an inventory.</p>
</ul><a name="101214m0001.htm_brev14"><a name="10121439000201"><ul><p class="tabletext">In her summing-up of the debate, Commissioner Kroes reiterated her preference for a January 2013 release date, but indicated the possibility of derogations for member states who share borders with non-EU states (a proposal that would not apply to nor resolve the UK's issues with the proposed deadline).</p>
</ul><a name="101214m0001.htm_brev15"><a name="10121439000202"><ul><p class="tabletext">Finally, during a final intervention, the presidency expressed concern that the Commission may not fully appreciate the extent of concerns of, and problems for member states associated with the proposed spectrum release deadlines.</p>

In response, the Commission indicated that the EU needed the flexibility of a time-limited mandate, given the rapidly changing nature of issues related to ENISA's work.

 I wish to inform the House that today, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, together with the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development, is publishing the first progress report on developments in Afghanistan, which I announced we would publish every month in my statement to the House on 27 October.</p>

NATO and Afghanistan also agreed the framework of a long-term partnership that looks beyond the end of ISAF's current mission. The summit set out the timetable for transition of lead responsibility for security from international to Afghan forces by the end of 2014.</p>

It will see ISAF's role evolve away from combat towards increased training, mentoring and support.

The significant uplift in troop numbers has corresponded to an increase in military operations, particularly in those areas where insurgent activity is still strong, although this has not caused a significant increase in civilian casualties.</p>

to increase its financial flexibility. Then, following the McFarland review in 2002, FSS Ltd was established as a GovCo, wholly owned by the Government, in December 2005. The intention was that this be a transitional step towards a "public-private partnership".</p>

This meant that FSS continued operating uncompetitive terms and conditions and expanded its employment levels between 1999 and 2003. This was undertaken without bringing down the cost base towards a level where FSS would be able to compete.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"><a name="101214m0001.htm_para26"><a name="10121439000161">The previous Government supported the company with a further £50 million grant from early 2009 to restructure the business.</p>

FSS is currently making operating losses of around £2 million per month. Its cash is due to run out as early as January next year. It is vital that we take clear and decisive action to sort this out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="101214m0001.htm_para28"><a name="10121439000163">The police have advised us that their spend on external forensic suppliers will continue to fall over the next few years, as forces seek to maximise efficiencies in this area. HMIC concurs with this assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"><a name="101214m0001.htm_para29"><a name="10121439000164">We have therefore decided to support the wind down of FSS, transferring or selling off as much of its operations as possible. We will work with FSS management and staff, ACPO, and other suppliers to ensure an orderly transition, but our firm ambition is that there will be no continuing state interest in a forensics provider by March 2012.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"><a name="101214m0001.htm_para30"><a name="10121439000165">There is no justification for the uncertainty and costs of trying to restructure and retain the business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="101214m0001.htm_para31"><a name="10121439000166">We will ensure the orderly wind down of FSS does not impact on police service customers or the wider criminal justice system. With ACPO, we will put in place a central team to ensure work is transferred in a controlled way and that arrangements are put in place to ensure security of supply in future. The continued provision of effective forensics is our priority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="101214m0001.htm_para32"><a name="10121439000167">We know that there are real challenges ahead for FSS staff whose skills and contribution will be important as we move through the transition. We will be working hard with the company to ensure that staff are kept fully informed of developments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_378"><a name="101214m0001.htm_para33"><a name="10121439000168">We will also be working with ACPO to seek to maximise the level of competition in the market including through opportunities created by FSS leaving the field. This will help to ensure that police forces benefit from cost-effective use of forensics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"><a name="101214m0001.htm_para34"><a name="10121439000169">We want to see the UK forensic science industry operating as a genuine market, with private sector providers competing to provide innovative services at the lowest cost. This will preserve police resources and maximise the positive impact forensic sciences can have on tackling crime. A competitive market can help to drive down prices and improve turnaround times, meaning serious crimes can be cleared up more quickly and efficiently. Ultimately, that is what everyone in the criminal justice system wants to see.</p>

 I wish to update the House on Crossrail progress since my annual update on 15 July 2010, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 43-44WS, in which I undertook to report later in the year on progress made by Crossrail Ltd on their value-for-money programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"><a name="101214m0001.htm_para38"><a name="10121439000175">The spending review announcement confirmed Government's joint commitment with the Mayor of London to delivering Crossrail, and secured the funding to deliver the scheme to its original scope.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"><a name="101214m0001.htm_para39"><a name="10121439000176">As I indicated in July, Crossrail Ltd has been undertaking a programme of value engineering, risk avoidance and mitigation, alongside indirect cost reduction to ensure that the scheme is delivered in the most efficient way possible. In line with this approach, the Government accepted an engineering-led solution to delivering the central section which has enabled substantial savings of around £1 billion to the Crossrail funding package to be identified. While the construction programme for the central section will be lengthened by around a year, this has enabled the Government to confirm that funding is available for the whole project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"><a name="101214m0001.htm_para40"><a name="10121439000177">We now expect that Crossrail services will commence from 2018.

 The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council was held on  6 December 2010 in Brussels. I represented the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_389"><a name="101214m0001.htm_para44"><a name="10121439000182">The main item on the agenda was a policy debate on the pregnant workers directive. Ahead of Council, the UK with the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Netherlands, Slovakia and Sweden circulated a joint minute statement. This underlined the importance of subsidiarity and member state competence in setting social security systems; criticised the EP's First Reading position; questioned the value of further negotiations; and called for a "pause for reflection" involving a Council impact assessment and consultation with social partners. In my intervention, I argued that the negotiations may be at the "end of the road" and while Council should at the very least have a pause for reflection, I see little point in further negotiations given the gulf between the co-legislators. We will continue to argue for these proposals to be abandoned. Despite the opposition of many member states to the proposal, the presidency  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_390"><a name="101214m0001.htm_para45"><a name="10121439000183">The other main agenda item was on pensions. The Council adopted conclusions and in the ensuing debate, the presidency asked the member states what measures they were taking to ensure the provision of adequate pensions, and asked for their initial reactions to the Green Paper on pensions. I outlined the UK's reforms to improve state pensions, to encourage earlier saving for retirement and to extend working lives. In reaction to the Green Paper, I acknowledged the value added through sharing of best practice at a European level but stressed that there could be no "one size fits all" solution. In particular, I argued there was no evidence for why Solvency II capital requirements should be applied to pensions, which, far from being in consumers' interests, could seriously weaken defined benefit schemes.</p>

Council took note of presidency conclusions on the Commission's flagship initiatives "Youth On the Move" and "New Skills and Jobs"; of Employment Committee opinions on employment and environment and the examination of countries' employment policies; and of a joint Employment Committee and Social Policy Committee opinion on a monitoring framework for employment policies. It also adopted Council conclusions on employment policies and the green economy, adapting to an ageing workforce, the social elements of the Europe 2020 strategy, social services of general interest and gender.</p>

This explained our decision not to opt in to the decision, our intention to seek a reciprocal exemption for non-active persons, and our disagreement with the interpretation given by the Council Legal Services to how the duty of sincere co-operation applied in these circumstances.</p>
