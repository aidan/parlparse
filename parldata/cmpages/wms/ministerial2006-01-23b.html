 My noble Friend the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor has made the following written ministerial statement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60123m01.html_para8"><a name="stpa_8">&quot;The Government announced plans for significant constitutional reform on 12 June 2003, designed to enhance the independence of the judiciary and to ensure clarity in the relationship between the Executive and the judiciary. I plan shortly to introduce the required statutory instruments to bring into force those parts of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 that will deliver the central aspects of those reforms. As of 3 April 2006, I intend to bring the new Judicial Appointments Commission into being and commence those aspects of the Act that give statutory effect to the provisions of the concordat I agreed with the Lord Chief Justice.

The Lord Chief Justice will hold the additional title of President of the Courts of England and Wales and be legally recognised as the head of the judiciary in England and Wales. As set out in the Concordat, the role of the Lord Chief Justice will be significantly reformed and strengthened. To support the Lord Chief Justice, the Judicial Office for England and Wales has been established and the new head of that office has recently been appointed and taken up post.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60123m01.html_para11">&quot;In addition, to give effect to the new arrangements for the handling of judicial disciplinary matters, a new office for judicial complaints will be established. The arrangements relating to judicial complaints and discipline will be published shortly&quot;.

 The television licence fee settlement announced by the Government in February 2000 provides for changes in the licence fee of RPI plus 1.5 per cent. for each year from 2000&#150;01 to 2006&#150;07. This settlement is designed to enable the BBC to provide a strong and distinctive schedule of high quality programmes and remain at the forefront of broadcasting technology. The settlement includes a requirement for the corporation to raise over &#163;1 billion through efficiency savings and increased income over the period.

The necessary regulations to bring these fees into force will be laid before the House in due course. The changes will come into effect from the 1 April this year.

This single grant to all fire and rescue authorities will replace the grants paid to some authorities under the Community Fire Safety Innovation Fund and the Arson Control Forum Implementation Fund in 2003&#150;06, and provide revenue funding to complement the capital grants paid to all fire and rescue authorities under the Home Fire Risk Check Initiative in 2004&#150;08.

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="60123m02.html_spmin2"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Andy Burnham): </b> 
 Further to Baroness Scotland&#039;s statement of Wednesday 18 January, the Paymaster General and I are this afternoon meeting senior figures in law enforcement and the banking sector to discuss action against ID fraud. The significance of ID fraud has been further emphasised by recent attempts by organised criminals to defraud the tax credit system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60123m02.html_para11"><a name="stpa_46">The meeting will discuss further ways of improving joint working on ID fraud, in particular through developing the work of public-private groups like the Home Office-led Identity Fraud Steering Committee (IFSC). Criminals who target the public sector are also likely to target the private sector. The meeting will also be discussing ways of ensuring the maximum appropriate sharing of information to protect public and private sector organisations from ID fraud.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60123m02.html_para12"><a name="stpa_47">As Baroness Scotland set out in her statement, the introduction of a secure national identity scheme/identity cards scheme using biometric information will make a step change in protecting people from identity fraud. As part of the work of the Ministerial Committee on ID cards, HMRC and the Home Office continue to evaluate the role of the national identity register in combating identity fraud.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60123m02.html_para13"><a name="stpa_48">At the meeting, the Paymaster General and I will be proposing a four step action programme to be taken forward urgently over the next few months under the Identity Fraud Steering Committee:
</p>

<p>
<a name="60123m02.html_para14"><a name="stpa_49">First, Government will explore with CIFAS&#151;the UK&#039;s Fraud Prevention Service&#151;the procedures for notifying them of the details of employees whose identities have been compromised as a result of large scale ID theft. This will help ensure that employees whose records have been stolen will not suffer adverse impact on their credit ratings and protect their identities from further abuse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60123m02.html_para15"><a name="stpa_50">Secondly, the IFSC will take forward urgently plans to encourage credit reference agencies and CIFAS to share information with the public sector, for example by welcoming public sector organisations into the CIFAS membership. It will also work to ensure public sector organisations take full advantage of these new opportunities, for example by becoming full members of the CIFAS network. This will ensure that the details of criminals who defraud, for example, the tax credit system are shared in the same way as those criminals who attack private sector organisations. This will enable partners in both the public and private sector to detect and prevent identity related crime.

<a name="60123m02.html_para20">I have made copies of the consultation document, &quot;Our Energy Challenge: securing clean, affordable energy for the long term&quot; available in the Vote Office and the Libraries of the House. Copies and further information are also available on the Internet at www.dti.gov.uk/energy/review.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60123m02.html_para21"><a name="stpa_54">The key questions posed by the consultation document are:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">What more could the Government do on the demand or supply side to ensure that the UK&#039;s long-term goal of reducing carbon emissions is met?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">With the UK becoming a net energy importer and with big investments to be made over the next 20 years in generating capacity and networks, what further steps, if any, should the Government take to develop our market framework for delivering reliable energy supplies? In particular, we invite views on the implications of increased dependence on gas imports.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">The Energy White Paper left open the option of nuclear new build. Are there particular considerations that should apply to nuclear, as the Government re-examine the issues bearing on new build? If so, what are these, and how should the Government address them?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">Are there particular considerations that should apply to carbon abatement and other low-carbon technologies in the context of electricity generation?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">What further steps should be taken towards meeting the Government&#039;s goals for ensuring that every home is adequately and affordably heated?</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60123m02.html_para22"><a name="stpa_55">Comments are also invited on:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">The long term potential of energy efficiency measures in the transport, residential business and public sectors, and how best to achieve that potential</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">Implications in the medium and long term for the transmission and network networks of significant new build in gas and electricity generation infrastructure</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">Opportunities for more joint working with other countries on our energy policy goals</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">Potential measures to help bring forward technologies to replace fossil fuels in transport and heat generation in the medium and long term.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60123m02.html_para23"><a name="stpa_56">The Government have a genuinely open mind on solutions. However, it is clear that there are no simple &quot;one-technology&quot; answers. The Review will take account of the evidence gathered during the consultation when developing its proposals.
