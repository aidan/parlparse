<p><a name="40430m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Mr. Ian Pearson): </b> 
 I have placed copies of the &quot;Northern Ireland Prison Service&#039;s Corporate and Business Plan for 2004&#150;2007&quot; in the Libraries of both Houses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40430m01.html_para0">The Corporate and Business Plan contains key performance targets I have set for the service for 2004&#150;05. These are:

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">No escape for top and high-risk prisoners.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">No more than three escapes per 1,000 medium and low risk prisoners.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The number of staff assaulted by prisoners is less than a ratio of five per 100 prisoners.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The number of prisoners assaulted by prisoners is less than a ratio of six per 100 prisoners.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">An average of at least 18 hours constructive activity per week for each sentenced prisoner.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">An average of at least nine hours constructive activity per week for each remand prisoner.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">To ensure 82.5 per cent. of prisoners serving six months or more are working to a resettlement plan and that 95 per cent. of lifers work to a resettlement plan, including preparation of the plan, in the first six months from sentence.</p>

<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Deliver at least 85 per cent. of the planned training days associated with the agreed corporate training priorities.</p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Ensure the average cost per prisoner place does not exceed the target to be agreed with HM Treasury.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="40430m01.html_para1">The Government have committed substantial resources to implementing the Steele report, so that staff remains in full control. This does not mean any reduction in the need to tackle the other costs that make for an excessively high cost per prisoner place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40430m01.html_para2">Also, in light of developments following the Steele report, and to support the development of partnerships with a wider range of statutory and voluntary agencies beyond the criminal justice system, I have agreed some adjustments to the service&#039;s statement of purpose, which now reads as follows:

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">&quot;The Northern Ireland Prison Service, through our staff, serves the community by keeping in secure, safe and humane custody those committed by the courts; by working with prisoners and with other organisations seeks to reduce the risk of re-offending; and in so doing aims to protect the public and to contribute to peace and stability in Northern Ireland.&quot;</p>

Both describe how the Home Office builds trust and security, by promoting cohesive communities and active citizenship; and through the effective enforcement of law, order and our borders. Both the report and the plan describe how these themes provide the context for all that we do, and contribute towards civil renewal. The report is primarily focused on 2003&#150;04, setting out our performance against key targets and describing how our activities contributed towards them.

<p><a name="40430m01.html_spmin5"><b>The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration  (Mr. Desmond Browne): </b> 
 The Government have today published the report of Stephen Shaw, the prisons and probation ombudsman, into the allegations of racism and abuse at Yarl&#039;s Wood immigration removal centre, which were reported by the Daily Mirror in December. The report is available on the immigration and nationality directorate (IND) website at http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/default.asp?pageid=4903. Copies of the report have been placed in the House Library.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40430m01.html_para12">We are very grateful to Stephen Shaw for the speed and thoroughness of his investigation and for the comprehensive nature of his report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40430m01.html_para13">The investigation of this matter has revealed a number of disconcerting incidents at Yarl&#039;s Wood and confirmed that the principal allegations published by the Daily Mirror were correct. However, Stephen Shaw was able to establish that the remarks reported by the Daily Mirror were made by a small number of people at Yarl&#039;s

<a name="40430m01.html_para14">Stephen Shaw&#039;s investigation was preceded by an internal investigation by Global Solutions Ltd. (GSL), the company contracted by IND to operate Yarl&#039;s Wood. This investigation resulted in the dismissal of one member of staff and the suspension of another, followed by his resignation. Stephen Shaw satisfied himself as to the thoroughness of the GSL investigation and the appropriateness of the action taken by the company thereafter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40430m01.html_para15">Stephen Shaw&#039;s report, which also covers the security implications of the journalist&#039;s undercover activity, contains 19 recommendations directed at GSL and ten recommendations directed at IND and the independent monitoring board (IMB) at Yarl&#039;s Wood. GSL have responded positively to the recommendations made to them. We have accepted all the recommendations, including that relating to the need to investigate an historical allegation of assault on a detainee, and IND officials will be working closely with GSL and the IMB to implement them.

<a name="40430m02.html_sbhd1"><h4 align=center>Armed Forces Pension Scheme</h4>












<p><a name="40430m02.html_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Ivor Caplin): </b> 
 During Standing Committee consideration of the Armed Forces (Pensions and Compensation) Bill in February, concern was expressed that the Government should provide more independent oversight of the arrangements provided for the armed forces in this area. I made clear to Committee members that I recognised the intent behind these concerns and we have considered how we might respond. We have now decided that we will give the independent Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) a role in externally validating the provisions of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS); we plan that this will be done in the context of their quinquennial valuation of the AFPS, though more frequent examinations of the scheme provisions could be undertaken if wider developments justified this.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40430m02.html_para6">The broad intent is that the AFPRB would compare the scheme provisions with practice elsewhere in the economy and consider the extent to which they meet the recruitment and retention needs of the armed forces. The Review Body&#039;s observations would then be made public in a supplement to the following annual report and the Government would also make public their response to these observations. I am pleased to say that the Chairman of the Review Body and his colleagues have agreed to take on this additional responsibility and we are now in discussion on the detail to determine the timing of the first such review. I am confident that this change will provide for more independence in reviewing the terms of the AFPS while equally helping us to ensure coherence across the broader remuneration package, comprising both pay and pensions. It should also provide additional reassurance for service personnel by ensuring effective independent validation of the appropriateness of the pension provisions for our armed forces.

<p><a name="40430m02.html_spmin2"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Ivor Caplin): </b> 
 The first duty under the Freedom of Information Act to be implemented by Government Departments was the requirement to prepare publication schemes. MOD&#039;s publication scheme is accessible via the internet at www.foi.mod.uk . Since the scheme was published in November 2002, we have continued to look for opportunities to extend the commitment to make information available proactively. To date, a further five classes of information have been added to the original publication scheme and a process for identifying and adding more is in place. The new classes cover information provided by the Army Historical Branch, the Naval Historical Branch, Defence Analytical Services Agency (DASA) Corporate Documents, Defence Data Definitions, and Defence Statistics.






<br>&nbsp;<br>30 Apr 2004 : Column 66WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40430m02.html_para7">As a further step in this process, I am announcing today that a new class of information will be included to require publication of the consolidated results of corporate level quantitative opinion surveys carried out to gauge the attitude of members of the public to the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces. The results of similar surveys undertaken internally with a random cross-section of the Department&#039;s own staff will also be published. The results of the external corporate level surveys undertaken since 1999 are also being placed in the Library of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40430m02.html_para8">From October 2004, we also plan to release the results of the continuous attitude surveys that are undertaken by each of the three services to measure the morale and understand the concerns of their personnel across a spectrum of issues. These surveys are sent out annually to a random sample of around 8,000 military personnel at all ranks. This commitment to publish the results of these surveys will also be reflected through a class of information in MOD&#039;s publication scheme.
