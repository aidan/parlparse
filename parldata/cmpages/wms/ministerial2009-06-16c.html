 Yesterday we launched a consultation on measures aimed at enhancing further the rescue culture to give struggling, but viable, companies a greater  chance to succeed, thus saving jobs and providing better returns to creditors. In particular, the proposals consider:</p>
<a name="90616m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="09061628000055"><ul><p class="tabletext">extending to medium and large-sized companies the option of a moratorium against creditor action &#151; currently only available to small companies &#151; so they too can have a &#147;breathing space&#148; in which they can seek to agree with their creditors a means of securing a company rescue by means of a company voluntary arrangement;</p>
</ul><a name="90616m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="09061628000056"><ul><p class="tabletext">the introduction of a new court-sanctioned moratorium available to all companies, again to allow them time to reach agreement on a company voluntary arrangement; and</p>
</ul><a name="90616m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="09061628000057"><ul><p class="tabletext">providing greater security to repayment of monies loaned post company voluntary arrangement or administration, to allow firms in difficulties more chance of accessing the funding they need to get back on track.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="90616m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09061628000017">The proposals are part of the Government&#146;s business rescue measures that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the 2009 Budget report earlier this year.</p>

 I have today placed in the Library of the House a copy of the report of a survey on service voter registration conducted by Defence Analytical Services and Advice in November 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="90616m0001.htm_para4"><a name="09061628000023">The MOD has continued to work with the Electoral Commission and the Ministry of Justice to improve awareness among our armed forces personnel and their families of their options on registering to vote. This survey was undertaken to provide an estimate of the numbers of service personnel who are currently registered to vote and to draw comparison with the results of similar surveys carried out in each of the previous three years. These surveys help us to judge how best to encourage service personnel to register in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="90616m0001.htm_para5"><a name="09061628000024">I welcome the survey, as it provides the facts needed to refine future work. It indicates that 65 per cent. of service personnel are currently registered, compared with 69 per cent. in 2007 (a decrease that is assessed as not statistically significant), 63 per cent. in 2006 and 60 per cent. in 2005. Of those registered in 2008, the majority (75 per cent.) chose to register as ordinary rather than service voters. The level of voters registered as overseas voters has remained at 1 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="90616m0001.htm_para6"><a name="09061628000025">We acknowledge that there is still work to be done. The results of the survey will help to indicate where our efforts should be concentrated for the future. By continuing to work closely with colleagues in the MOJ and the EC to understand what might be the reasons behind the results, we hope to make further improvements to the quality of information available to our service personnel and their families. We remain committed to improving arrangements for the service community to exercise their right to vote.</p>

 I would like to inform the House of a new coastal change fund that I am establishing. The fund, of up to &#163;11 million, is designed to support communities in adapting to coastal change. I am inviting bids from local authorities interested in becoming coastal change pathfinders to pilot new approaches to planning for, and managing, change in partnership with their communities. Further details are set out in the &#147;Coastal Change Policy&#148; consultation which has also been published. Copies will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="90616m0001.htm_para9"><a name="09061628000029">Through the pathfinder programme, authorities will be able to test ideas and guidance on possible approaches to planning for and managing coastal change adaptation. Approaches could range from projects to help maintain beach access points damaged by coastal change; &#147;buy and lease back&#148; schemes to ease the transition where a property is at risk of being lost; and support for &#147;roll-back&#148; of caravan parks at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="90616m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09061628000030">These coastal change proposals are part of the Government&#146;s wider programme to support communities in adapting to flood and coastal erosion risk. It reflects the commitment, made in the Government&#146;s &#147;Making Space for Water&#148; strategy, to effective management of flood and erosion risk in a sustainable way which takes account of climate change. We will defend where it is sustainable and affordable to do so, but it will not be possible to protect every piece of coastline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="90616m0001.htm_para11"><a name="09061628000031">Where this is the case, communities will need to start preparing for and managing change. Significant progress has already been made with a programme of activities designed to support adaptation. These include the provision of better planning information through shoreline management plans and support for households to protect against flood risk through a &#163;5 million grants scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="90616m0001.htm_para14"><a name="09061628000035">On fisheries there was an exchange of views on the Commission&#146;s Green Paper on reform of the common fisheries policy, focusing on the main issues of concern to each member state, rather than a structured discussion on specific questions. There was much recognition of the need for widespread reform, with no member state supporting the status quo overall, however there was no real consensus about the detail of reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="90616m0001.htm_para15"><a name="09061628000036">Under any other fisheries business, the Commission updated the Ministers on their thinking on tackling the problem of discards. Though they expressed disappointed at the rate of progress so far, they were optimistic that some improvement could be made without having to wait for the common fisheries policy to be reformed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="90616m0001.htm_para16"><a name="09061628000037">On agriculture the presidency presented draft Council conclusions on the simplification of the CAP which all Ministers could support. Sweden, as upcoming presidency, confirmed its intention to come back to the issue of CAP simplification at Agriculture Council in November, with a view to ensuring progress is made on concrete simplification proposals. The Commission welcomed the Council conclusions and confirmed that their officials were already analysing the 39 specific simplification suggestions made in the list compiled at the previous Agriculture Council. The presidency confirmed that the conclusions had been adopted.</p>
