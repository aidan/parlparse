 On 19 July my predecessor, the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Watson), announced the publication of an independent report on the errors made in administering the Government&#146;s ex-gratia payment scheme for former far east prisoners of war and civilian internees. The report prepared by Mr. David Watkins was based on a detailed and thorough investigation of how inconsistent criteria came to be used in deciding payments to former civilian internees; this included consultation with the key affected parties. At the time of its publication, the Government welcomed the report and made clear that they would take time to consider further the detail of the recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="70314m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07031479000013">In responding to the report, the Ministry of Defence has consulted with the other Departments responsible both for developing and implementing the scheme in 2000-01, and for now providing guidance on the development of new policy. We have also consulted with the representative organisation for civilian internees, ABCIFER, and with the parliamentary ombudsman. The report made some 13 recommendations. Steps had already been taken since 2000 that address many of the shortcomings. These occurred quite independently, as part of the Government&#146;s work on better regulation and better policy making. Nevertheless, the recent reshaping of the FEPOW scheme in particular was able to benefit from the emerging recommendations and we are doing work to take them into account in the wider context of a wider review of the Department&#146;s guidance on policy making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="70314m0001.htm_para1"><a name="07031479000014">I have today placed in the Library of the House our detailed response to David Watkins&#146; recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="70314m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07031479000015">I would like to thank Mr. Watkins for his thorough investigation and comprehensive report and to acknowledge the major role played by the parliamentary ombudsman and Public Administration Select Committee in scrutinising the administration of the scheme and helping us to identify and resolve the errors within it. Finally, I would like to give credit again to Ron Bridge, the chairman of ABCIFER, for the enormous amount of painstaking work he has put into the process.</p>

headquarters at RAF High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire. The creation of a single command, with a single fully integrated headquarters, will better equip the RAF to provide a coherent and co-ordinated single air focus to the other services, MOD Head Office, the Permanent Joint Headquarters and the rest of MOD.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="70314m0001.htm_para3"><a name="07031479000017">Over the past five years the RAF has undertaken a significant amount of restructuring to improve delivery, reduce bureaucracy and eliminate waste. This has centred on force structure adjustments, estate rationalisation and logistics transformation. One element of this work focused on headquarters rationalisation and resulted in the collocation of Headquarters Personnel and Training Command and Headquarters Strike Command at RAF High Wycombe in October 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="70314m0001.htm_para4"><a name="07031479000018">The success of this work, which resulted in a reduction of some 1,000 posts across the two command headquarters and annual savings of some &#163;23 million, has enabled these resources to be better directed towards the delivery of support to the front line. The next step in this work is the creation of a single Air Command which reflects the continued commitment of the Government to ensuring that resources are focused on the front line. The recent draw down of personnel for collocation means, however, that the creation of a single Air Command is unlikely to lead to any manpower reductions.</p>

 I have received a report from Mike Nichols, Chairman and Chief Executive of the Nichols Group, on the Highways Agency major roads programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="70314m0001.htm_para13"><a name="07031479000035">In July 2006 the Highways Agency advised me of increases in its cost estimates for schemes in the Targeted Programme of Improvements (TPI). I was concerned that these estimates could be unreliable, since in the majority of cases costs had not been finally agreed with contractors. I therefore commissioned Mike Nichols to undertake an immediate review, with the following terms of reference:</p>
<a name="70314m0001.htm_brev5"><a name="07031479000036"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;To review the Highways Agency's approach to cost estimating and project management, and to make recommendations, including on how the Agency should best assess, monitor and report on risks to its cost estimates.&#148;</p>

He has confirmed that estimates have increased above initial forecasts, largely on schemes which are not yet in construction. The biggest single factor is higher than expected inflation in construction prices. He notes that estimating is inherently difficult for schemes with expenditure spreading over 10 or more years ahead,  <br>

and that the majority of the forward programme by value is at stages of development when estimates are inevitably uncertain. Importantly, he has made it clear that he is not saying that the Agency is paying more than it should do for its schemes; rather, the main concern is future delivery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="70314m0001.htm_para15"><a name="07031479000038">He has made a number of recommendations for improvements in the development and management of schemes, so that the large forward programme of investment can be successfully managed. He has suggested restructuring the roads programme into phases; improvements to the governance arrangements between the Department and the Agency; and improvements the Agency should make in estimating, risk management, procurement and delivery capability. I accept his recommendations and will ensure that priority is given to their implementation.</p>
