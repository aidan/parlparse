This lifespan extension will provide the Corporation with the necessary time to overcome barriers and challenges to the achievement of these aspirations, allowing them to build on their significant progress to date.

 On 7 May European Union (EU) Ministers agreed a Directive which for the first time establishes rules governingthe conditions under which meat chickens are kept. The package of new measures includes detailed requirements for holdings where meat chickens are kept, the introduction of a maximum stocking density limit, data collection and scientific monitoring of impacts on chicken welfare, training for the industry and a possible new welfare labelling regime following a report from the European Commission.

This is a major sector of livestock production with some 850 million meat chickens produced in the UK every year and 4 billion across the EU. It is therefore only right that we set harmonised welfare rules for these animals.</p>
