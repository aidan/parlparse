 As part of our commitment to ensure the safety and security of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games a contract has been signed between Airwave Solutions Ltd and the National Policing Improvement Agency for the enhancement of the Airwave radio service, which provides core radio communications for police, fire and ambulance services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="91102m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09110212000010">This &#163;39 million investment will fund an increase in the capability of the Airwave system in time for the 2012 Games which will mean it can cater for thousands more users from all of the emergency services. This will benefit all 2012 host venue police forces, fire and ambulance services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="91102m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09110212000011">This investment will provide capacity to support the additional policing requirements at all Olympic venues, coverage within Olympic venues, capability to support public order operational activities involving several thousand officers within confined geographical locations, and capability to address the risk of a spontaneous major incident while continuing to support business as usual and Olympics requirements.</p>

 Together with the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Young People and Families, Baroness Delyth Morgan, I have today issued statutory guidance to the UK Border Agency under section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="91102m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09110212000013">Section 55 comes into force today. It places a duty on the Secretary of State to make arrangements for ensuring that immigration, asylum, nationality and customs functions are discharged having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. A similar duty is placed on the Director of Border Revenue in respect of the director&#146;s functions. Subsections 55(3) and (5) require any person exercising any of these functions to have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State for this purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="91102m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09110212000014">Section 55 is intended to have the same effect as section 11 of the Children Act 2004 which places a similar duty on a range of key public bodies. This guidance is an important step in the process of bringing the UK Border Agency within the family of agencies who, together, have statutory responsibilities to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children when carrying out their duties. The guidance is supported by a programme of reform to improve the way in which children are treated in the immigration system, led by the agency&#146;s senior management, and  <br>
