ContactPoint will provide a tool to support better communication among practitioners across education, health, social care and youth offending. It will provide a quick way for those practitioners to find out who else is working with the same child or young person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="80221m0001.htm_para13"><a name="08022199000038"><i>Clear communication of responsibilities and accountabilities when the governance process is communicated to sponsors and partner organisations</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="80221m0001.htm_para14"><a name="08022199000039">We recognise the need for the Department to communicate clearly to local authorities and partner organisations, who will use ContactPoint, exactly what their responsibilities are and what is required of them. We are developing a comprehensive programme of training, readiness assessments and accreditation checks to ensure these organisations are properly prepared for these responsibilities. The review has identified a number of areas which will be critical to get right as these plans develop. We welcome this advice and will follow it as we finalise our plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="80221m0001.htm_para15"><a name="08022199000040"><i>Technical and procedural controls are subject to formal assurance under a recognised standard</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="80221m0001.htm_para16"><a name="08022199000041">In determining the security policy for ContactPoint, the project followed Government guidance on risk assessment and security controls set out in the manual of protective security. The manual was updated in August 2007. The design of ContactPoint is currently undergoing a re-baselining exercise. Once this is complete, we will fully update the risk assessment against the new criteria and initiate a formal, external assessment to ensure these risks are effectively controlled. The scope of this will include the self-certification and local data quality tool process issues highlighted by the review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="80221m0001.htm_para17"><a name="08022199000042"><i>Further controls are introduced over the access to data by central system users such as database administrators and report programmers</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="80221m0001.htm_para18"><a name="08022199000043">The review has correctly identified that we have significant controls in place to ensure the security of the core database, but has identified some areas in which these could be further improved. The ContactPoint project will undertake a rapid impact assessment to determine the most effective approach in our specific context, and will build this into the deployment plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="80221m0001.htm_para19"><a name="08022199000044"><i>Processes are defined for the secure </i><i>disposal of electronic and hard </i><i>copy media</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="80221m0001.htm_para20"><a name="08022199000045">Temporary guidance was issued to ensure secure storage and/or disposal of media used for initial load of data into the database. This was effective at the time, and will be reviewed against latest Government-wide best practice to inform standards for production processes. These additional controls will be in place before any data are loaded into the user acceptance test or live systems. The live system will also be designed to minimise, and where possible eliminate, the use of physical media.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="80221m0001.htm_para21"><a name="08022199000046"><i>Clear guidance about information security matters is provided to all helpdesk staff on the production system</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="80221m0001.htm_para22"><a name="08022199000047">The Deloitte review has highlighted one occasion where helpdesk guidance did not reflect best security practice. Formal helpdesk training has not yet taken place, and training plans will be reviewed to ensure that helpdesk staff are aware of security best practice, including the areas highlighted by the review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="80221m0001.htm_para23"><a name="08022199000048"><i>The project board should consider the appropriateness of obtaining formal independent assurance and accreditation of the supporting security operating procedures at connecting organisations before allowing connectivity or sponsorship</i></p>

 I have for some time been seeking more ways to remove foreign prisoners from our prisons, and to remove them earlier. I believe this will work to the benefit of our system, and today I can bring forward proposals that will help us to do this. The early removal scheme established under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 enables the Government to remove foreign national prisoners liable to deportation or administrative removal up to 135 days before the halfway point of their sentence. Since its introduction in June 2004, over 3,000 prisoners have been removed under the scheme. This has made a significant contribution to reducing the number of foreign national criminals in our prisons and on our streets. Given this success, the Government now believe the scheme can contribute more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="80221m0001.htm_para30"><a name="08022199000057">As of December 2007 there were 11,310 foreign national prisoners within the prison system, representing 14 per cent. of the total prison population. Foreign national prisoners represent a significant proportion of the prison population, although at 14 per cent. it is low in comparison to most other European countries. Of 17 western European states, the UK&#146;s proportion is the third lowest. France has 21 per cent., Germany 28 per cent., Italy 34 per cent., Greece 42 per cent. and Austria 43 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="80221m0001.htm_para31"><a name="08022199000058">The early removal scheme applies only to those foreign national prisoners who are able to be removed to their country of origin. Such prisoners only benefit from the scheme if their removal from the UK can be given immediate effect. We have been working to ensure that arrangements are in place so as to enable us to remove prisoners to their country of origin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="80221m0001.htm_para32"><a name="08022199000059">Prisoners serving a life or indeterminate sentence are not eligible to be considered for removal under the scheme. Determinate sentence prisoners serving a sentence of four years and over under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 for a sexual or violent offence are removed under the scheme only if the parole board considers that they would present an acceptable risk to the community.</p>

Should they seek to return to the United Kingdom during their sentence they can be detected by the border control officer on arrival at the UK border and returned to prison custody until the point at which they would have been released had they not otherwise been removed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="80221m0001.htm_para34"><a name="08022199000061">Based on the successful experience of the last three and a half years, and in particular our increasing experience of and success in securing travel documents from overseas countries and making other arrangements with them that enable us to remove prisoners, I believe the scheme can make an even greater contribution to removing criminals from our shores. I have therefore decided to extend the early removal scheme so as to enable prisoners to be removed 270 days early rather than the current 135. I will be laying the appropriate draft Order, which is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, and time will be found for a debate shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="80221m0001.htm_para35"><a name="08022199000062">The measure is entirely consistent with our strategy and with our earlier announcements, and I commend it to the House.</p>
