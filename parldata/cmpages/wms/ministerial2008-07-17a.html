<p><a name="st_61"><a name="08071779000061"><a name="80717m0001.htm_spmin3"><a name="08071779000315"><b>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Kitty Ussher):</b>
 The Government announced in November 2006 that, as part of its work to improve accountability for EU funds across the EU, HM Treasury would prepare an annual consolidated statement, audited by the NAO, on the use of such funds in the United Kingdom. We are today laying before Parliament the first of these statements, along with the Comptroller and Auditor General&#146;s (C&amp;AG) audit opinion and report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="80717m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08071779000062">The purpose of this arrangement is to strengthen the audit and parliamentary scrutiny of the UK&#146;s use of EU funds and help detect any weaknesses in the UK&#146;s management of these funds so that these can be more effectively and rapidly tackled. The statement and C&amp;AG&#146;s first report sets an excellent basis for doing this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="80717m0001.htm_para7"><a name="08071779000063">The C&amp;AG&#146;s positive opinion on regularity clearly shows that the management of EU funds by UK authorities during the period covered by the statement has been sound and that there has be no evidence of material irregularity in the payments made to beneficiaries. The Government welcome this finding, as providing assurance on the management of EU funds in the UK was one of the statement&#146;s key objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="80717m0001.htm_para8"><a name="08071779000064">The C&amp;AG&#146;s limitation of scope does make it clear that more needs to be done to improve the consistency of the recording and the accounting of EU funding by UK central government bodies. The Government are working to ensure these issues are addressed. In particular, improved guidance is being developed so that all future EU transactions and balances are recorded consistently and separately in the accounts of all the relevant entities. The actions taken this year will be the first in a rolling programme of improvement in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="80717m0001.htm_para9"><a name="08071779000065">This statement and the improvements that result from it will be important in building momentum for similar action to be taken by our EU partners. Such action is critical, as a positive &#147;statement of assurance&#148; from the European Court of Auditors on the reliability of the EU&#146;s accounts will only ever be obtained if measures to improve the management of agricultural and structural funds are taken by member states as well as the Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="80717m0001.htm_para10"><a name="08071779000066">In this context, the Government warmly welcome the statements that have been published by the Dutch Finance Ministry and the Danish National Audit Office, as well the Swedish initiative to publish a statement in the spring of next year. In time, the UK hopes to welcome similar reports on the use of EU funds from other member states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="80717m0001.htm_para11"><a name="08071779000067">The Government hope this statement and the C&amp;AG&#146;s audit opinion will be helpful to the European Court of Auditors and the Commission when they are performing their own audits and controls. I will be sending copies of this statement to both institutions, as well as to my counterparts in other member states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="80717m0001.htm_para12"><a name="08071779000068">It is crucial that EU taxpayers are given the necessary assurance that EU money is being spent correctly. The UK&#146;s initiative to publish this consolidated statement on its use of EU funds will make a positive contribution to ensuring this is the case. I will continue to work to encourage my counterparts in other member states to show a similar degree of commitment to providing such an assurance.</p>

<p><a name="st_62"><a name="08071779000069"><a name="80717m0001.htm_spmin4"><a name="08071779000316"><b>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Kitty Ussher):</b>
 Following the March 2005 Treasury Committee report on ATM (Automatic Teller Machine) charging, the Treasury invited the chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, the right hon. John McFall, to chair a Working Group on ATMs to take forward work on key issues. The Working Group, which included banks, independent ATM operators and consumer groups, published its report on 13 December 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="80717m0001.htm_para13"><a name="08071779000070">The Working Group announced an agreement to provide around 600 new free cash machines across 1,707 target low-income areas that it identified as lacking convenient access to these machines. To achieve this, a market-based financial incentive&#151;known as a &#147;financial inclusion premium&#148;&#151;was introduced, to encourage ATM operators to place or retain free ATMs in deprived areas with a low expected volume of transactions. The Working Group also agreed to implement improved transparency rules for charging cash machines. Since publication of the Working Group report, LINK has assessed around 10 per cent. of the identified low-income areas as unsuitable for an ATM location as there is no centre of population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="80717m0001.htm_para14"><a name="08071779000071">The Government are pleased to report that the industry has, over the 18 months following publication of the Working Group&#146;s report, made excellent progress towards its goals of placing around 600 non-charging machines in low-income areas across the UK, with around 2 million individuals on low incomes standing to benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="80717m0001.htm_para15"><a name="08071779000072">As of 30 June 2008, sites for 562 of the 600 new ATMs required have been identified. Of these, 419 new free machines are already in use and issuing cash to the public. Some 74 per cent. of these ATMs that are based in the target deprived areas receive the &#147;financial inclusion premium&#148;. Encouragingly, nine of these new cash machines have proved so popular that their level of withdrawals means that they have now graduated from the &#147;financial inclusion premium&#148; scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="80717m0001.htm_para16"><a name="08071779000073">Banks, building societies and independent ATM operators have all contributed new free-to-use cash machines; independent ATM operators have provided or are in the process of supplying around 35 per cent. of the confirmed new non-charging ATMs. The UK ATM network, LINK, is continuing to work with its member banks and ATM operators to identify suitable sites in the remaining target areas, and is engaging closely in this exercise with Members of Parliament, local authorities, consumer councils and retailers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="80717m0001.htm_para17"><a name="08071779000074">The benefits in terms of financial inclusion are clear. Data from LINK suggest that the new ATMs currently in operation or under contract will enable almost 1.3 million residents in the target low-income areas to access cash more conveniently and manage their money more effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="80717m0001.htm_para18"><a name="08071779000075">In terms of improved transparency, operators of cash machines that charge users for withdrawals and that can upload screens remotely, have met the end-June 2007 deadline to improve the onscreen standards of &#147;at a glance&#148; signage. This means that it is clear to a consumer when a charge is applied when withdrawing cash. Good progress was also made by operators in enhancing external signage by end December 2007.</p>

on 7 and 8 July 2008. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice) and I attended on behalf of the United Kingdom. Since it was an informal Council, no formal decisions were taken. The following issues were discussed:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="80717m0003.htm_para16"><a name="08071779000195">During the first session of the Council, member states considered what practical measures could be taken to improve the internal security of the EU and police co-operation. All welcomed the presidency idea that police co-operation should be developed around the principle of convergence, with most defining that to mean practical changes to improve cross border working by police forces, such as radio interoperation, data-sharing, work on major events and in tourist areas. Several called for more European police training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="80717m0003.htm_para17"><a name="08071779000196">The UK agreed with the practical approach recalling that, especially on the third anniversary of the London bombings, one of our top priorities remained counter terrorism. As such we welcomed the work led by the counter terrorism co-ordinator. Counter-radicalisation, projects like the Maritime Analysis and Operation Centre (MAOC(N)) on drugs, criminal asset confiscation, cybercrime, and a data-sharing and protection strategy were also all important. The presidency concluded by confirming that the lack of a new treaty did not stand in the way of the practical measures Ministers wanted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="80717m0003.htm_para18"><a name="08071779000197">The presidency introduced their paper in the Civil Protection session by stressing the need for the EU to be prepared, improve capabilities, convergence and interoperability and suggesting that some &#145;modules&#146; (specialised intervention teams based on member state assets) be put on standby. A number of member states supported the need for co-operation, but responded with caution regarding new structures and any suggestion of EU authority over national resources. Modules must remain on a voluntary basis to ensure that member states have full control over the use of their own assets. It was concluded that these should remain voluntary but the EU should look at any capability gaps and support joint training initiatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="80717m0003.htm_para19"><a name="08071779000198">Over lunch, the final report of the interior future group was presented and there was a general discussion with member states welcoming it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="80717m0003.htm_para20"><a name="08071779000199">We expect the work of both of the future groups to be officially concluded at the JHA Council at the end of July.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="80717m0003.htm_para21"><a name="08071779000200">The presidency presented the Migration Pact and said that they hoped to adopt it at the October Council. All member states supported the pact but raised points of detail, with some arguing that asylum procedures should not be changed, others wanting a single consolidated instrument on legal migration procedures, concerns regarding the creation of a common border guard; and some seeking a stronger reference to burden sharing of people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="80717m0003.htm_para22"><a name="08071779000201">The UK welcomed the pact and noted that the EU should continue to focus on practical measures that deliver results including on data-sharing, border control, and passenger name records (PNR). The EU&#146;s border agency, Frontex, (among others) should be used to strengthen the external border but the responsibility should remain with the member states. On asylum, the UK stressed that the EU should focus on implementing existing asylum legislation. The EU must provide a  <br>

haven, but also needed to work together to combat abuse. The global approach to migration needed to be further implemented although we needed to be clearer on the links between development and migration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="80717m0003.htm_para23"><a name="08071779000202">The first justice session opened with a debate introduced by the presidency about whether judges required further training in EU law and judicial co-operation. Most member states welcomed the discussion but concerns were raised about judicial independence and the way the training should be delivered. Most thought that any such training should be open to judges, prosecutors and court officials and that the key subjects should be EU law, other member states&#146; law and language training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="80717m0003.htm_para24"><a name="08071779000203">The second justice session focused on the protection of children and vulnerable adults. For the discussion on protecting children, the presidency urged member states to establish national missing child alert systems which should be interoperable. The UK supported both the principle and detail of the presidency&#146;s ideas and explained that the UK was rolling out an alert system. Information sharing on convicted sex offenders, use of CCTV and automatic number plate recognition were all also useful. The presidency concluded that the child alert system would be taken forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="80717m0003.htm_para25"><a name="08071779000204">There was a discussion about how the European Union should deal with the question of the protection of vulnerable adults in order to meet the challenges of an ageing population and the high level of mobility of European citizens. The presidency encouraged member states to ratify the Hague Convention on the International Protection of Vulnerable Adults and there was a discussion about how member states could improve the implementation of the convention. The UK signed and ratified the convention within Scotland in 2003. Work is underway to extend the convention to cover England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="80717m0003.htm_para26"><a name="08071779000205">There was a short discussion of the report of the Justice future group over lunch. Those Ministers who spoke broadly welcomed the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="80717m0004.htm_para30"><a name="08071779000261">The meeting started with a Ministers only breakfast meeting looking at ideas to make social Europe more concrete and closer to its citizens. A &#147;social Europe week&#148; and a common declaration from all member states of the EU&#146;s &#147;social offer/deal&#148; to its citizens were some of the ideas raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="80717m0004.htm_para31"><a name="08071779000262">There were three plenary sessions, each devoted to specific challenges linked to social Europe: the impacts of climate change and globalization, of changing demographic structures and the fights against poverty and discrimination. There was broad support by all delegations for the Commission&#146;s renewed social agenda and interesting discussions on poverty and active inclusion in particular. For the UK, I pledged broad support for the new proposals whilst highlighting some of the areas which would need further work. I raised the challenges posed by financial exclusion and the further possible useful work at a European level in this area. Other member states welcomed this positive statement on anti-discrimination and thought the financial exclusion point was a good example of specific problems needing concrete answers and they were willing to discuss further.</p>

public had been invited to put questions to Ministers via the French presidency website and these were answered by whichever Minister chose to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="80717m0005.htm_para1"><a name="08071779000264">I answered a question on active ageing, pointing out the economic implications, the importance of skills, the need to exchange information and best practice and the challenges of anti discrimination. I met bilaterally with Ministers from Denmark, Sweden, and Italy, and I hope that the new Italian Minister will visit the UK in the autumn and see a Jobcentre Plus office. I was also able to discuss with the French High Commissioner for Active Solidarity against Poverty, Martin Hirsch, UK views on EU social experimentation, including the trans-national pilot projects which we believe can offer significant new insights in the field of social inclusion.</p>
