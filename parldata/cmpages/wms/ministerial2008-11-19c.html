 Today I am launching our consultation on proposals to amend national minimum wage regulations that will end the practice of tips being used in payment of the national minimum wage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="81119m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08111976000025">Since the National Minimum Wage Act came into force in 1999, it has created a level playing field for employers in the payment of wages and an essential safety net for vulnerable and low-paid workers. Through this we have seen a better rewarded and more committed work force who have been a force in driving up standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="81119m0001.htm_para7"><a name="08111976000026">Under the 1999 Act, the use of tips may count towards payment of the national minimum wage in certain circumstances. Some 10 years on, I believe that the time is now right to review this position to ensure equity for all workers and create a level playing field in wages amongst employers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="81119m0001.htm_para8"><a name="08111976000027">In July 2008 we announced that we would be amending national minimum wage regulations to prevent the use of tips towards payment of the national minimum wage. Alongside this, we also set out our plans to make tipping practices fairer and more transparent, as we believe that it is important that there is clear information for consumers about what happens to their tips.</p>

 The Education, Youth and Culture Council will be held on 20-21 November in Brussels. Alun Ffred Jones, Minister for Heritage for Wales, will be representing the UK on the morning of 20 November when culture and audiovisual issues will be taken. Education issues will be taken on 21 November.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="81119m0001.htm_para11"><a name="08111976000031">The first item on the agenda is the Council conclusions on the European heritage label. The purpose of this initiative is to highlight sites and monuments that have played a key role in European history and to raise their profile as tourist attractions. UK concerns about the added value of a European heritage label have largely been addressed in discussions at official level. The draft conclusions are now broadly acceptable and the scheme is to be voluntary, which will allow the UK to decide on the extent of any future participation.

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="81119m0001.htm_para13"><a name="08111976000033">The conclusions have been considered and welcomed by the European Forum for Architecture Policies. The aims of the conclusions are in line with the UK&#146;s approach to architecture, sustainable design, and built environment education. The Government intend to support the adoption of these conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="81119m0001.htm_para14"><a name="08111976000034">The Council will then be invited to adopt conclusions on the promotion of cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue in external relations. These conclusions encourage member states to strengthen the role of culture in broader programmes; to enter into discussion with third countries about legal frameworks on cultural policies; to promote cultural diversity and the economic benefits of cultural activities; and to strengthen the role of culture in sustainable development. They also encourage the exchange of best practice on cultural issues; the mobility of artists, especially young people; the protection of copyright matters; and the protection and preservation of cultural heritage and goods. The UK believes these conclusions adequately address cultural property issues. The Government intend to support the adoption of these conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="81119m0001.htm_para15"><a name="08111976000035">There will be an exchange of views on section 4 of the draft resolution on multilingualism. This section of the resolution suggests ways in which translation issues might be better addressed, with a focus on delivering cultural goals. These include: improvements in conditions for translation of texts and publishing issues; reinforcing the role of cinema and audiovisual works in promoting language diversity; improving accessibility of performing arts to a wider audience; and improving training in translation skills. The UK supports the focus on culture in translation issues, and also the focus on young people as proposed in section 4 of the draft resolution. The UK welcomes the proposed debate on the issue. The Government will intervene on this item to express their support for multilingualism. The full text of the resolution is expected to be adopted during the education section of the Council.</p>

There will also be a launch event that day at the Royal Library of Belgium. Europeana is an online common multilingual access point to European digital cultural material including books, newspapers, photographs, films, archival documents and archaeological heritage. The conclusions have been discussed and agreed at official level. The Government intend to support their adoption and there will be no need to intervene.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="81119m0001.htm_para17"><a name="08111976000037">The presidency will also seek the adoption of the Council conclusions on the development of legal offers of online cultural and creative content and the prevention and combating of piracy in the digital environment. The Commission published a communication in January of this year which examined the current status of online creative content in Europe and how the European Union can add value to this. In July the French presidency submitted draft Council conclusions which attempted to incorporate member states&#146; and stakeholders&#146; views on the Commission&#146;s findings, and to focus the discussions on the legal offer of online content.

the Council is now expected to adopt them at this meeting. The Government intend to support the adoption of these conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="81119m0001.htm_para18"><a name="08111976000038">Broadcasting is not a specific agenda item for this meeting of the Council. I understand however that Sweden may raise an information point under any other business on the Commission&#146;s communication on state aid rules and public service broadcasting. State aid issues are within the formal competence of the Commission and the European Court, and the Government&#146;s view is that they are not a matter on which Council conclusions are appropriate. The Government however remain a firm supporter of the principle of public service broadcasting. Bearing in mind the importance of public service broadcasting across the EU we think it is right for member states and the Commission to develop a clear framework to ensure that it is properly funded in future whilst respecting the competition rules, and we look forward to taking a prominent and positive role in that debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="81119m0001.htm_para19"><a name="08111976000039">Further items under any other business are a presentation from the presidency and Commission on the progress report on the implementation of the Council recommendation on priority actions to increase co-operation in the field of archives in Europe compiled by the European archives group. The presidency will provide information on the proposed multi-annual safer internet programme. There will also be an information point from Germany on the digitisation of cinema.

 Today I am publishing the findings of the Government&#146;s review into tackling demand for prostitution. The review explored both the legislative and non-legislative options available drawing on the experiences of other countries such as Sweden and Holland. Copies have been placed in the House Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="81119m0001.htm_para20"><a name="08111976000041">The review makes several recommendations that shift the focus for reducing prostitution on to the sex buyer, the person responsible for creating the demand for prostitution markets, which in turn creates demand for the trade of women to be trafficked for sexual exploitation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="81119m0001.htm_para21"><a name="08111976000042">Specific legislative recommendations include: creating a new strict liability criminal offence of paying for sex with someone who is controlled for another person&#146;s gain; removing the need to prove that a person has acted persistently in order to be prosecuted for kerb crawling and; powers to close premises associated with sexual exploitation. Non-legislative recommendations include a marketing campaign to raise awareness amongst sex buyers about trafficking for sexual exploitation and a national anti-kerb crawling campaign, to support the police in their efforts to reduce street-based prostitution.</p>
