               <b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (Mr Edward Davey):</b>
 I have today agreed to the publication of the Insolvency Service’s Corporate Plan for the period 2011-15.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_286"> 
               <a name="110705m0001.htm_para0"> 
               <a name="11070548000020"> Over the past 18 months there has been a significant fall in the number of bankruptcies which has driven the number of new compulsory insolvency cases dealt with by the official receiver down from 78,000 cases in 2009-10 to an expected level of 45,000 to 55,000 cases in 2011-12. In response to this, the service has cut its costs principally by reducing its staff complement from 3,200 to 2,100 by May 2010.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_287"> 
               <a name="110705m0001.htm_para1"> 
               <a name="11070548000021"> While this is a significant reduction in capacity in a relatively short time, I am satisfied that the service will be able to maintain the levels of service that it achieved in 2010-11 and so I have decided that the service’s targets for timeliness, customer satisfaction and efficiency should be maintained at 2010-11 levels. The service will aim to achieve a real-terms reduction in insolvency case administration fees of 2.5% compared to last year.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_288"> 
               <a name="110705m0001.htm_para2"> 
               <a name="11070548000022"> At the same time as insolvency case numbers have fallen, the average value of assets in bankruptcy estates has also fallen, making the insolvency case administration fee more difficult to recover and putting upward pressure on the service’s bad debt position. In response to this, in 2011-12 the service, working with BIS, will review how it raises and collects the case administration fee and whether it is possible to move to a more effective and lower-risk fee regime which is fair to those affected, relying less on internal cross-subsidy and leading to lower fees overall.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_289"> 
               <a name="110705m0001.htm_para3"> 
               <a name="11070548000023"> Action will continue to be taken against bankrupts and company directors in respect of financial misconduct or dishonesty and the service will continue to investigate the affairs of companies in the public interest. Since 2009 the service has undertaken a stakeholder satisfaction survey of the level of confidence in its enforcement regime, achieving an overall confidence level of 68% and 64% in the two surveys to date. I have asked the service to explore what drives this confidence level so as to facilitate work towards a return to a 68% confidence level during 2011-12. I have also set a timeliness target in relation to the instigation of disqualification proceedings against company directors in appropriate cases.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_290">

               <a name="11070548000024"> I have set the service targets in relation to the timeliness of releasing reports to creditors in insolvency cases, and of processing claims for redundancy payments. I have also asked the service to at least maintain the overall satisfaction levels of its principal customers and users.</p>

Most responding also agreed with the Government’s preferred approach of achieving these objectives now through encouraging increased collaboration—in a locally determined manner—with some Government support. This approach will deliver efficiency and resilience benefits for fire and rescue authorities in the best way for their area, as well as build national resilience through local solutions.</p>

There was very strong support for the strategy itself, but some debate around whether to endorse the associated targets and actions proposed by the Commission, or to leave these for further discussion. There was general acceptance that the actions needed further discussion, but the Commission and several member states were keen that Council should specifically endorse the targets now, as a means to influence discussions in other fora, such as on the EU budget and CAP reform. Others, notably Denmark and Italy, argued that they should be subject to fuller examination first, to avoid the risk of signing up to something that would not be achieved. I was able to accept language that endorsed the targets, but only if the targets, as well as the actions, took fully into account international agreements. I highlighted the recently published Natural Environment White Paper, the UK National Ecosystem Assessment and the England Biodiversity Strategy. I identified the importance of delivering biodiversity objectives through a reformed CAP. Conclusions were ultimately agreed that endorsed the strategy, considered that the strategy and its targets were a key instrument to enable the EU to reach its overall 2020 target and emphasised the need for further discussion on the actions.</p>

I stressed the importance of the protection of water resources and integrated sustainable water management and the need to put in place measures to conserve and make better use of these resources. The forthcoming Commission “fitness check” provided an opportunity to thoroughly review existing EU water legislation to ensure it was effective and fit for purpose and I highlighted the importance of integration of water issues into other policies, notably agriculture.

 Thirtieth June marked the end of the regulatory payment window for payments under the 2010 single payment scheme (SPS.) At that point, the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) had paid a total of £1.75 billion to some 103,604 claimants. That leaves a total of some 594 claimants to be paid up to a maximum of £25 million. It is likely that further work will reveal that some of these cases are not eligible for payment and most of the remainder cannot be paid at present due to reasons such as probate.</p>

               <a name="11070548000104"> These figures demonstrate that RPA has succeeded in paying over 99% of eligible claimants within the payment window and met the EU benchmark of 95.238% of the total value of payments to be made, so avoiding the prospect of late payment penalties. This is particularly pleasing given the focus this year on ensuring accuracy of payments in order to begin drawing a line under the legacy of IT and data problems that have dogged the agency since the chaotic implementation of SPS in 2005. Significant progress has been made on legacy data correction activity so providing greater confidence for farmers about their subsequent scheme year payments. Nevertheless, I recognise that a significant number of farmers had to wait longer than usual for the payment, which I regret.</p>

The remaining backlog of potential error cases also needs to be reviewed and overpayments notified to claimants and recovered. This significant volume of work will be undertaken alongside processing of 2011 scheme payments.</p>

 Against a background of the need to make economies right across the public sector I announced, in a written ministerial statement on 15 September 2010, <i>Official Report</i>, column 46WS that the Government were proposing to make changes to the provision of interpretation and translation services across the justice sector to cut the cost and make more efficient provision while safeguarding quality.</p>

That process resulted in a proposed framework agreement with a single supplier, under which justice sector organisations could contract for language services as needed. Having sought and taken account of the views of interested parties the Government have decided that a framework agreement is the best way to meet their objectives.</p>

Other justice sector organisations, including police forces, have indicated that they intend to sign contracts under the framework agreement as soon as they can.

               <a name="11070548000111"> The framework agreement will deliver significant administrative and financial savings over the current approach. It will do this by introducing market forces into language services provision and providing a single point of contact available to staff at any time of day for the provision of all language services, including interpretation, translation and language services for the deaf and deaf-blind.</p>

Thirteen proposals are considered to have potential when scored against the fund criteria, but in my view require further work. Their promoters will be invited to improve their offer and resubmit to the Department in February 2012, or to improve their offer in the context of their large project proposal, where this proposal is shortlisted. The full list of decisions is attached.</p>

Detailed business cases will be submitted to the Department by December 2011.
