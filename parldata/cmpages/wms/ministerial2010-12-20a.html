 The coalition Government are publishing today the allocation of science and research funding for 2011-12 to 2014-15.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para0"><a name="1012204000035">Our world class science and research base is inherently valuable, as well as critical to promoting economic growth. Despite enormous pressure on public spending, the £4.6 billion per annum funding for science and research programmes has been protected in cash terms and ring fenced against future pressures during the spending review period. For the first time HE research funding in England has been included within this ring fence, providing overall stability and certainty to the research base.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para1"><a name="1012204000036">Allocations for resource are set out in table 1, below, and allocations for capital are in table 2.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para2"><a name="1012204000037">This Government are committed to efficiency, prioritisation and reform. We shall delay capital investment to maximise investment in research projects and in people undertaking research. The Government intend to announce during 2011 the allocation of funding to a small number of further projects on the 2010 large facilities roadmap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para3"><a name="1012204000038">Savings from improved efficiency will be recycled directly within the ring fence. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) will reform its quality-related (QR) funding for research with a greater focus on research excellence and reform higher education innovation funding with a greater focus on business interaction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para4"><a name="1012204000039">Collaboration is one of the key themes of these allocations. There will be significant collaboration among research councils, and among universities, tackling issues of national importance, often working with the TSB.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para5"><a name="1012204000040">There will also be greater coherence among HEFCE and the research councils. For example HEFCE and the research councils will work together so that support and incentives to bring universities and business closer together are delivered coherently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para6"><a name="1012204000041">These allocations provide funding for the arts, humanities and social sciences as well as STEM to pursue vital research. Outstanding researchers in all fields will be funded to pursue curiosity driven work and to define their own areas of scholarship. We are also putting the new UK Space Agency on a firm footing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para7"><a name="1012204000042">The allocation will allow research councils, HEFCE and the national academies to maintain the flow of talented new researchers and maintain national capability. It will enable them to provide researchers with access to key large scale research infrastructure, both here and abroad. Funding bodies will concentrate on research centres of proven excellence, with the critical mass to address national challenges and compete internationally and the expertise to collaboration with business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para8"><a name="1012204000043">A copy of the allocation document has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para9"><a name="1012204000044">The grant letter sent by the Secretary of State to HEFCE today also includes details relevant to science and research funding. A copy of that letter has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

 The Haldane principle means that decisions on individual research proposals are best taken by researchers themselves through peer review. This involves evaluating the quality, excellence and likely impact of science and research programmes. Prioritisation of an individual research council's spending within its allocation is not a decision for Ministers. The coalition Government support this principle as vital for the protection of academic independence and excellence. We all benefit from its application in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para11"><a name="1012204000383">Over the years there has been some uncertainty over the interpretation of the Haldane principle.

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para12"><a name="1012204000384">This statement on the Haldane principle applies to science and research which the Government funds through the research councils and national academies. HEFCE has statutory independence<sup>(1)</sup>. The Haldane principle does not apply to the research budgets of Government Departments, which are used to fund research to support their departmental policies and objectives. That said, Departments work closely with the research councils to ensure that the research they fund is aligned with that funded by the science and research base and delivers maximum value to the taxpayer. More generally, research councils need to ensure that the views of those with an interest in the potential outcomes of the research are sought when setting their overall priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para13"><a name="1012204000385">The Government do, however, need to take a view on the overall level of funding to science and research and have decided to protect and to ring fence the science and research budget for the next four years. This decision is evidence that the Government recognise the strategic importance of science and research to our future growth, prosperity, culture and heritage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para14"><a name="1012204000386">There are areas where Ministers should have no input: Ministers should not decide which individual projects should be funded nor which researchers should receive the money.

The research base has an important role to play in addressing such priorities and the research councils, with the support of independent advice, have proposed research programmes to tackle them. It is also appropriate for Ministers to ask research councils to consider how best they can contribute to these priorities, without crowding out other areas of their missions. But it is for the research councils to decide on the specific projects and people to fund within these priorities, free from Ministerial interference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para17"><a name="1012204000389">Similarly, Ministers have a legitimate role in decisions that involve long-term and large scale commitments of national significance. These include the construction of large research facilities, where Ministers have to approve business cases, and involvement in international research treaties. Public funding from the research councils for both these categories of research spending must be dedicated to supporting excellent research, irrespective of its geographical location. In many cases the location will be an obvious decision, given clusters of relevant research capability.

This role is currently fulfilled through legislation, and through the suite of planning policy guidance notes (PPGs) and minerals policy guidance notes (MPGs), and more recently planning policy statements (PPSs) and minerals policy statements (MPSs).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para60"><a name="1012204000436">These documents, which run to over 1,000 pages, set out central Government policy on various aspects of development and land use to local planning authorities, who must legally have regard to them when drawing up their local development frameworks. They are also often relevant to making decisions on planning applications. They cover broad policy themes such as planning aspects of climate change, housing, renewable energy, flood risk, green belt and waste, and also procedural themes such as how to compile local development plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para61"><a name="1012204000437">The Government believe that the current suite of planning policy statements and guidance notes is too centralist in its approach, and too long and cumbersome for councils and developers to use effectively. There is no over-arching integrated statement of the Government's priorities for the country and the role which planning can play in delivering them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para62"><a name="1012204000438">Therefore the Government will produce a simple national planning policy framework setting out their priorities for the planning system in England in a single, concise document covering all major forms of development proposals handled by local authorities. All the national planning policies set out in PPSs, MPSs, PPGs and MPGs, will be integrated into a single document.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para63"><a name="1012204000439">The national planning policy framework will set out the Government's views on how the planning system in England can contribute to the delivery of a prosperous, competitive and attractive country based on the values of freedom, fairness and responsibility. The framework will set broad economic, environmental and social priorities and how they relate to each other, but will ensure that the majority of planning decisions are made at the local level, with the minimum of interference from Whitehall. The framework will also set out a strong basis for economic growth, a presumption in favour of sustainable  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para64"><a name="1012204000440">The Government will apply the following principles when considering what the framework should contain. The framework will be:</p>
<a name="1012204000540"><ul><p class="tabletext">localist in its approach, handing power back to local communities to decide what is right for them;</p>
</ul><a name="1012204000541"><ul><p class="tabletext">used as a mechanism for delivering Government objectives only where it is relevant, proportionate and effective to do so; and</p>
</ul><a name="1012204000542"><ul><p class="tabletext">user-friendly and accessible, providing clear policies on making robust local and neighbourhood plans and development management decisions.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para65"><a name="1012204000441">In the past, Governments have issued vast swathes of non-statutory guidance in addition to policy. However, such guidance can unintentionally take on a force which constrains rather than helps practitioners and users on the ground. This Government, therefore, believe that we should keep central Government guidance to a minimum. Accordingly, the Government will radically reduce the amount of guidance they issue and will work to withdraw or shorten existing guidance wherever they can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para66"><a name="1012204000442">The Government will publish and consult on a draft of the new national planning policy framework in 2011.

Further detail on our approach to major infrastructure is set out in the work plan on major infrastructure planning reform which I am also publishing today. Copies of the work plan have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and are available on the Department's website:</p>

To begin the process of writing the framework, therefore, and in advance of formal consultation on a draft, I invite organisations and individuals to offer their suggestions to the Department on what priorities and policies we might adopt to produce a shorter, more decentralised and less bureaucratic national planning policy framework. Details of how to do so have been placed on the Department for Communities and Local Government website. I would be pleased to receive proposals by 28 February 2011. The Department will also organise a number of roundtable discussions with key organisations to promote debate on the framework.</p>

In July, we asked the Zero-Carbon Hub to advise on the national benchmark standard for on-site measures. I have now received the Hub's initial findings; I am grateful for the work of the Hub with developers, green groups and other partners on this study. This is an important piece of work which will help us shape final decisions on the regulatory thresholds. We will also need to take account of decisions on the renewable heat incentive and the Climate Change Committee's recent advice on grid decarbonisation. We will announce our conclusions next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para70"><a name="1012204000448">Localities can already plan for zero-carbon development today, using powers in the Planning and Energy Act 2008, where it is reasonable to do so and is consistent with national planning policy, including relevant requirements on feasibility and viability, and relevant regulation. Many local authorities are already demonstrating their desire to drive performance in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para71"><a name="1012204000449">Many interested parties have argued for a community energy fund, enabling zero-carbon to be met partly through contributions to a fund used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, allowing developers to meet their carbon obligations cost-effectively. In this respect, the recently confirmed community infrastructure levy provides a mechanism for local authorities to achieve reductions in carbon dioxide emissions locally, through investment in local renewable energy infrastructure that supports development in their area. It will be important that any approach operates in a way that demonstrates transparently that real carbon savings are achieved. We will now work with local authorities and industry on how best to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para72"><a name="1012204000450">It will be important that people are able to take the best decision for their area. We recently launched community energy online to support local authorities and others who want to introduce local energy schemes. We will also work to incorporate material on local energy planning into a local standards framework, providing accessible, robust options to underpin local choice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para73"><a name="1012204000451">New homes are an important part of new development, but not the whole picture.</p>

The Government's policy is progressively to raise the national regulatory requirements for non-domestic buildings between now and 2019, enabling them to be zero carbon from 2019. We will maintain consistency between the domestic and non-domestic frameworks as far as it is practical, but will consider taking a different approach on some elements, where the diversity of the non-domestic stock or the nature of the commercial market justifies that. We are today publishing on the Department's website the findings of the consultation exercise on policy options for zero-carbon new non-domestic buildings that was concluded earlier this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para75"><a name="1012204000453">We are currently undertaking detailed technical work to underpin the development of future national regulatory standards.

 In the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement in April 1998, the UK Government undertook to explore the scope for achieving more widespread availability of the Irish language television station, Teilifis na Gaeilige (TG4) in Northern Ireland. The UK Government fulfilled this commitment by the construction of a new transmitter at Divis. This, combined with the analogue overspill signal from transmitters in Ireland, means that TG4 is currently available, on a free-to-air basis to approximately 60% of the population in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para77"><a name="1012204000456">Once the analogue signals in Northern Ireland and Ireland are switched off by the end of 2012, arrangements need to be put in place to enable TG4 to be received in  a digital form. In this context, a memorandum of understanding was signed by the Irish and UK Governments in February 2010, committing them to working together on the technical arrangements for post-switchover provision of TG4.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para78"><a name="1012204000457">The two Governments are pleased with the amount of progress made since the signing of the MOU in ensuring and expanding the provision of Irish television services, including Irish language services, in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para79"><a name="1012204000458">Following a broad range of technical work, the two Governments have now agreed that the most effective way to provide for the continuing provision of TG4 is by building a new, low power TV multiplex in Northern Ireland. In addition to carrying TG4, this multiplex, which will be part of the UK DTT system, will also carry RTÉ 1 and RTÉ 2.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para80"><a name="1012204000459">It is hoped that this will further increase the coverage of these channels in Northern Ireland, enabling approximately 90% of the population in Northern Ireland to receive their services on a free-to-air basis, either through overspill as before or via the new multiplex.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para81"><a name="1012204000460">The existing analogue signals will be switched off on a co-ordinated basis in Ireland and Northern Ireland at the end of 2012 and much more work needs to be done between then and now. Digital UK, the not-for-profit organisation that is leading the digital switchover in the UK, will be ensuring that viewers in Northern Ireland have all the necessary information to help them make the switch to digital and know what sort of equipment to buy if they want to receive these services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para82"><a name="1012204000461">Other arrangements that need to be put in place include the establishment of a joint venture between RTÉ and TG4 to run the multiplex which will be licensed under the UK's Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 by Ofcom at the request of the UK Government. This will be a not-for-profit company. In addition, the licensee will have to put out to competitive tender all the elements  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para95"><a name="1012204000479">The Court ruled that barring convicted prisoners in detention pursued a legitimate aim, but that a blanket ban was not proportionate.

a choice: it is a legal obligation. So the Government are announcing today that we will act to implement the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights. In deciding how to proceed, we have been guided by three principles. First, that we should implement the Hirst judgment in a way that meets our legal obligations, but does not go further than that. Secondly, that the most serious offenders will not be given the right to vote. Thirdly, that we should seek to prevent the taxpayer having to face future claims for compensation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para99"><a name="1012204000483">The Government will therefore bring forward legislation providing that the blanket ban in the existing law will be replaced. Offenders sentenced to a custodial sentence of four years or more will lose the right to vote in all circumstances, which reflects the Government's clear view that more serious offenders should not retain the right to vote. Offenders sentenced to a custodial sentence of less than four years will retain the right to vote, but legislation will provide that the sentencing judge will be able to remove that right if they consider that appropriate. Four years has in the past been regarded as the distinction between short and long-term prisoners, and the Government consider that permitting prisoners sentenced to less than four years' imprisonment to vote is sufficient to comply with the judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para100"><a name="1012204000484">The right to vote will be restricted to UK Westminster Parliamentary and European Parliament elections only, and not in other elections or referendums. That is the minimum currently required by the law (a case considering whether article 3, protocol 1 applies to elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly is currently before the European Court of Human Rights: the Government's position is that they do not). Prisoners will vote by post or proxy, and will be entitled to register to vote not at the prison, but at their former address or the area where they have a local connection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para101"><a name="1012204000485">We believe that these proposals can meet the objectives that we have set out of implementing the judgment in a way that is proportionate; ensuring the most serious offenders will not be given the right to vote; and seeking to prevent future claims for compensation. We will bring forward legislation next year for Parliament to debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para102"><a name="1012204000486">While the franchise is reserved to Westminster, the implementation of this policy will clearly have implications for Scotland and Northern Ireland, where the administration of justice is devolved. The Government will work closely with colleagues in the Scottish and Northern Ireland Administrations before legislation is introduced on the practical implications of the approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para103"><a name="1012204000487">Governments have an absolute duty to uphold the rule of law. And at this of all times we must avoid risking taxpayers' money in ways that the public would rightly condemn. In the light of this, and of the legacy left by the last Government, the only responsible course is to implement the judgment, and to do so in a way which ensures the most serious offenders continue to lose the right to vote.</p>

rely on deliveries of heating oil to heat their homes. Heating oil is also used by smaller commercial customers, notably, with demand focused in the agricultural sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para104"><a name="1012204000489">Overall, UK heating oil demand is around 3.7 million tonnes per year with domestic demand accounting for some 60%. Demand is seasonal with around two thirds of heating oil consumed between October and March.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para105"><a name="1012204000490">The recent severe weather has significantly disrupted the distribution of heating oil to customers across the UK, particularly, but not only, in Scotland. The severe weather-notably-low temperatures and heavy snow, has caused considerable disruption to road networks which has affected suppliers' ability to make deliveries particularly to more remote areas away from the strategic road network. This has resulted in delivery backlogs which suppliers have been working hard, in difficult circumstances, to reduce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para106"><a name="1012204000491">There are around 200 fuel distributors in the UK who work hard throughout the year to supply their customers. Many of these companies are small businesses, some with perhaps only two or three delivery vehicles. A tanker will make an average of 16 domestic deliveries per day covering some 180 miles to make these deliveries. The bulk of the time in making a delivery is taken up by the travel between the vehicle's base and the customer and between customers. Some larger suppliers hold their own stocks at smaller depots but others pick up from fuel terminals "off rack" purchasing product on the spot market. Modern road tankers deliver fuel to the customer's storage tank via a dedicated fuel delivery system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para107"><a name="1012204000492">Tackling this backlog is challenging for the industry at a time when, due to the cold weather, they have been facing significantly higher demand than is usual at this time of year. This challenge has been exacerbated by delays to deliveries due to the state of road network in parts of the UK, and customers bringing forward deliveries that would usually have been made in the new year. However, prompt action to relax regulations on drivers' hours has enabled drivers to work for longer each day, making more deliveries and helping to manage the backlog.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para108"><a name="1012204000493">Distributors are doing all they can to prioritise deliveries to vulnerable customers and those running short on fuel. Working with DEGG, the Federation of Petroleum Suppliers has issued a voluntary code of practice to its members to help them prioritise orders to those most in need. We are also putting in place arrangements with distributors through the relevant trade associations, the Federation of Petroleum Suppliers and UK Liquid Petroleum Gas, for distributors to alert local authorities when they are aware of a risk that potentially vulnerable households will run short of heating oil. Similarly we have asked local authorities, and other local responders to be aware of these risks and, taking account of local circumstances, to consider what assistance they can provide to potentially vulnerable households who may need support over the Christmas and new year period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para109"><a name="1012204000494">Hospitals do not tend to use heating oil, although a reducing number of NHS organisations are reliant on gas oil for stand-by use, fuel for generators, for boiler maintenance or dual fuel needs. Hospitals normally operate with higher levels of fuel reserves at this time of year, and, at present, we understand that there are no reported problems owing to a lack of gas oil deliveries to NHS trusts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para110"><a name="1012204000495">The severe weather has also led to a very high forecast of demand for gas today. Last night this led National Grid to issue a day-ahead Gas Balancing Alert for Monday 20 December at 6.28 pm. The GBA trigger level for today (20 December) is set at 452.40 million cubic metres. National Grid currently expect demand for the day will be 461.57 million cubic metres (though it should be noted this figure is constantly updated). This figure is 97 million cubic metres above the normal seasonal demand (more than 26%). The expected demand being higher than the trigger level obliged National Grid to issue the GBA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para111"><a name="1012204000496">The Gas Balancing Alert (GBA) is a tool that National Grid uses to make sure there is enough gas in the system. The GBA has the effect of signalling:</p>
<a name="1012204000547"><ul><p class="tabletext">to shippers to increase supplies on to the network, for example, by increasing flows through imports and releasing gas from storage; and,</p>
</ul><a name="1012204000548"><ul><p class="tabletext">to large users, including power stations, that they should reduce demand for gas (for example, in the case of power portfolio generators, to switch to alternative sources such as coal.)</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para112"><a name="1012204000497">As such GBAs are simply a part of the portfolio of mechanisms which help the market to operate effectively. When each of the GBAs were issued last winter the market responded well, closing any potential gap between supply and demand by bringing on additional supplies and reducing demand from large users. There is currently no expectation of any disruption to domestic customers or commercial customers unless they have interruptible contracts in place. That said, we are never complacent about security of supply and National Grid continues to keep us informed as the situation develops and we are making changes through the Energy Bill to improve further the security of gas supply, by conferring powers on Ofgem to sharpen commercial incentives for the effective management of low-probability, high-impact events.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para113"><a name="1012204000498">The issuance of a Gas Balancing Alert by National Grid today is also a reminder of the significant efforts being made by system and network operators, shippers, suppliers, storage operators and other participants in the gas market to deliver sufficient gas to meet the heightened demand brought on by the current severe weather.</p>

As these mandates are currently restricted so as to preserve the EU negotiating position they are not therefore depositable within Parliament.</p>

I will also in due course update Parliament on the Government's opt-in decisions at these later stages.</p>

working group established to conduct the review and we agreed a set of high-level findings and next steps. This group included members of the motorcycle industry, trainers, riders' representatives, road safety and local authority bodies as well as DSA and DFT officials. I will be placing the report on the Department's website www.dft.gov.uk and in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para143"><a name="1012204000534">While there is more work to be done on the detail, the review has helpfully identified a set of changes to the test which have the potential to deliver my objectives for a new motorcycle test. My goal is to see the practical test delivered as a single on-road event in a way which will maintain riding standards, protect safety and increase accessibility of the test to all candidates. The work delivered by the group includes a new hazard avoidance manoeuvre which-subject to further trialling-can be carried out on the road, as well as ways to perform the other specified manoeuvres on the road. The working group has also suggested that the slow manoeuvres (manual handling, slalom, figure-of-eight, U-turn and slow ride) might better be examined at training centres, ahead of the main test, by delegated examiners employed by the training industry. It could be followed by a single event on road test conducted by DSA, including the remaining manoeuvres and the other elements of the road-based test. This approach needs further development with the training industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="101220m0001.htm_para144"><a name="1012204000535">The next step for the review will be to hold wider trials, with test-level candidates, to verify the standards, suitability and safety of the new manoeuvres, including a number of on-road sites, to establish the criteria for safe on-road testing. This will be followed by public consultation on the proposed changes. We will aim to implement a new test by the end of 2011 or early 2012, including on-road testing initially in priority areas which are poorly served by the current network of off-road test centres. Any changes to the manoeuvres would be implemented for all tests at all locations. Subject to further work on safety, cost and value for money, there would be a phased introduction of on-road testing moving to general adoption as soon as possible. Changes to the test will need to be monitored and kept under review to ensure that the review objectives are delivered in practice.</p>
