<a name="subhd_1"><a name="90401m0001.htm_sbhd0"><a name="09040165000010"><h4 align="center">Finance Bill Measures</h4>

<p><a name="st_98"><a name="09040165000022"><a name="90401m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="09040165000159"><b>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</b>
 I can today announce the implementation of a measure following consultation and two measures to protect revenues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="90401m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09040165000023"><i>Modernising tax relief for business expenditure on cars</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="90401m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09040165000024">Following consultation, the Government published draft legislation on 8 December 2008 setting out proposals for new rules for tax relief for business expenditure on cars. With effect from April, the rate of relief will be determined by the car&#146;s CO2 emissions, rather than its cost. Associated rules governing the proportion of lease rental payments that may be deducted for tax, where businesses hire or lease their cars rather than buying them, are being similarly amended. I can confirm that this measure will be going ahead with effect from today for businesses in the charge to corporation tax and from 6 April for businesses within the charge to income tax. However, following comments received on the published draft legislation a number of changes to it are proposed. These, together with anti-avoidance provisions, are set out in revised legislation published on the HMRC website today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="90401m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09040165000025"><i>Avoidance using life insurance policies</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="90401m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09040165000026">Schemes designed to avoid income tax have been identified by HMRC. The schemes purport to create income tax loss relief from offshore life insurance policies that can be set against other taxable income. The Government do not accept that the schemes have the effect sought or that there are any circumstances in which income tax loss relief can arise on life policies. However, to put the position beyond any doubt, legislation will be introduced in the forthcoming Finance Bill that will prevent income tax loss relief from being available from transactions on offshore life policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="90401m0001.htm_para4"><a name="09040165000027">This change, effective from 6 April 2009, will ensure that claims cannot be made for income tax loss relief from offshore life insurance policies relating to the years 2009-10 onwards. Furthermore, it will ensure that tax deductions will not be allowed for the years 2009-10 onwards even if the loss related to a previous year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"><a name="90401m0001.htm_para5"><a name="09040165000028">The change will also have effect from today to all new offshore life insurance policies. It will also apply to existing offshore policies which on or after today are wholly or partly assigned to the person claiming a deduction, become used as security for a debt, or are varied so as to increase the benefits secured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="90401m0001.htm_para6"><a name="09040165000029">A copy of the draft legislation together with a draft explanatory statement will be published shortly on HMRC&#146;s website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="90401m0001.htm_para7"><a name="09040165000030"><i>Avoidance using artificially created employment losses</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="90401m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09040165000031">The Government have become aware of a further artificial and aggressive avoidance scheme that seeks to abuse tax reliefs available for employment-related losses incurred by employees and former employees.</p>

<notus-date day="1" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>1 Apr 2009 : Column 64WS</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_364"><a name="90401m0001.htm_para9"><a name="09040165000032">This scheme relies on deliberate default during the course of a contrived employment. During the course of the employment, the employer will deliberately default in relation to one or more aspects of certain financial arrangements undertaken by the employer. Under the terms of the employment, this will trigger compensation payable by the employer. The employee will be contractually obliged to suffer all or part of the compensation payable by the employer in respect of the default and will then claim relief for this as a loss against other income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"><a name="90401m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09040165000033">These arrangements are similar to the highly abusive avoidance scheme that the Government acted against with effect from 12 January 2009. The Government do not accept that any of these highly contrived arrangements have the effect that is sought, but will remove any doubt by introducing appropriate legislation in the Finance Bill 2009 to prevent loss relief being allowed where liabilities relating to an employment are incurred by employees and former employees with a main purpose of the avoidance of tax. This legislation will have effect from 12 January 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"><a name="90401m0001.htm_para11"><a name="09040165000034">The legislation will not affect genuine cases where tax avoidance arrangements are not involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="90401m0001.htm_para12"><a name="09040165000035">Details are contained in a technical note; the note, the draft legislation relating to this announcement and the draft legislation relating to the earlier statement of 13 January 2009 are published on HMRC&#146;s website.</p>

 In 2003 the Government commissioned, via the Medical Research Council, a large-scale and independent epidemiological study of the more than 19,000 UK service personnel who had taken part in human experiments at the Porton Down research establishment between 1939 and 1989. The study was completed in 2007, and the main findings on mortality and cancer incidence were published on 25 March by the British Medical Journal.</p>

General mortality was slightly higher among the Porton Down veterans than the controls, but was lower in both groups than in the population at large.

 The UK Border Agency, which was established as a shadow executive agency in April 2008, will today begin to operate as a full executive agency of the Home Office. I am also publishing the UK Border Agency&#146;s Framework Agreement, which describes how the agency will be governed, and its business plan, which sets out the agency&#146;s objectives for the next three years.

<p><a name="stpa_407"><a name="90401m0002.htm_para12"><a name="09040165000083">The move to full executive agency status is an important milestone in the development of the agency. It establishes a clear accountability framework within which the chief executive will have greater operational freedom to focus on delivering the agency&#146;s services. At the same time, the framework agreement ensures that the agency will continue to work closely with the wider Home Office and its key delivery partners, including HM Revenue and Customs, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the police. Later this year we hope, subject to the passage of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Bill, to complete the formal transfer of customs functions and staff from HM Revenue and Customs to the agency.</p>

 In 1997 there was no capital budget for Further Education Colleges and the National Audit Office described FE college buildings as &#147;ageing and their quality and fitness for purpose was often unsatisfactory, affecting the reputation of the sector&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_413"><a name="90401m0002.htm_para18"><a name="09040165000091">Between then and 2006-07, more than &#163;2 billion has been invested in modernising FE facilities. My Department will spend another &#163;2.3 billion in the current spending review period. We have been able to bring forward over &#163;110 million of future investment in 2008-09 as part of the Government&#146;s response to boost the economy. Last summer the NAO reported the capital programme was making good progress with the renewal and modernisation of the FE estate with the great majority of projects coming in on budget and delivering improvements for learners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_414"><a name="90401m0002.htm_para19"><a name="09040165000092">In December, the Learning and Skills Council, which runs the programme, decided to defer further approvals of schemes while assessing the programme overall. The LSC&#146;s assessment, which I reported to the House on 4 March 2009, <i>Official Report</i>, column 56WS, was that there were many more schemes in preparation than can be funded in this spending round. Before this assessment had been completed, I had agreed with the LSC in January to appoint Sir Andrew Foster to conduct an independent review of the LSC&#146;s handling of its capital programme and to make recommendations for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_415"><a name="90401m0002.htm_para20"><a name="09040165000093">Sir Andrew&#146;s report is published today and copies have been placed in the Library of the House. I am also writing to all Members enclosing a copy of the report.</p>

My Department and the LSC will accept all of his recommendations. I also wish to record my thanks for the speed and efficiency with which he has conducted his review. His key finding is that &#147;a good policy has been compromised by the manner of its implementation&#148;. He goes on to explain that &#147;the policy intent to transform the FE estate is clear and positive. But the implementation approach did not include a robust financial strategy or a regional or national approach to prioritisation&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_418"><a name="90401m0002.htm_para23"><a name="09040165000096">He has immediately appointed an external team from the firm Grant Thornton to review the financial data held by the LSC about capital projects to ensure, as Sir Andrew recommends, that &#147;the process is grounded in fully accurate and detailed information about capital schemes in the pipeline&#148;.</p>

The LSC is now consulting the sector on the approach which should be used in prioritising schemes. Sir Andrew also recommends that it will be essential to have early and open engagement with the sector in finding ways forward on the most pressing matters. The LSC has therefore established a reference panel of college principals convened by the Association of Colleges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_421"><a name="90401m0002.htm_para26"><a name="09040165000099">Mr Russell is also appointing an external team of property specialists to assist the LSC as it begins shortly to meet with each college to ensure that the information held by the LSC is accurate and comprehensive and a sound basis for taking future decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_422"><a name="90401m0002.htm_para27"><a name="09040165000100">While that work is going on, we have already made clear to all college principals that we will not allow any college to get into a situation where it cannot meet its financial obligations as a result of decisions taken by the LSC on the capital programme. The LSC monitors financial risk in colleges and there are well-established procedures for dealing with any college judged to be at risk. Any college that is concerned should speak to its local LSC who will work with the college to agree an appropriate financial plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_423"><a name="90401m0002.htm_para28"><a name="09040165000101">Finally, Sir Andrew&#146;s report also concludes that the scrutiny of the LSC capital programme by my Department was insufficiently rigorous. Many of my Department&#146;s objectives are achieved via arm&#146;s length bodies. It is vitally important that my Department is able to exercise proper scrutiny of their work. I have asked the permanent secretary to carry out a review of DIUS relationships with our non-departmental public bodies to ensure that there is clarity about accountability and responsibility.</p>
