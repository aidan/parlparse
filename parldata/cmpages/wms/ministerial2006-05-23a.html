Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs (Ms Harriet
Harman):</b> My noble Friend the Under-Secretary of State for
Constitutional Affairs, has made the following written ministerial
statement:</p><a name="06052384000033"><ul><p class="tabletext">"My
right honourable and noble Friend, the Lord Chancellor has approved
proposals for the Official Solicitor and Public Trustee (OSPT) to
retire from the bulk of his existing caseload of trusts and estates
work over the next two years. This follows a recommendation in April
2004 in an NAO review of the Public Trustee's stewardship of client
funds that he should establish a pro-active strategy for divesting
himself of trusts and estates work, particularly in terms of becoming a
trustee of last resort and outsourcing his investment
activities.</p></ul><a name="06052384000034"><ul><p class="tabletext">Where
cases cannot otherwise be closed during that period, the OSPT proposes
to invite expressions of interest from a private sector corporate
trustee to take over and administer his cases in accordance with best
market regulated practice. The OSPT will work to ensure that the
interests of beneficiaries will 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 72WS</b><br>be secured through this process. The proposals will be designed to
deliver the administration of their trusts in the future in accordance
with best practice standards. There will be full consultation with
those affected, who will be able to put forward any alternative
solution more appropriate in their particular case than that which the
OSPT proposes. If agreement is reached with a private sector corporate
trustee, or on an alternative solution in a particular case, the OSPT
will retire from these cases in favour of the new
trustee.</p></ul><a name="06052384000035"><ul><p class="tabletext">As
announced in April 2000 in "Making Changes: The Future of the Public
Trust Office", since the Official Solicitor was also appointed Public
Trustee in 2001 he has only accepted any new trust and estates case
where he has been satisfied that, in accordance with strict "last
resort" acceptance criteria, a public sector trustee is required. In
2005-06, for example, only 13 cases were accepted by him as Official
Solicitor, and one as Public Trustee. He is, however, currently
responsible for administering about 1,750 trusts and estates, mainly
taken on before the last resort criteria were
applied."</p></ul><h4 align="center"><a name="06052384000014">Her

<p><a name="06052384000157">I
would like first, however, to set the handling of the consideration and
deportation of foreign national prisoners into context. The context is
the backdrop of mass migration prompted by the end of the Cold War and
other global changes. The effects of this can be seen in the huge
increases in the past decade in asylum-seeking, in immigration, and
generally in the numbers of passenger journeys all over the
world.</p><p><a name="06052384000159">Against
this backdrop, our immigration and asylum systems have secured notable
achievements in recent years: the number of asylum seekers has been
reduced by 72 per cent from its peak in 2002; we now decide73
per cent of asylum cases within 8 weeks compared to the 22 months it
took to decide asylum cases (including older cases) in 1997; and I can
say that February and March were the first months in which we have
achieved the target known as the 'tipping point', with removals running
at the highest rate
ever.</p><p><a name="06052384000160">It
is in this context that the issue of foreign national prisoners should
be
considered.</p><p><a name="06052384000162">My
first priority has been to protect the public by identifying,
controlling, considering for deportation and, where appropriate,
deporting the foreign national prisoners who were released without due
consideration of deportation having been made. I am today reporting on
progress since my written statement to the House on 15 May, <i>Official
Report</i>, column
40WS.</p><p><a name="06052384000164">Analysis
of these cases has, as I indicated in an oral answer in the House on 15
May, revealed some duplicate files and the total overall number of
these cases currently stands at 1,019, although it is possible that
this figure may either reduce further due to the discovery of
additional duplicates as the process of analysis is completed; or rise
as the Immigration and Nationality Directorate re-checks that it has
captured every relevant
case.</p><p><a name="06052384000166">In
sharing information on these cases with the House, I would like to add
the caveat that the investigative process has uncovered flaws in data
collection, not least the lack of a unique personal number for use by
the Home Office, prisons and the police to identify an individual. An
additional factor rendering the information subject to change is the
continuing examination of the records by all relevant agencies,
including for re-offending. I can therefore only give the best
information available to me as of today on the 1,019 foreign
prisoners.</p><p><a name="06052384000167">Subject
to these caveats, the figure for the number of offenders convicted of a
serious offence, as defined in my statement of 15 May, now stands at
186. As Isaid at that time, the previous figure of 179 was
liable to change since the scrutiny of around 200 of the1,019
cases was yet to be completed. That has so far resulted in an
additional seven cases being identified in this
category.</p><p><a name="06052384000169">Of
these 186, 37 have been convicted of the most serious offences, defined
as murder, manslaughter, rape and child sex offences. This is an
increase of two since 15 May as a result of the scrutiny of past
offences. All four of the murderers are now detained in prison. Of the
other 33 most serious cases which include rapists and child sex
offenders, two are believed dead and 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 79WS</b><br>23 are in prison. We have so far identified that eight of these 37 have
re-offended since release (of which six have been convicted) but no
offence discovered so far has involved violence or a sexual
element.</p><p><a name="06052384000171">Of
the 149 "more serious" offenders, 66 are now under our control and six
have been deported. Of these 149, 13 have re-offended following release
(of which11 have been convicted) with a crime involving
violence or a sexual
element.</p><p><a name="06052384000173">All
of the 1,019 have now been assessed and consideration of the case for
deportation has started in 999 cases. There has been an initial
decision to deport in 778 of these cases. Of these 778,197 are
detained, one is electronically tagged, 10 are reporting regularly to
the Immigration Service or Prison Service and37 have been
deported or
removed.</p><p><a name="06052384000175">As
police and agencies focus hard on these cases, I believe it is
essential to be clear about our long-term policy. My objectives are
straightforward: all non-EEA nationals who are given a custodial
sentence should face deportation; and deportation should happen as
early as possible in that sentence. But to achieve these long-term
objectives, I believe management must address eight priority
areas.</p><p><a name="06052384000176">Firstly,
there is today no unique personal number for individuals who come into
contact with the criminal justice, immigration and asylum systems. I
have instructed management to tell me how this can
change.</p><p><a name="06052384000178">Secondly,
as my predecessor has already set out, there are prisoners within the
system whose nationality is not known. There is currently no legal
obligation on people who are suspected, charged or convicted to declare
their nationality and no sanction against them if they refuse to
co-operate or they declare a nationality falsely I have tasked
management to come up with a way of stopping this, even if it needs
legislation.</p><p><a name="06052384000180">Thirdly,
there have almost certainly been foreign nationals whose nationality
was known but who were not referred to Immigration and Nationality
Directorate for consideration for deportation. For example, before
September 2004, guidance to prisons on which cases to refer to
Immigration and Nationality Directorate covered only those cases which
were subject to a court recommendation and omitted to cover other
categories of case which should have been considered by the Immigration
and Nationality Directorate. In addition, a HO Circular to police of
December 2004 sets broad criteria by which the police should refer
cases to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. It is not clear
enough that this Circular has been systematically implemented. I have
demanded therefore that management ensure all future instructions are
given to all agencies of the criminal justice, asylum and immigration
systems and are both consistent and fully
implemented.</p><p><a name="06052384000182">Fourthly,
the criteria governing which individuals should be considered for
deportation appear to have been varied over time on authority which is
unclear. They have then not been consistently applied. For example, the
derivation of the inclusion of those convicted of three or more
offences over a five-year period in the criteria, as set out by my
predecessor on3 May, is unclear. I have ordered the policy
officials to audit trail all policy criteria and the process by which
they ensure that guidance is both clear and consistently
applied.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 80WS</b><br><p><a name="06052384000184">Fifthly, there
are foreign national prisoners who were considered for deportation
under the current criteria, but where the decision was made not to
deport, or where a decision to deport was frustrated by difficulties
over return to the home country. I have ordered that all decisions on
deportation are now made according to the most robust interpretation of
the requirements of our international
obligations.</p><p><a name="06052384000186">Sixthly,
I have instructed managers to work with colleagues in Scotland and
Northern Ireland to audit the numbers of foreign national prisoners
released in Scotland and Northern Ireland and to establish how many of
these were referred to IND for consideration of deportation. I have
demanded clear procedures for dealing with foreign national prisoners
held in Scotland and Northern Ireland are written and
followed.</p><p><a name="06052384000188">Seventhly,
historically there have never been systematic arrangements in place for
collecting information on the nationality of mentally disordered
offenders, referring them to the Immigration and Nationality
Directorate and considering them for deportation. This is a hugely
difficult group to deal with. But I have tasked officials to construct
arrangements for considering deportation where appropriate for people
in this group taking account of their very specific
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06052384000190">Finally,
as my predecessor set out in his statement of 3 May, I have demanded
enhanced arrangements to facilitate the return of prisoners earlier in
their sentence, including Prisoner Transfer
Agreements.</p><p><a name="06052384000192">These
eight management priority areas will form the basis of a long-term
'agenda for change' to deal more effectively with foreign national
prisoners.</p><p><a name="06052384000194">However,
there are also two immediate steps which are forced on me by the
urgency of the present problems and the constraints on the system.
Those constraints include both the trained caseworking resource
available in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate to consider
cases for deportation, despite the steps we have taken to reinforce the
Criminal Casework Team, and detention
capacity.</p><p><a name="06052384000196">To
enable them to deal effectively with the current flow of cases, I have
agreed two immediate changes to the
system.</p><p><a name="06052384000198">The
first change is to prioritise cases for consideration according to the
degree of risk a person poses to the public. At present the criteria
for consideration for deportation includes people who have committed
several minor and non-violent offences, but excludes those who have had
two custodial sentences of under a year for, say, actual bodily harm.
This is a perverse outcome in public protection terms. I have therefore
authorised that instead of considering for deportation those with three
convictions regardless of seriousness or risk, the Immigration and
Nationality Directorate will now consider for deportation all non-EEA
nationals who have been given 12 months prison sentence, either in one
sentence or as an aggregate of two or three
sentences.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 81WS</b><br><p><a name="06052384000200">The
second immediate change is to tighten the guidance given to caseworkers
in deciding whether or not an individual should be deported. Rule 364
of the Immigration Rules, which sets out the criteria which officials
should weigh in the balance against a person's crime in taking the
decision whether to deport and which dates back to 1994, currently goes
wider than the requirements of the Human Rights Act and the European
Convention on Human Rights would stipulate. It is not right that the
system should tilt the exercise of discretion in favour of the criminal
rather than public safety in this way. I have therefore approved the
issuing of new guidance to caseworkers which interprets the
decision-making criteria much more
tightly.</p><p><a name="06052384000202">I
believe that these immediate measures will help to ensure that more of
those offenders who pose a risk to public safety are dealt with fairly
and efficiently, and will face deportation where that is
appropriate.</p><p><a name="06052384000204">None
of the reforms set out above, in particular the long-term agenda for
change, will be delivered unless the right leadership is in place
across the system. I have therefore instructed the new Permanent
Secretary of the Home Office to address the following issues as a
matter of urgency: performance; weak services, because not every field
of our operations matches the standard of the best; leadership and
skills, where we have under-invested; fragmentation and silos,
exacerbated by communications which are too weak; and systems and
processes, which simply need to be
stronger.</p><p><a name="06052384000206">And
finally, I announced yesterday that the hon. Member for Birmingham
Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne), will be taking overall responsibility for this
reform agenda, reporting to me. I have told him I want to consider any
option he believes feasible, however radical it may be. I intend to
report back to the House on progress and proposals for change before
the summer
recess.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06052384000008">International

and other issues affecting our development partnership with President
Museveni and his Foreign Minister, Sam
Kutesa.</p><p><a name="06052384000208">The
security situation in northern Uganda has improved over the last year,
as Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) numbers have declined in the face of
better performance by Uganda's army and less freedom of movement for
the LRA in southern Sudan. LRA attacks have fallen, and some of those
displaced by conflict in the eastern part of the region have started to
return home. But there are still 2 million people displaced, 1.7
million of whom are living in camps. Fear of the LRA remains strong,
especially in the Acholi districts of Kitgum, Gulu and Pader. One young
girl I spoke to still walks four hours every day there and back to
sleep at a night centre as she has done since 2003 for fear of
abduction. People will not go home until they are quite certain it is
safe to do so. A significant number of the LRA are now active in 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 82WS</b><br>Garamba national park in the north-eastern part of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), including leaders who have been indicted by
the International Criminal Court (ICC). This adds to regional
insecurity.</p><p><a name="06052384000209">The
humanitarian effort, including the &#163;20 million provided by DFID
in 2004-05, has improved conditions in the camps. But the camps are
crowded and there are major challenges in providing essential services.
I visited Padibe camp in Kitgum district where 35,000 displaced people
still live. In the Health Centre, there were only a handful of health
workers, no doctor present, beds had no mattresses to hand, there was a
shortage of drugs, and no ARVs for HIV-positive patients. Less than six
litres of water are available per person per day compared to a
humanitarian target of 15 litres per person per day. There is a cholera
outbreak in the region. The humanitarian situation continues to demand
our
attention.</p><p><a name="06052384000210">In
my discussions with President Museveni and his Foreign Minister, I
emphasised that greater effort was needed to address the humanitarian
situation and as security allows to help people return home. We agreed
that the Joint Monitoring Committee recently established by the
Government and including the core group of bilateral donors (UK, US,
Netherlands and Norway), the UN and civil society should help achieve
this provided there was an agreed and effectively monitored plan. I
made a commitment to continued substantial humanitarian assistance from
the UK and for help with recovery when this becomes
possible.</p><p><a name="06052384000211">I
welcomed President Museveni's discussions with the government of
southern Sudan about tackling the LRA, but emphasised that ICC's
warrants against the LRA leadership had to be enforced. I also
emphasised that the regional integrity of the DRC must be respected. We
agreed that a Special Envoy could have an important role to play in
achieving the regional cooperation required to deal effectively with
the
LRA.</p><p><a name="06052384000212">I
also emphasised the importance of the government working with the
opposition in the new Parliament to strengthen political pluralism and
to help achieve an effective and accountable parliamentary process. I
raised the care of Dr Kiiza Besigye and President Museveni assured me
that due process will be followed in his High Court trial. I also
discussed the President's commitment in his election manifesto and
subsequent public statements to tackle corruption. Promoting good
governance in Uganda is an important priority for the
UK.</p><h4 align="center"><a name="06052384000020">Visit to Somalia by

Action Contre Le Faim (ACF) therapeutic feeding centre for malnourished
children brought from distances of up to 50 km, and then in a camp
occupied by about 11000 people who were living in terrible conditions 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 83WS</b><br>under very basic shelters, and being fed by the World Food Programme.
Now that some rain has arrived, the menfolk have returned to their
homes to begin cultivation. However, the harvest will not come for
several months, and the families in the camps will need to be cared for
in the meantime. I was also able to visit a UNICEF-organised tent
school in the camp, where about 300 children and an equal number of
boys and girls are enjoyingvery basic primary education for
the first time in their lives. UN agency and Non-Governmental
Organisation representatives told me that despite the logistical and
security problems of working in Somalia, the relief effort had averted
a humanitarian disaster, and while I was there I committed a further
&#163;2 million to support what I hope will be post-drought
operations.</p><p><a name="06052384000219">In
Baidoa, I called on President Abdulahi Yusuf Ahmed, Prime Minister Ali
Mohamed Gedi, and Parliamentary Speaker Sharif Hassan Sheik Adan, the
leaders of the Transitional Institutions. I was struck by the warmth of
their welcome, and how, having earlier this year buried their
differences, they are trying to build a new administration from
absolutely nothing, working from loaned properties including a
warehouse converted into a parliamentary chamber. Despite their great
fragility, these transitional institutions represent the best hope for
taking Somalia forward from over15 years of internal
conflict, which sadly has continued with recent fighting in Mogadishu.
The President and Prime Minister emphasised the urgent need for support
to education&#151;not currently available to the vast majority (about
80 per cent.) of children&#151;and I was able to announce plans for a
new &#163;6 million DFID partnership programme with UNICEF and others
over three
years.</p><p><a name="06052384000222">Building
the new institutions, and the systems to bring internal reconciliation,

time, butsome progress is being made. I committed a further

the Transitional
Institutions.</p><p><a name="06052384000223">We
must all hope that the political transition in Somalia, fragile though

TIF represents a new approach by the Department for Transport (DfT) to
the allocation of some of its budget. Through the TIF, resources will
be directed towards the achievement of two high priority
objectives&#151;specifically tackling congestion and improving
productivity. The principle underlying the TIF is that resources should
be allocated on the basis of an assessment of how these objectives can
be most effectively and sustainably met. The provision of pump priming
funding only applies to congestion TIF schemes.</p><p><a name="06052384000239">&#147;The
Future of Transport&#148; White Paper identified the risk that,
despite effective policies to promote smarter choices and network
management, without radical measures, including more effective demand
management, road congestion will spread over time to longer periods in
the day, and to more road users. This would have negative impact on
both quality of life and

development of national road pricing in the longer term.</p><p><a name="06052384000240">We
recognise that the development and appraisal of such packages will be a
complex and costly process for many local authorities. That is why the
Government decided to offer a limited number of local authorities some
financial assistance with scheme development in advance of substantive
congestion TIF funding. In July 2005 it was announced that up to
&#163;18 million was set aside between 2005-06 and 2007-08. The first
allocations were made to seven areas in November 2005. The guidance
published today covers the second allocation of
funding.</p><p><a name="06052384000241">It
explains the basis on which DfT intends to allocate this pump priming
funding for the second round and sets out the information that will be
required from local authorities intending to bid. The guidance applies
both to authorities considering putting forward new proposals and to
authorities who successfully obtained funding in the first round of
pump priming and who wish to apply for further funding. Eligibility for
funding is restricted to local authorities in England.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 86WS</b><br><p><a name="06052384000242">The process for
allocating pump priming funding is separate from the process of
allocating the main TIF. Full guidance on the TIF was published in
January 2006. It is not necessary to have had a successful pump-priming
