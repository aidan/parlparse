<p><a name="st_114"><a name="09012861000018"><a name="90128m0001.htm_spmin1"><a name="09012861000068"><b>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Yvette Cooper):</b>
 The Treasury, the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and the Department for Work and Pensions are today publishing a consultation document on proposals to legislate on the Government&#146;s commitment to eradicate child poverty by 2020.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="90128m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09012861000019">Every child deserves the best start in life. Where children grow up on low income, suffering either material deprivation or falling too far behind their peers, they can be disadvantaged throughout their lives. Child poverty doubled in the 20 years from the late 1970s to the mid 1990s, leaving far too many British children deprived of important opportunities in life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="90128m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09012861000020">That is why in 1999 the Government set an ambitious target to end child poverty in a generation. This commitment has already driven considerable progress across Government. The number of children in absolute poverty has halved and 600,000 children have been lifted out of relative poverty to date. Had the Government done nothing other than simply uprate the tax and benefit system, there would have been 2 million more children in relative poverty than there are today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="90128m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09012861000021">All families have benefited from increases in support since 1997; households with children are on average &#163;2,100 better off in 2009-10 and families with children in the poorest fifth of the population are &#163;4,400 better off as a result of personal tax and benefit changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="90128m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09012861000022">But too many children still suffer from poverty or disadvantage. That is why we have committed to enshrine in legislation our historic pledge to eradicate child poverty by 2020. The consultation document outlines how the Government will use primary and secondary legislation to set a framework for achieving the Government&#146;s 2020 aims, including setting targets for  <br>

the future. It will also set a requirement for Government to report annually on progress. Improved accountability and a clear and comprehensive definition of progress will provide a platform for a renewed approach to break the cycle of poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="90128m0001.htm_para4"><a name="09012861000023">We believe that tackling child poverty and confirming our commitment to ending child poverty by 2020 is even more important during difficult economic times. Giving families real help now is important to help people deal with the challenges from the global credit crunch. But it is also about preventing the kind of long-term unemployment and worklessness caused by past recessions, which scarred communities and pushed up child poverty across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="90128m0001.htm_para5"><a name="09012861000024">The Government are determined that no child is left behind, and we create a fairer society for the future.

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="90128m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09012861000030">We have come a long way in delivering on the agenda that we set ourselves in 2004. Thanks to hard work across the sector, parents now have access to more flexible, affordable and better quality early learning and childcare than ever before, and many more families are benefiting from new rights and services. It will take time for the children who have had these opportunities to demonstrate the long-term benefits, but there are already signs that changes could help promote the social mobility of future generations.

results show that 21,000 more children achieved a good level of development at age 5 than the previous year. And the lowest achievers are starting to catch up; the gap between their achievement and their peers has narrowed for the first time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="90128m0001.htm_para11"><a name="09012861000031">We are determined to keep improving early learning and childcare because these are crucial long-term investments. Good quality early learning and childcare is vital for ensuring all children, but especially the most disadvantaged, reach their full potential. It supports parents into employment&#151;which is the best way out of poverty. And it relieves the time and emotional pressures that families face in balancing work and home life. In a time of global economic downturn, where parents face increased financial and emotional pressures, these priorities are as important as ever.</p>

We want this to be the beginning of a wider conversation with parents, people who work in the sector, providers, agencies, children and local government&#151;about how we can meet these challenges. That is why, the Government are also launching today a consultation on our plans to enshrine our historic goal of eradicating child poverty into law&#151;&#147;Ending Child Poverty: Making it Happen&#148;&#151;and publishing a discussion paper on a new framework to help many more parents with younger children and employment and support allowance claimants to prepare for work&#151;&#147;Personalised Conditionally And Support&#148;, the Gregg review.</p>

 My noble Friend Lord Adonis, the Minister of State for the Department for Transport (Lord Adonis) has made the following ministerial statement:</p>

The consultation, which closed on 17 December 2008, sought views on provisions to slow down the rate at which the renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO) increases year on year as recommended by the Gallagher review, adding two new renewable fuels to those eligible for RTFO certificates and revising the definition of relevant hydrocarbon oil.</p>
</ul><a name="90128m0001.htm_brev6"><a name="09012861000057"><ul><p class="tabletext">Having considered the responses received to the consultation, the Government continue to believe that there is a need to progress with caution with regard to obligation levels.</p>
</ul><a name="90128m0001.htm_brev7"><a name="09012861000058"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Government have now decided to introduce legislation setting an obligation level for 2009-10 of 3.25 per cent., which is 0.25 per cent. higher than the Gallagher recommendation, and thereafter maintaining the planned increases in line with the Gallagher recommendations to reach 5 per cent. in 2013-14. A draft order to amend the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007 (2007/3072 will be laid in Parliament shortly and will be subject to the affirmative procedure. It is our intention that if the order completes the necessary stages it will be made in time to come into force at the start of the next obligation year in April 2009.</p>
</ul><a name="90128m0001.htm_brev8"><a name="09012861000059"><ul><p class="tabletext">Our decision on next year&#146;s obligation level takes into account the views expressed in response to the consultation. In particular this decision reflects concerns about the effects of the discrepancy in the definition of relevant hydrocarbon oil in the 2007 order. That definition excludes any fossil fuel which is blended with renewable fuel before the duty point. The result is that less fossil fuel than was intended is taken into account in calculating suppliers&#146; obligations, and therefore less renewable fuel is required to be supplied than was intended. My earlier statement of 13 November 2008, <i>Official Report</i>, column 67WS explained the background behind this issue.</p>

effect for the current obligation period which started in April last year. The full effect of the discrepancy issue on the volume of biofuel supplied in the first obligation year (2008-09) will not be known until after the end of this year. Our intention is that by setting this level the overall amounts of biofuel supplied in the first two years are still broadly consistent with the Gallagher recommendations; that is, 5.5 per cent.

This will form part of Government policy as we draw up our renewable energy strategy and action plan for meeting the UK&#146;s 2020 renewable energy target, which needs to be submitted to the European Commission during 2010.

Because we know that the availability of childcare is so central to enabling parents to realise their aspirations for paid work, we will pay for any additional childcare that claimants need to carry out their action plan. We will also test out whether offering an improved financial incentive for parents to try out work supports them make the full transition from benefits to work.</p>
