 In a written ministerial statement on 10 October 2006, <i>Official Report</i>, column 11WS, the then Economic Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Ed Balls) undertook to report to Parliament on a quarterly basis on the operation of the UK's counter-terrorism asset-freezing regime.

This figure is lower than previous quarters, primarily because some frozen assets were surrendered to the Legal Services Commission to repay legal aid, but also reflecting that some funds have been unfrozen as a result of delistings in this period.</p>

Each licence is considered on a case-by-case basis. The key objective of the licensing system is to strike a balance between minimising the risk of diversion of funds to terrorism and the humanitarian rights of individuals and third parties affected.</p>

in the EU, states that it is an offence to "make funds available directly or indirectly for the benefit of the designated person" without a licence from a competent authority. The Treasury's interpretation of this provision, as set out in a written statement to Parliament by the then Economic Secretary on 3 July 2006, <i>Official Report</i><i>,</i> column 25WS, is that it includes the provision of state benefits to the spouses or partners of designated persons where they are living together in the same household.</p>

Following referral of the case by the House of Lords to the European Court of Justice, the ECJ Advocate-General issued an opinion on 14 January 2010 indicating that in his view, the provision should be interpreted narrowly and should not include the payment of state benefits to the households of designated persons. A final ECJ decision is expected within the next few months.</p>

In the meantime, as set out in my written ministerial statement of 5 February 2010, <i>Official Report</i>, column 31WS, I have made changes to how we implement the licensing of household benefits to ensure that our approach remains fair and proportionate.</p>
