 I hereby give notice of the Cabinet Office's intention to seek an advance from the Contingencies Fund to provide for a deficient net cash requirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="100126m0001.htm_para0"><a name="10012652000017">The Cabinet Office requires an advance in the  amount of £99.248 million to meet an urgent cash requirement pending parliamentary approval of the spring supplementary estimate 2009-10.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="100126m0001.htm_para1"><a name="10012652000018">Of this total, £33 million is required to fund the cash settlement of its prior year creditors and £66.248 million is required to fund resources sought by the Office of the Third Sector in the spring supplementary estimate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="100126m0001.htm_para2"><a name="10012652000019">In seeking this advance, it is not the intention of the Cabinet Office to consume resources additional to those sought in the spring supplementary estimate 2009-10.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="100126m0001.htm_para3"><a name="10012652000020">There are no reasonable grounds to doubt that Parliament is willing to approve the additional net resource and net cash requirements, since the Cabinet Office has received prior agreement from the Treasury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="100126m0001.htm_para4"><a name="10012652000021">The Cabinet Office has drawn down from the Treasury's Consolidated Fund the full amount of net cash requirement voted in the winter supplementary estimate 2009-10 and has disbursed almost all of this funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="100126m0001.htm_para5"><a name="10012652000022">This accelerated pattern of disbursement is caused by the Office of the Third Sector making grant payments to its delivery partners in cases where the funding for these commitments has been approved by the Treasury but the net cash requirement detailed in the spring supplementary estimate will not be voted by Parliament until late March.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="100126m0001.htm_para6"><a name="10012652000023">If the Office of the Third Sector is unable to make payments to these funds, it will be in breach of contract and, in turn, its delivery partners will be in breach of contract with their third sector partners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="100126m0001.htm_para7"><a name="10012652000024">The Cabinet Office will repay the advance to the Contingencies Fund as soon as it has access to draw down additional supply sought in the spring supplementary estimate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="100126m0001.htm_para8"><a name="10012652000025">Parliamentary approval for additional resources of £66,248,000 will be sought in a supplementary estimate for the Cabinet Office. Pending that approval, urgent expenditure estimated at £99,248,000 will be met by repayable cash advances from the Contingencies Fund.</p>

 I regret that a date I gave during the Adjournment debate on electricity transmission (North Somerset) on 19 January was incorrect. National Grid's consultation on two possible route corridors for a new overhead power line from Bridgwater to Avonmouth was extended until 22 January because of the bad weather.

Interventions fell into three broad categories-market transparency; the role of producer organisations; and the country of origin principle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="100126m0001.htm_para13"><a name="10012652000033">For market transparency (surveillance of price trends and margins for producers, processors and retailers) member states were divided between those that felt price monitoring should be carried out systematically at EU level, and those who, sceptical of creating additional costs and burdens, favoured national competence (including the UK).</p>

France called for changes to single market rules and competition law, and the adoption of model contracts. Germany and the UK, at the other end of the spectrum, insisted on the need to operate within the rules.

 On Friday 22 January, the joint terrorism analysis centre (JTAC) changed the UK threat level from international terrorism from substantial to severe. This means that a terrorist attack is highly likely.</p>

It reinforces the message that the terrorist threat to the United Kingdom is real, serious and can change. Our first duty is always to protect the public and we view the appropriate threat level is a keystone for doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="100126m0001.htm_para22"><a name="10012652000043">The decision to change the threat level is taken by JTAC independently of Ministers and is based on the very latest intelligence, considering factors such as capability, intent and timescale.

In addition to this statement I am also placing in the Libraries of the House a document setting out the expertise each member will bring to the panel's work and their respective letters of appointment. All panel appointments are for a period of two years.</p>

That over 30,000 people attended the service marking the 20th anniversary of Hillsborough in April shows how deep the wound in Liverpool remains. I believe that the independent panel has an historic opportunity to bring healing to those affected by the tragedy, and that its establishment can help to begin to bring an end to the grievances strongly felt by many.</p>
