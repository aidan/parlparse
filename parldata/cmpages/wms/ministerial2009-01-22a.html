The intent is to provide an occasion during which the whole nation has the opportunity to show its appreciation for the contribution made to society by all those who serve and have served in Her Majesty&#146;s Armed Forces.</p>

This sense of inclusiveness is reflected in the strapline for the Day: &#147;Honouring Britain&#146;s Armed Forces, Past, Present and Future&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="90122m0001.htm_para4"><a name="09012247000032">Building on the success of previous Veterans Day celebrations, we plan to mark the occasion with a wide range of community-led events taking place in towns and cities around the country. Last year, we supported over 100 such events and we expect a similar level of activity this year. To provide a focus for the national recognition, we also intend to support a national event and a number of local authorities and other organisations have also submitted bids to be the national event host. There were a number of compelling bids that offered excellent prospects to host a prestigious and fitting event, but against stiff competition, we have selected Chatham Historic Dockyard to be the host for the 2009 national event.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="90122m0001.htm_para12"><a name="09012247000042">The presidency will outline their priorities: Economy, Energy and Europe in the World. In practice, this is likely to mean a focus on enlargement, the Eastern Partnership, energy security, single market, economic recovery, post-2013 Lisbon strategy and better regulation, which the Government support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="90122m0001.htm_para13"><a name="09012247000043">We also expect the presidency to present their plans for the Eastern Partnership, which they have said will be a key agenda item for the spring European Council on 19 and 20 March. We support the Eastern Partnership, and will work closely with the presidency, Commission and EU partners to develop the initiative. The presidency plans a Summit of Heads of State from the EU 27 and Eastern partner countries on 7 May to launch the partnership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="90122m0001.htm_para14"><a name="09012247000044"><i>Energy Security</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="90122m0001.htm_para15"><a name="09012247000045">The Council will discuss the presidency&#146;s priority of Energy Security with particular reference to the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute and its impact on the EU. We support the presidency and Commission&#146;s handling of this dispute and agree with President Barroso that it has done long-term damage to both parties&#146; reputations as reliable energy partners. We welcome the recently announced agreement by the two parties, and the resumption of gas flow through Ukraine, and hope this will prove to be a long-term, sustainable solution. The situation of the last few weeks cannot be allowed to happen again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="90122m0001.htm_para16"><a name="09012247000046">In the longer-term the dispute has highlighted the need to tackle EU energy security as a whole. We therefore expect Ministers to discuss the EU Strategic Energy Review (SEER2), released on 13 November 2008, and look ahead to the adoption of an ambitious action plan at the spring European Council on 19 and 20 March. This will be an important step in ensuring a more coherent EU energy policy. The action plan needs to focus on increasing diversification of energy supplies for the EU and interconnection within the EU, greater transparency of gas flows and improving our ability to respond to supply disruptions. At the same time, the EU needs to increase its energy efficiency and continue to work towards the creation of a fully functioning internal energy market. The SEER2 identifies six strategic energy infrastructure projects. The UK particularly welcomes concrete actions to develop the southern gas corridor, which would bring Caspian gas into the EU via Turkey thereby diversifying both the sources and routes of energy supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="90122m0001.htm_para20"><a name="09012247000050">The outcome of the GAERC will depend in part on developments this week, and the outcomes of these other meetings.

We anticipate inclusion of a call for regional states to pave the way for the establishment of an equitable power-sharing agreement in Zimbabwe. We expect a call for investigations into links between illicit diamond trading in Zimbabwe and the regime. Conclusions should also note the extension and renewal of targeted measures against individuals and entities associated with the Mugabe regime&#146;s violence and human rights violations.

global pressure on resources, promoting lower carbon growth and sustainable development, achieving the millennium development goals (MDGs), and reducing conflict and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. On security issues, China is a pivotal member of the UN Security Council and its regional relations will be key to Asian stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="90122m0001.htm_para29"><a name="09012247000060">The framework offers three pillars for the UK&#146;s response to this challenge and sets out the series of outcomes we are working for under each. The outcomes are in places aspirational and by necessity subject to review. In a period of economic uncertainty, achieving our targets in trade and economic co-operation will be particularly challenging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="90122m0001.htm_para30"><a name="09012247000061">The three pillars are:</p>

Working towards the outcomes we want will require patience, persistence and effective partnership. We will be candid where we disagree but we will ensure that the relationship remains characterised by co-operation, not confrontation. Building a progressive, comprehensive relationship with China will be a major priority in the years ahead.</p>

Analysis of what had taken place needed to begin in parallel with a full examination of the alternatives with clear timescales in place. It was also argued that any alternative scenarios needed to take into account the investments already made, something upon which the presidency gave assurances.

The presidency brought the debate to a close by noting that an alternative solution should be scoped in parallel to the ongoing work to test and analyse the current system, and a taskforce approach to testing would be implemented to offer greater scrutiny by member states&#146; experts. The February JHA Council will be asked to confirm this approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="90122m0002.htm_para0"><a name="09012247000072">On the use of modern technology for security purposes, the presidency stressed the importance of the core values of mobility, security and privacy in taking forward this work. The Commission emphasised the need for a coherent common strategy to enable information sharing and interoperability, covering all aspects of law enforcement information exchange across the EU. The UK also stressed the need for a broad strategy, but one which was not artificially constrained by the treaty pillars, and which drew on operational needs. The UK agreed that balance of privacy and data sharing was important. In subsequent interventions there was general support for a broad strategy in the area of EU information access that looked at the practical needs and that could then be reflected in the post-Hague JHA work programme. There was also a sense that this work should be taken forward through existing Council structures rather than through the creation of new groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="90122m0002.htm_para1"><a name="09012247000073">On the related issue of the use of modern technologies in border control, migration management and asylum policy, there was clear support for the use of modern technologies to improve border management, including the use of biometric data to manage external borders. There was also broad support to develop the use of Eurodac. The presidency noted that existing mechanisms should be combined to enhance the effectiveness of border management work and said that the entry/exit system and registered traveller system would be ongoing areas of work for its presidency. The Commission recognised the possibility of an automated border system for those with biometric travel documents, but noted that a requirement to make the collection of such data binding would require a change to the current legislation. The Commission thought that new systems should only be developed once the legal instrument had been agreed, and systems needed to be developed in an integrated manner, across all levels (national and EU). The Commission also said that there would be an agency to manage IT systems, which would improve the process and enable member states to be more involved. The UK welcomed the presidency&#146;s proposals, noting its extensive use of data in border management, which facilitated travel as well as being a tool for law enforcement and migration management. It was important to learn from one another, and agree on the basic principles and benefits for citizens, for example in the use of passenger name records.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="90122m0002.htm_para2"><a name="09012247000074">During a working lunch the presidency sought views on the international protection of children, with particular emphasis on the use of IT, including SIS II. The Commission raised the issue of the still small number of member states who currently have an early warning child abduction system in place. The UK called for support on a number of related issues: the work being undertaken by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP) Centre to tackle the sale and distribution of abusive images; for member states to consider participation of their law enforcement agencies in the virtual global taskforce (an international collaboration of law enforcement agencies who lead work to tackle child sexual abuse and exploitation both on and offline in their respective countries) to broaden its use within the EU; for consideration of an EU-wide child abduction taskforce and use of a website to exchange information and child alerts. Other delegations stressed the importance of concerted effort at EU level, mentioning specifically the  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="90122m0002.htm_para3"><a name="09012247000075">As regards the debate on the future of mutual recognition of court decisions and judgments, there was a general sense that mutual recognition should remain the cornerstone of judicial co-operation. However, there were also widespread calls for better implementation and for improved evaluation of existing instruments, and for minimum procedural safeguards in order to enhance trust in each others&#146; systems. The UK stressed the importance of proportionality in the way instruments were applied, and called for existing standards under the European Convention on Human Rights to be better observed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="90122m0002.htm_para4"><a name="09012247000076">During the debate on succession and family law, general support was expressed in principle for a proposal that dealt with problems arising from succession and wills involving property in more than one country. However there was widespread caution as to the detail, with some delegations calling for work to proceed slowly and taking full account of the diversity of member states&#146; legal systems. During a short discussion on family law, some states observed that it would be better to focus on implementation of agreed measures before proceeding further. A number of delegations spoke in favour of enhanced co-operation where negotiations on family law measures among all member states had not led to agreement. Nonetheless, the Commission indicated it did not consider that there was the critical mass to proceed with a proposal under enhanced co-operation on choice of law in divorce (following from the failure to reach agreement on Rome III).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="90122m0002.htm_para5"><a name="09012247000077">Over lunch there was a discussion about e-justice. The presidency announced that they are going to produce a manual listing the location of video-conferencing facilities in every member state. The Commission said that member states would be able to request funding to help them to improve their video-conferencing capabilities.</p>

 The Olympic Funders&#146; Group<sup>(1)</sup> met yesterday and agreed to allow the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) to access &#163;394 million of funders&#146; contingency. This decision provides &#163;68 million, to meet the funding requirements of the International Broadcast Centre/Main Press Centre (IBC/MPC), and &#163;326 million to support the construction of the Olympic village. The overall &#163;9.325 billion public sector funding package remains unchanged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="90122m0002.htm_para6"><a name="09012247000081">As a result of good progress being made by the ODA, this investment is affordable from the overall contingency funds available and the contingency provision still available exceeds the assessed value of remaining risks. Alongside other contingency allocations, this means that around &#163;1.5 billion of contingency funds remain available. The additional funding required is due to the shortage of private sector funding and the deterioration in the property market as a result of the current global economic downturn.</p>

The original budget assumed a private sector contribution of &#163;160 million which is no longer available, with &#163;220 million from the ODA budget. As a result, &#163;68 million of funders&#146; contingency is being provided to bridge the funding gap.

The village will house up to 17,000 athletes during the Olympics and over 6,000 during the Paralympics.</p>

Some &#163;2 billion of contingency therefore remained available for the ODA.
