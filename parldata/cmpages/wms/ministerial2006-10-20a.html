the costs of local enforcing authorities in regulating processes which
are subject to Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (Local
Air Pollution Control (LAPC)) were introduced in April 1991. Interim
charges for installations which are subject to the Pollution Prevention

2000.</p><p><a name="06102036000020">With

Council in Luxembourg on 23
October.</p><p><a name="06102036000025">At
this Council, the Finnish presidency will be seeking political
agreement on the proposed directive on ambient air quality and cleaner
air for Europe, following the Council&#146;s agreement on a general
approach at the June Council. The directive, the first legal measure to
be brought forward under the Commission&#146;s Air Thematic Strategy
of September 2005, consolidates and simplifies current EU ambient air
quality legislation, retaining existing standards for pollutants in
air, but gives member states several new flexibilities to help them
comply with the legislation. The UK strongly supports the general
approach text as it strikes the right balance between allowing member
states some flexibility in meeting targets while achieving a net
improvement in public health protection. The UK will continue to oppose
the introduction of more flexibility which would make it easier to
postpone obligatory standards for various
pollutants.</p><p><a name="06102036000026">The
presidency will be seeking Council conclusions on three items. On
climate change, the conclusions will serve as the negotiating mandate
for this year&#146;s COP/MOP in Nairobi in November, focusing on the
scale and urgency of the climate change challenge while setting out
priorities for the Nairobi meeting including adaptation, technology
transfer and the various further action tracks. The UK will also be

particular emphasising that the EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) is
the nucleus of this market and a key driver of its
expansion.</p><p><a name="06102036000027">Council
will also be asked to agree conclusions on the preparations of the
eighth conference of the parties to the Basel convention on the control
of transboundary hazardous wastes and their disposal. The UK welcomes
the inclusion of ship recycling in the Council conclusions, as we are
keen that the issue of ship recycling remains on the agenda. The new
convention being negotiated under the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) is unlikely to enter into force for several years
and interim measures are needed to improve environmental conditions at
current ship recycling
facilities.</p><p><a name="06102036000028">The
presidency will be seeking Council conclusions on the thematic strategy
on the sustainable use of natural resources which forms part of the
EU&#146;s sixth environmental action programme. The UK supports the
thematic strategy as a first step towards decoupling economic growth
from the environmental impacts of resource use. The UK is particularly
pleased to see strong links being made to the Commission&#146;s
proposed EU sustainable consumption and production (SCP) action plan,
which we believe will be an important means of advancing this
agenda.</p><p><a name="06102036000029">The
Council will hold a policy debate on the thematic strategy for the
protection of the marine environment and the proposed marine strategy
directive. Member states will be asked to consider whether the strategy
and directive are adequate, whether an explicit definition of good
environmental status (GES) is required in the directive and how to
balance and strengthen national measures and regional co-operation. The
UK supports an ambitious but realistic definition of GES in the
directive. We would like the directive strengthened so that there is a
requirement for the EU to take appropriate decisions or actions, within
the framework of the common fisheries policy, where fishing is
preventing a member state from achieving GES. We support regional
co-operation, whilst recognising that implementation of a directive
rests with individual member
states.</p><p><a name="06102036000030">Under
&#147;Any Other Business&#148;, the first European congress of
conservation biology, a ban on mercury exports from the EU and forest
