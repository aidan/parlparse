 The Treasury has today issued a consultation paper on a Regulatory Reform Order which proposes to cut unnecessary consultation by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), to make it easier for the FSA to tailor regulation to industry&#039;s needs and to improve the FSA&#039;s operational efficiency in other areas. Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in both Libraries of the House and it is accessible at www.hm-treasury.&#95;gov.uk.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51205m01.html_spmin2"><b>The Paymaster General  (Dawn Primarolo): </b> 
 The Child and Working Tax Credits are today benefiting over 6 million families and 10 million children. Tax credits tailor support to families&#039; specific circumstances, providing more support when their need is greatest. They represent a more generous and inclusive system of income-based financial support than any previous system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m01.html_para18"><a name="stpa_18">Over the past seven years the Government have reformed Britain&#039;s tax and benefit system to achieve three over-arching aims: to provide adequate financial incentives to work; to reduce child poverty; and to recognise the responsibilities of parenthood by supporting families with children. These reforms have helped make work pay and reduce the numbers of children in absolute poverty by one and a half million. Tax Credits have been an important part of this success and they represent the best way to continue it in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m01.html_para19"><a name="stpa_19">In my statement of May 26 I outlined six measures to improve the administration of tax credits. These aimed to improve HMRC&#039;s communications with tax credit recipients, reduce the risk of errors and improve the procedures for recovering overpayments. Significant progress has been made in each of these areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m01.html_para20"><a name="stpa_20">Building on these improvements to the administration of the system, the Government are today announcing a package of further improvements most of which will come into effect over the next 18 months. The measures reflect the experience of the first years of operating the tax credit system and strike a balance between providing more certainty and stability of financial support for families, while maintaining flexibility to respond to changes in their income and circumstances. The measures also include clear responsibilities for claimants to report changes affecting their award.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m01.html_para21"><a name="stpa_21">The tax credits system is an annual one&#151;integrated with the tax system&#151;within which payments can be adjusted to reflect changes in a family&#039;s circumstances and income. Under an annual system, given a family&#039;s final entitlement cannot be known until the end of the year, some level of end-year adjustment will be necessary. However, for some families, especially those on lower incomes, downward adjustments to tax credit payments&#151;to reflect changes in circumstances reported within the year or when awards are renewed&#151;can sometimes cause difficulties. This is a particular problem where claimants had not realised their payments were too high. Better communications, which is a key part of the measures announced on 26 May, will help by improving claimants&#039; understanding of the system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m01.html_para22"><a name="stpa_22">Today&#039;s measures will improve matters further, providing greater certainty for claimants, especially those on lower incomes, through measures to reduce the need for adjustments caused by rising income and to limit the effects of adjustments. These are supported by measures to reduce the likelihood of unexpected downward adjustments resulting from inaccurate or out of date information about a family&#039;s income or circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m01.html_para23"><a name="stpa_23">Analysis of overpayments suggests that they result from a number of factors: income rises from one year to the next; families overestimating the extent to which 





<br>&nbsp;<br>5 Dec 2005 : Column 56WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

their income has fallen when they seek extra support during the year; provisional payments made at the start of the tax year, which are based on out-of-date information that is subsequently updated when the award is renewed; and delays in reporting changes in families&#039; personal circumstances to HMRC.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m01.html_para24"><a name="stpa_24">The improvements announced today will provide greater certainty for claimants, particularly those on lower incomes, while maintaining flexibility to respond to falls in income and changes in circumstances.
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">To increase the flexibility of the system, from April 2006 there will be an increase in the limit on the amount that family income can rise over the current tax year without affecting tax credit entitlement for that year. The current annual income disregard of &#163;2,500 will increase to &#163;25,000. This will mean that, for instance, a family where a non-working partner moves into work on average earnings will not see their increased income lead to a fall in their tax credit entitlement during that year. This will maintain the incentives for people to move into work, while removing a major cause of the overpayments seen in the first two years of the system&#039;s operation.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">To provide greater certainty of award for claimants, from November 2006, automatic limits will be imposed on the extent to which tax credit payments can be reduced to recover higher payments in the earlier part of the year which could lead to an overpayment for the year as a whole. These limits will be set at the same levels at which overpayments from a previous tax year are currently recovered. This will guarantee that low- to middle-income families do not face large and sudden falls in their tax credit income, and reassure people who report changes promptly.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">To tackle the problem of families overestimating falls in income, from April 2007, when claimants report a fall in expected income during the year, their tax credit payments will be adjusted for the rest of the year to reflect their new income level, but will no longer include a one-off payment for the earlier part of the year. At the end of the year, their award will be finalised when their actual income is known. If they have been underpaid, a further payment will then be made. This approach will provide a buffer against any overpayment accumulated by the family during the year, especially where their estimate of income proves to have been too low.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m01.html_para25"><a name="stpa_25">Today&#039;s measures will also give claimants clear responsibilities to report changes promptly and more regularly. They will be helped to keep their records up to date, including through more proactive contact by HMRC, allowing HMRC to base tax credit awards on the best possible information.
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">In summer 2006 the deadline for providing information to finalise and renew tax credit awards will be brought forward by one month to shorten the period during which provisional payments may be made using out-of-date information.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">From November 2006, the range of changes reducing entitlement that must be reported to HMRC within three months will be expanded to include changes in work status or in the number of children for which the family can claim support. From April 2007, the time allowed to report such changes will be reduced from three months to one.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">In early 2007, towards the end of the tax year, HMRC will contact key groups of claimants to obtain more up-to-date income information on which to base the next year&#039;s payments while the finalisation process is completed. And from 2008&#150;09, the income figure used in setting provisional payments will be uprated by average earnings where up to date information has not been provided.</p>
</ul>
<p>






<br>&nbsp;<br>5 Dec 2005 : Column 57WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m01.html_para26"><a name="stpa_26">In line with its commitment when tax credits were announced in 2002, the Government have looked to learn from the early operation of the system and will continue to do so. Together these measures, and the six measures currently being implemented by HMRC, will lead to steady and ongoing improvements in the tax credits system, allowing it to deliver support even more effectively to millions of families. Without the changes announced today, initial estimates suggest that subsequent years&#039; overpayments would be of broadly the same level as in 2003&#150;04. When fully implemented, it is anticipated that today&#039;s changes will reduce the value of overpayments by around one third. I am still considering whether there is more that can be done to alert claimants about the recovery of an overpayment before HMRC starts to collect it but the scale of changes to the computer system that would be needed mean that this could not be done quickly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m01.html_para27"><a name="stpa_27">I believe that these further measures will help to ensure that tax credits strike the right balance between flexibility and certainty for claimants and give clear messages about the need to report changes to HMRC. They are a positive response to the issues raised by the Ombudsman and others and will go a long way to meet the concerns they have expressed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m01.html_para28"><a name="stpa_28">A case has been made for a system of fixed awards, which within the framework of the annual tax credits system, would need to be based on the previous year&#039;s income. The Government will continue to listen to the case, but believe on balance that it is preferable to maintain the current system that flexibly responds to changing circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m01.html_para29"><a name="stpa_29">The PBR sets out the actions the Government are taking to continue improving compliance in the tax credit system. As announced on 2 December, as part of their ongoing compliance work, HMRC have identified and stopped attempts to defraud the tax credits system by making claims through the tax credits e-portal. HMRC has closed the e-portal while it develops new checks to ensure the system remains secure. A criminal investigation is also being undertaken into the apparent false use of a number of DWP staff identities in fraudulent tax credit claims. It would not be appropriate to make any further public statement at this stage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m01.html_para30"><a name="stpa_30">DWP and HMRC are carrying out an in-depth investigation into how this happened. They are also working quickly to identify the records concerned and to ensure they are corrected.

<br>
Notes:
<br>
The above calculation involves estimating several figures that are inherently difficult to forecast accurately, such as the gross rate yield and the prior year adjustments. The resulting figure of &#163;17.413 billion has therefore been rounded to &#163;17.500 billion exactly to avoid spurious accuracy.
<br>
For 2002&#150;03, 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05, the amounts shown are generally those reported on the outturn (NNDR3) returns, with those for 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 being regarded as provisional in advance of the receipt of audited returns from all billing authorities. For 2005&#150;06, the amounts shown are the provisional outturn for the year based upon authorities&#039; provisional contributions to the non-domestic rating pool, largely as reported on NNDR1 and&#151;where submitted&#151;NNDR2 returns. For 2006&#150;07, the estimates are based on:
<br>
 1. Item 1: The gross rate yield represents the estimated effective total rateable value of non-domestic hereditaments on local rating lists multiplied by the small business non-domestic rating multiplier of 42.6p. The supplement of 0.7p that is also applied to businesses paying for the small business rate relief is not included, and neither is the small business rate relief included within the reliefs at item l(i). This reflects the fact that the income from the supplement is intended to equal the cost of the relief nationally, resulting in a zero net effect upon the Distributable Amount.
<br>
 2. Item l(i)(a): the cost of the transitional reliefs in 2006&#150;07 is estimated to be &#163;300 million, to reflect the fact that the increase in the multiplier for 2005&#150;06 onwards to take account of expected losses from appeals has had an impact upon the in-year revenue neutrality of the transitional arrangements. At least part of this cost will be recouped once the appeals take effect, and the power exists to adjust the multiplier in later years as necessary.
<br>
 3. Item l(i)(b): net small business rate relief. This is assumed to be zero: see note 1, above.
<br>
 4. Item l(i)(c): The empty properties relief includes voids and partially occupied hereditaments.
<br>
 5. Item l(i)(d): Charitable rate relief.
<br>
 6. Item l(i)(e): Rural Shops and Post Office relief. Figures include mandatory relief for general stores and post offices under the Local Government and Rating Act 1997.
<br>
 7. Item l(i)(f): Community Amateur Sports Clubs (CASCs). This is mandatory rate relief for sports clubs registered with HM Revenue and Customs (formerly Inland Revenue) as Community Amateur Sports Clubs under the Section 64 of the Local Government Act 2003, which came into effect on 1 April 2004.
<br>
 8. Item l(i)(g): Discretionary relief granted to charities, non-profit making organisations and for other reasons including discretionary relief for village shops and post offices under the Local Government and Rating Act 1997.
<br>
 9. Item l(ii)(a) and (b): The allowances for the costs and losses incurred by authorities in collecting non-domestic rates from ratepayers.
<br>
 10. Item l(ii)(c): City of London offset&#151;the amount which the City of London is not required to pay into the non-domestic rating pool. It has been set to zero for 2004&#150;05 onwards.
<br>
 11. Item l(iii): net adjustment in respect of appeals and other amendments to the rating list affecting liability for previous years rates settled in that year: comprising repayments and associated interest payments.
<br>
 12. Item 2: a forecast of the rateable value of non-domestic hereditaments on the central rating list multiplied by the multiplier, less the net effect of transitional arrangements, and adjusted for appeals and other changes in respect of previous years.
<br>
 13. Item 3: Almost all properties previously included in the Crown List are now included in the local list figures at item 1.
<br>
 14. Item 4: the contribution from central government to offset the amount of the Secretary of State&#039;s estimate of income foregone as a result of transitional arrangements is assumed to be zero for 2006&#150;07.

The Direction will ensure that the Secretary of State has the opportunity to consider whether to call in for public inquiry and his own determination the more significant and potentially most harmful development proposals in the Green Belt before they can be approved.

Copies of the proposal are available in the Library of the House and in the Vote Office.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para0"><a name="stpa_66">This written ministerial statement outlines the context of the proposal. These budget proposals have four policy objectives:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"> The first is tough budget discipline. They are below the level proposed by the Luxembourg presidency in June and 17 per cent. below the level proposed by the Commission.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">Second, they help the new member states in the enlarged EU by building their economies and societies, and they more fairly distribute the costs among the better off nations. The UK is offering an extra contribution to these costs of enlargement amounting to 8 billion euros over the budget period.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">Third, these proposals keep the rebate. Indeed the rebate will rise, from an annual average over recent years of 5 billion euros to around 7 billion.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">Fourth, these proposals ensure there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. All spending, including on agriculture, will be subject to a review during the coming budget period.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para1"><a name="stpa_67">Let me explain in more detail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para2"><a name="stpa_68"><i>The budget overall</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para3"><a name="stpa_69">Last year the commission proposed a budget of 1,025 billion euros, or 1.24 per cent. of the total national income of all member states (GNI). We said all along that this was far too high. There would be no chance of any serious budgetary reform in specific areas without strong downward pressure overall. Given this, and the demand of the six &quot;budget disciplinarians&quot; [France, Germany, Sweden, Austria, Netherlands and UK], the Luxembourg presidency reduced their proposed budget to 1.06 per cent. or 871 billion euros. This latest proposal would further reduce the budget to at 847 billion euros 





<br>&nbsp;<br>5 Dec 2005 : Column 66WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

or 1.03 per cent. [on the commitments basis] and by the end of the budget period spending will be below the 1 per cent. level the six had proposed. This would be a major achievement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para4"><a name="stpa_70">It is important to see these proposals in a longer-term context. EU spending hit 1 per cent. of GNI in 1985 and rose rapidly under Baroness Thatcher and Sir John Major as a proportion of national income, by a quarter to 1.25 per cent. by the early 1990s. and it started to come down only in 1998. These proposals would bring it down further.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para5"><a name="stpa_71"><i>Enlargement</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para6"><a name="stpa_72">The new member states will receive 150 billion euros in structural and cohesion funding. That is an enormous amount and would represent very large new funds. Total funding through all EU programmes to the 10 new member states is worth twice the Marshall plan which funded the reconstruction of Western Europe nearly 60 years ago [at today&#039;s prices].
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para7"><a name="stpa_73">And we are ensuring that these countries will be able to spend much more of what they have been allocated. This is a very important point because the record shows that year by year both the existing and new member states have not been able to spend their full allocation for many technical reasons. We have included a series of very practical changes to ensure that they are better able to do so. This means that while headline entitlements are lower by 14 billion euros than in the June proposals, we are confident that all these countries will be better able to spend what they have been allocated. And we are proposing strengthened financial management arrangements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para8"><a name="stpa_74">Under our proposals, for example, Hungary would receive 22 billion euros in structural and cohesion funding the Czech Republic 23 billion euros and Poland 56 billion euros.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para9"><a name="stpa_75">Of course there are those who ask why our taxpayers in western Europe should pay for roads, railways and other reconstruction projects in the east, the answer is that all enlargements have benefited all members economically by increasing the total volume of EU trade, investment and jobs in which all have a share. British trade with the new member states has already increased by 400 per cent. since 1990, 10 times the rate of growth with the rest of the world. That is an indication of the economic potential we will be helping to unlock by making this investment in Europe&#039;s future. It is very much in Britain&#039;s national interest for the world&#039;s largest single market to grow and become more prosperous. And the benefits of enlargement are not just economic. It must be in Britain&#039;s interest to have increasingly stable societies in Eastern Europe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para10"><a name="stpa_76"><i>The UK contribution</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para11"><a name="stpa_77">As I have spelt out, and as these proposals make clear, the UK Government recognises its responsibility to pay a fair contribution to the cost of enlargement&#151;an historic project supported across the political divide. It has been a strategic objective of successive British Governments and, happily, has enjoyed very active all-party support. The Opposition parties have called for significant increases in structural and cohesion funding in Central and Eastern Europe. This budget delivers that objective. But it has to be paid for. We all prepared to pay our fair share, but no more than our fair share.






<br>&nbsp;<br>5 Dec 2005 : Column 67WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para12">As EU spending shifts from older member states to the new, the British contribution will inevitably rise, along with the contributions of all the EU 15 member states. But the proposals tabled by the Luxembourg presidency would have left us with a bill of more than 20 billion euros over and above the 50 billion euros that would be our contribution under existing arrangements. That was not acceptable then, nor is it now. The proposal we have tabled today will take our contribution to 58 billion over the seven-year period of the budget.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para13"><a name="stpa_78">This is the equivalent of halving the value of the rebate in respect of structural and cohesion funding in the 10 new member states. This could be achieved either by not applying the rebate to a proportion of structural and cohesion funding in the new member states, or by a technical route to increasing our gross contributions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para14"><a name="stpa_79">The UK will in any event continue to receive the full value of the rebate as it applies to the Europe of 15, and to all CAP spending throughout the union. And the rebate will rise, because it increases in proportion to our net contribution. The rebate will increase from an annual average of 5 billion euros in the current financial period, to around 7 billion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para15"><a name="stpa_80">The rebate was negotiated in 1984, but it did not prevent a very significant rise in the EU&#039;s take of member states&#039; national income. Nor did it deal with the underlying problem which made the rebate necessary. And it did not prevent the UK paying twice as much as France and Italy, countries with similar sized economies. With these proposals today, Europe&#039;s spending comes down as a proportion of income. And for the first time since the UK joined 30 years ago, we would pay roughly the same as France and Italy as a share of national income.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para16"><a name="stpa_81"><i>Reform</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para17"><a name="stpa_82">This is a budget which seeks to invest in Europe&#039;s future, and not only through enlargement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para18"><a name="stpa_83">Our proposals provide for a comprehensive and wide ranging review, covering all aspects of revenue and expenditure, including agriculture. This will be conducted by the Commission, which will submit a report in 2008. On the basis of the review, the EU would be able to make changes in the 2007&#150;13 financial period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para19"><a name="stpa_84"><i>Conclusion</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para20"><a name="stpa_85">We have always made clear our overall aim is to secure fundamental reform of spending which would remove the underlying justification for the rebate. The mechanism we propose for a review both of revenue and expenditure undertaken by the Commission would put us on a pathway to a reformed European Union better able to compete in the global economy. The budget we have circulated today is a tough package which recognises the responsibilities of all members of the EU to both pay a fair contribution towards the future well being of the Union.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para21"><a name="stpa_86">It provides a sound basis on which all our citizens can thrive in an enlarged European Union.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para22"><a name="stpa_87">A bigger, more prosperous European Union means a stronger, more prosperous Britain. These are good proposals for the UK and good proposals for Europe.

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51205m04.html_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety  (Ms Hazel Blears): </b> 
 I have today placed in the Library a copy of the Home Secretary&#039;s proposals for allocation of police grant for England and Wales in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08. The Home Secretary and I intend to implement the proposals subject to consideration of any representations and to the approval of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para23"><a name="stpa_88">This Government have put unprecedented levels of investment into the Police Service in England and Wales in recent years. This investment has helped to expand local policing, reduce crime and help to make our communities safer. Police Officer, Police Staff and Community Support Officer numbers are all at record levels, police performance continues to improve and the police have never been better equipped with the tools and powers to respond to the needs of local communities. On a like for like basis Government grant and central spending on services for the police will have increased by 56 per cent. or almost &#163;4.0 billion between 2000&#150;01 and 2007&#150;08.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para24"><a name="stpa_89">Our ambitious police reform programme continues to produce real improvements but there is still more to do to ensure that the Police Service meets the challenges of the 21st century. People are safer now but we want them to feel safer too. Key elements of the reform programme are about building a responsive, accessible police service which successfully tackles local concerns about crime and anti-social behaviour. As part of this, we are committed to ensuring that every neighbourhood has a neighbourhood police team by 2008; to continuing to modernise the police workforce to ensure it is able to deliver a more responsive, citizen focused service that the public want; and to reshape the national policing landscape to ensure it is able to meet the policing challenges of the modern world. A key part of this is the reconfiguring of the service around larger strategic police forces which will have sufficient capacity and capability to provide the full range of protective services to the public alongside responsive neighbourhood policing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para25"><a name="stpa_90">The National Community Safety Plan, which incorporates the National Policing Plan 2006&#150;09, was published on 16 November. Our key policing priorities are to reduce overall crime; bring more offenders to justice, provide dedicated, visible, accessible and responsive neighbourhood police teams, tackle serious and organised crime including improved intelligence and information sharing between partners and protect the country from both terrorism and domestic extremism. The police funding settlement for the coming two years will support the priorities outlined in the plan.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para26"><a name="stpa_91">This year, for the first time, the Government are providing planning totals for two years. Total provision for policing grants and central spending in 2006&#150;07 will be &#163;10,570 million, an overall increase of 5.0 per cent. This includes an increase of 3.4 per cent. in general grant (including a small increase to take account of losses from Amending Reports).

<a name="51205m04.html_para31"><a name="stpa_94">Police funding proposals within the Local Government finance system are being announced by my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth today, and by the Welsh Assembly Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para32"><a name="stpa_95">Provisional general policing grants (ie Home Office Police Grant, Revenue Support Grant and National Non Domestic Rates) for English and Welsh police authorities in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 compared with 2005&#150;06 are given in Tables 2 and 3. The figures for 2006&#150;07 take into account our proposed amendments to the settlements for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para33"><a name="stpa_96">With my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, we have reviewed the Police Grant formula. We have decided to use the most comprehensive and technically robust option, on which we consulted during the summer, as a basis for formula change. We have updated the existing 1995 formula that used data from the early 1990s, to bring it in line with modern conditions. At the same time, we are concerned to maintain stability of funding during a period of major structural change. We have therefore decided to apply a broadly flat rate increase for all Police Authorities for 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08. This will be 3.2 per cent. and 3.7 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para34"><a name="stpa_97">The settlement continues to take account of our commitment to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the police service. We expect the police service to build on impressive efficiency gains of &#163;316 million (3.24 per cent.) in 2004&#150;05 and projected gains of &#163;360 million (3.5 per cent.) for 2005&#150;06 through continued focus on the target of &#163;1,069 million of cumulative gains by the end of 2007&#150;08. Half these gains are to be cashable. The greater certainty over funding for 2007&#150;08 should help forces and authorities plan to meet this target. The Home Office, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the Association of Police Authorities (APA) will continue to work in partnership to deliver cumulative year on year improvements in the value for money to deliver the efficiency targets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para35"><a name="stpa_98">If Police Authorities deliver efficiency gains, and exercise judicious financial planning, there is no reason for them to set excessive increases in police precepts on council tax next year. The Government&#039;s policy in relation to average council tax increases of less than 5 per cent. in each year in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 has been clearly set out by my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government. The Government are prepared to take capping action if necessary.

The Government made clear in the Consultation Paper on formula grant distribution that they would apply the same approach to grant adjustment as they did in relation to the 2003&#150;04 Amending Report. We have therefore adjusted 2006&#150;07 grants to ensure that any authority owing money under the Amending Reports will be able to pay it back in 2006&#150;07 and still be left with at least the broadly flat rate grant increase over 2005&#150;06. The consultation period for both Amending Reports will end on the same date as the consultation on the funding settlement proposals 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 on 11 January 2006.

It is important that the police service maintains the capacity that has been developed for the efficient and effective collection and use of DNA material from individuals and crime scenes. Without sampling of newcomers to crime and the collection of DNA samples from crime scenes, the benefits of the previous investment in the detection of crime and the benefits of legislative changes introduced by the Government allowing the DNA sampling of persons when arrested, will be reduced. The Home Office will continue to monitor and report on the use of

</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m04.html_para53"><a name="stpa_116">Police Authorities will continue to receive extra funding through a number of specific grants for particular schemes. Targeted grants were introduced as a direct response to what the police service and the public told us they wanted. Total provision for specific grants in 2006&#150;07 is &#163;588 million and in 2007&#150;08 is &#163;840 million (Table 4).

This Fund has been remarkably successful in helping the police service boost its strength which is at a historically high level of more than 141,000. In response to concerns raised by both Chief Constables and Police Authorities we have relaxed the terms of the Fund this year and are willing to discuss with the service further flexibility in the use of this money from 2006&#150;07.

This settlement honours our undertaking given in &quot;Neighbourhood Policing&#151;your police; your community; our commitment&quot; (March 2005) to provide &#163;88 million in 2006&#150;07 and &#163;340 million in 2007&#150;08 to support our target of 24,000 CSOs by 2008. Details were set out in letters to Chief Constables and Police Authorities on 7 November 2005. In addition to this, for 2006&#150;07, we have allocated &#163;44 million for continuing support of CSOs recruited in the first three rounds from 2002 onwards and this support will continue in 2007&#150;08.

With this, and with funding that was removed from the Centrex baseline this year, we are able to increase substantially the funding per recruit that is available to forces for their initial police learning and development programmes. Some funding will remain with Centrex in 2006&#150;07 so that they can continue to deliver foundation

Each force, with the exception of the MPS (whose money for training is already included in their baseline funding, and who do not currently send recruits to Centrex for training), will receive &#163;3,000 per IPLDP recruit in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08. Payment will be made up to the level of recruits that each force needs to maintain their force strength at 31 March 2005.

We have therefore drawn together existing grants, including the provision for Dedicated Security Posts formerly in general grant, into a single consolidated grant for Counter Terrorism. We will be augmenting the amounts transferred from general grant for counter-terrorism and the increase will be announced shortly. Within the increase in general grant to police authorities in 2007&#150;08 we have made provision of &#163;25 million to enable authorities to enhance further their counter-terrorism capability.

On that basis we believe that we should continue to fund the service separately so that Parliament is assured that the MPS&#039;s national capabilities are effectively funded.

This will replace the present practice whereby each police authority is responsible for paying the pensions of its former employees on a &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; basis. The new system will eliminate the effect of the volatility resulting from significant fluctuations in the number of police officers retiring in any given year and consequently reduce cost pressures being passed on to council tax precepts. It will also introduce greater transparency by making clear the actual level of resources available for service delivery.

To create this central pension pot &#163;313 million for 2006&#150;07 and &#163;328 million for 2007&#150;08 has been held back from the funding settlement. The new arrangements will be cost neutral.

 On transition of the Forensic Science Service (FSS) from Trading Fund status to GovCo the Government will retain control of the National DNA Database (NDNAD). It is recognised to be a world leading crime intelligence database, and a key national criminal justice asset.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51205m05.html_para0"><a name="stpa_146">The standard setting and oversight of the National DNA Database, ensuring quality and integrity of the service, will be carried out by a dedicated unit initially in the Home Office, overseen by a tripartite board composed of the Home Office, ACPO and APA. We propose to increase Human Genetics Commission representation at board meetings from one to two to strengthen lay representation. Following initial consultation regarding established bio-medical ethics committees, it has been determined that a new and dedicated ethics group is required to provide independent oversight of Board decision-making. Plans for the creation of this group are being developed with Department of Health support. These transitional arrangements have been developed to improve the strength and transparency of NDNAD oversight.

The separation of operational service delivery from the governance and standard setting will enable value for money to be maximised, while the control of oversight within the public sector will be retained. Wider consultation will take place about the most effective long-term oversight of the National DNA Database and other national forensic databases, which should enhance public confidence in the safeguards and ethical controls which are being developed.

Friend, the Minister for Competitiveness who sat in the UK national seat, intervened briefly to stress that it was important to utilise the existing capabilities of GMES alongside developing new ones. The Council also held an exchange of views on international collaboration based on a discussion paper tabled jointly by the EU and ESA presidencies. The debate focused on: the need to develop an overall cooperation strategy; EU/ES A roles and responsibilities; and the financial principles that should apply in funding. The UK intervened briefly to support the development of a collaborative approach but noted that this should pay due consideration to Community competence. Vice-President Verheugen (Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry) and ESA Director-General Dordain provided an oral report to the Council on the progress of European space policy.
