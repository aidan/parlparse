 I am pleased to inform the House that the planned legal and capital restructuring of Northern Rock, as announced in my Written Ministerial Statement of 8 December 2009, successfully took effect on 1 January 2010. As a result, two new companies are now carrying out the business formerly carried out by Northern Rock-Northern Rock plc, a new savings and mortgage bank and Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc, the existing company (renamed) that holds and services the majority of the existing residential mortgage book.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="100125m0001.htm_para3"><a name="1001256000030">The Government's actions to stabilise Northern Rock over the past two years have protected the savings and deposits of hundreds of thousands of British families.

capital requirements. These amounts are within the £3 billion of capital support announced by the Government in August 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="100125m0001.htm_para6"><a name="1001256000033">The outstanding Government loan owed by Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc has been reduced by £12.6 billion, from £26.9 billion as at 31 December 2007 to £14.3 billion at 31 December 2009. The loan increased on 4 January 2010 by £8.5 billion, taking the outstanding loan balance to £22.8 billion, in order for Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc to finance the difference in mortgage assets and retail and wholesale deposit liabilities that were transferred to Northern Rock plc. As previously announced, Northern Rock plc will use the cash it has received from Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc to increase mortgage lending.</p>

This liquidity facility is similar to the working capital loan facility the Government have provided to Bradford &amp; Bingley plc. The Government expect the loan facilities to Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc to be repaid in full.</p>

The restructuring is also part of the Government's policy to encourage and support a well-functioning mortgage market, where lenders lend responsibly, and borrowers have access to a wide range of mortgages that they can afford to repay. At some point in the future, the Government will sell its stake in Northern Rock plc. In any sale, the objectives of the Government will be to promote competition for retail services, secure the best possible return to taxpayers and ensure that Northern Rock plc will continue to increase its lending to homeowners.</p>

Programme. The session opened with two presentations from UNEP and the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies. In discussions on international negotiations on mercury, the UK intervened to call on the EU to proceed with caution in seeking to broaden the scope of the legal instrument, in order not to stall the intergovernmental negotiating Committee process. In addition, several member states showed support for the UK view on the need to reform the current international environmental governance system. In relation to the sixth EAP, the UK indicated that any new framework must be based on a comprehensive assessment of where we are now, what will be the challenges of the next 10 years and what are the most appropriate mechanisms to address these challenges.</p>

The UK highlighted that it is in the EU's economic and environmental interests to show leadership, and the shared objective now should be to broaden, deepen and strengthen the commitments made in Copenhagen, and quickly to take forward the actions necessary to deliver the promises on finance that we made in the Accord. The EU should encourage more countries to associate themselves with the Accord, maintaining the momentum towards a legal framework. An exchange of views followed on the target that the EU should submit to the Accord appendix by January 31. The presidency concluded that while support was lacking for an unconditional offer of 30 per cent. the EU would need to find a formulation that underlined the EU's willingness to move to 30 per cent. in the right circumstances.</p>

 Today, I am laying before Parliament a draft Animal Health Bill that sets out major changes I am intending to implement on responsibility for, and management of, animal health in England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="100125m0001.htm_para17"><a name="1001256000048">The draft Bill would establish a new body in England, headed by an independent board and chair, with responsibility for animal health policy and its application; matters that currently rest with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The draft Bill draws upon extensive consultation over a number of years on the policy of responsibility and cost sharing for animal health. It is based on a partnership working approach that will be increasingly central to the development of animal health policy and the means by which it is carried out on the ground. This will enable the experience and expertise of those making a living in the livestock and other animal related sectors to contribute to the policies and decisions on animal health.</p>

We have received reports that other British nationals are missing but we do not have any further information at this stage.</p>

I pay tribute to the work of the Disaster Emergency Committee, their NGO members and the British public for this remarkable response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="100125m0001.htm_para27"><a name="1001256000086">The British Government have moved very quickly with our response. The UK search and rescue teams were in Haiti for over a week, carrying out their life saving work, including pulling three people from the rubble alive, arranging medical evacuations, treating the wounded and helping the United Nations co-ordinate the overall search and rescue effort. After consulting with the United Nations, we concluded that they had done all they could and that the rescue effort was moving on to another phase. The British team returned to the United Kingdom on Saturday 22 January, at the same time as other international search and rescue teams headed home. The United Kingdom should be incredibly proud of their efforts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="100125m0001.htm_para28"><a name="1001256000087">We have also committed £1 million for the International Federation of the Red Cross to provide food, shelter, water and other immediate needs for 20,000 families; £2 million for the World Food Programme for transport and logistics; £1 million to assist with aid co-ordination to ensure the right aid reaches those who need it quickly; £300,000 for the World Health Organisation for disease surveillance to help prevent epidemics and a further £2.5 million to NGOs with established operations on the ground- Oxfam, Action Against Hunger and Handicap International-to deliver clean water, shelter, medical care and food for 160,000 earthquake victims.</p>

The additional funding will enable our support to extend beyond immediate humanitarian relief. Over the next four or five days, we are sending a further three flights with non-food items such as shelter kits,  <br>

A team of three from the unit has already deployed with equipment including vehicles, field offices and communications equipment to support British efforts and strengthen co-ordination with other partners in Haiti.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="100125m0002.htm_para1"><a name="1001256000089">We have also taken the decision to deploy the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Largs Bay, to carry further vital relief goods. The ship is expected to depart by the end of the month and will help assure continuity of supply of vital goods such as food, shelter and medical supplies. Following a request from the United Nations it is expected to stay on to assist in distributing supplies around Haiti.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="100125m0002.htm_para2"><a name="1001256000090">We continue to support strengthened co-ordination by the United Nations and Government of Haiti. The United Nations Office for Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs has rapidly increased its staffing to co-ordinate relief on the ground. The humanitarian clusters are accelerating their work and we are exploring options for further help to the shelter clusters. The Prime Minister spoke with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last week and subsequently with President Obama to discuss how both countries could support the United Nations in their role. The Prime Minister welcomed the role played by President Clinton as UN Special Envoy to Haiti and that of Acting Special Representative Edmond Mullet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="100125m0002.htm_para3"><a name="1001256000091">The United States military is playing a crucial role in supporting the humanitarian effort, keeping the airport functioning, clearing the port, and enabling aid to get where it needs to. They are working well with the United Nations in support of the international relief effort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="100125m0002.htm_para4"><a name="1001256000092">Aid is now getting through to affected communities but the pace of delivery needs to be accelerated. So far, over 500,000 people have received assistance. By 22 January, there were over 120 water distribution points in Port-au-Prince. The Government of Haiti have identified six formalised settlements to house 120,000 people and work has started to build them. Medical provision is also improving, and the United Nations has announced that there are now enough doctors and surgeons in the country. There are at least nine field hospitals operational in Haiti as well as a 1,000-bed hospital ship and six more on the way. The Department for International Development provided funding for an assessment team and specialised surgical team from Merlin that are now working on the ground in Port-au-Prince.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="100125m0002.htm_para5"><a name="1001256000093">More still needs to be done. A shortage of trucks and fuel, exacerbated by the airport's limited capacity to receive, warehouse, and dispatch relief supplies, continues to hamper relief efforts in and around Port-au-Prince. Over 200,000 people have left Port-au-Prince for other parts of Haiti and as many as 800,000 people are believed to be reliant on temporary shelters. Our early contribution to the World Food Programme for logistical support has helped, and RFA Largs Bay will transport more trucks to help with aid distribution. Ministers are liaising at the highest level with the relevant authorities to unblock bottlenecks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="100125m0002.htm_para7"><a name="1001256000095">We continue to follow the security situation very closely, both for our teams and for the wider operation, and share the concerns expressed by the United Nations that the relatively stable situation could deteriorate. Following Security Council Resolution 1908 to bolster the Haitian peacekeeping mission with an additional 2,000 troops and 1,500 police, we congratulate countries offering additional personnel and urge the speedy deployment of these peacekeepers in their humanitarian role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="100125m0002.htm_para8"><a name="1001256000096">Once the relief phase is over, it is essential that the international community does not forget about Haiti. We welcome the efforts multilaterals are already making to support the recovery and reconstruction. We expect our contribution to be through our very substantial support to multilaterals and we are looking urgently at ways of providing longer-term support for Haiti through the European Commission, the World Bank and other multilaterals. To this end, the European Union Foreign Affairs Council meeting of Development Ministers on Monday 18 January pledged longer-term reconstruction funding as well as significant funding for humanitarian support. And today, member countries from the long established grouping "The Friends of Haiti" will meet in Montreal to start the planning process for a major conference in the spring on post-emergency reconstruction which we fully expect to attend. Leading multilaterals will also attend the Montreal meeting, and the United Kingdom will be represented by the European Union delegation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="100125m0002.htm_para9"><a name="1001256000097">Going forward, it is clear that Haiti will need grant assistance and development support for the foreseeable future, and on terms consistent with its future debt sustainability. The United Kingdom has already cancelled all debts owed by Haiti as part of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative in June 2009. We will continue to play our part in responding to the short and long-term needs of the Haitian people.</p>
