 The Economic and Financial Affairs Council will be held on 27 February in Brussels. The items on the agenda are as follows:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="70226m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07022615000014">Implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact</p>

The UK supports a prudent interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) which takes into account the level of debt, the influence of the cycle and the level of public investment, and ensures that any recommendations reflect each Member State&#146;s economic position.</p>

 I have today issued an intervention notice under section 42(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 in respect of British Sky Broadcasting Group's acquisition of a 17.9 per cent. stake in ITV plc. In accordance with Section 44A of the Enterprise Act, Ofcom will now investigate public interest issues that may arise as a result of this transaction and report to me by 27 April. In accordance with Section 44 of the Act, the Office of Fair Trading will report to me on the competition effects of the transaction by the same date.</p>

However, having given careful consideration to the provisions of the relevant legislation and to the representations I have received, both from the parties directly concerned and from interested third parties, I believe that, in this case, it is appropriate for me to use the mechanism established by the Communications Act 2003 to ask Ofcom to conduct an initial investigation into the public interest issues that may be raised by this transaction.</p>

Formal advice from Ofcom will enable me to make a properly informed decision on whether the transaction should be referred to the Competition Commission for fuller investigation. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) announced on 12 January 2007 its provisional view that a relevant merger situation may have been created for the purposes of the Enterprise Act 2002 as a result of British Sky Broadcasting Group acquiring material influence over ITV plc. The OFT will report to the Secretary of State on 27 April on this and other competition issues raised by the transaction.</p>

The review document which is jointly promoted by DFT, the Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly Government, fulfils the commitment in the March 2000 White Paper<i></i>&#147;Tomorrow's Roads&#151;safer for everyone&#148; to formally review our approach every three years.</p>
