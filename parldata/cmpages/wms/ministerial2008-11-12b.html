<p><a name="st_92"><a name="08111232000017"><a name="81112m0001.htm_spmin2"><a name="08111232000066"><b>The Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):</b>
 Last autumn the Government announced details of the biggest sustained programme of capital investment in schools for over 50 years. Annual capital investment in schools was just under &#163;700 million in 1996-97. By 2011 it is set to rise to &#163;8.2 billion; representing a sevenfold real-terms increase. This unprecedented investment has helped address a significant backlog of work going back over many decades as well as supporting hundreds of new-build schools, including 740 primary schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="81112m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08111232000018">In recent years the emphasis has shifted towards a strategic approach which requires local authorities to consider their whole schools estate and take a long-term view about how capital investment can support wider transformation of teaching and learning; starting with those most in need. Building Schools for the Future was launched in 2004 with the long-term aim of rebuilding or refurbishing all secondary schools. The first completed new built schools came on stream in 2007-08.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="81112m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08111232000019">Plans for an equally transformational approach to capital investment in primary schools were first announced in 2005. Following an overwhelmingly positive response to consultation in March 2006, the programme got under way with 23 pathfinder authorities in 2007. It will be rolled out nationally to all local authorities from 1 April 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="81112m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08111232000020">The Primary Capital Programme challenges local authorities to think long-term and strategically about teaching and learning in primary schools in the 21st century and how capital investment can support wider transformation. It commits to renewing at least half of all primary school buildings by 2022-23, creating primary schools that are equipped for 21st century learning, at the heart of their communities, with children&#146;s services in reach of every family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="81112m0001.htm_para3"><a name="08111232000021">This marks the start of a &#163;7 billion programme of investment in primary schools. It will be kick-started by &#163;1.75 billion of new capital investment from April 2009. This represents a major injection of new capital investment that will not only benefit children and families but will also provide a welcome boost for the construction industry and local businesses who will be crucial to delivering the new and refurbished primary schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="81112m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08111232000022">Local authorities were advised by the Department last autumn of their indicative share of this funding. To access funding, they were required to prepare and agree with the Department &#147;A Primary Strategy for Change&#148;. The Department issued comprehensive guidance on the content of these strategic plans in December 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="81112m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08111232000023">All strategies have now been rigorously assessed against the detailed requirements set out in the guidance. The overall picture is encouragingly positive, giving confidence that the transformational objectives of the programme will be delivered. Collectively, local authorities are planning to start projects at more than 1,500 schools over the next three years. Following assessment local authorities were placed in one of three categories;</p>

death of Victoria Climbi&#233; we introduced fundamental reforms to help keep children safe. Local areas are also now required to review every case where a child is harmed or killed, and neglect or abuse is suspected.

Lord Laming expects to submit his findings early next year.</p>

 After thorough consideration of 193 applications made in the 25th offshore oil and gas licensing round, I have decided to offer 171 production licences. This makes the 25th offshore oil and gas licensing round one of the most successful since offshore licensing began in 1964. This demonstrates the continuing attractiveness both of the UK continental shelf as an oil and gas producing province and of DECC&#146;s licensing system.</p>
