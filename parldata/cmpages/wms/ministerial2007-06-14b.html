<p><a name="st_36"><a name="07061428000015"><a name="70614m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="07061428000174"><b>The Minister for Immigration and Asylum (Mr. Liam Byrne):</b>
 I am today placing in the Library copies of the report &#147;A review of the failure of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate to consider some foreign national prisoners for deportation&#148;, conducted by Stuart Hyde, former Senior Director for Enforcement and Compliance, now Assistant Chief Constable in the West Midlands Police, together with the first annual business plan of the Border and Immigration Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="70614m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07061428000016">In addition, the Chief Executive of the Border and Immigration Agency, Lin Homer, has today written to the Home Affairs Select Committee providing them with a breakdown of the most accurate and robust information currently available to the Department of progress in considering the 1,013 foreign national prisoners released without deportation consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="70614m0001.htm_para1"><a name="07061428000017">The annual business plan, together with the Action Plan on the Hyde Report sets out the progress the Border and Immigration Agency has made over the last 12 months and the further reforms required by Ministers for the year ahead. I am grateful to the staff of the Border and Immigration Agency for their work over the last year and their ambition for further progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="70614m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07061428000018">I can also update the House today on progress made in response to the Home Secretary's eight priority areas set out on 23 May 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="70614m0001.htm_para3"><a name="07061428000019">First, the Home Secretary identified the issue that there was no unique personal identifier for individuals who come in to contact with the criminal justice, immigration and asylum systems and asked officials to explain how this could change. Secondly, he identified that there was no legal obligation on people who are suspected, charged or convicted to declare their nationality. To address this, the Chief Executive of the Border and Immigration Agency has, in collaboration with the Metropolitan Police, designed new ways of working which are now being tested. Nationality is verified at the point of charge and from that point, the Police National Computer number is used as a unique number identifying the individual as they pass through the criminal justice system. We continue to assess this as the pilot progresses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="70614m0001.htm_para4"><a name="07061428000020">Thirdly, the Home Secretary said that all future instructions should be given to all agencies of the criminal justice system and be consistent and fully implemented. I can confirm to the House that new instructions have been issued to all agencies. Guidance is continually reviewed and the Border and Immigration Agency now continues to work in partnership with criminal justice agencies to ensure consistency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="70614m0001.htm_para5"><a name="07061428000021">Action point four identified that the criteria under which individuals should be considered for deportation were not clear. Policy officials were ordered to audit trail all policy criteria and the process by which they ensure that guidance is both clear and consistently applied. I can confirm to the House that this has been undertaken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="70614m0001.htm_para6"><a name="07061428000022">Fifthly, the Home Secretary asked that deportation decisions be made according to the most robust interpretation of the requirements of our international obligations. The UK Borders Bill now proposes a new link between criminality and deportation in the way that we want and the public would expect. That legislation is currently being steered through Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="70614m0001.htm_para7"><a name="07061428000023">Managers were instructed under action point six to work with colleagues in Scotland and Northern Ireland to audit the numbers of foreign national prisoners released in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Home Secretary asked that clear procedures for dealing with prisoners held in Scotland and Northern Ireland were written and followed. I can confirm that this has been undertaken, and officials assure me it is operating well. They have further assured me that no foreign prisoner is released from prison in Scotland and Northern Ireland without their deportation case being considered. The Border and Immigration Agency continues to work closely with our Scottish and Northern Irish colleagues to ensure this is kept under review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="70614m0001.htm_para8"><a name="07061428000024">Seventhly, the Home Secretary explained that historically there have never been systematic arrangements in place for collecting information on mentally disordered offenders. He also explained in May last year that this is a hugely difficult group to deal with. Taking in to consideration the very specific circumstances of these individuals, officials have assured me that no Mentally Disordered Offender is removed from restriction without being considered for deportation. There is now a dedicated case working team in place in the Border and Immigration Agency's Criminal Casework Directorate to assess this particular group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="70614m0001.htm_para9"><a name="07061428000025">Finally, the Home Secretary asked that arrangements were enhanced to facilitate the return of prisoners earlier in their sentence, including prisoner transfer agreements. The Border and Immigration Agency has launched a scheme, which I announced on 9 October 2006, the Facilitated Returns Scheme, to incentivise prisoners to go home sooner, whether time-served, under the Early Removal Scheme, or under a Prisoner Transfer Agreement. The scheme has been very successful in returning more foreign national prisoners home and continues to do so.</p>

On December 14 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, House of Lords, column 117WS, volume 428, I announced that the cost of running the Supreme Court would be approximately &#163;8.4 million per annum at 2004-05 prices. This would be the equivalent of &#163;10.4 million at 2010-2011 prices, the first full year of the Supreme Court's operations.

Our estimate of the running costs is &#163;12.3 million per annum at 2010-11 prices and is set out in the table.</p>

2007. The number of Crown Court sitting days in London has not been affected by the closure and work undertaken by the courts is now allocated to nearby court centres. In December 2006, following a successful appeal, the Department obtained planning consent for the construction of additional courtrooms at the Isleworth Crown Court Centre. The additional courtrooms will replace the loss in overall capacity by the closure of the Middlesex Guildhall. We are currently in commercial negotiations with Geoffrey Osborne (Building) over the plans and costs for the development at Isleworth. Our current plans are to commence construction in summer 2007 and open the new courts in the spring of 2009.&#148;</p>

 In my statement of 20 July 2006, <i>Official Report</i>, column 56-57WS I announced that the Government had accepted the broad thrust of the independent review of Airport Policing by Stephen Boys Smith and outlined some of the report&#146;s key recommendations. I also made a commitment to make a further statement in due course about progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="70614m0002.htm_para12"><a name="07061428000155">The report&#146;s recommendations focused on how police and the aviation industry&#146;s security activities could be better harmonised to improve effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, how to achieve an appropriate balance between the various stakeholders for delivering all aspects of security at airports was considered. The Government fully accept that any policing element of airport security should be transparent and understood as part of a wider package of security measures at airports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="70614m0002.htm_para13"><a name="07061428000156">We have welcomed stakeholders&#146; general support of the report&#146;s diagnosis and their endorsement of its conclusions about the need to define agency accountability; to enhance liaison between stakeholders at all levels; and to further develop the Multi-Agency Threat and Risk Assessment (MATRA) approach that is already in place at airports. All stakeholders recognise the fundamental need for clarity, transparency and agreement of their roles and responsibilities in the complete security package at airports. There has also been wide support for the conclusion that the system of designation be discontinued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="70614m0002.htm_para14"><a name="07061428000157">However, the Government do not underestimate concerns about the detail of possible solutions, in  <br>

particular the identification and calculation of any policing costs to be borne by the industry; the ability of industry to recover agreed costs from passengers; and the affordability of those costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="70614m0002.htm_para15"><a name="07061428000158">Since the report was concluded, constructive dialogue has been ongoing between national representatives of industry, the police and police authorities and Government. A shared security vision for UK airports has been agreed along with the principles to be used to develop the airport security plans to achieve that vision. We welcome the greater mutual awareness, trust and commitment demonstrated by all stakeholders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="70614m0002.htm_para16"><a name="07061428000159">Two key areas of work have been identified to be tackled nationally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="70614m0002.htm_para17"><a name="07061428000160">First, MATRA remains strongly recommended best practice for all airports. We maintain that such joint agency consideration of threat and risk should be the cornerstone for current and future security activity at airports. BAA and the Metropolitan Police Authority are working together at Heathrow Airport to enhance their MATRA and to develop a shared multi-agency airport security plan. More generally for all airports, work is already underway to deliver national threat assessments to airports so that all suitably security cleared MATRA members can evaluate the security situation from the same knowledge basis. It is acknowledged by all stakeholders that an enhanced MATRA process may identify improved options for tackling particular security issues. Some of these may need to be delivered by the police but it is recognised that a dedicated and permanent police presence may not be required at some airports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="70614m0002.htm_para18"><a name="07061428000161">Secondly, existing legislation is being reviewed to clarify the current responsibilities of stakeholders for security at airports to assist in resolving areas of disagreement. We are taking that work forward as quickly as possible with the agencies concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="70614m0002.htm_para19"><a name="07061428000162">Separately, complementary legislation has been introduced requiring aerodrome managers and police at designated airports to agree necessary dedicated policing resources and to clarify what the cost to the aerodrome manager should be. This is then set out in a Police Services Agreement (PSA). Some airports already have, or have had, service level agreements in place and it may be deemed by the parties to them that they remain fit for purpose and contain the requisite information to comply with the Civil Aviation Act 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="70614m0002.htm_para20"><a name="07061428000163">All this work is being drawn together to clarify the security responsibilities of all stakeholders at all airports and create the clear and transparent funding process recommended by the review. No legislative changes can be made until that work is complete but we are working to identify a suitable parliamentary opportunity for this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="70614m0002.htm_para21"><a name="07061428000164">Although the review did not focus on airport security, it was an examination of a key element in the protection of our airports against a range of threats. It is naturally not a report for public disclosure, however I will make another statement providing further updates in due course.</p>
