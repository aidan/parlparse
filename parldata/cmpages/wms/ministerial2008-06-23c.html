<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="80623m0001.htm_para11"><a name="0806238000019">Ministers agreed Council conclusions, which the Government support, reiterating the EU&#146;s commitment to the Western Balkans&#146; European perspective and encouraging the countries of that region to meet the necessary conditions. The Council also condemned the violence during the 1 June elections in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), and regretted shortcomings in the conduct of those elections. It called on the authorities to investigate these incidents and take appropriate action.</p>

The Council encouraged BiH to sustain the reform momentum by implementing the agreement and the priorities set out in its European partnership. Ministers further welcomed visa liberalisation roadmaps setting out requirements for Western Balkans countries working towards visa-free travel to the Schengen area. These do not impact on the UK, which is not a party to the Schengen agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="80623m0001.htm_para19"><a name="0806238000027">International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Ocampo briefed Ministers on the ICC&#146;s activities concerning Sudan. Ministers adopted Council conclusions that reiterated the EU&#146;s support for the work of the ICC, deeply deplored the Government of Sudan&#146;s continued non co-operation with the ICC and noted that the Council stood ready to consider measures against individuals responsible for not co-operating, should the obligation under the UNSC Resolution 1593 on co-operation with the ICC continue to be disregarded. The conclusions expressed concern over the recent fighting between north and south Sudan armed forces in the disputed border region of Abyei, welcomed the Abyei Roadmap agreed on 8 June, and called on both sides to fulfil the obligations under the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA). The conclusions condemned the justice and equality movement&#146;s attack on Omdurman on 10 May; reiterated the Council&#146;s readiness to take further measures against any party impeding UNAMID, obstructing humanitarian access, or failing to constructively engage in the Darfur political process; and called on the Governments of Chad and Sudan to adhere to the Dakar agreement.</p>
