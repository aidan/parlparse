<p><a name="st_8"><a name="09031266000023"><a name="90312m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="09031266000113"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Sarah McCarthy-Fry):</b>
 The schools admissions code has transformed the admissions system. We have outlawed unfair and covert admission practices which disadvantaged low-income families and increased social segregation. We have extended the role of the independent schools adjudicator allowing him to look into any admission arrangements that parents feel are unfair or overly complicated as well as requiring him to monitor compliance and report annually to the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09031266000024">The Information as to Provision of Education (England) Regulations 2008 require local authorities (LAs) to submit data to the Department on how many families received an offer of a place at one of their preferred secondary schools. This year on Monday 2 March, almost 547,000 families were advised at which secondary school their child was being offered a place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09031266000025">Today we are publishing validated data, based on returns from 149 LAs, showing that across the country 83.2 per cent. of families received an offer at their first preference school. This is an increase of 1.1 percentage points on last year&#146;s figures. A further 8.4 per cent. of families were offered a place at their second preference school and, in total, 94.6 per cent. were offered a place at one of their three preferred schools. I am placing a copy of these data in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09031266000026">There is considerable variation nationally. Outside London, 86 per cent. of parents were offered a place in their first preference school. For Greater London, this figure is 66 per cent. However across London, over 93 per cent. of pupils have been offered a place at one of their chosen schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09031266000027">Parents have the right of appeal against any application that has been turned down; and over the summer, local authorities and schools will be re-allocating places where others have moved address or chosen a different education for their child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para4"><a name="09031266000028">Parents now have a fairer choice because of our action to enforce the code, and also more real choice because there has been a transformation in the quality of our state schools. More schools are judged by Ofsted as outstanding and more than 78,000 more young people are leaving school with five good GCSEs including English and mathematics than did so 10 years ago. In 1998, there were 1,600 schools where fewer than 30 per cent. of children achieved five or more good GCSEs including English and mathematics. Now there are just 440 below this minimum standard, and our national challenge programme is working to ensure that all schools reach this standard by 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para5"><a name="09031266000029">We are continuing to look at ways to improve the admissions system. The Secretary of State has recently asked the independent schools adjudicator to report on how admissions authorities are using random allocation.</p>

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="09031266000030"><a name="90312m0001.htm_spmin1"><a name="09031266000114"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Mr. Sadiq Khan):</b>
 Today my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government is publishing the East Midlands Regional Plan (Regional Spatial Strategy) (RSS) for the East Midlands which covers the period 2006-2026. Also published are the final Sustainability Appraisal and Habitats Regulations Assessment plus other supporting documents. This replaces RSS8 (issued in March 2005) with the exception of part of the Milton Keynes and South Midlands sub-regional strategy which remains extant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para6"><a name="09031266000031">The regional spatial strategy forms part of the statutory development plan for every local authority in the East Midlands and sets the framework for the production of local development frameworks and local transport plans. It provides the spatial plan for the development of the region, and the policy framework for employment, housing, transport and the environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para7"><a name="09031266000032">The existing strategy (RSS 8), which is replaced today, was published in March 2005. The draft revision of the RSS was submitted to Government in September 2006 by the East Midlands regional assembly. It was tested by an examination in public lasting eight weeks during summer 2007 and the panel report was published in November 2007. Proposed changes were published on 22 July 2008 followed by a 12-week public consultation ending on October 17. We received 2,549 comments from 735 respondents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09031266000033">We have carefully examined all the responses. The result is that we have rebased the housing figures from 2006 rather than 2001 to bring the plan more up to date. We have defined total housing provision for all authorities (apart from Northamptonshire where figures were not subject to review), setting out the total that local authorities need to plan for up to 2026. Responding to representations we have removed the five-year phasing of the housing provision which was introduced in the proposed changes and we have responded to the concerns of local authorities around Nottingham by reducing the level of increase for the city and adjusting the balance of numbers required between urban and rural areas for the suburban authorities, which reflect their concerns about land availability. Total provision in the Lincolnshire coastal districts of East Lindsey, Boston and South Holland remains limited and will be reviewed after a coastal strategy has been completed. A small adjustment to remove some double counting in the Leicestershire area has also been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para9"><a name="09031266000034">The result is a total provision of 430,300 dwellings over the plan period, compared to 408,360 at the draft stage and 434,094 at proposed changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09031266000035">We have made some minor amendments to the text to clarify the position on climate change measures for local authorities who do not have an up to date development plan document. We believe this clarification will reduce the risk of confusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para11"><a name="09031266000036">We have also made some changes to the pitch requirement figures for gypsies, travellers and showpeople, which clarify the timescales and remove some errors in the use of gypsy and traveller accommodation assessments.</p>

 The UK&#146;s chemical protection programme is designed to protect against the use of chemical weapons. Such a programme is permitted by the chemical weapons convention, with which the United Kingdom is fully compliant. Under the terms of the convention, we are required to provide information annually to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). In accordance with the Government&#146;s commitment to openness, I am placing in the House of Commons Library a copy of the summary that has been provided to the organisation outlining the UK&#146;s chemical protection programme in 2008.</p>

 Today I am publishing the third consultation on the Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para14"><a name="09031266000041">The Climate Change Act, which received Royal Assent in November last year, set legally binding targets for the UK to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent. by 2050.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para15"><a name="09031266000042">To meet this target, the Climate Change Act provided powers to create emissions trading schemes. The CRC will be the first scheme created under these powers. We have worked closely with the devolved Administrations in developing a scheme that will work across the UK. We believe the CRC will be the world&#146;s first mandatory carbon dioxide emissions trading scheme to auction all allowances. It will cover large non-energy intensive organisations from both the public and private sector such as all British central government departments, supermarkets, banks, local authorities, the National Health Service and universities. The sectors of the economy covered by the CRC account for approximately 10 per cent. of the UK&#146;s emissions. The CRC will start in 2010 and after a three year introductory phase we will introduce a declining cap on the amount of carbon this sector of the economy can emit. Government will take the views of the independent Committee on Climate Change into account when setting the cap to ensure that  <br>

the environmental goals of the scheme will be met. The CRC is expected to deliver emissions savings of at least 4 million tonnes of C0<sup>(2)</sup> per year by 2020.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para16"><a name="09031266000043">By harnessing financial and reputational drivers, the CRC will encourage participating organisations to use energy more efficiently, thereby reducing their energy costs and saving up to &#163;1 billion by 2020. We expect that the market for energy efficient technology and energy services to grow in response to the CRC, spurring innovation and helping to lay the foundations for new, low carbon economic growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para17"><a name="09031266000044">We have worked closely with stakeholders in business and the public sector to develop the scheme, and have consulted twice on the scheme design and implementation. The CRC will capture a diverse range of organisations, and so we have listened to the perspectives and experiences expressed - and these have been critical to the development of the scheme. I therefore believe that the CRC will successfully drive improvements in energy efficiency in a large sector of the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para18"><a name="09031266000045">I have today placed in the Libraries of the House, and published on the Department of Energy and Climate Change website, a consultation package on the draft CRC Order, which will form the statutory basis of the scheme. This includes the CRC consultation document, the CRC Draft Order, the CRC User Guide and a Regulatory Impact Assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para19"><a name="09031266000046">The consultation document:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para20"><a name="09031266000047">I have also launched today a review of Climate Change Agreements (CCAs). The current scheme ends in 2013 and, subject to state aid approval, the scheme will be extended to 2017. CCAs have been highly successful in reducing emissions in the energy intensive sector. In 2006, the latest period for which information is available, sectors saved 16.4 million tonnes of C0<sup>(2)</sup> and an estimated &#163;1.5 billion in energy costs, when measured against baselines. This review provides an opportunity to simplify the agreements for the benefit of business and Government, and to ensure coherence with other climate change policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="90312m0001.htm_para21"><a name="09031266000048">The proposals in these consultation documents will help us reduce the carbon emissions from these sectors of the economy in the most cost-effective way possible. They will bring us one step closer to our goal of creating a thriving low carbon economy.</p>

Each control order is kept under regular review to ensure that obligations remain necessary and proportionate. The Home Office continues to hold control order review groups (CORGs) every quarter, with representation from law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to keep the obligations in every control order under regular and formal review and to facilitate a review of appropriate exit strategies. The CORGs for this quarter fall outside of this reporting period and will be covered in the next report.

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="09031266000090"><a name="90312m0002.htm_spmin3"><a name="09031266000123"><b>The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</b>
 I would like to update the House on the process carried out to deal with the coldest winter the UK has faced for almost 20 years and in particular the heavy snowfalls experienced in early February across large parts of the UK, and how the Government propose to work with partners to identify and address the lessons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="90312m0002.htm_para19"><a name="09031266000091">First, I want to thank all of those who worked very hard in the transport sector and beyond over the last few weeks to minimise the disruption that was caused by the recent severe weather. Many people worked long hours throughout the period to maintain vital road and rail links, to keep airports open, to provide a whole range of essential services and to mine and deliver new supplies of salt for treating our roads. I am pleased that this hard work kept the country functioning during that recent period of severe weather and its aftermath.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="90312m0002.htm_para20"><a name="09031266000092">The heavy snowfall had an impact on all parts of our transport systems. The robust efforts of the Highways Agency allowed the strategic road network in England  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="12 Mar 2009">

<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>12 Mar 2009 : Column 30WS</b><br>
to remain operational over the whole period and, although there were some closures due to road traffic accidents, they were cleared as quickly as was possible given the conditions. In cities, very heavy snowfalls created conditions which made driving very hazardous and&#151;at their worst&#151;led to the suspension of public transport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="90312m0002.htm_para21"><a name="09031266000093">On the main rail network, again, most train operating companies were able to continue running services&#151;albeit, on occasion, services were disrupted, in particular services from the south of London into London were particularly disrupted from 2 February by the snow because of the use of the third rail to power the trains. Further snow later that week caused more problems for routes into London from the north and services across the south-west. In the following week, further snowfalls across the midlands, the east and the north caused further disruption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="90312m0002.htm_para22"><a name="09031266000094">Across the country, the weather had a significant impact on the national road network. Some parts of the national infrastructure, such as the Severn crossing and sections of road such as the A38 near Exeter, were particularly affected. I am grateful to the efforts of the authorities who were able to restore these to running efficiently, through hard work and a prudent management of the risks involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="90312m0002.htm_para23"><a name="09031266000095">The weather also posed operational challenges to UK airports. Operations were on occasions suspended, with problems on public transport and local roads making it more difficult for travellers to get to and from the airports. Regional airports and those in the south-east of England responded admirably. The impact of the snow was particularly significant at Heathrow, where the fact that the airport is currently running at 99 per cent. capacity, has shown both the creativity and resilience of the airport operator, and the need for further runway capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="90312m0002.htm_para24"><a name="09031266000096">The cold spell presented challenges to both the Highways Agency and transport authorities around the country who needed reliable supplies of salt to keep roads flowing smoothly. Stocks of salt were heavily called upon. Salt stocks around the country varied significantly as local highway authorities had made different decisions about the levels of reserve required. Some local authorities chose to keep very high level of stocks, running as high as 25 days in some case; whereas others chose to operate with leaner reserves. While the latter approach is of course appropriate in a normal year, it does leave the relevant authorities exposed to abnormal weather events. As a result, in some cases stocks of salt became very low.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="90312m0002.htm_para25"><a name="09031266000097">The Government and in particular the Highway Agency took a lead role in helping those local highway authorities who experienced difficulties with shortfalls in their salt levels. Mutual aid between authorities and with the Highways Agency helped to make sure that traffic kept flowing smoothly. For example, the Highways Agency stepped in to ensure salt deliveries over the weekend of 7 and 8 February at a time when salt suppliers would not normally have made deliveries. The Highways Agency were also flexible in running down its stocks to help prioritise supplies to local authorities with very low reserves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="90312m0002.htm_para26"><a name="09031266000098">The UK has, of course, not seen snow falls like early February for at least 18 years. The good news is that no highway authorities ran out of salt. The fall-back measures on the whole worked, and worked well, but we need to make sure we address those aspects that did not go well.</p>
