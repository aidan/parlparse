 On current plans, the Queen Elizabeth (QE) class aircraft carriers do not have an electro-magnetic catapult system in their design, as their initial configuration is for the operation of Short Take Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) aircraft. The US has developed the Electro-Magnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) for their CVN-78 programme. The adaptable nature of the QE class design would enable the fitting of an electro-magnetic catapult in the future, should that become a UK requirement; this would be capable of launching a number of aircraft types, including the Rafale M.</p>

 It has never been the case that convictions have been based solely on the DNA evidence, including that obtained through the low copy number technique.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="100909w0001.htm_para66"><a name="10090912000661">In November 2006 the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) set up a multi-agency group to consider and oversee reanalysis of all low copy number samples analysed by the Forensic Science Service prior to September 2005. This was referred to as Operation Cube. Under this operation the police service and FSS Ltd identified 4,841 samples that required re-analysis. The FSS undertook this work, free of charge, and 885 new DNA profiles were obtained. These profiles related to 342 criminal investigations across a range of crime. The results of the re analysis have been reported to police forces and they have taken action based on these results. There were 15 cases with the potential for new and significant lines of inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="100909w0001.htm_para67"><a name="10090912000662">Only two of the 15 cases have resulted in prosecution and conviction. In both cases the reanalysed DNA evidence was made available to the defence. But in neither case did DNA play a significant part. One conviction was quashed under appeal, through evidence unconnected to DNA. An appeal in the other case was unsuccessful and I am advised that, although the DNA analysis reinforced earlier findings, the DNA evidence as a whole had a very limited impact upon the judgment. In one other case, the reanalysis led to the elimination of persons previously suspected of, but not charged with, the crime.</p>

 In my written statement of 20 July, <i> Official Report</i>, column 9WS, I reported on the findings of an independent review of the Rural Payments Agency. That statement also set out my priorities for future action in meeting the agency's key challenge, namely to deliver a better quality of service, while reducing operating costs so that both farmers and taxpayers get a better deal. Subsequently, an interim chief executive (Richard Judge) has been appointed and he attended the first meeting of the new Agency Oversight Board that I chaired on 9 August. Through that Board I will be working to ensure that the independent review recommendations are carefully considered and action is taken.</p>

 The continued detention of Aung San Suu Kyi, who has spent 15 of the last 21 years as a prisoner, is a deliberate policy by the military regime to isolate her from her supporters and to prevent a legitimate expression of the will of the people of Burma. Her sham trial in 2009, which extended her house arrest by a further 18 months, highlights the regime's fear of her influence as a credible political leader. The Minister of State, Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton Dean (Jeremy Browne) raised Burma at the EU-ASEAN meeting on 26 May 2010, at which the Burmese Foreign Minister was present. He made clear that the continued detention of political prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi is unacceptable. Our ambassador in Rangoon repeatedly raises the need for the release of all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, with ministers in the Burmese military government and will continue to do so.</p>

 The Government firmly support EU membership for all the countries of the Western Balkans region, once they meet the EU's robust membership criteria. Enlargement of the EU will help to create stability, security and prosperity across Europe on a firm foundation of democracy, the rule of law and shared values. The prospect of EU membership is an opportunity for the governments and citizens of the Western Balkans to entrench stability and prosperity and turn the page on the difficult chapters of the past. It requires concrete steps to meet the criteria set by the EU in a genuine merit-based process.</p>

 We continue to be greatly concerned about Iran's nuclear programme. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has issued a number of reports on Iran, all making clear that Iran had shown no sign of suspending its enrichment-related activities and continued to stockpile uranium, as required by six UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) and numerous IAEA resolutions. The estimates in his May 2010 report showed Iran had produced 2,427 kg of low enriched uranium since the start of operations in February 2007, and that Iran had also produced a total of 5.7 kg of uranium enriched to nearly 20%, a significant step towards weapons grade enrichment.</p>

 The Government's main policy objective in relation to the coal industry is to ensure that the United Kingdom and the European Union are enabled to make best use of a valuable natural resource which continues to make an important contribution to security of energy supplies, where it is economically viable and environmentally acceptable to do so.</p>

It also introduced investment aid to support qualifying projects to maintain access to reserves at potentially viable mines; such projects remain ineligible for support under the general state aid regime.</p>

This is because, in broad terms, coal produced by mines receiving closure aid merely displaces coal which would otherwise be imported to meet overall demand; and because emissions from coal used for energy production, industrial processes, etc., whatever its origin, are subject to existing EU legislation (e.g. LCPD) and the EU Emissions-Trading System.</p>

 Given that the Kyoto Protocol is an already-established legally-binding framework, the EU, and therefore the UK, has already adopted all the requirements in EU law for the next commitment period of the Protocol. Continuing with the KP approach for a second commitment period would therefore not have any implications for the UK. However, certain elements of the KP are likely to change as the current round of United Nations Framework convention on Climate Change negotiations progresses. Particularly, the mitigation target to which the UK is subject is likely to be higher than in the first commitment period, though ultimately the level will depend on the outcome of the negotiations.</p>

<i> [holding answer 8 September 2010]:</i> DECC officials maintain an oversight of developments in future reactor designs and thorium continues to be a possibility for use as a fuel in nuclear power reactors. This involves the Department working with technical experts both from industry and academia and in this respect I am making arrangements to host a meeting with Professor Ian Fells to explore topics of this nature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="100909w0002.htm_para53"><a name="10090917000122">Ultimately it is for the industry to propose what type of fuel to use in any future nuclear reactors, the designs of which would be subject to independent regulatory assessment and acceptance. At present the UK safety and environment regulators are undertaking a generic design assessment process on two new nuclear reactor designs that use uranium oxide fuel. No proposals have been made for reactor designs using thorium-based nuclear fuel, but we would of course consider a proposal if one was to come forward.</p>

 This Government are committed to supporting people with learning disabilities and in particular to improving health outcomes of people with learning disabilities. As our White Paper for the national health service makes clear, this Government's ambition is for health outcomes-and quality health services-as good as any in the world. And that means we are committed to providing a high quality service for everyone-especially those who are more disadvantaged and have experienced real inequity in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="100909w0002.htm_para69"><a name="10090917000182">Like all other patients, people with learning disabilities will be at the heart of everything. They will have more choice and control to shape health services around them, enabled by easy access to the information they need and want. They (or their families and advocates) will be involved in decisions about their care and we expect NHS professionals to ensure that they fully involve people with learning disabilities and their family carers and enable them to be part of that decision-making process.</p>

We intend that GP consortia will be responsible for commissioning the majority of NHS services, including elective hospital care and rehabilitative care, urgent and emergency care (including out-of hours services), most community health services and mental health and specialist learning disability services. Consortia will be responsible for meeting prescribing and associated costs. It will be for consortia to decide on a case-by- case basis whether to commission services themselves, or to make appropriate arrangements with another commissioning organisation (for instance a lead consortium). The NHS Commissioning Board will develop a commissioning outcomes framework which measures health outcomes. The Government are considering how the outcomes framework will measure improved health outcomes, including for people with learning disabilities.</p>

Staff in all GP practices delivering annual health checks have had training in meeting the needs of people with learning disabilities.

 The Centre for Disability Research (2008) predicted a sustained increase in the number of people with learning disabilities known to services, from 2009 to 2026. The research detailed a number of scenarios, based on expected levels of need and anticipated levels of eligibility criteria in local authorities. All scenarios suggest sustained growth in the need for social care services for adults with learning disabilities over the full time period. However, average estimated annual increases vary from 1.04% (lower estimate, services are only provided to new entrants with critical or substantial needs) to 7.94% (upper estimate, services are provided to new entrants with critical, substantial or moderate needs).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="100909w0002.htm_para78"><a name="10090917000197">The impact of these increases upon future funding requirements will depend on the ability of the social care system to deliver efficiency savings through a range of measures-including a renewed focus on preventing needs from escalating, greater personalisation, and improved community-based services to keep people independent. Future funding requirements will also depend upon decisions taken at a local level around charging policies and eligibility criteria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="100909w0002.htm_para79"><a name="10090917000198">Plans to improve care and support services for people with a learning disability within Blaydon and in the North East region are a matter for local decision. We have made clear our commitment to drive forward action to improve support and outcomes for people with learning disabilities across England and to support independent living. For this year, our priorities are to improve health outcomes and support people into jobs and homes of their own.</p>

 We have made no recent estimate of the effect on life expectancy of someone with a mental illness. However, we are aware of the body of evidence which suggests that there are increased rates in morbidity and premature mortality in those with serious mental illness. This is also true of those with common mental health disorders which coincide with increased obesity and smoking for example. We intend to address this issue in the new mental health strategy and mention of this has already been made in the new national health service outcomes framework.</p>

 Motor neurone disease is a long-term neurological condition; the National Service Framework for long-term neurological conditions (NSF) was developed to address long-standing issues in neurological care, such as inequity in access to services; work force shortages and variable quality of care across the country. The NSF's quality requirements include a separate section on addressing the needs of people with rapidly progressing conditions, such as motor neurone disease, where services need to respond quickly.</p>

 Our overarching principle is that commissioning decisions should wherever possible reflect the views of local clinicians and the local public. Under the proposals set out in our NHS White Paper: "Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS", an NHS Commissioning Board will be responsible for commissioning primary care services for registered patients, while general practitioner (GP) consortia will be responsible for commissioning urgent care. The responses to the consultation on "Commissioning for Patients", as part of the wider proposed changes in the White Paper, will enable us to proceed to set out the full details of how GP-led commissioning will work. We urge anyone who has any concerns to respond to the consultation by 11 October.</p>

 A report commissioned by the Department for Education and Skills in 2007 estimated that the net present value (NPV) of completing an apprenticeship is around £105,000 at Level 3, and £73,000 at Level 2. NPV captures the surplus of lifetime benefits, in terms of higher wages and employment likelihoods, over the costs of undertaking the learning, including both the resource costs to the state and the employer, as well as the value of output foregone during learning.</p>

 Apprenticeships are jointly funded by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills and the Department for Education. In 2008/09, the latest full year for which data are available, there were 240,000 apprenticeship starts in England and 17,200 in the north east. Final full year data for 2009/10 will be available in January 2011. In the 2010/11 academic year 131,000 16 to 18-year-old and 167,000 adult apprenticeship starts are planned. The Government's decision to redeploy £150 million of our savings in 2010-11, creating an additional 50,000 adult places, demonstrates our commitment to high-quality employer owned apprenticeships. We fund apprenticeships on a national basis through the Skills Funding Agency-there are no regional or sectoral allocations.</p>

 Information on the total number of young people and adults seeking an apprenticeship is not collected centrally. People may start an apprenticeship through a variety of routes, including using apprenticeships vacancies, the national on-line system for advertising and applying for apprenticeship vacancies. Alternatively people may apply directly to a training provider or to an employer offering an apprenticeship programme, or may already be employed and undertake an apprenticeship. However, from this academic year (2010/11) training providers are required to submit all apprenticeship vacancies through the national apprenticeships vacancies system. This does not apply where it is proposed that the apprenticeship opportunity will be offered to a learner already employed. In the last academic year (August 2009 to July 2010) 354,000 candidates had registered to use apprenticeship vacancies and 75,000 candidates made at least one application. A regional breakdown is not available.</p>

 Both my Department and the Department for Education are responsible for the promotion of equality of access to apprenticeships. The National Apprenticeships Service (NAS), as the body responsible for promoting apprenticeships to employers and to potential apprentices, manages its systems to ensure equal access to information about the programme and to apprenticeship vacancies. Enhanced support includes additional funding available for training providers to support learners with a learning difficulty and/or disability. A priority for NAS is to address stereotyping and under-representation across apprenticeships including gender, race and disability. NAS and the Skills Funding Agency fund apprenticeships through a wide range of training providers including specialist providers that support disadvantaged learners. NAS also works with employers to help them understand and be more responsive to the needs of under-represented groups.</p>

For example, the Skills Funding Agency estimates that the cost of delivering a Level 2 adult apprenticeship in business and administration is around £2,700 and is £16,300 for an advanced apprenticeship (Level 3) in engineering for a 16 to 18-year-old.</p>

 I have been asked to reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="100909w0003.htm_para35"><a name="10090919000085">Effective enforcement of the national minimum wage (NMW) plays a crucial role in driving up compliance levels. Officials are working with HMRC to deliver a compliance strategy that ensures that enforcement is targeted on the areas where there is the greatest risk of non-compliance. To achieve this, HMRC will be testing new ways of working to focus on the most 'at risk' employers and the most 'at risk' workers. This will include piloting a triage approach to investigating complaints and making greater use of the contribution that community bodies, unions, trade associations in the low pay sectors and other interested parties can make to promoting the NMW and raising the profile of enforcement. We will also be encouraging more NMW inspection activity co-ordinated with the work of other bodies, including the Employment Agency Standards inspectorate. This will build on the joint working agreements put in place following the launch of the single Pay and Work Rights helpline last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="100909w0003.htm_para36"><a name="10090919000086">Central to our compliance strategy is the proposition that a 'one size fits all approach' is not the most effective. We will therefore continue to use a variety of tools and techniques to reach different audiences, ranging from ensuring that up-to-date, practical and accessible guidance is available, through to prosecution of the worst employers. This tailored approach to NMW compliance ensures that employers who want to comply have access to information and tools to enable them to do so and those employers who would otherwise be tempted to operate outside of the law are deterred from doing so.</p>

 It is not currently possible to separate the cost of supervising offenders on community sentences as probation case loads also include significant numbers of offenders who have been released from a custodial sentence or released temporarily into the community. Work is in hand in the National Offender Management Service to ensure that all offender services delivered in custody and in the community are properly specified and costed so that commissioners can ensure resources are targeted effectively to protect the public and reduce reoffending.</p>

 The national payment rate for financial penalties at the end of the 2008-09 financial year was 85% and 71% excluding the value of administrative cancellations. The payment rate covers fines, compensation, victims surcharge, and unpaid fixed penalty notices. Her Majesty's Courts Service has in place a strategy to increase the success of compliance with court orders particularly with regard to financial penalties-the Criminal Compliance and Enforcement Services Blueprint. This was launched in July 2008 and is being implemented across HMCS. The blueprint sets out HMCS's strategic objective for enforcement which is for a cheaper, faster and more proportionate system that primarily focuses on 'first time' compliance while continuing to apply the principles of rigorous enforcement to the hard core of defaulters. The blueprint implementation ensures greater use of the sanctions available under the Courts Act 2003 and extended methods of payment. In the 2009-10 financial year HMCS collected £259,241,082 which was £12.5 million (5%) more cash against financial penalties than in the 2008-09 year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="100909m0001.htm_para2"><a name="10090920000018">Ministers will discuss next steps on the economic partnership agreements (EPAs) with African, Caribbean and Pacific States, including how to progress negotiations further, being as flexible as possible while retaining compatibility with the rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). They may also discuss the implementation of EPAs already signed and the impact of EPAs on regional integration.</p>

Discussion is also likely to cover the progress of the associated bilateral safeguard regulation through ordinary legislative procedure in the European Parliament. They will also agree to provisional application of the FTA's commitments, the date to be confirmed later in the year following parallel work in the European Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="100909m0001.htm_para5"><a name="10090920000021"><i>Investment</i></p>

This discussion is likely to cover which countries will take priority as the EU seeks partners for new EU-investment agreements and what these agreements should cover. It is also likely that the regulation to manage the transfer of competency for international investment policy, which was published in parallel with the communication, will also be raised.</p>

The discussion is likely to cover both increased humanitarian assistance from member states and the Commission, as well as mechanisms to grant Pakistan increased market access to the EU, either through membership of the generalised system of preferences(+) (GSP+) scheme or through immediate, short-term reductions in EU tariffs on key Pakistani exports.</p>

 For many years our education system has failed to value practical education, choosing to give far greater emphasis to purely academic achievements. This has left a gap in the country's skills base and, as a result, a shortage of appropriately trained and educated young people to fulfil the needs of our employers. To help support our economic recovery, we need to ensure that this position does not continue and in future we are able to meet the needs of our labour market. I am today announcing an independent review of vocational education which will be chaired by Professor Alison Wolf</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="100909m0001.htm_para11"><a name="10090920000028">To enable us to achieve this long-term aim, the Government are currently developing a new approach to qualifications, considering all routes which are available to young people, to ensure that the qualifications that they study for are rigorous, relevant and bear comparison with the best in the world. As part of this I have asked Professor Wolf to consider how we can improve vocational education for 14 to19-year-olds to support participation and progression, specifically: how vocational education for 14 to19-year-olds can be improved; what the appropriate target audience for vocational education is; what principles should underpin the content, structure and teaching methods of the vocational education offer; and how progression from vocational education to positive destinations can be improved. The review will not be considering the detailed content of specific qualifications, but will be focusing on the effectiveness of the overall structure of the vocational offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="100909m0001.htm_para12"><a name="10090920000029">I have asked Professor Wolf to report to me by spring 2011, and to make practical recommendations that will ensure real change and have regard to current financial constraints.</p>

 The National Programme for IT is being reconfigured to reflect the changes described in the White Paper "Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS" and the outcome of the cross-Government review of ICT projects initiated in May.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="100909m0001.htm_para28"><a name="10090920000047">The new approach to implementation will be modular, allowing NHS organisations to introduce smaller, more manageable change, in line with their business requirements and capacity. NHS services will be the customers of a more plural IT supplier base, embodying the core assumption of connecting all systems together rather than replacing all systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="100909m0001.htm_para29"><a name="10090920000048">This approach will also address the delays, particularly in the acute sector, that resulted from the national programme's previous focus on complete system replacement. It will allow NHS trusts to retain existing systems that meet modern standards, and move forward in a way that best fits their own circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="100909m0001.htm_para30"><a name="10090920000049">An appropriate structure for health informatics is a key element of the organisational design work currently underway following the publication of "Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS". The direction of travel being announced today for IT services very much reflects the key theme of the White Paper, of bringing decisions closer to the front line. It follows that the national programme will no longer be run as a centralised programme. Some elements will need to continue to be nationally managed and it is expected that new structures will be fully in place by April 2012.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="100909m0001.htm_para31"><a name="10090920000050">Existing contracts will be honoured and it is vital that their value be maximised. However, by moving IT systems closer to the frontline, it is expected to make additional savings of £700 million, on top of the £600 million announced by the previous Administration in December 2009. These savings will mean that the total cost of the programme will be reduced significantly from the original forecast of £12.7 billion for combined central and local spending to £11.4 billion.</p>

 The Home Secretary announced the cancellation of ID cards and a halt to work on second biometric passports on 27 May 2010. UKBA has now renegotiated one of the key contracts that supported this work, saving £50 million. Using the restructured contract UKBA will build the immigration and asylum biometric system (IABS). This system will strengthen our ability to control the entry of foreign nationals into the United Kingdom and identify those who pose a risk to our country. Those who have previously been deported, or committed a criminal offence, or been turned down for a visa will find it much harder to enter the UK.</p>

One of the relevant contracts is for the provision of a database of fingerprints and facial images. This contract, titled the national identity assurance service (NIAS) also supports key UKBA initiatives for the control of immigration and asylum. UKBA has been able to save £50 million from the contract price by removing components that stored data on UK nationals, and which are no longer needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="100909m0001.htm_para37"><a name="10090920000058">Using the revised contract UKBA will completely modernise our ability to use biometrics to protect our borders. The new system is scheduled for delivery by IBM at the end of 2011 and will support the checking of biometric visas, registration cards for asylum seekers and biometric residence permits. It will replace an existing system that was first commissioned in 2000 and is now nearing its design capacity. The new system is faster, more accurate and more resilient. It can also be expanded to cater for future immigration applications, for example streamlined border entry processes. The revised contract is worth £191 million over seven years.</p>

 The National Assembly for Wales passed a resolution on 9 February 2010 calling for a referendum under the terms of the Government of Wales Act 2006. The First Minister notified my predecessor of this resolution on 17 February 2010.</p>

I referred a question proposed by the Wales Office Referendum Project Board to the Electoral Commission on 23 June 2010. The commission has conducted a thorough assessment of the preamble and question, including carrying out public opinion research, gathering views from interested parties and seeking advice from experts on plain language and accessibility in English and Welsh. It published its findings and recommendations on 2 September 2010.</p>

I have discussed the conclusions of the report with the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and, with their agreement, have decided to accept the commission's recommended revision of the question and its preamble.</p>
