<a name="40107m01.html_spmin0"><B>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland   (Mr. Paul Murphy): </B> 
 The Government have today exchanged letters with the Irish Government to bring the agreement establishing the Independent Monitoring Commission into force. The final draft of the agreement was placed in the Library of the House on 4 September 2003. Following signature on 25 November 2003 the agreement was published as Command Paper Cm 6068 and laid before Parliament on 3 December 2003 in accordance with the Ponsonby "rule".
<P>

<a name="40107m01.html_para0">Both Governments have been committed to doing all they can to ensure that the Commission can begin its work as early as possible. We are confident that in agreeing an early date for entry into force with the Irish Government&#151;before the 21 days required by the Ponsonby "rule" have elapsed&#151;we have acted with the will of the House.

<a name="40107m01.html_spmin1"><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence   (Mr. Ivor Caplin): </B> 
 Following the expiry of the call-out Order made last January, I am informing the House that a new Order has been made under the 



<P>
<P>7 Jan 2004 : Column 10WS<P>
Reserve Forces Act 1996 so that reservists may continue to be called out into service to support operations in Iraq. The new Order is effective until 6 January 2005.
<P>

<a name="40107m01.html_para1">Some 8,500 reservists were called out and accepted into service under the Order made last year. The proportion of reservists deployed with the UK force in theatre is currently just under 20 per cent. but this is expected to reduce to just over 10 per cent. during the course of the year. The next tranche of reservists, involving some 1,100 personnel, will shortly be called out for mobilisation and then deployed in early April where the majority will complete six month tours. We will continue to keep the size and mix of forces in theatre under careful review. We are very appreciative of the continuing support and commitment shown by both reservists and their employers.
