National School of Government as a separate non-ministerial Department.

<sup>(1)</sup> Departments and Agencies which received 10 MPs/Peers letters or fewer during 2005 are not shown in this table. Holding or interim replies are not included unless otherwise indicated. This report includes letters from prospective candidates prior to the general election. The report does not include correspondence considered as Freedom of Information requests.
<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> Received fewer than 10 letters in 2005.
<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> With effect from 1 April 2005, HM Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue merged to form HM Revenue and Customs.
<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> Includes a small number of letters from members of the public that received a ministerial reply. Figure also includes some FOI requests, though these represent less than 1 per cent of total reported.
<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> Reduced volume of correspondence compared to previous years reflects the setting up of a central correspondence system and the introduction of a more accurate method of monitoring letters received.
<br>
<sup>(6)</sup> Poor performance caused by backlog of cases and resource issues. Performance for December 2005 was 75 per cent, increased to 81 per cent in March 2006.
<br>
<sup>(7)</sup> Abolished in September 2005.
<br>




<sup>(8)</sup> IND saw an increase in volume of 15 per cent between 2004 and 2005 (6 per cent increase in ministerial, and 21 per cent in official replies). During 2005 all official replies were again signed off by IND senior executive group members which inevitably built delays into the system, but had the effect of significantly enhancing the quality of replies.
<br>
<sup>(9)</sup> Performance slipped last year due to internal reorganisation following a reduction in staff numbers. Launch of new centralised response unit will raise level of performance.
<br>
<sup>(10)</sup>Includes all ministerial correspondence.

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60330m03.html_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Yvette Cooper): </b> 
 In December I announced the first provisional allocations for the 2006&#150;07 round of planning delivery grant in England, the majority of which is a performance-related grant paid to local authorities in recognition of their work in planning. Today I am finalising these allocations and announcing the remaining final elements of the Grant to the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m03.html_para0"><a name="stpa_32">The Government&#039;s aim is to enhance the resourcing of the planning system in a way that drives performance improvement and ensures effective delivery of our objectives for sustainable communities. Planning delivery grant is specifically targeted towards meeting the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s Public Service Agreements (PSA) 5 and 6. PSA 5 aims to achieve a better balance between housing availability and demand. PSA 6 requires all authorities to have local development frameworks in place (in accordance with agreed local development schemes) and to meet the best value development control targets by March 2007. Beyond this date the PSA requires local authorities to maintain this level of performance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m03.html_para1"><a name="stpa_33">The Planning Delivery Grant (PDG) is not ring-fenced or hypothecated beyond the condition that 25 per cent. of the total received by authorities in the 2006&#150;07 financial year must be used for capital expenditure. In that financial year, &#163;135 million will support planning services through the PDG, in addition to other efforts at boosting the resources available to enhance good planning, such as the raising of planning fees in April 2005.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m03.html_para2"><a name="stpa_34">I can confirm today the amount of grant to be distributed to authorities in 2006&#150;07 is just over &#163;127 million. It will be paid to local planning authorities at a London borough, district and county level, national park authorities, regional planning bodies, the broads authority and the Greater London Authority. The remaining &#163;7.975 million of the grant will be used to support a number of national initiatives and this is broken down as follows: The planning advisory service and the advisory team for large applications will both be allocated &#163;2 million each for their work supporting local authority planning performance; &#163;2 million will be allocated to the planning inspectorate for their work on local development plan preparation; &#163;0.5 million will be used to support the implementation of planning for

This is a qualification which would provide planning support staff with a university accredited qualification to equip them to deal with minor planning applications, hence raising development control capacity in LPAs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m03.html_para3"><a name="stpa_35">The grant elements for local authorities being announced today are awarded on a number of different criteria. &#163;20.8 million has been allocated across English local authorities based on their performance in making future plans for their local area. This grant allocation was dependent on local authorities delivering an annual monitoring report to Government Offices by December 31 2005 and all 396 local authorities met this target and will consequently receive &#163;52,525 each.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m03.html_para4"><a name="stpa_36">This year has seen a huge improvement in local authorities&#039; online planning services with 95 per cent. now achieving a ranking of good or excellent. This is well above the target in our PSA 6 delivery plan which states that &quot;80 per cent. of local authorities are to have &#039;good or excellent&#039; e-planning services in place by the end of March 2006&quot;. We are continuing to use planning delivery grant to incentivise and reward local authorities&#039; achievements in this area. The &quot;e-planning&quot; allocations will range from &#163;4,920 to &#163;24,446 to all authorities ranked as good or excellent through satisfying a minimum of 15 out of 21 e-planning criteria, with the highest awards going to those who achieve all 21.

These allocations were announced as provisional in December 2005 and I am announcing finalised figures in this statement today. The proportion of grant allocated to local authorities within the high housing demand and growth areas as identified in the communities plan has been increased to further incentivise the step change in housing supply which the Barker review concluded was needed to make housing more affordable for the next generation, with &#163;16 million being allocated in total. This money is allocated in proportion to the contribution of these authorities towards delivering net additions to the housing stock. Pathfinder authorities receive an allocation of &#163;100,000 each in recognition of the low demand for housing in their areas. Local authorities are also awarded &#163;1,743 for each enterprise area within their boundary.

<p>
<a name="60330m03.html_para6"><a name="stpa_38">Regional planning bodies receive grant to support their work preparing regional spatial strategies and in recognition of the additional work which the strengthened regional planning function involves. In 2006&#150;07 this totals &#163;6.835 million. The Greater London Authority (GLA) will receive &#163;90,000 in recognition of its plan making responsibilities. The award is based on the GLA&#039;s performance against its business plan, and is given in recognition of work on: sub-regional development frameworks; completion of strategic planning guidance documents; the Housing Capacity Study; and the implementation of the London Plan.

I may consider withholding up to 10 per cent. of the grant allocated to authorities whose best value Performance Indicator 109 (BVPI 109) has been qualified by the auditor until we have established to our satisfaction the reason for the qualification and the reliability of the data on which grant was allocated. Following this I may seek to recover some or all of the monies paid to those authorities.

<p>
<a name="60330m03.html_para8"><a name="stpa_39">As part of the allocation criteria for PDG, I have included a provision for abatement of the development control element of the grant. This relates to performance on appeals and was announced as part of the first announcement of provisional figures which I announced in December 2005. This states that where an authority&#039;s performance on appeal is at least 40 per cent. worse than the national average (32.65 per cent. of appeals upheld against the authority), 10 per cent. of their development control allocation will be abated.

<a name="60330m04.html_para4"><a name="stpa_49">The regulations come into force on Monday 15 May 2006. The Landfill Directive&#039;s requirements, section 33(1 )(c) of the 1990 Act and the duty of care under section 34 of the Act will apply from that date. However, the regulations contain transitional provisions which allow farmers six months from that date to register with the Environment Agency to transport agricultural waste on a professional basis or as a dealer or broker; and allow farmers 12 months to apply to the Agency for waste management licences, to dispose of or recover agricultural waste on-farm, or to register licensing exemptions.

<a name="60330m04.html_para5"><a name="stpa_50">A wide range of licensing exemptions will be available to farmers. As a result of discussions with the Agricultural Waste Stakeholders&#039; Forum and public consultation, we have identified proposals for more licensing exemptions for agricultural waste covering the use of drum incinerators, waste disposal in the event of a plant health disease outbreak, the use of ash from the incineration of non-SRM pig and poultry carcasses, the use of biobeds for pesticide residues and the use of dredgings from ditch clearances. We propose to carry out a supplementary consultation exercise on these proposals for more licensing exemptions during the 12-month transitional period before the regulations&#039; waste management licensing provisions come fully into force.

The proposed amendments apply to animal by-products which are waste within the meaning of Article 1(a) of the Waste Framework Directive and are not excluded from the Directive&#039;s scope under Article 2;</p>

The memorandum called for new EU measures to help farmers cope with their greater exposure to market fluctuations, following recent and ongoing reform. I welcomed the memorandum as a contribution to the ongoing debate on the future of the CAP and urged the Council to be cautious about introducing EU or other Government measures which contradicted the market direction of recent CAP reforms, stressing that farmers were best placed to judge what risk management measures were best suited to their businesses. The Agriculture Commissioner referred to the Commission&#039;s ongoing work on risk and crisis management and CAP simplification and gave an overview of forthcoming work to reform the fruit and vegetable and wine reform sectors towards the end of this year and the proposal for the reform of the Common Market organisation of bananas which would be presented in June.

The DDRB has recommended with effect from April 2006 general increases in remuneration of 2.2 per cent. for consultants and doctors and dentists in training, 2.4 per cent. for non-consultant career grade doctors and salaried dentists and an increase of 3.0 per cent. in gross remuneration for general dental practitioners.

In considering the DDRB recommendations, it is necessary to consider a range of factors and with the National Health Service currently running a small deficit affordability must also be taken into account.

 Today the Government have published statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System. The statistics, published under section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, are one of the main sources of information available on Black and other Minority (BME) Ethnic groups&#039; experiences across the CJS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m05.html_para12"><a name="stpa_71">The Government are committed to delivering a CJS which promotes equality, does not discriminate against anyone because of their race, that has a workforce which fairly represents the communities it services and is effective in rooting out and tackling racism and racist crime.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m05.html_para13">The statistics published today show that significant progress has been made but that there is still much to do. For example on race hate crime the statistics show racist incidents recorded by the police rose in 2004&#150;05 but that the British Crime Survey (which is a large scale survey based on reports of people&#039;s individual experience) estimated the number of racist incidents fell. That might be an indication that the progress we have made in investigating and prosecuting hate crime has given people greater confidence to report incidents and been effective in preventing them from happening.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m05.html_para14"><a name="stpa_72">The representation of BME groups working for CJS agencies has improved, in 2004&#150;05 the Police, Prison, Crown Prosecution, Probation Services and Crown and Magistrates courts all recorded an increase in the number of BME staff.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m05.html_para15"><a name="stpa_73">There are signs that the confidence of BME groups that the CJS will treat them fairly is improving. The Government have set a target to reduce the percentage of people from BME communities who believe they would be treated worse than people from white communities by one or more CJS agency. The most recent Home Office Citizenship Survey (which is the basis for the measure) shows that, while there has not been a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of people from BME communities who believe one or more agency might discriminate against them, there has been a significant reduction in the proportion who believe it of the Courts, the Police, the CPS and the Prison Service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m05.html_para16"><a name="stpa_74">But the Government are not complacent and acknowledge that there is still much to do. The statistics reveal that BME people continue to be disproportionately represented in the CJS. While that data does not necessarily mean there is discrimination it is an issue the Government are committed to addressing. In key areas such as the use of stop and search the statistics do not reveal an increase in the disproportion between different groups but neither has there been a reduction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m05.html_para17"><a name="stpa_75">The Government have a programme of work to understand and address this and other issues. While the ultimate outcome of this work will be to secure a reduction in the levels of inappropriate disproportion as well as increased BME community confidence in the CIS it will take time for the initiatives to have an impact.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m05.html_para18"><a name="stpa_76">We will continue to use these statistics to drive forward further change by ensuring all agencies continue to scrutinise their policies and standards, and work towards ensuring services are delivered fairly to all communities.

the reduction of reoffending through the development of more effective end to end management of offenders, throughout the sentence. Every offender will have a named offender manager who will be responsible for making sure that they are both punished and properly rehabilitated, and that the public are protected. They will manage the offender, often from before they are sentenced, throughout any prison sentence, and then during time on a community sentence or on licence in the community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m05.html_para21"><a name="stpa_79">Regional offender managers need to be able to fund the delivery of specified contracts based on evidence of what reduces reoffending rather than leaving the prison and probation services to decide what to deliver. The current legal framework allows the Home Office to commission prison services&#151;but not for probation. This asymmetry is one of the biggest barriers to realising our vision of joining up offender management from custody into the community. We will therefore be bringing forward legislation to improve the position.

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="60330m06.html_spmin1"><b>The Leader of the House of Commons  (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon): </b> 
 The Parliamentary and Other Pensions Act 1987 requires the Government Actuary to make triennial reports on the financial position of the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund. His latest report, dealing with the position of the Fund as at 1 April 2005, is published today and a copy of the report &quot;Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund: Report by the Government Actuary on the Valuation as at 1 April 2005 [HC 979]&quot; has been laid before the House. It includes his recommendation on the rate of Exchequer contributions to be made to the Fund, which the Act requires the Government to follow. The new rate of Exchequer contribution will be implemented in accordance with the requirements of the Act from 1 April 2006.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m06.html_para9"><a name="stpa_90">The Government Actuary has assessed that the underlying cost of the benefits accruing under the Parliamentary pension scheme is lower than the cost assessed at the previous actuarial valuation in 2002 (27.4 per cent. of the total pensionable payroll of scheme members compared with 28 per cent.). This is primarily because the Government Actuary has assumed, in the light of recent experience, that MPs will leave and retire at higher ages than was assumed previously. Furthermore, the Exchequer share of the underlying cost has decreased due to higher contributions being paid by most of the scheme&#039;s members. The Government Actuary expects members&#039; contributions to total 9.3 per cent.of the payroll, compared with 8.7 per cent. at the 2002 valuation. The Exchequer&#039;s share of the underlying cost has therefore fallen from 19.3 per cent. of payroll to 18.1 per cent.






<br>&nbsp;<br>30 Mar 2006 : Column 93WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m06.html_para10">However, despite the fall in the underlying cost of accruing benefits and in the Exchequer share of that cost, the Government Actuary has recommended an increase in the level of Exchequer contributions to the Fund from the current level of 24 per cent. of payroll to a new level of 26.8 per cent. This is because there has been an increase in the deficit in the Fund (that is, a shortfall of assets to the estimated value of liabilities) since the Government Actuary&#039;s last valuation in 2002 from &#163;25.2 million to &#163;49.5 million. (For the purposes of the actuarial valuation, the value of the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund&#039;s assets at 31 March 2005 was assessed as &#163;278.6 million).

<a name="60330m06.html_para11"><a name="stpa_91">The deficit would have risen by around &#163;7 million even if the experience of the scheme had developed entirely in line with the assumptions made at the 2002 valuation&#151;because of the interest that is assumed to accrue on the deficit, and because the increase in Exchequer contributions following the previous valuation only took effect a year after the valuation date. However, the deficit has increased further because the experience of the scheme has differed from what the Government Actuary assumed at the 2002 valuation, and also because the Government Actuary has changed his assumptions about what will happen in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m06.html_para12"><a name="stpa_92">The main area where the experience of the scheme has differed from what the Government Actuary assumed is in relation to investment returns, which were lower than expected. In common with most other pension funds and other investors in equity shares, the Fund experienced negative investment returns in the first year covered by the Government Actuary&#039;s report and positive returns in the subsequent two years. Although the investment returns over the three years as a whole were positive, they were lower than had been assumed. Overall, divergence of the scheme&#039;s experience from the Government Actuary&#039;s assumptions made at the 2002 valuation contributed around &#163;5 million to the increased deficit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m06.html_para13"><a name="stpa_93">The main area where the Government Actuary has changed his assumptions about what will happen in the future is in relation to the longevity of members. Again, in common with other pension funds, the Fund has been affected by the fact that people are living longer. The Government Actuary has assumed that the life expectancy of a 65-year old man has increased by two years to 19.5 years. Overall, changes in the Government Actuary&#039;s assumptions contributed around &#163;13 million to the increased deficit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m06.html_para14"><a name="stpa_94">The contributions by the Exchequer to the Fund have fluctuated over the years, and the Exchequer has benefited in the past from the fact that the Fund has been in surplus and that lower contributions have been paid as a result. The level of Exchequer contributions over the period 1989 to 2003 varied between 4.4 per cent. and 9.6 per cent. of payroll, representing a saving of between 6.6 per cent. and 11 per cent. of payroll over the Exchequer&#039;s share of the underlying cost of the accruing benefits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m06.html_para15"><a name="stpa_95">Separately from his report on the actuarial valuation, the Government Actuary has estimated that the

capitalised value as at 1 April 2005 of the saving to the Exchequer over the period 1989 to 2003 (that is, the difference between the actual level of the Exchequer contribution and the Exchequer share of the underlying cost of the accruing benefits) is &#163;50 million.
</p>

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60330m08.html_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Energy  (Malcolm Wicks): </b> 
 I am making today a statement to the House to announce the Government&#039;s decision on the high level regulatory regime to be put in place to regulate offshore electricity transmission.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m08.html_para2"><a name="stpa_130">This is a key step in the delivery of the targets, goals and aspirations for renewable generation set out in the 2003 Energy White Paper: &quot;Our Energy Future&#151;Creating a Low Carbon Economy&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m08.html_para3"><a name="stpa_131">The White Paper set out four key goals of energy policy:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">To put the UK on a path to cut carbon dioxide (CO <sub>2</sub> ) emissions by some 60 per cent. by about 2050.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">To maintain the reliability of energy supplies.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">To promote competitive markets in the UK and beyond.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">To ensure that every home is adequately and affordably heated.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m08.html_para4"><a name="stpa_132">Offshore renewable energy can make a major contribution to the delivery of the Government&#039;s target of 10 per cent. renewable energy by 2010. Currently there is no regulatory regime in place covering the transmission connection of our second round of offshore wind farms (and the other marine renewables that may follow them) to the onshore electricity grid. However, the Energy Act 2004 gives the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry various powers to set up a regulatory regime for offshore transmission.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m08.html_para5"><a name="stpa_133">The Government&#039;s aim has been to introduce a regulatory regime that facilitates the connection of a proportion of Round 2 (R2) projects in time to contribute to the 2010 target. That objective includes ensuring efficiency of connections and allowing for fair and open access for offshore generators.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m08.html_para6"><a name="stpa_134">In making my decision I have sought to balance the achievement of the four White Paper goals. The right balance also needs to be struck between the interests of all stakeholders including consumers, offshore developers, transmission companies, and other generators. Grid connections are likely to form 10&#150;15 per cent. of capital costs for the round two wind farms given the considerable cable lengths involved. Certainty about how the grid connection costs will be funded, and the regulation that controls them, is a key factor that developers need in preparing their business models.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m08.html_para7"><a name="stpa_135">Broadly speaking the consultation document sought views from stakeholders on two high level options for this offshore regime. The main options set out were:






<br>&nbsp;<br>30 Mar 2006 : Column 99WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">Extension of arrangements broadly similar to the existing onshore regulated price control approach offshore.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">A light touch regulatory approach with developers directly responsible for funding and construction of cable connections to the onshore system&#151;the licence merchant approach.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m08.html_para8"><a name="stpa_136">A third option was also included which is a sub-set of the first option above:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38">Extension of the existing onshore system offshore but with the addition of some limitation of the highest transmission charges.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m08.html_para9"><a name="stpa_137"><i>The approach</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m08.html_para10"><a name="stpa_138">I am announcing that the existing onshore regulated price control approach to electricity transmission should be extended offshore, and ruling out the licensed merchant approach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m08.html_para11"><a name="stpa_139">In making this decision I have also noted that this was also the option supported by the majority of respondents to the consultation exercise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m08.html_para12"><a name="stpa_140">I have concluded that the regulated price control approach has a number of clear advantages. Extending the regulated price control approach offshore will ensure consistency with the regulatory arrangements onshore. It will provide a financial benefit to offshore developers by spreading the costs they face to connect to the onshore electricity system over a number of years. The regulated price control approach will also mean that the responsibility for developing the offshore transmission network will be shared by the System Operator and the Transmission Asset Owners. This should help to ensure that the Government&#039;s renewable energy targets are achieved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m08.html_para13"><a name="stpa_141">In taking this decision I have sought to put in place a regulatory framework that includes a fair and transparent approach to transmission costs consistent with those faced by onshore generators. At this stage there is insufficient information to indicate that the level of transmission charges offshore would deter renewable generation. Based on the information currently available the Secretary of State does not foresee a need to consider capping transmission charges offshore for the planned round two wind power projects. However, he will continue to keep this under consideration as different offshore technologies develop, taking account of the Government&#039;s targets and aspirations for the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources and the cost to consumers being acceptable. Full consultation with all interested stakeholders on any future proposal of this sort would be essential.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m08.html_para14"><a name="stpa_142">It is likely to be at least eighteen months before the necessary programme of technical work to determine the level of charging is completed, by which time the Energy Review will have concluded. The impact of those charges could therefore be considered in the context of any conclusions that have emerged from the review.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m08.html_para15"><a name="stpa_143">It is important to bear in mind that regulated price control offshore, while providing the advantages to generators that I mention above, would still involve the charges they face being based on the costs of their connections. The main consideration with the options consulted on was how these costs will be financed. Under the regulated price control approach the costs will be recovered from developers through an annual transmission charge over a fixed period. Under the licensed merchant approach the cost of building the

connection would have been met by developers upfront themselves. Only under the price control approach with capping would there be an extra element of cross-subsidisation from other users of the system.

<p><a name="st_28"><a name="60330m09.html_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Transport  (Mr. Alistair Darling): </b> 
 The Government are aware of the concerns that have been expressed by the London borough of Tower Hamlets and others in the borough about the impacts of Crossrail in Tower Hamlets. Many of those concerns centre on the works proposed in the Bill in and around Hanbury street to use a site for launching tunnel boring machines and associated works at Pedley street and Mile End Park for removal of excavated material.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m09.html_para3"><a name="stpa_150">After many months of detailed work with Cross London Rail Links (CLRL) and Transport for London, a solution has been identified that should significantly reduce the implications of Crossrail works for the local community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m09.html_para4"><a name="stpa_151">The work carried out by CLRL has involved a fundamental review of its tunnelling strategy. CLRL has concluded that by a major recasting of the construction programme it is possible to accommodate the major part of the tunnelling activities from the two tunnel boring machine launch sites already proposed at Royal Oak in west London and between Canary Wharf and Custom House in the Docklands area of east London. As a result Crossrail would not need to launch tunnel boring machines from Hanbury Street in east London.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m09.html_para5"><a name="stpa_152">The new tunnelling strategy will significantly reduce the environmental impacts of Crossrail construction in the borough of Tower Hamlets, and we believe they would be positive overall for London. There would be no need for the works between Hanbury street and Pedley street or the conveyor along the Great Eastern main line. Mile End Park would not be needed as a site for stockpiling excavated material. A shaft will still need to be constructed at Hanbury street for ventilation and intervention, but this will be a much smaller structure involving less work and so reducing disruption to the local community. I have asked CLRL urgently to consider these residual impacts so that they can be further ameliorated. An environmental assessment of the alternative strategy will be published in due course.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m09.html_para6"><a name="stpa_153">LRL&#039;s assessment is that constructing the central Crossrail tunnel in this new way will not increase overall the project&#039;s programme or budget.

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="60330m11.html_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Derek Twigg): </b> 
 Today the Department for Transport has published the North East Regional Planning Assessment for the railways (RPA), the second in a series of 11 RPAs covering England and Wales. The north-east RPA covers the north-east of England region and a small part of North Yorkshire where the railway services are closely linked to the north-east network.






<br>&nbsp;<br>30 Mar 2006 : Column 109WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m11.html_para8"><a name="stpa_230">RPAs are the key link between regional spatial planning (including preparation of regional transport strategies) and planning for the railway by both Government and the rail industry and are designed to inform the development of the Government&#039;s strategy for the railway. They look at the challenges and options for development of the railway in each region over the next 20 years, in the wider context of forecast change in population, the economy and travel behaviour. An RPA does not commit the Government to specific proposals. Instead it sets out the Government&#039;s current thinking on how the railway might best be developed to allow wider planning objectives for a region to be met, and identifies the priorities for further development work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m11.html_para9"><a name="stpa_231">The area covered by the north-east RPA has a population of just over 2.5 million, mainly concentrated around the two major conurbations of Tyne and Wear and the Tees-Valley. While population levels are not expected to grow significantly, structural changes in the type of employment available are expected to increase labour market participation rates and prosperity for residents of the region. In general, greater prosperity can be expected to lead to more trips and longer travel distances for all types of journey. Growth in rail passenger journeys is forecast for the region and it is expected that there will be particular growth in longer distance journeys, linking the north-east to other regions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m11.html_para10"><a name="stpa_232">Planning for railways in the north-east needs to take into account a changing economic and social context. Rail has a part to play in addressing national and regional government agencies&#039; aims to close the gap that has opened up between the prosperity of the north-east and the rest of the UK over the next decade. This aim is the prime objective of recent initiatives such as the Northern Way, which have influenced the formulation of the north-east RPA.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m11.html_para11"><a name="stpa_233">The RPA clarifies the role of the railway in the region, its contribution to the economy and its place in the overall transport system, setting out where greater rail capability and capacity will be needed over the next

20 years, and the options for responding to that need. In the shorter term it recommends optimising timetables, improving accessibility and interchanges, and matching resources to demand best to use existing capacity and improve performance.

<p><a name="st_35"><a name="60330m11.html_spmin3"><b>The Secretary of State for Transport  (Mr. Alistair Darling): </b> 
 I reported on 14 February 2006 that my Department has been considering its future relationship with London and Continental Railways (LCR) who are responsible for the construction and operation of Channel Tunnel Rail Link and had also been independently approached by a third party, with an interest in the potential acquisition of the shareholders&#039; interests in LCR. I announced on 1 March 2006 that, given such interest, the best way of delivering continuing value for money for the taxpayer would be for there to be an open, transparent, competitive process and that my Department was discussing this approach with LCR&#039;s shareholders.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m11.html_para18"><a name="stpa_240">Having considered the matter, it is clear that certain shareholders do not wish to sell their shares at this time. Meanwhile, LCR and its shareholders have proposed a significant overhaul of the future relationship with the Department, which I welcome. There is therefore no need to proceed with a competitive process now. My main concern is to secure best value for taxpayers as well as continuing value for money and so we will look again with shareholders at a later stage, probably once the Channel Tunnel Rail Link has been commissioned, which we expect to be in 2007.

 I am pleased to announce changes to the discretionary loans scheme from 3 April 2006.






<br>&nbsp;<br>30 Mar 2006 : Column 112WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m12.html_para0">We have greatly simplified the rules for determining the size of the maximum budgeting loan amount that can be offered to eligible applicants. There are now only three rates that can be offered: one for single people; one for couples without children; one for families with children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m12.html_para1"><a name="stpa_241">The complex &quot;double debt&quot; rule is abolished so that those applicants with existing budgeting loan debt have more help available to them. This, and the simpler rules for determining size of the maximum budgeting loan, means that applicants will understand better the help that is available and when they can access it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m12.html_para2"><a name="stpa_242">We have increased the overall limit on loan amounts that any applicant can borrow from the social fund. At the same time we are reducing the highest loan repayment rates and giving applicants longer to repay their loan debt.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m12.html_para3"><a name="stpa_243">Also from 3 April 2006, budgeting loan applicants will benefit from being able to have more savings before any budgeting loan award is affected. The capital limit is doubled to &#163;1,000 (under pension age) and &#163;2,000 (pension age).
</p>

<p>
<a name="60330m12.html_para4"><a name="stpa_244">Overall this is a significant package of changes. Also, in making loans more affordable and easier to access, we aim to help people avoid alternative high cost lenders.
