 I am today launching the public consultation on the regulations and guidance in support of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, which received Royal Assent on 18 November.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m01.html_para0"><a name="stpa_0">The Act and accompanying non-legislative measures will deliver a single framework for civil protection in the UK, modernising outdated legislation to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m01.html_para1"><a name="stpa_1">The purpose of the public consultation is to consider the suitability and content of the underpinning regulations and guidance for practitioners and is in accordance with the Government&#039;s commitment to launch the consultation shortly after Royal Assent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m01.html_para2"><a name="stpa_2">Copies of the consultation document, the draft regulations and guidance will be placed in the Library of the House. They can also be viewed on the UK resilience website www.ukresilience.info/home.htm.

 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and I are jointly publishing today the Government response to the Electoral Commission&#039;s report &quot;Voting for change&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m01.html_para4"><a name="stpa_4">In its report &quot;Voting for change: An electoral law modernisation programme&quot;, the Electoral Commission has made a range of proposals and recommendations for electoral reform to address the needs of the voter and make elections more accessible, to protect the integrity of the democratic process, and to modernise electoral registers. The Commission advocates the modernisation of registers, which would involve the introduction of individual registration building blocks on which safe and secure arrangements for voting away from polling stations could be delivered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m01.html_para5"><a name="stpa_5">Our response welcomes many of the Electoral Commission&#039;s recommendations and sets out our priorities for change. These are focussed on three key outcomes: engaging more people in the political process; building public confidence in the electoral system; and delivering electoral services in a way that is more efficient and more responsive to the needs of the voter.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m01.html_para6"><a name="stpa_6">We are committed to maintaining the security and integrity of the electoral process and to enhancing its openness and transparency. We will ensure that any innovative methods of voting that are introduced will be as secure, if not more secure, than the traditional methods. Specifically we are proposing, when parliamentary time allows:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">To introduce measures to make ballot papers more secure.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">To establish new offences around electoral fraud and personation.</p>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">To give greater access to observers at polling stations and at other stages of the electoralprocess, such as the count.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m01.html_para7"><a name="stpa_7">We are sympathetic to the principles of individual registration and appreciate the benefits that it might bring, but are concerned about maintaining a simple and clear system, and comprehensive registers. We are therefore considering the options to support voting away from polling stations with an approach that preserves the completeness and integrity of electoral registers.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="41209m01.html_spmin2"><b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence  (Mr. Adam Ingram): </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence informed the House in his statement on 21 July 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 348, that changes in the force structure of the RAF and the achievement of planned organisational efficiencies would lead to a reduced RAF trained manpower requirement of around 41,000 by 2008. I can now inform the House that the RAF has completed initial work on how this reduction will be achieved, while maintaining a satisfactory balance of personnel with the skills and experience levels throughout the service to enable the delivery of operational capability in a more flexible, deployable and responsive way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m01.html_para10"><a name="stpa_10">The RAF will achieve the required reduction, from a current regular trained strength of around 48,900, through a balanced strategy of normal outflow, reduced recruitment and a targeted redundancy programme. The service is therefore reducing its recruitment targets by some 4,000 (to around 6,000 in total) over the next three financial years and has identified a need for some 2,750 redundancies over the same period. Redundancy will be effected by a compulsory scheme, for which applications will be invited. It is hoped that as many of the redundancies as possible will be applicants but, in order to ensure the long-term balance of ability and experience across the RAF, it may not be possible to accept all applications received, in which case, it may be necessary to select some non-applicants.






<br>&nbsp;<br>9 Dec 2004 : Column 103WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m01.html_para11">Applications for the first 450 redundancies are being invited today and those selected will leave the service by 31 March 2006. Details of the remaining redundancies (approximately 2,300), which are expected to be managed in two further phases, will be notified to RAF personnel when further work is complete.

<a name="41209m01.html_sbhd3"><h4 align=center>Planning (Telecommunication Developments)</h4>












<p><a name="st_3"><a name="41209m01.html_spmin3"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Keith Hill): </b> 
 I am seeking to place a renewed emphasis on the importance of both the local planning authority and network operators participating in the annual rollout discussion process described in the code of best practice on mobile phone network development. The importance of this was recognised in planning policy guidance note 8 telecommunications (revised) (PPG8) and the code of practice and has recently been emphasised by the all-party group on mobile phones (apMobile) in their report into planning procedures. The report recognised the benefits of local planning authorities and operators working with the local community to review annual roll out plans and to develop local strategies for telecommunication developments.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m01.html_para12"><a name="stpa_11">The Government believes that information sharing and negotiation at this early stage could greatly reduce the levels of concern and conflict when specific applications are submitted in line with the agreed local plan or strategy. Therefore, it is desirable that in their local development frameworks, local planning authorities consider how they plan to manage the developments needed to meet the growing demand for communication services. Where appropriate, authorities may need to consider developing a suitable policy basis for communication developments in their local development documents. Such policies must of course be in accordance with the national policy as set out in planning policy guidance note 8 telecommunications (revised).

</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m01.html_para13"><a name="stpa_12">I am also reiterating the importance of effective pre-application discussions, especially in the absence of an agreed communications plan or strategy. It is of course open to local planning authorities to charge for such discussions under section 93 of the Local Government Act 2003, if they consider it necessary or appropriate.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m01.html_para14"><a name="stpa_13">The code of best practice sets out the traffic light model which is designed to help network operators and their representatives to identify issues that might arise should a site be selected for a telecommunication development and to help the preparation of consultation strategies to address such issues. It is important that the rating under the traffic light model is discussed with the local planning authority. In red and amber rated areas this discussion should include consideration of the optional elements of the consultation strategy that will be undertaken by the applicant. In accordance with the code of best practice, it is reasonable for the local planning authority to expect evidence of the consultation undertaken should be provided as part of the supplementary information sent with an application.






<br>&nbsp;<br>9 Dec 2004 : Column 104WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m01.html_para15"><a name="stpa_14">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has commissioned a study by the University of Reading and Arup to assess the impact that the code of best practice has had since its introduction and how local authorities have implemented the code and how the public perceives its operation. The mobile network operators have also commissioned the second independent review of their 10 commitments which will demonstrate in a quantitative way how their operations and procedures align with the requirements of the code. This will provide the Government with evidence on whether the code has been effective and whether there are any areas of weakness that need to be addressed. Informed by this evidence the Government will consider whether changes to the code are appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m01.html_para16"><a name="stpa_15">Finally, in respect of the Court of Appeal case, <i>First Secretary of State</i> v <i>T-Mobile and others</i> on 12 November, the court dismissed an appeal by the First Secretary of State against the decision of Sir Richard Tucker in relation to an application by T-Mobile for a shared mast in Harrogate. In essence the issue before the Court of Appeal was whether the judge in the High Court had dealt correctly with the extent to which public fears about the health risks arising from masts was material, when the development in question had the benefit of an ICNIRP certificate. Sir Richard had held that the inspector had misconstrued PPG8 when dealing with this issue in his decision letter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m01.html_para17"><a name="stpa_16">The Court of Appeal gave consideration to the policy guidance in PPG8. Taking into account that advice, the court found the FSS&#039; policy to mean that in cases where an ICNIRP certificate exists, only in exceptional circumstances would it be legitimate for a local planning authority to take public fears about health risks into account. They agreed with Sir Richard that the inspector had misconstrued this advice, and his decision was therefore flawed. We will be carefully reviewing the transcript of the judgment of Lord Justices Pill, Mummery and Laws before deciding what action may need to be taken in the light of this judgement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m01.html_para18"><a name="stpa_17">Officials in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be writing to all local planning authorities and licensed communications code system operators drawing their attention to this statement.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m02.html_para2"><a name="stpa_20">In its report, the commission sets out its evaluation of the electoral pilots in June 2004. It found that:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">the elections were successfully delivered;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">there was no evidence that all-postal voting lead to an increase in fraud;</p>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">a majority of more than 2:1 were either very or fairly satisfied with the all-postal votingarrangement in their pilot area.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m02.html_para3"><a name="stpa_21">The commission also found that voters wanted have choice about the way they vote. This is consistent with the Government&#039;s long term goal of multi-channel elections, including voters having the options of electronic, postal voting and voting in person.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m02.html_para4"><a name="stpa_22">We are not, however, persuaded by the commission&#039;s arguments that all-postal voting should not be pursued at UK elections. These are not supported by the outcome of the June elections, where turnout was substantially higher in the pilot regions and a large majority found the all-postal method acceptable. Furthermore, the turnout achieved in the north-east regional referendum underlined the value of all-postal voting in increasing participation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m02.html_para5"><a name="stpa_23">In its report, the commission proposes the development of a new model of voting. We welcome the opportunity to contribute to this work and will have regard to the progress of this work when assessing any new proposals for all-postal voting.

<p>
<a name="41209m02.html_para6"><a name="stpa_24">The Electoral Commission also indicated that it would not support pilots in May 2005 (or any at all until the new model is in use). We have decided not to issue a prospectus inviting applications for pilots in the county council elections in May 2005. It remains, however, open, at any time, to local authorities to apply to run all-postal pilots. The Government remain committed to a programme of electoral pilots in 2006 and subsequent years, including e-voting pilots.

 The Government is today publishing for consultation the draft Waste Management (England and Wales) Regulations 2005. The main purposes of the draft regulations, and the associated draft commencement order, are (a) to repeal the exclusion in section 75(7)(c) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990; and (b) to apply to agricultural waste, and to non-mineral waste from mines and quarries, the national controls that are already in place to comply with the waste framework directive (75/442/EEC as amended by 91/156/EEC and Commission decision 96/350/EC) and the landfill directive (1999/31/EC).

The controls will be enforced by the Environment Agency, as the &quot;competent authority&quot; in England and Wales, in ways which are proportionate to the risk to the environment and human health.

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="41209m03.html_spmin2"><b>The Secretary of State for Health  (Dr. John Reid): </b> 
 The fifth report of the Shipman inquiry, &quot;Safeguarding Patients: Lessons from the Past&#151;Proposals for the Future&quot;, Cm 6394, was published today, together with the Government&#039;s response to the inquiry&#039;s fourth report, &quot;The Regulation of Controlled Drugs in the Community&quot;, Cm 6249. This follows the publication of reports on the extent of Harold Shipman&#039;s criminal activities; on the 1998 investigation by the Greater Manchester police; and on death certification and the coroner system. The inquiry is now working on a supplementary report to the first of those reports and hopes to publish this final element of its work early in the new year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m03.html_para4"><a name="stpa_37">The Government express their profound thanks to Dame Janet Smith and her team for the care and attention that has gone into the preparation of each of her reports. We also reiterate our sympathy to the relatives and friends of Shipman&#039;s victims and express our thanks to them for their valuable contribution to the inquiry&#039;s work.

<a name="41209m03.html_para5"><a name="stpa_38"><i>The Inquiry&#039;s Fourth Report</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m03.html_para6"><a name="stpa_39">The inquiry&#039;s fourth report, published on 14 July 2004, analyses the means by which Harold Shipman was able to obtain his lethal armoury of controlled drugs and finds weaknesses both in current systems of control and in the ways in which those controls were operated. The report recommends strengthening current arrangements 





<br>&nbsp;<br>9 Dec 2004 : Column 109WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

in four main areas. First, it recommends a new integrated, multiprofessional inspectorate to inspect the management of controlled drugs in national health service primary care to replace the existing unco-ordinated arrangements for inspection. Secondly, it recommends restrictions on the right of general practitioners to prescribe controlled drugs in certain circumstances, for example prescribing for oneself or one&#039;s immediate family or prescribing beyond the requirements of one&#039;s normal clinical practice. Thirdly, it recommends auditing the prescribing of controlled drugs in primary care and the movement of supplies of controlled drugs in the community. Fourthly it recommends, better information to patients on the special legal status of the controlled drugs that are prescribed for them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m03.html_para7"><a name="stpa_40">The Government fully accept the need to improve current arrangements for the management of controlled drugs, and to do so in a way that does not hinder patients from accessing the treatment they need. We fully accept the great majority of the inquiry&#039;s recommendations and for the remainder we propose to achieve the same recommended ends by alternative action. Dame Janet Smith has seen our proposals, and is pleased that we have accepted the principles underlying her report, and that we intend to follow up her recommendations with rigorous action.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m03.html_para8"><a name="stpa_41">We will also follow through the implications of the inquiry&#039;s recommendations for other health care settings, including hospital care, the private sector, and care homes. Our proposals are set out in &quot;Safer Management of Controlled Drugs&#151;The Government&#039;s Response to the Fourth Report of the Shipman Inquiry&quot;, Cm 6434, which is published today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m03.html_para9"><a name="stpa_42">We will make it clear that responsibility for the proper management of controlled drugs is an integral part of the clinical governance responsibility of all NHS and private sector health care organisations. We will develop improved arrangements for the inspection of controlled drugs that strengthen, rather than detract from, this proper local responsibility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m03.html_para10"><a name="stpa_43">We will ensure that prescribing of controlled drugs&#151;which in future will include prescribing by health care professionals other than doctors and dentists&#151;takes place in the context of a general framework of good prescribing practice backed by clinical governance frameworks and appropriate professional regulatory sanctions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m03.html_para11"><a name="stpa_44">We will also capture information on all prescribing and requisitioning of controlled drugs, including private prescribing, and provide analyses of prescribing patterns by prescriber and by patient for those operating the local controls. Information systems will be set up that will enable a full audit trail for the movement of controlled drugs into the community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m03.html_para12"><a name="stpa_45">We will also ensure that patients receive appropriate information about controlled drugs in the context of an informed discussion with the health professionals involved in their care, and against a background of information about the safe handling of prescription medicines more generally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m03.html_para13"><a name="stpa_46">Finally, we will support all these actions through improved education and continuous professional development for healthcare professionals dealing with controlled drugs.

<a name="41209m03.html_para14"><a name="stpa_47"><i>The Inquiry&#039;s Fifth Report</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m03.html_para15"><a name="stpa_48">In her fifth report, Dame Janet makes recommendations in the following areas: handling patients&#039; complaints and whistleblowing concerns; the development of clinical governance in primary care; the availability of information about GPs; professional regulation of doctors and the role of the General Medical Council.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m03.html_para16"><a name="stpa_49">We have been working hard with the medical profession and others over the period since the conviction of Harold Shipman to strengthen the systems, rules and regulations that govern the medical profession and we are pleased that Dame Janet recognises the progress that has been made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m03.html_para17"><a name="stpa_50">Dame Janet also welcomes the changes made to date in the NHS complaints procedure and in the increasing amount of information available about doctors&#039; performance. She recognises the progress that has been made in developing systems for handling poor performance and aberrant conduct and the importance of continuing to develop clinical governance in primary care. Her recommendations build on all this work but also reflect her continuing concerns that, in some areas, there has been insufficient change to safeguard patients appropriately.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m03.html_para18"><a name="stpa_51">Dame Janet has made some very significant recommendations that would have a major impact on service delivery. We will need to study them carefully and discuss them with a wide range of stakeholders and interested parties. We also want to consider them alongside recommendations made in the recent inquiry reports into the activities of Clifford Ayling, Cm 6298, and Richard Neale, Cm 6315 both published on 9 September 2004.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m03.html_para19"><a name="stpa_52">Dame Janet has also made significant recommendations concerning the constitution and operation of the General Medical Council. We have recently made changes to the constitution of the General Medical Council to ensure a far greater voice for patient interests. We will consider carefully the recommendations Dame Janet makes for further reform, and the implications of her recommendations for other regulatory bodies in health and social care. Changes to the General Medical Council&#039;s disciplinary procedures have also recently been made and came into force only last month. We will consider carefully with the General Medical Council the recommendations in the report for further changes to these procedures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m03.html_para20"><a name="stpa_53">The scale of Shipman&#039;s crimes was unprecedented and his activities were totally abhorrent. No sanctions will stop conduct like that of Shipman so our energies must be focused on prevention and early identification of problems. Standards of behaviour must be high and action against those who fail to maintain those standards must be timely, firm and fair.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m03.html_para21"><a name="stpa_54">In welcoming the inquiry&#039;s previous reports, my right hon. Friends the Home Secretary and the then Secretary of State for Health emphasised the need to learn lessons from the mistakes of the past. All of Dame Janet&#039;s reports have provided us with an expert and detailed analysis of where systems failed. We are determined to ensure that all reasonable measures are taken to provide the safeguards that are needed and that the public rightly expect.

<p><a name="st_12"><a name="41209m04.html_spmin1"><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Mr. John Spellar): </b> 
 Earlier today I placed in the Libraries copies of the annual report on the implementation of the Regional Development Strategy for Northern Ireland 2025 (RDS) covering the period 2003&#150;04.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m04.html_para2"><a name="stpa_57">Implementation of the RDS is not simply a process for the Department for Regional Development. It is a shared process involving a wide variety of public and private organisations, businesses, voluntary and community organisations and individuals. Annual reporting on the implementation of the RDS involves assessment of progress being made against a number of critical threshold indicators (CTIs), and each of the strategic planning guidelines (SPGs) contained within the strategy.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m04.html_para3"><a name="stpa_58">The RDS sets out a regional brownfield target of 60 per cent. by 2010 for towns with populations of more than 5,000. Recent information provided by 





<br>&nbsp;<br>9 Dec 2004 : Column 112WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

the Department of the Environment shows a fall from almost 88 per cent. in 2001&#150;02 to 81 per cent. in the period 2002&#150;03.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m04.html_para4"><a name="stpa_59">Progress is also measured against each of the SPGs. This information is published annually in the monitoring report and is available on the Department&#039;s website. With only three years monitoring it is not possible to draw any significant conclusions on the data collected so far.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m04.html_para5"><a name="stpa_60">During 2003 and 2004, the Department engaged with a wide range of stakeholders in the public and private sectors and in the community. A series of four sub-regional seminars were held in the north-west, the south-east, the west rural and the north-east. The aim was to identify the development needs of sub-regions, and to examine the potential of the RDS to provide a framework through which these needs could be addressed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m04.html_para6"><a name="stpa_61">The Planning (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 requires the Department to examine emerging development plans for &quot;general conformity&quot; with the RDS. In March 2004, the Department received the draft Magherafelt area plan for consideration and a statement of general conformity was issued in the same month.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41209m04.html_para7"><a name="stpa_62">The annual report comments on the RDS commitment to a five-year review, a focused assessment of the strategy to be carried out in the period 2005&#150;06. The purpose of this focused assessment is to consider any aspects of the RDS where in-course adjustments to strategic guidance would be important prior to a major review at the 10-year point. Work has already commenced on a review of regional housing figures and I expect to make an announcement on this shortly. The focused assessment process will provide the opportunity for consultation on the outcome of this housing work.
