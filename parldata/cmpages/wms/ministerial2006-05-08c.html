Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. Tom
Watson):</b> I am very pleased to announce to the House that
the Ministry of Defence has awarded the Project Allenby/Connaught
contract to Aspire Defence Ltd. for the redevelopment and provision of
services to Aldershot garrison and garrisons in the Salisbury plain
area. This private finance initiative (PFI) project will provide
modernised and fully serviced accommodation to the Army for35
years and is worth approximately &#163;8 billion through the life of
the
contract.</p><p><a name="06050919000007">This
is the largest accommodation PFI project the MOD has ever undertaken.
In all, this project will deliver modern living and working
accommodation for 18,000 military and civilian personnel, including the
provision of some 11,000 en-suite bedspaces. The total new build for
the project will cover an area twice the size of Hyde Park, and there
will be more than 200 individual construction sites across the project
footprint. In all more than 350 new buildings will be constructed and a
further 140 will be refurbished. The project will also involve the
demolition of more than 400 buildings, many of which are either empty
or uneconomical to
maintain.</p><p><a name="06050919000008">The
agreement we have reached with Aspire Defence Ltd. is a highly
significant one, especially given the scale of the project, and the
number of people who will benefit from it&#151;not just within the
Army, but in the garrison areas as well. The project will generate many
new jobs in the local areas, but will also provide benefits to the
wider UK economy through extensive contracting and sub-contracting of
work. Furthermore, the implementation of this project will create a
large area of land in Aldershot, which will be disposed of. The
availability of this land is key to the plans for the urban
regeneration of the area, and this too will create many employment
opportunities.</p><p><a name="06050919000009">Work
on the new barracks has already started in Tidworth garrison with other
garrisons soon to follow; it is anticipated that all the major
construction work will take place during the first nine years of the
project. The project also includes the provision of a wide range of
services, including catering, cleaning, vehicle management and
utilities. Some of these services are currently provided within the
public sector, and approximately 380 civil service posts will transfer
to the new service providers. These transfers will be handled in
accordance with existing legislation and the Ministry of Defence's TUPE
code of practice. There will not be any redundancies arising out of
this transfer. The trade unions have been involved throughout the
process, and 
<br></br><notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>8 May 2006 : Column 2WS</b><br></br>a formal consultation period is currently under way. In addition around
1,800 existing contractors staff will transfer, in accordance with TUPE
legislation, to the Aspire supply
chain.</p><p><a name="06050919000011">This
project delivers on the Government's pledge to provide our armed forces
with modern and appropriately provisioned facilities.
Furthermore,it demonstrates the Government's continuing
commitment to private finance initiatives as a procurement option,
where they are proven to offer a sensible and cost-effective way
forward.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06050919000003">Trade
