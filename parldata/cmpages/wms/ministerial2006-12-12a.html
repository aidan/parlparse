<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para0"><a name="06121257000018">This is an important step forward for both the armed forces and British industry. The MoU sets out the framework for purchasing JSF and supporting and upgrading it through life. It also provides for the pooling of the nine partner nations' collective buying power in a common support solution, and of their resources and technology in follow-on development. It does not, however, formally commit the UK to buying any aircraft. Our associated increase in financial commitment at this stage is &#163;34 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para1"><a name="06121257000019">We have always been clear that the UK would only sign the MoU if we were satisfied that we would have operational sovereignty of our aircraft. We have today received the necessary assurances from the US on technology transfer, which we would require to operate the aircraft safely and maintain, repair and upgrade it over its operational life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para2"><a name="06121257000020">JSF's next-generation capabilities will contribute to air superiority for decades to come. As part of the Carrier Strike capability, it will be a key component of the expeditionary capability needed to confront the diverse range of 21st century threats. Signature of the MoU today reflects our continuing commitments to providing the armed forces with battle-winning equipment; to procuring and supporting that equipment in the most cost-effective way; and to enhancing the armed forces' ability to interoperate effectively with our international partners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para3"><a name="06121257000021">I shall place a copy of the MoU in the Library of the House.</p>

control, to the start of the next Rural Development Programme in England, originally due for 1 January 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para4"><a name="06121257000023">As explained in my earlier statement our programme, which will deliver important environmental, economic and social benefits in rural England, is dependent upon a new European Voluntary Modulation regulation which is still subject to a consultation procedure with the European Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para5"><a name="06121257000024">Our aim is to minimise any disruption caused by this delay. We have indicated that we want to keep as near as possible to business as usual for those existing rural development schemes that will continue under the next programme. But we have to take account of the legal and financial issues. Given the changes to the legal basis for the next Programme under the new Rural Development Regulation, our own policy priorities and the ongoing uncertainties over approval, we need to take a prudent approach. For some elements of the programme we shall need to continue our discussions with the EU Commission before we make funding available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para6"><a name="06121257000025">From 1 January 2007, Environmental Stewardship (Entry Level, Organic Entry Level and Higher Level) will remain open to new applications. Successful applicants will be informed that their agreements are provisional. This means that agreements might have to be amended in the light of any changes caused by the EU approval process. However, we do not anticipate any major changes because the schemes were approved in 2005 under the current England Rural Development Programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para7"><a name="06121257000026">The Hill Farm Allowance will also continue in 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para8"><a name="06121257000027">The English Woodland Grant Scheme will remain open to new applications. It is unlikely that contracts will be issued until Programme approval is confirmed, but this will be kept under review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para9"><a name="06121257000028">Under the Energy Crops Scheme there are significant energy crop plantings planned in 2007, which have been carried forward from the existing programme. It is our intention to continue to support energy crop planting under the next Rural Development Programme. Although we will not be able to accept new applications from January, we expect to be in a position to accept applications under the new in summer 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para10"><a name="06121257000029">Responsibility for commitments to socio-economic projects made under the current programme passed to the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) on 1 October this year. This means that the RDAs expect to spend about &#163;34 million between now and October 2008 on ongoing commitments. However, the RDAs will not be able to enter into any new commitments in advance of approval, although they will continue to work with rural businesses to discuss potential future projects. We will keep this approach under review as discussions with the EU Commission proceed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para11"><a name="06121257000030">Further details about what these arrangements mean for our customers will be available on the DEFRA website, and from our delivery partners for the next Programme: Natural England, the Forestry Commission and the RDAs.</p>

<p><a name="st_72"><a name="06121257000031"><a name="61212m0001.htm_spmin2"><a name="06121257000084"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Barry Gardiner):</b> Following DEFRA's consultation earlier this year on the future uplands reward structure in England, we have decided to fully integrate uplands support within environmental stewardship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para12"><a name="06121257000032">We consulted on the basis of moving away from THE compensatory nature of the hill farm allowance and towards a scheme which rewards farmers for maintaining the upland landscape and environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para13"><a name="06121257000033">After reviewing the consultation responses, and taking into account the need for effective planning and implementation, we are now minded to put in place a specific uplands strand to the entry level stewardship scheme by no later than 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para14"><a name="06121257000034">Uplands entry level stewardship will enable us to recognise the key role of upland farmers in delivering many of our environmental and landscape objectives, whilst also enabling us to better target the funding towards the delivery of public benefits. Like ELS, this new uplands strand would be open to all eligible farmers, and would offer a higher payment than ELS to reflect the higher costs of farming in these areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para15"><a name="06121257000035">To ensure fullest environmental benefit, further scoping work is needed with Natural England and stakeholders. There will then be a further consultation on the final scheme design prior to implementation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para16"><a name="06121257000036">Higher level stewardship will of course continue to be available in the uplands, and we will keep the balance of funding between HLS and UELS under review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para17"><a name="06121257000037">In the interim, we will continue to roll forward the hill farm allowance for three years from 2007 to 2009. Moving directly to uplands entry level stewardship from the hill farm allowance will avoid the costs to industry and Government of implementing a separate transitional scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para18"><a name="06121257000038">We also consulted on our plans to reduce the geographic coverage of the hill farm allowance (and future uplands support) by removing the &#147;disadvantaged areas&#148; (DA) from the scheme, thereby focusing uplands support on farms in the &#147;severely disadvantaged areas&#148; (SDA). We propose to do this from 2008. This proposal received general support in the consultation, given that in comparison to the SDA, land in the DA is generally higher grade agricultural land, is more accessible, and producers have more options to maximise the potential of the land. In addition, the single payment scheme will, over time, tend to favour farmers in the DA in comparison to the SDA (since the DA is subsumed within the lowland for the purpose of defining SPS regions and therefore receives a higher flat rate payment than the SDA).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para19"><a name="06121257000039">The money saved by limiting the geographic coverage of the hill farm allowance will be retained within the rural development programme for England, to boost the funds available under environmental stewardship, including in the uplands. We have made a separate announcement today about the contingency arrangements we have put in place to cover the delay to the start of the next rural development programme in England.</p>

It can be viewed as a partial solution to the ongoing shortage of human organs and tissues for transplantation. It can also raise concerns&#151;for the safety of the individual and the wider public, for the efficacy of the procedures, and for the welfare of the animals involved. To date there have been no xenotransplant procedures in the UK, and very few, if any, are anticipated over the next few years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para21"><a name="06121257000044">The Department has reviewed the interim xenotransplantation regulatory arrangements put in place by Ministers in 1997. At that time, the UK xenotransplantation Interim Regulatory Authority (UKXIRA) was established to develop a regulatory framework for xenotransplantation, and to advise Ministers on specific proposals for xenotransplant procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="61212m0001.htm_para22"><a name="06121257000046">UKXIRA was a pioneer in the early debates around xenotransplantation. Its approach has been reflected in a number of international recommendations and developments. In particular, EU legislation on medicinal products (Commission Directive 2003/63/EU) and the Clinical Trails Regulations (2004) make specific provision for xenotransplantation proposals. With these statutory arrangements now in place, UKXIRA has completed its work and it will cease to exist from today, 12 December 2006.</p>
