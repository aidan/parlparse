 On 12 August 2011 the Government announced a change in legislation to prevent tax avoidance. The Government have set out a clear strategy on preventing tax avoidance and will not hesitate to take action to stop those who seek to obtain an unfair advantage by exploiting unintended tax loopholes. This measure demonstrates the Government’s commitment to act quickly to close loopholes when this happens.</p>

In the judgment the Court prescribed a timetable for the introduction of legislative proposals to amend the blanket ban, namely a period of six months from when the judgment became final (which was 11 April 2011).

Those discussions have progressed well and now all bar a handful of landlords are coming to the end of finalising the commercial arrangements that will apply in future. Within the next few weeks, we expect agreements to be signed that will effect the transfer of the business and assets of each home operated by Southern Cross to the new operators. The expectation is that formal transfer of care homes will be achieved in two waves, with around 330 homes transferred at the end of September and the remaining 400 homes transferred at the end of October. At that point Southern Cross will no longer be responsible for providing care anywhere  in the country and the company will be wound up. Throughout, the Government have strongly urged all parties to agree their plans as swiftly as possible so as to offer reassurance to residents, staff and families. The company has informed all Southern Cross staff, together with residents and their families, of these plans in order to provide reassurance.</p>

As the new care operators are settled, their names will be added to the information. Within the next few weeks we expect the complete picture to emerge for each care home, and it will be clear who is the landlord and who is the new operator.

No transfer of homes will take place without new operators having been approved and registered. Alternative operators will need to demonstrate to the regulator that they are capable of delivering high-quality care and of meeting all regulatory standards in the homes they take over. It is important that this process moves quickly and smoothly and, in respect of operators in England, the Care Quality Commission have assured us that they have the resources to complete the necessary regulatory work in time. However, regulators will not lower the regulatory threshold or reduce the rigour of the registration process to achieve that. Standards will not be compromised.</p>
