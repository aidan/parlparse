 As part of the update provided by Budget 2009 on the Government&#146;s tax simplification reviews, the Government committed to consult on further simplification of the associated company rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="91029m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09102931000025">I am today publishing a consultation document to fulfil that commitment. The consultation seeks stakeholders&#146; views on a proposal to reform the associated company rules as they apply to the small companies&#146; rate of corporation tax. The proposed reform aims to benefit businesses by providing a more targeted test to establish those companies whose profits should be considered collectively in establishing the rate of corporation tax that applies to them. Further details can be found in the consultation document, copies of which have been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses and are available on HM Treasury&#146;s website.</p>

It will encourage the UK&#146;s young people to become entrepreneurs, through interactive events that engage those who would not otherwise have considered enterprise. And by connecting British youth with young people abroad, it should increase the level of cultural understanding in the UK.</p>

 I am pleased to announce that implementation of the Armed Forces Act 2006 will be completed and the Act will come into force on 31 October. The legislation establishes for the first time a single system of service law across the armed forces. It preserves the important principle of a separate service justice system, reflecting the particular circumstances of the armed forces, and keeps the commanding officer at the heart of service discipline. It also promotes greater fairness, which in turn supports operational effectiveness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="91029m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09102931000028">The new single, harmonised and modernised system of service law will apply to the personnel of all three services at all times, wherever in the world they are serving.

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="91029m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09102931000029">When the new legislation comes into force, a number of Acts of Parliament will be repealed, including the current Service Discipline Acts (the Army Act 1955, the Air Force Act 1955 and the Naval Discipline Act 1957).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="91029m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09102931000030">The Armed Forces Act 2006 was the largest and arguably the most significant piece of legislation the Ministry of Defence has ever put before Parliament. Its implementation has been a lengthy and complex process, but the new single system of service law that it has established will serve the armed forces well for many years to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="91029m0001.htm_para4"><a name="09102931000031">Guidance on the new service justice system is provided in the &#147;Manual of Service Law&#148;, which is now available on the Armed Forces Act 2006 website at the following link: http://www.mod.uk.

<p><a name="st_56"><a name="09102931000051"><a name="91029m0001.htm_spmin5"><a name="09102931000111"><b>The Minister for Borders and Immigration (Mr. Phil Woolas):</b>
 I am announcing today our intention to make changes over time to our returns policy to Zimbabwe, recognising the different categories of people currently living in the UK. This reflects developments in Zimbabwe following the formation of the inclusive Government led by Prime Minister Tsvangirai.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="91029m0001.htm_para22"><a name="09102931000052">As Prime Minister Tsvangirai has set out, including during his visit to the UK in June, there have been some positive changes in the situation in Zimbabwe over the past six months. While a great deal remains to be done to institute the political and other reforms set out in the global political agreement, the indiscriminate violence which marred the elections of 2008 has abated. And the formation of the inclusive Government has led to improvements in the economy, schools and the availability of basic commodities. In response to this changed situation some Zimbabweans in the UK are considering returning home to help rebuild their country. I consider we should be doing more to help them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="91029m0001.htm_para23"><a name="09102931000053">On 1 February we announced enhancements to the assisted voluntary return (AVR) package for Zimbabweans. AVR packages are available for individuals of all nationalities who are within the asylum system. The standard package provides support to help them reintegrate into their home country, including &#163;4,000 for vocational training, assistance in setting up a business and a flight home. Since February the package for Zimbabweans has been supplemented with an extra &#163;2,000 of reintegration assistance. This includes an additional &#163;500 cash on departure, an extra &#163;1,000 &#147;in kind&#148; assistance for business set up, a &#163;500 basic subsistence package and cholera prevention kits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="91029m0001.htm_para24"><a name="09102931000054">We are today changing the way we deliver our supplementary package for Zimbabweans such that the total value remains the same but, instead of providing the assistance &#147;in kind&#148;, cash payments will now be phased in over a six-month period through the IOM office in Harare. Making cash available to those who go home will support economic reform in Zimbabwe &#151; enabling people to return voluntarily and use their skills to support change and help rebuild Zimbabwe with capital behind them. The scheme will also be extended until 31 December and will be reviewed at that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="91029m0001.htm_para25"><a name="09102931000055">Alongside these changes to our voluntary returns package we have also considered carefully our position on enforced returns to Zimbabwe. We have kept this issue under review since the Home Office first deferred enforced returns to Zimbabwe in September 2006 and the courts have found that not all Zimbabweans are in need of international protection. The UK Border Agency will therefore be starting work over the autumn on a process aimed at normalising our returns policy to Zimbabwe, moving towards resuming enforced returns progressively as and when the political situation develops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="91029m0001.htm_para26"><a name="09102931000056">The agency takes its obligations under the 1951 refugee convention seriously. We will continue to consider each case on its individual merits and where someone needs protection it will be granted. However, we have always expected those found not to be in need of protection to return home. We prefer these individuals to return voluntarily and the enhancements to the AVR scheme will support this, but where they choose not to do so we are bound to take steps, over time, to enforce the law.</p>

While the UK does not participate in the EU visa regime, we do maintain an interest in all visa issues, notably for full reciprocity with third country nationals. The Council then exchanged views on the Canadian decision to impose visas on Czech nationals. The UK believes the Commission should continue to engage with the Canadians to broker a solution.</p>
</ul><a name="91029m0001.htm_brev11"><a name="09102931000088"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Council reached agreement on the draft framework decision on accreditation of forensic laboratory activities, which aims to increase mutual trust in DNA and fingerprint data exchanged between member states by requiring a minimum standard of accreditation.

The Commission stressed the importance of going further than the Council of Europe convention and welcomed the global approach to combating trafficking. It appealed, however, for higher levels of penalties, and for greater assistance for victims. The UK supported the presidency compromise and, despite the UK having very limited extraterritorial jurisdiction, said that it had taken the decision to extend jurisdiction to cover UK nationals who commit trafficking offences abroad given the seriousness of the offences involved.

 The indicative budget for 2010-11, communicated to probation chiefs in February, 2009 was &#163;844 million, compared with a budget of &#163;894 million in 2009-10. This would have been a 5.6 per cent. reduction year-on-year.</p>

prospects for recently qualified probation officers, I can announce today that the confirmed 2010-11 allocation will be &#163;870 million, &#163;26 million more than the original indicative budget. This equates to a reduction of 2.68 per cent. year-on-year. This is consistent with the savings expected across the public service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="91029m0002.htm_para2"><a name="09102931000061">In this economic climate the probation service along with all public services has to achieve efficiency savings. Probation boards and trusts have been required to review their structures, overheads, support services and efficiency levels. This funding will enable probation boards/trusts to review their staffing plans for 2010-11 which will benefit both the September 2009 graduates and the 305 trainee probation officers due to graduate in September 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="91029m0002.htm_para3"><a name="09102931000062">The additional funding will be targeted to increase confidence in community penalties and divert low risk offenders from short term custody. Directors of offender management will be required to negotiate specific service improvements with individual boards/trusts which will be incorporated in SLAs contracts for 2010-11 to ensure that this additional funding is targeted on front line delivery. Detailed work will be undertaken by directors of offender management with areas/trusts to agree additional service delivery requirements and finalise individual allocations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="91029m0002.htm_para4"><a name="09102931000063">The total case load of offenders being supervised by the probation service rose by 53 per cent. between 31 December 1997 and 31 December 2008 (from 159,200 to 243,400). This compares to an overall rise in the probation service budget of 70 per cent. in real terms between 1997 and 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="91029m0002.htm_para5"><a name="09102931000064">The total offender case load has remained stable in recent years. At 31 December 2007 there were 242,700 offenders being supervised, compared to 243,400 at 31 December 2008 and 244,300 at 31 March 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="91029m0002.htm_para6"><a name="09102931000065">The overriding priority for the probation service is public protection which will not be put at risk. Probation areas are looking to make any required savings through back office and management rationalisation and improvements in efficiency and processes, protecting front line delivery.</p>

 My right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, Lord Adonis, has made the following ministerial statement:</p>
<a name="91029m0002.htm_brev0"><a name="09102931000096"><ul><p class="tabletext">The ex-Metronet investment programme covers the upgrade, maintenance and renewal of infrastructure on the Bakerloo, Central, Victoria, Waterloo and City and the sub-surface (Metropolitan, Circle, District, Hammersmith and City) lines. It will deliver nearly 30 per cent. more capacity across the network, improving journey times and reliability.</p>
</ul><a name="91029m0002.htm_brev1"><a name="09102931000097"><ul><p class="tabletext">Following the administration of Metronet in July 2007, its assets and obligations were transferred to Transport for London in May 2008 as an interim measure. The former Mayor and Secretary of State for Transport tasked a Joint Steering Committee consisting of Transport for London (TfL) including London Underground Ltd (LUL), the Department for Transport and HM Treasury with considering a range of options for the permanent structure of the Metronet contracts, with the objective of providing a stable and safe operational framework and delivering the modernisation, upgrade and maintenance of the tube infrastructure at an affordable price that offered value for money for the taxpayer.</p>
</ul><a name="91029m0002.htm_brev2"><a name="09102931000098"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Mayor and I have accepted the committee&#146;s recommendations that the contracts inherited from Metronet should remain under the direct management of LUL as the best value option under the present circumstances, with the majority of upgrades already underway. Some of these contracts have since been renegotiated to secure more favourable terms for LUL. Future contracts will be procured directly by LUL, including robust performance incentives and transferring risk where appropriate. LUL will remain responsible for all asset management decisions, but there will continue to be substantial private sector involvement through the contracts managed by LUL. A decision on the most appropriate contracting arrangement for the Bakerloo line upgrade (which has not yet started) will be taken nearer the time, reflecting lessons learnt from the earlier upgrades.</p>
</ul><a name="91029m0002.htm_brev3"><a name="09102931000099"><ul><p class="tabletext">LUL is investing in its management and organisational capacity and capability in order to meet this new challenge. Organisational restructuring within LUL has also created a clearer separation of client and delivery functions, with a defined sponsor for each project.</p>

The Mayor will establish an independent advisory panel with remit extending across the entirety of the TfL investment programme, including all maintenance, renewal, upgrades and major projects across the modes, but not operations.</p>

The Mayor and I will also agree the panel&#146;s terms of reference. The panel will report to the TfL board and the Mayor as its chair. The members of the panel will have experience in a range of disciplines including engineering, finance and project management, ensuring that as a whole the panel will be able to offer expert advice, opinion and challenge on all aspects of TfL&#146;s investment programme, including the ex-Metronet works.</p>

It will also review delivery of the investment programme at a portfolio level, including management and organisational capability and the efficiency, effectiveness and economy of delivery of the investment programme. The panel will report its findings directly to the TfL board, who will also receive a TfL management response setting out how the issues raised have been or will be dealt with. The panel will commission other reports as it or the TfL board consider appropriate. It will publish an annual report making overall conclusions on the  <br>
