 The Economic and Financial Affairs Council was held in Brussels on 4 March 2008. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury attended for the UK. Items on the agenda were as follows:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="80403m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08040372000032"><i>Implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. Stability and Convergence Programmes: Second series of Member States</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="80403m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08040372000033">Ministers adopted Council opinions on the stability programmes of Austria, Spain, Ireland, Portugal, Greece, Malta, Cyprus, Slovenia, and on the convergence programmes of the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Denmark, and Lithuania. The UK supports a prudent interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) which takes into account the economic cycle, sustainability and the important role of public investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="80403m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08040372000034"><i>Preparation of the European Council (13-14 March)</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="80403m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08040372000036">Following the orientation debate on these documents at the January ECOFIN and further drafting amendments in the Economic Policy Committee and Economic and Financial Committee, Ministers adopted reports which were sent to the spring 2008 European Council. These reports included reformulated draft texts which were endorsed by Heads as part of the launch of the next three-year cycle of the Lisbon strategy. The UK believes that implementation of the Lisbon strategy, including these recommendations, should now be a priority for member states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="80403m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08040372000037"><i>ii) Financial stability</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="80403m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08040372000038">Ministers prepared the spring European Council&#146;s discussion on issues related to financial stability on the basis of a report drafted by the Economic and Financial Committee which examined the causes and possible policy responses to recent financial market turbulence, preparing a contribution for Heads of State and Government on the matter. Ministers agreed that key issues for discussion were: improving transparency, valuation of financial products, strengthening prudential requirements and making markets function better. The UK believes that as a key global marketplace, EU has an important role to play in the international response to market turbulence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="80403m0001.htm_para7"><a name="08040372000039"><i>iii) Sovereign wealth funds</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="80403m0001.htm_para8"><a name="08040372000040">Ministers prepared the spring European Council&#146;s discussion on Sovereign Wealth Funds, following the publication of a communication by the European Commission on the framework for investments made by Sovereign Wealth Funds. The UK welcomes the Commission&#146;s recognition of the benefits of open trade and investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="80403m0001.htm_para10"><a name="08040372000042">Ministers adopted conclusions agreeing the Council&#146;s budget guidelines for the 2009 EC budget. These guidelines are a set of broad principles which are designed to inform the subsequent and more detailed discussions on the level of appropriations required for the different areas of the budget. The subsequent negotiations throughout 2008 will determine the amounts to be spent under each budget heading. The UK supports the conclusions, which place appropriate emphasis on maintaining budget discipline and sound financial management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="80403m0001.htm_para13"><a name="08040372000045">At the March ECOFIN, Ministers had an initial discussion of a Commission Communication on far-reaching changes to the VAT system to help counter fraud. The issue will be re-examined at a future meeting. The UK is strongly supportive of work that will help in the fight against Missing Trader Intra-Community (MTIC) and other VAT fraud, while remaining committed to minimising the burdens on legitimate businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="80403m0001.htm_para14"><a name="08040372000046"><i>Taxation of savings</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="80403m0001.htm_para15"><a name="08040372000047">The European Commission updated ECOFIN on its discussions with Singapore, Hong Kong and Macao with a view to bringing them into the framework of the Savings Directive. The Savings Directive enshrines the principle of exchange of information on taxation of savings and extends beyond the EU through agreements with third countries and territories. The UK strongly supports the Commission&#146;s continued dialogue with these financial centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="80403m0001.htm_para16"><a name="08040372000048">Ministers also discussed the problem of cross-border tax evasion in the context of recent developments concerning Liechtenstein. The Commission offered to bring forward its report on the operation of the Savings Directive and Ministers welcomed this. The EU has an important role to play in combating tax evasion and the Savings Directive is a key instrument in promoting transparency.</p>

I have now been able to add an additional &#163;10 million to this amount, making a total investment of &#163;235 million. This will fund 30 new adventure playgrounds and up to 3,500 inclusive play sites, creating attractive play  areas for children and particularly 8-13 year olds in disadvantaged areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="80403m0001.htm_para19"><a name="08040372000055">I am today announcing the first 20 pathfinder local authorities who will this year begin spending this investment as play pathfinders. Each pathfinder will receive around &#163;2 million capital funding plus approximately  &#163;500k revenue funding over three years. A further 10 pathfinder authorities will be selected in the autumn. In additional 43 other local authorities (LAs) will receive funding from this year to develop play areas in their communities. These LAs will receive capital funding of around &#163;l million over three years. A list of the pathfinders and those LAs benefiting from capital funding this year is attached to this statement. This funding will help them transform play opportunities in their areas in partnership with children, families, communities and the third sector. Over the next three years every local authority will receive substantial capital funding to develop public play areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="80403m0001.htm_para20"><a name="08040372000056">We want local authorities to give a high priority to supporting and promoting outdoor play, with play and public play space being seen as an essential characteristic of every healthy community. That is why, from 2009, we will introduce a new national indicator to monitor progress on what children think about the parks and play spaces in their local area.</p>

The standard route, which will be open to applicants until the end of September, will also encourage applications from those with further to go.

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="80403m0002.htm_para20"><a name="08040372000145">It sets out how pharmacists will work to complement general practitioners in promoting health, preventing sickness and providing care that is more personal and responsive to individual needs. Pharmacists already play a vital role for local communities in dispensing medicines, and providing services such as supporting people who want to give up smoking. This extended role will see more pharmacists being able to prescribe for and deal with minor ailments on the national health service, as well as supporting those with long-term conditions and preventing illnesses through additional screening and advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="80403m0002.htm_para21"><a name="08040372000147">This will enable pharmacies, many of which already open out of hours to provide increased access to the right medicines and the right care, in the right way&#151;more personal and more responsive to individual needs.</p>

Her report, &#147;Review of NHS pharmaceutical contractual arrangements&#148;, which was completed last year, has been placed in the Library and copies are available to hon. Members from the Vote Office. I am most grateful to Mrs Galbraith for the speed and efficiency in which she completed her report and her insights, which have helped shape our thinking as set out in this White Paper.</p>

The Government welcome the intention to clarify and simplify the existing provisions. The proposed changes in the legislation should maintain and improve road safety while minimising the burdens on industry and they should help to reduce distortion of competition through greater levelling of enforcement and compliance between the UK and other EU road haulage and coach operators. However, we have some reservations, particularly in relation to the proposed definition of cabotage, the responsibilities of transport managers and the information to be included in the interoperable national enforcement registers. I will be raising these issues at the Council.</p>

The conclusions broadly welcome the Communication and invite the Commission to devise measures to achieve the efficient operation of international rail freight services along cross-border corridors, mainly through improved co-operation between national infrastructure managers. Key UK concerns with the communication have been addressed satisfactorily in the conclusions: the Commission&#146;s suggestion of giving &#147;priority to international freight&#148; over domestic rail traffic (a problem for the UK and many other member states with mixed, passenger and freight, traffic) has been substituted with a more general objective of &#147;facilitating efficient flows of international rail freight&#148;; the Commission&#146;s apparent preference for new legislation to achieve its objective has been mitigated by an invitation to consider also the consistent implementation and rigorous enforcement of existing EC legislation, alongside new legislation where this may be required; and the Commission has been invited to develop relevant alternative proposals on the basis of an appropriate analysis of their impact and their relative costs and benefits and in accordance with the principles of Better Regulation. The UK can be satisfied with this successful outcome which will enable it to support these Conclusions in Council.</p>

for suppliers at all levels, including SMEs, and robust measures for the control of costs. I believe the current text meets the UK&#146;s objectives. A number of issues remain under negotiation including the role and responsibilities of the European Parliament and ensuring a clear division of tasks between the Commission and the Galileo supervisory authority in the programme. It is possible that some of these will have to be resolved in discussions at Council itself.

We welcome recognition of the need for proportionality in any future European regulation, given the diverse nature of general and business aviation activities.

The Government have consistently argued that the Commission has yet to establish either a compelling need or a robust better regulation case for these proposals. We recognise that the Slovenian Presidency has made a significant effort to reach an agreed compromise on these proposals. Despite this effort, however, the majority of the member states, including the UK, are continuing to voice their strong concerns on both proposals and agreement is unlikely in the near future. There are five other maritime safety measures (ship classification, accident investigation, port-state control, vessel-traffic monitoring and carrier liability) which risk being   <br>

 The Local Transport Bill will empower local authorities to deliver bus services that better meet the needs of their local communities. Among other things, it will enable quality partnership schemes to make more of a difference, by allowing them to cover frequencies, timings and maximum fares where there are no &#147;admissible objections&#148; from &#147;relevant operators&#148;.</p>

 During the debate on the draft Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order in the House of Commons Seventh Delegated Legislation Committee on 23 October 2007, I agreed to commission a review of the likely impacts of the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) on the other UK industries which use tallow as a feedstock.

 The Government are committed to continuing their work to eradicate child poverty and help all individuals reach their full potential by moving from unemployment and welfare dependency to  paid work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="80403m0004.htm_para8"><a name="08040372000295">We announced in the command paper &#147;Ready for Work: Full Employment in our Generation&#148; our intention to require lone parents with older children who can work to look for work. This means that lone parents will no longer be entitled to income support solely on the grounds of being a lone parent. Instead, those who are able to look for paid work will make a claim for jobseeker&#146;s allowance and be required to seek suitable employment actively.</p>

The Government have been working closely with a range of groups who represent the interests of lone parents and has had early advice from the Social Security Advisory Committee. Additional flexibilities to jobseeker&#146;s allowance have been suggested to meet the specific needs of lone parents.</p>
