<p><a name="st_1"><a name="0906152000016"><a name="90615m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="0906152000113"><b>The Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Ed Balls):</b>
 Budget 2009 announced an additional investment of &#163;655 million over the next two years to ensure that every young person aged 16 and 17 who wants to study or take up a training place will have their place guaranteed by the Government under the September Guarantee. &#163;25l million of this investment is being used to fund 54,500 places and additional support for young people from this September, bringing our total investment in the education and training of young people to &#163;6.8 billion in 2009-10.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="90615m0001.htm_para0"><a name="0906152000017">In March, schools, colleges and other training providers told us that the allocations they had received would not meet the increase in local demand they were already experiencing or were expecting from September 2009. Budget 2009 now allows us to provide funding for the additional 32,000 learner places schools and colleges notified us of earlier in the spring, and to make provision for a further 22,500 learners who we expect will want a place in learning later this year. This is necessary for us to meet the September Guarantee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="90615m0001.htm_para1"><a name="0906152000018">I am today announcing the regional breakdown of the &#163;77 million investment which is funding the further 22,500 places. The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has recently notified schools, colleges and training providers of these allocations, which are focused on supporting young people who would otherwise be at risk of becoming NEET (not in employment, education or training).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="90615m0001.htm_para2"><a name="0906152000019">Our investment means we have increased the number of places available this September and next by 54,500 to an all time high of more than 1.55 million. Together with the 17,500 apprenticeships places for young people announced by the Prime Minister, that is 72,000 young people more than were first set out in the LSC&#146;s annual statement of priorities in November 2008. This funding means that we can make sure that young people who are especially vulnerable have a suitable offer of a place by expanding the Entry to Employment programme by 13,000 places in 2009-10.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="90615m0001.htm_para3"><a name="0906152000020">This is a huge investment in the skills of our young people to ensure that they can gain the skills and confidence to put them on the path to economic prosperity and to prepare the country so it is well placed for economic recovery with young people having the skills base it needs. We must make sure that every young person knows the wide range of education and training options open to them under the September Guarantee. We expect the Connexions service, schools, colleges and other providers to work with the local authorities to deliver the Guarantee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="90615m0001.htm_para4"><a name="0906152000021">We know that the recession will continue to have an impact on the choices being made by young people over the summer and may increase demand further for learning and training places. I have therefore asked the Association of School and College Leadership, the Association of Colleges and the LSC to monitor the situation and to report to me after the bulk of the recruitment for the 2009-10 academic year has taken place this September. This will also inform our plans for the 2010-11 academic year and will be crucial as we make the transition from the LSC to local authority led commissioning. I will then make a further assessment of the situation, with my Cabinet colleagues, to ensure all young people who want one can have a suitable place at school, college or training provider.</p>

1. The matching to Local Authority and hence to Region is done on best fit and derived from post code of the head office of the providers to whom the allocation is made. It is possible for these providers to operate across more than one authority area, although there is no double counting of the funding allocations.<br>
2. The figures by region do not include allocations for Entry to Employment provision or apprenticeships.<br>
3. The figures by region do not include any allocations for Academies, SEN, or Teacher Pay Grant.<br>
4. The total figures shown for SEN and Teachers Pay Grant are for the 2009-10 Financial Year as this is how this funding is allocated. As such they are not directly comparable to the other funding figures which are all 2009-10 Academic Year based.<br>

A judgment was handed down in the case of <i>Secretary of State for the Home Department v. AV</i> on 30 April 2009.

Provided that this requirement is satisfied there can be a fair trial notwithstanding that the controlled person is not provided with the detail or the sources of the evidence forming the basis of the allegations. Where, however, the open material consists purely of general assertions and the case against the individual is based solely or to a decisive degree on closed materials the requirements of a fair trial will not be satisfied, however cogent the case based on the closed materials may be.

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="90615m0001.htm_para23"><a name="0906152000098">The Commission was set up by the Scottish Parliament and supported by the UK Government. The Commission&#146;s remit was:</p>

<a name="90615m0002.htm_brev0"><a name="0906152000112"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to review the provisions of the Scotland Act 1998 in the light of experience and to recommend any changes to the present constitutional arrangements that would enable the Scottish Parliament to serve the people of Scotland better, improve the financial accountability of the Scottish Parliament, and continue to secure the position of Scotland within the United Kingdom.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="90615m0002.htm_para0"><a name="0906152000100">The Commission, under the chairmanship of Professor Sir Kenneth Calman, have produced a detailed report, based on sound analysis, a robust evidence base and extensive engagement with people in Scotland. I welcome in particular the efforts the Commission made to engage as widely as possible, through public events across the country, through oral and written evidence, a public questionnaire and through their website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="90615m0002.htm_para1"><a name="0906152000101">I welcome their conclusion that the devolution settlement in Scotland has been &#147;a remarkable and substantial success&#148;. We are approaching the 10th anniversary of the Scottish Parliament receiving full legislative competence, and there is broad support in Scotland and across the UK for the devolution settlement. The Scottish Parliament has established itself firmly in public life, bringing greater accountability to the people of Scotland, and innovation in both policy and working methods.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="90615m0002.htm_para2"><a name="0906152000102">The Government agree with the Commission&#146;s conclusion that, in order to serve the people of Scotland better, and to secure the position of Scotland within the United Kingdom, the institutions of the United Kingdom and Scotland must be able to work together effectively. The Government have already taken steps to reinvigorate the Joint Ministerial Committee and to ensure close working with the Scottish Government, in particular in the face of the global economic downturn. We will consider the Commission&#146;s recommendations in this area carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="90615m0002.htm_para3"><a name="0906152000103">Ten years on, the Scottish Parliament needs to have the financial responsibilities to match its ambitions for Scotland. We asked the Commission to examine the options for improving financial accountability. The Commission outlines a new financial model that would give significantly more responsibility to the Scottish Parliament for decisions on tax and spending in Scotland. The Commission&#146;s model empowers and requires the Scottish Parliament to make a decision on the balance between taxes and public spending. Their recommendations draw from the work of Professor Anton Muscatelli&#146;s group of independent financial experts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="90615m0002.htm_para4"><a name="0906152000104"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="90615m0002.htm_para5"><a name="0906152000105">The Government agree that financial accountability could be achieved by moving to a system where a greater proportion of the Scottish Parliament&#146;s budget comes from their own decisions. We welcome the Commission&#146;s model which provides a promising and well-evidenced basis on which we can work with the Scottish Parliament and others to bring forward practical proposals. The suggested changes are complex, and require detailed and careful consideration. The Government will assess, and explore how to implement, these proposals. We agree with the Commission&#146;s recommendation that any change should be introduced in a phased way to manage the risks of instability in public finances and of windfall gains or shocks and will take this into account in developing proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="90615m0002.htm_para6"><a name="0906152000106">The Commission proposes further changes to the powers and functions of the Scottish Parliament, based on the work of a task group led by Sir David Edward. I am grateful for their careful consideration of this important area. Their work highlights the range and depth of responsibilities which the Scottish Parliament already has. They broadly endorse the existing settlement, but recommend adjustments. The Government are willing to adjust the devolution settlement, where there is benefit to the people of Scotland and where it will strengthen Scotland&#146;s place within the Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="90615m0002.htm_para7"><a name="0906152000107">A steering group comprising parties involved in the Calman Commission process, chaired by myself, will help the UK Government and the Scottish Parliament plan how to take forward the Calman recommendations and deliver stronger devolution within a stronger United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="90615m0002.htm_para8"><a name="0906152000108">The Government warmly welcome this report, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and the Vote Office. I am grateful to Sir Kenneth and the members of his Commission for their work. I look forward to working with colleagues, partners and stakeholders here and in Scotland to take forward the report.</p>

 The Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Amendment Regulations 2009 have today been laid before Parliament. The regulations implement, from 13 July 2009, the recommendation set out in the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council&#146;s report&#151;&#147;Osteoarthritis of the knee in coal miners&#148;. The Command Paper (Cm 7440) was published in August 2008.</p>

Work from 1986 onwards as a coal face worker at a non-mechanised coal face, and for certain other categories of work, can be included in the 10 years&#146; qualifying period.</p>
