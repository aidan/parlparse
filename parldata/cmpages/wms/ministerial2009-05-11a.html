<p><a name="st_2"><a name="0905116000019"><a name="90511m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="0905116000069"><b>The Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs (Mr. Pat McFadden):</b>
 The Government firmly believe that the blacklisting of trade unionists has no place in a modern system of employment relations. Individuals should not be systematically and secretly victimised for their trade union membership and for engaging in the activities of a trade union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="90511m0001.htm_para0"><a name="0905116000020">Section 3 of the Employment Relations Act 1999 contains a power for the Secretary of State to introduce regulations prohibiting the compilation, dissemination and use of lists of trade union members or activists drawn up with the purpose of discrimination in relation to their recruitment and treatment by employers or employment agencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="90511m0001.htm_para1"><a name="0905116000021">We consulted on draft regulations in 2003 but they were not implemented. We took that decision because it was then widely believed that blacklisting of this type had been eradicated in the UK. Following the investigation of the Information Commissioner into the affairs of the Consulting Association (TCA) renewed evidence has come to light. The investigation showed that, within the construction industry, a covert vetting system has operated. My officials have worked closely with the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office (ICO) during its investigation and they have examined the detailed information which the ICO seized from the TCA. We have discovered that much of the information held by the TCA concerned the trade union activities of individuals and gave a very unfavourable account of their suitability for employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="90511m0001.htm_para2"><a name="0905116000022">In the light of these developments, the Government are minded to introduce regulations under section 3 of the 1999 Act. To ensure we have drafted them correctly and taken account of subsequent developments, BERR will launch a short public consultation early this summer seeking views on revised regulations. We will then seek parliamentary approval of the final draft regulations this autumn, bringing them into effect at the earliest opportunity thereafter. This abuse needs to be addressed as a matter of priority and our aim is to ensure that suitably drafted regulations are implemented with the minimum of delay.</p>

This document sets out the Government&#146;s preliminary thinking on possible market, regulatory or legislative changes that may be considered in respect of future insolvencies in the investment banking sector.

 Today my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for the Home Department and I are announcing the publication of &#147;Safer School Partnerships Guidance&#148;.</p>

SSPs, an important part of neighbourhood policing, have a central role to play in supporting the triple track approach of enforcement, prevention and support on which the action plan is based. Taking early action to ensure pupil safety and to prevent young people from being drawn into crime or antisocial behaviour is important for all pupils and for all schools. And every school&#151;not just those in high crime areas or which have serious issues of antisocial behaviour or offending among its pupils&#151;should consider establishing an SSP.</p>

theft and the need to promote media literacy: What steps have member states taken to help develop legal offers and tackle the problems of piracy? How effective have these steps been and are there any lessons that can be learned from the experience gained? In particular: (i) how far is it possible to take Government action without risking the creation of new obstacles to the development of new innovative services, and; (ii) how far is it possible to develop solutions which promote greater variety and better accessibility of legal offer while protecting the interests of rightholders? On media literacy, the presidency asks: How can member states achieve greater awareness on the importance of media literacy, and where do they see added value in possible initiatives at EU level? Our contribution to the exchange of views will outline current UK actions where we think that these are relevant to other member states and the Commission.</p>

The aims of the programme include increasing information exchange, competitiveness and transnational distribution worldwide. It also aims to improve circulation and exposure of audiovisual works, increasing public demand for culturally diverse audiovisual content. The presidency will present a paper outlining the current status of this proposal and will invite discussion and comments from member states.
