<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="70329m0001.htm_para38"><a name="07032949000116">A Local Area Agreement (LAA) is a three-year agreement that sets out the priorities for a local area as agreed between central Government and the local authority and local strategic partnership (LSP).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="70329m0001.htm_para39"><a name="07032949000117">The primary objective of an LAA is to deliver genuinely sustainable communities through better outcomes for local people. As set out in the Local Government White Paper, &#147;Strong and Prosperous Communities&#148;, the Government are strengthening the role of LAAs and placing them at the heart of the new performance framework for local authorities. LAAs will now apply to all outcomes delivered by local government working alone or in partnership with other organisations. The White Paper puts in place a new framework for strategic leadership in local areas, bringing together partners to focus on the needs of citizens and communities. It offers a deal where the local authority and local partners co-operate with each other on agreeing and delivering the improvement priorities for places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="70329m0001.htm_para40"><a name="07032949000118">In 2008 all areas will have moved to a new LAA enabling them to work with even greater flexibility over resources to respond to local priorities. The new LAAs are all about practical solutions for issues which really matter for local people. We are working across Government, with the LGA and with authorities to implement the new arrangements over the course of the next year.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence and I wish to make the following statement to the House about the inquests of servicemen and women who have died overseas which fall within the jurisdiction of the Oxfordshire coroner, Nicholas Gardiner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="70329m0002.htm_para0"><a name="07032949000137">All casualties suffered by the UK armed forces are a source of profound regret. UK service personnel have put their lives on the line to help build strong, stable and democratic nations and protect the interests of the United Kingdom and we cannot pay high enough tribute to the job they are doing, or the sacrifice some of them have made. We are committed to assisting the families of UK Service personnel who have died on operations overseas when their loved ones are returned to the UK.</p>

The inquest &#151; both the investigation into the death and the holding of the public hearing into the death &#151; is conducted by the coroner with jurisdiction which derives from where the body lies. In the case of deaths of servicemen and women whose bodies are flown into Brize Norton military airbase, the Oxfordshire coroner has jurisdiction.</p>

 In my written parliamentary statement of 20 March, <i>Official Report</i>, Col. 38W, I announced that political agreement had been reached at the European level on a new regulation on voluntary modulation which would open the way to the implementation of the new rural development programmes in the UK for the period 2007-2013. The regulation was adopted formally by the Council on Tuesday 27 March.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="70329m0003.htm_para1"><a name="07032949000542">Now that this regulation is finalised, I am able to announce that the overall budget for the next Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) 2007-2013 will be &#163;3.9 billion. As was the case during 2000-2006, funding an ambitious programme of this size is only made possible through continued use of voluntary modulation. Shifting funding from farm subsidies to payments for environmental services&#151;green farming&#151;is consistent with the Government's long term vision for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="70329m0003.htm_para2"><a name="07032949000543">Details of the voluntary modulation and co-financing rates that will apply are as follows.</p>

I attach very high priority to the environmental outcomes we wish to achieve through the Environmental Stewardship Scheme. I am therefore prepared to add a significant amount of national co-financing to voluntary modulation under Axis 2 in order to deliver on these objectives. I shall therefore provide national co-financing for Axis 2&#151;which will account for 80 per cent. of the voluntary modulation funding&#151;at a rate of 40 per cent.

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="70329m0003.htm_para17"><a name="07032949000558">The budget for the next Rural Development Programme in England is constructed from an EU European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) allocation of around &#163;750 million, plus co-financing from the Government (including some state aided expenditure) of around &#163;850 million. As set out above, this will be supplemented with approximately &#163;1.5 billion generated through voluntary modulation (under the new and old voluntary modulation mechanisms), which will be co-financed with approximately &#163;800 million of national funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="70329m0003.htm_para18"><a name="07032949000559">Of this nearly &#163;3.3 billion will be used to achieve environmental outcomes under Axis 2. A further &#163;277 million will be applied to axis 1, which will be used to help make agriculture and forestry more competitive and sustainable, and &#163;277 million will be applied to Axis 3, which will be used to enhance opportunity in rural areas.</p>

Our aim is that this should clear the way for speedy approval of the programme which will enable us to begin the new programme formally in the autumn. Until then, we shall continue to keep the Environmental Stewardship scheme open to new applicants with agreements entered into on a provisional basis.</p>

<p><a name="st_21"><a name="07032949000610"><a name="70329m0004.htm_spmin2"><a name="07032949000708"><b>The Minister for Trade (Mr. Ian McCartney):</b>
 Sir Christopher Hogg, the Chairman of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), is today publishing proposals for consultation on measures to improve the FRC&#146;s internal governance. The Government welcomes this consultation</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="70329m0004.htm_para13"><a name="07032949000611">The FRC is the independent UK regulator and standard setter for accounting, auditing and the actuarial profession. The FRC&#146;s remit was significantly expanded in 2004 as a result of the Government&#146;s review of audit and accounting regulation, following the corporate scandals in the United States and elsewhere earlier in the decade. Its responsibilities were further expanded in 2006 to include actuarial standards and regulation, as recommended by the Morris Review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="70329m0004.htm_para14"><a name="07032949000612">Since his appointment as Chair in January 2006 Sir Christopher has been reviewing the FRC&#146;s internal governance arrangements. While these arrangements have operated well, Sir Christopher has concluded there is now a strong case for changes to enhance the FRC&#146;s transparency, efficiency and independence. The Government agree with Sir Christopher&#146;s view and welcomes the consultation document he is publishing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="70329m0004.htm_para15"><a name="07032949000613">The changes Sir Christopher is proposing include merging the FRC Council, which at around 30 members is a large group, and its management board, to form a single governing body of directors. The new governing body would be larger than the existing six-strong board, to enhance its balance, composition and effectiveness. The majority of the governing body will be non-executive directors, including the Chair and Deputy Chair. In addition, the chairs of the FRC&#146;s operating bodies would become directors for the first time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="70329m0004.htm_para16"><a name="07032949000614">Sir Christopher is also recommending changes to the process for appointing directors to support the new arrangements and ensure the new governing body reflects the range of skills and experience required. At present, the Secretary of State makes all appointments to the Board of Directors, with the exception of the Chief Executive who is appointed by the FRC. Under the new arrangements, the Secretary of State would appoint only the Chair and Deputy Chair of the FRC. The other directors would be appointed by a Nominations Committee chaired by the FRC Chair, through an open and transparent process, following the same principles  <br>

as set out for public appointments by the Office of the Commissioner for public appointments. The committee, guided by a template of the range of skills and experience the board should include, will establish clear, objective criteria for individual appointments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="70329m0004.htm_para17"><a name="07032949000615">The Government believe the FRC has adapted well to its new responsibilities, and that it continues to receive strong support from companies, investors, the accountancy profession and other stakeholders. The Government are therefore confident the FRC under the new governance arrangements will continue to make an essential contribution to ensuring open, efficient and competitive markets and a strong enterprising corporate sector. Corporate reporting and governance in the UK are widely recognised domestically and internationally as being of a very high standard generally. The FRC&#146;s integrated and market-led approach to regulation effectively underpins these standards.</p>
