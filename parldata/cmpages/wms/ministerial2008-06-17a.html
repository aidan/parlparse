 On 10 July 2007, I announced that Sir Peter Williams had agreed to undertake a review of the teaching of mathematics in early years settings and primary schools in England (<i>Official report,</i> columns 1319 and 1320). Today the review&#146;s final report has been published and I have written to Sir Peter Williams to confirm that we will implement the recommendations the review panel has made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="80617m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08061772000016">The review, over the course of almost a year, has explored the important areas of: effective pedagogy of mathematics teaching; the range of provision required for pupils of all ability levels; the Every Child Counts programme&#151;announced by the Prime Minister in May 2007; the conceptual and subject knowledge which should be expected of primary school teachers and early years practitioners; the most effective sequencing and design of the mathematics curriculum; and how parents should be helped to support young children's mathematical development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="80617m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08061772000017">All children should receive the quality of mathematical teaching during their primary school years that ensures they reach their potential and have the opportunity to enjoy mathematics. We must build on the progress made since the introduction of the national numeracy strategy in 1998 and ensure that we address the problem set out in the report that it is culturally acceptable to admit to being poor at mathematics. Raising the profile of mathematics and attainment in all schools will begin to do this. I believe we will achieve this through implementing the key recommendations as follows:</p>
<a name="80617m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08061772000018"><ul><p class="tabletext">there should be at least one mathematics specialist in each primary school, in post within 10 years, with deep subject and pedagogical knowledge, making appropriate arrangements for small and rural schools. Implementation should commence in 2009 and be targeted initially to maximise impact on standards and to narrow attainment gaps. We are investing &#163;24 million in this over the next three years;</p>
</ul><a name="80617m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="08061772000019"><ul><p class="tabletext">local authorities should upskill their field force of mathematics consultants; and</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="80617m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08061772000021">I am placing in the Library a copy of the final report and also the letter I sent to Sir Peter Williams confirming that we will be implementing all recommendations.</p>

Government intend to publish a draft Floods and Water Bill for consultation in 2009.

The UK noted its own efforts in this area and supported the involvement of more Member states in resettlement, but stated it must be a permanent solution, not just a temporary humanitarian evacuation.

The Commission confirmed that it would do so. Member states welcomed the work of the co-ordinator and supported his recommendations. The UK particularly welcomed the focus on radicalisation and recruitment and prioritisation of work with Sahel/North Africa and Pakistan. The UK had launched its national strategy on Prevent the previous week, and would share its experience in leading the workstream on communications. The presidency noted that the new ad hoc Council group on information exchange would contribute to work on counter-terrorism.</p>

Many delegations intervened fully to support the compromise agreement. The Commission stressed that the instrument must come into effect without delay and called on Member states to lift parliamentary reservations as quickly as possible.

With the exception of one member state, which retained a reserve on article 9, all could accept the compromise text and the presidency therefore concluded that a general approach had been reached. The presidency also concluded that the outstanding reserve could be dealt with in a recital to be discussed at a later date.</p>

It is important that senior figures in the public and private sector lead by example in taking a disciplined and restrained approach to pay.</p>

MPs should set the example at a time of public sector pay restraint. The Government will also not be supporting a link between MPs&#146; salaries and the three-month average public sector average earnings index. Instead, the Government propose, in line with an alternative proposal provided by Sir John Baker, that MPs should receive the median average of the settlements of a wide basket of public sector workforces.</p>

 The 30th report of the Review Body on Senior Salaries is being published today. This makes recommendations about the pay of the senior civil service (SCS), senior military personnel, the judiciary and very senior NHS managers. Copies have been laid in the Vote Office and the Library of the House. I am grateful to the Chairman and members of the Review Body for their work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="80617m0002.htm_para2"><a name="08061772000081">The Government have decided to accept all of the main recommendations of the Review Body as they are affordable and consistent with public sector pay policy. They will be implemented with effect from 1 April 2008. The cost of the awards will be met from within existing Departmental Expenditure Limits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="80617m0002.htm_para3"><a name="08061772000082"><i>Senior Civil Service</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="80617m0002.htm_para4"><a name="08061772000083">For the SCS, the Review Body has recommended that for the three year period 2008-2011 there should be an indicative envelope of 7 per cent. pay bill available for normal base pay increases and additions to the pot for non-consolidated bonuses. This multi-year pay arrangement will provide certainty and stability for Departments and the workforce. The Government have decided to accept the recommended 7 per cent. envelope, but believes that the appropriate metric is pay bill per head rather than pay bill. This ensures that in the event of any changes in workforce size individual pay awards remain consistent with public sector pay policy. The envelope for SCS pay increases and bonuses over the next three years will therefore be 7 per cent. of pay bill per head.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="80617m0002.htm_para5"><a name="08061772000084">For 2008-09, the Review Body has recommended a headline award of 1.5 per cent. and a 1 per cent. increase to the size of the bonus pot.</p>
