 The Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr. Lammy) and I have today announced new legislative proposals for asylum reform. We are writing to a number of key stakeholders outlining these proposals and inviting comments. I will be placing copies of this letter in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament and on the IND and DCA websites. The major proposals include: reform of the immigration and asylum appeals system into a single tier of appeal with restricted access to the higher courts; measures to tackle the problem of asylum seekers deliberately destroying or disposing of their documents to make unfounded claims; provisions removing NASS support from families whose claim for asylum has been rejected and enhancing the effectiveness of the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner.
<P>

<a name="31027m01.html_para0">The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 has enabled us to make significant progress in reforming the UK's nationality, immigration and asylum systems. In the asylum system this has meant that the number of people claiming asylum has halved, removals are at record levels and the number of claims awaiting an initial decision is at the lowest for a decade. The Government determined that there should be a balanced approach in asylum and immigration policy so that we bear down on those who would seek to enter the UK illegally and who make unfounded asylum claims, whilst ensuring effective help for refugees who need our protection. Our policy on asylum has to be seen in the wider context of managed migration, through which we are opening up routes for people to enter the UK legally. That is why we are committed to continued reform, as necessary, of the asylum system to ensure that those in need of protection are identified quickly and those who try to exploit the system are prevented from doing so.
<P>

<a name="31027m01.html_para1">We believe that these reforms should be in place as a matter of urgency and will introduce legislation to enact the measures as soon as parliamentary time allows. We are therefore urgently seeking comments from interested parties on the proposals. We would welcome views on the proposals by 17 November.

<a name="31027m01.html_spmin2"><B>The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions   (Mr. Andrew Smith): </B> 
 I laid before the House on 18 November 2002 a consultation document entitled "Pathways to Work, Helping People into Employment" Cm 5690. This outlined a range of proposals to provide more effective support to people with health conditions and disabled people. The Pathways to Work pilots represent the next steps in the Government's strategy of providing people with health conditions and disabilities with the help and support they need&#151;particularly support in helping them into employment. My Department, together with the Department of Health and appropriate Scottish Executive and Welsh Assembly officials, have been preparing for the implementation of the Pilots.
<P>

<a name="31027m01.html_para3">On 26 March I announced the locations of the first three Pathways to Work pilots and on 5 June I subsequently announced the locations of the final four pilots.
<P>

<a name="31027m01.html_para4">Today, I am pleased to announce the launch of the first three pilots&#151;Bridgend Rhondda Cynon Taf; Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, Argyll & Bute; and Derbyshire.
<P>

<a name="31027m01.html_para5">The pilots will provide a range of individual help and support (including new condition management programmes provided by the NHS and a range of financial incentives) for people with health conditions and disabilities. We will fully evaluate the impact of the extra support we are providing.

 I am pleased to announce that, following advice from the Meteorological Office, the annual review of the cold weather payments scheme has now been completed. Amending regulations were laid on 10 October and will come into force on 1 November, in time for the beginning of the winter period.
<P>

<a name="31027m01.html_para6">Six of the weather stations used in the scheme last winter, Bracknell, Dumfries, Dyce, Leeds, Ringway and Redhill are closing and six new weather stations are being introduced at South Farnborough, High Wycombe, Dundrennan, Craibstone, Woodford and Charlwood to provide data for the scheme. In addition to changing two weather station linkages to more

representative links, eight postcode to weather station linkages have been changed on the advice of the Meteorological Office following representations made by hon. Members.
<P>

<a name="31027m01.html_para7">Cold weather payments are separate from, and in addition to, winter fuel payments, which are paid to eligible people from age 60.
<P>

<a name="31027m01.html_para8">I have written to each of the hon. Members affected by the changes.
