<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para3"><a name="07110852000031">As a result of the recent high tempo of operations we have quite rightly seen a greater focus on the support that we offer to our people and their families&#151;both in theatre and at home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para4"><a name="07110852000032">Over the last year we have made significant improvements to the welfare package and to the support that we provide. These include: a rebate on council tax and a tax-free operational allowance for those on operations; an increase in financial support provided for coroners dealing with inquests along with additional support for bereaved families; extension of the mental health assessments and provisions for both veterans and those serving on operations; a commitment to spending &#163;5 billion over the next decade on accommodation; and a significant pay rise for junior soldiers, sailors and airmen and women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para5"><a name="07110852000033">There have been significant improvements to in-theatre medical treatment and facilities and it is widely recognised that we provide first class clinical treatment for those injured through both the NHS and the defence medical services. Better treatment and better equipment mean that our personnel are surviving injuries that they would not have previously survived. As a result we have a number of casualties and personnel sustaining serious injuries who will need enduring support. As a Government we are committed to making sure that the care pathway from initial injury to rehabilitation is as good as it can be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para6"><a name="07110852000034">We also acknowledge that some of the accommodation for service personnel and their families is not up to scratch and we are now rectifying decades of under investment. But we have also said that we want to ensure our forces have the opportunity to get on the housing ladder if they wish and we are looking for the best mechanism to achieve this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para7"><a name="07110852000035">We believe that now is the right time to take stock and for the Government to set out its agenda for service personnel, their families and veterans. Our intention, therefore, is to publish a Command Paper setting out our existing support and in the context of the challenges facing our service personnel today and in the future, the Government&#146;s vision for further support. We believe that we are doing a lot to enhance the support we offer our forces in areas like accommodation, education, health care, family support, transition to civilian life, caring for our casualties. However we can do more in all of these areas and we are committed to doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para8"><a name="07110852000036">We envisage engagement with key external stakeholders from the charity sector and our service families&#146; federations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para9"><a name="07110852000037">Also, we will conduct a parallel study into encouraging greater engagement, understanding and pride in the UK armed forces by the nation as whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para10"><a name="07110852000038">We expect that both these studies will be published in spring 2008.</p>

were consistent with the Government&#146;s overall policy on GM crops, as set out in the parliamentary statement made by the then Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett), on 9 March 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1379.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para11"><a name="07110852000040">A factual summary of the consultation responses has been published on the DEFRA&#146;s website at: http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/gm/crops/index.htm. We are grateful to everyone who responded and have considered the various comments made very carefully. It is clear that before our coexistence plans can be finalised we should await various developments that could have an important bearing on how we move forward. These include the following:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para12"><a name="07110852000041"><i>Receipt of New Scientific Evidence</i></p>
<a name="71108m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="07110852000042"><ul><p class="tabletext">The DEFRA consultation paper noted that new research evidence was expected to come forward for consideration in due course, in relation to crop separation distances in particular. There are three important research projects on coexistence that are due to report by next spring (1 DEFRA-funded and 2 EU-funded). After reflecting on the consultation responses, we are also commissioning some further research to improve the evidence-base in certain areas.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para13"><a name="07110852000043"><i>Seed Thresholds</i></p>
<a name="71108m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="07110852000044"><ul><p class="tabletext">The EU is expected to adopt specific thresholds for labelling adventitious GM presence in conventional seeds. These will dictate what level of GM material might be in the seeds sown by non-GM farmers. This in turn bears directly on what coexistence measures need to achieve, in terms of minimising the potential for further GM transfer into non-GM crops. We should await clarification of what seed thresholds are to be adopted.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para14"><a name="07110852000045">No commercial GM cultivation is expected in England for several years, but it remains our intention to have appropriate coexistence measures in place beforehand. We will clarify in due course how we intend to proceed in the light of the expected developments noted above, and having considered the consultation responses from stakeholders.</p>

 I represented the United Kingdom for the agricultural items at this month&#146;s Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg.

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para19"><a name="07110852000051">The Council held a discussion, based on a presidency questionnaire, on the Commission&#146;s proposal on the reform of the EU wine sector. The discussion covered: the proposed national envelopes; the possible use of national envelope money to fund decoupled payments under the single payment scheme; and the scope of the proposed grubbing-up scheme. I intervened to support the principle of national envelopes, but argued that a greater proportion of funding should be used for rural development measures to help producers adapt to the reform. I also intervened to support the use of national envelope money to enhance payments under the SPS and the proposed voluntary grubbing-up scheme that will provide a dignified way out for those farmers most affected by the greater market orientation of the wine sector following the reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para20"><a name="07110852000052">The Council held an exchange of views on the EU/Norway fisheries agreement for 2008. The UK sought to set responsible levels of fishing while also maintaining the economic viability of the EU fleets involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para23"><a name="07110852000055">Poland called for the introduction of relief measures to alleviate difficulties in the pigmeat sector. The Agriculture Commissioner reported that the Pigmeat Management Committee on 18 October had indeed adopted a proposal to introduce private storage aid from 29 October; as regards export refunds, the Commission did not think that these would be appropriate to address the difficulties faced in the pigmeat sector, although the situation would be kept under review.</p>

 Between 23 and 25 October, I attended the pre-COP ministerial conference of the parties meeting in Bogor, Indonesia. The traditional purpose of the pre-COP ministerial is to narrow down the range of options likely to be discussed at the Conference of the Parties (COP), later in the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para25"><a name="07110852000058">The UN climate negotiations beginning in Bali this December will be crucial if we are to secure a comprehensive international framework by 2009. The Bali meeting must see the launch of broad and comprehensive negotiations that include all parties and all relevant issues. The pre-COP meeting was a valuable opportunity for Ministers who will be negotiating in December to begin to map out and explore the difficult issues and to start building consensus for some of the essential elements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para26"><a name="07110852000059">The meeting was successful. The EU has done a lot of preparatory work on options for the structure of post-Bali negotiations. The meeting helped to test these propositions against the emerging views of other key players and identified where common ground and potential trade-offs exist with other items on the agenda for Bali. It highlighted many points of consensus between 40 parties present on some key issues, such as: the need for a Bali roadmap towards a fair and balanced multilateral framework beyond 2012, and the need for a process under the convention to further explore and negotiate contributions from developing countries to this framework alongside the continuation of negotiations on further commitments for developed country parties under the Kyoto protocol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para27"><a name="07110852000060">These provide a promising foundation for the discussions in Bali, but perhaps even more valuable was the opportunity to get into the detail on the type of process that needs to be put in place at the COP and on substance. Building trust and developing a full understanding of the positions and concerns of other parties on matters of substance is essential if we are to secure an ambitious outcome in Bali.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para28"><a name="07110852000061">There is now considerable support for launching broader negotiations but there is also a range of views about what those broader negotiations could look like. Some parties are committed to securing one process encompassing all the current tracks in the negotiations on future action, while others want to see the convention and Kyoto tracks remain separate, at least for now. Likewise, there was emerging agreement on key elements of an international framework; mitigation, adaptation, technology and investment and finance, although the full details of these four elements and what they might encompass are not universally agreed. Further negotiations will also be needed in order to secure an overall end date of 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="71108m0001.htm_para29"><a name="07110852000062">It is now essential that we follow up this positive meeting with intensive outreach to our key partners and interlocutors in order to iron out these crucial details and the UK will be carrying out an extensive lobbying effort, both at ministerial and official level, to give the last vital push before Bali.</p>

 The Government are launching the face-to-face guidance pilot project which was announced as part of a package of measures in The Welfare Reform Green Paper, "A new deal for welfare: Empowering people to work" which was published in January 2006 and aimed at increasing the employment rates of people aged 50 and over. Further reference was made in the Pensions White Paper of May 2006 "Security in Retirement towards a New Pensions System" which re-emphasised the importance of providing information and communicating choices to individuals. The pilot project is being carried out to establish what information older people need and how they can access it in order to take an informed decision about work and retirement in later life. Existing services are not providing the information that older individuals tell us they need when considering options about working longer. The information will focus on the choices and opportunities available to older people to help them plan how and when to retire as well as making use of flexible working options to help them remain in work or work for longer. The expectation is that better information will support extended working lives. The pilots will be evaluated over the operating period to inform the development of good practice for Government and non-government organisations to use in the guidance  <br>
