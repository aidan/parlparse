 I have today agreed to the publishing of "The Insolvency Service's Corporate Plan" for the period 2010-11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="100325m0001.htm_para0"><a name="10032542000053"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="100325m0001.htm_para1"><a name="10032542000054">As a result of changes in public behaviour, with individuals increasingly opting for voluntary insolvency and bankruptcy procedures, the Insolvency Service is planning in 2010-11 to deal with a level of new compulsory insolvency cases within a range of 71,500 to 80,000, significantly less than was predicted in 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="100325m0001.htm_para2"><a name="10032542000055">The service is also planning to deal with a range of 120,000 to 150,000 redundancy payments and other insolvency-related claims during 2010-11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="100325m0001.htm_para3"><a name="10032542000056">The service's "Enabling the Future" programme, a major programme of IT-led investment, and its service transformation plan to implement online services and improve its customers' experience, will deliver significant savings for the service and its customers over the next five years. In 2010-11 the service will review its long-term fees strategy, with a view to reducing its bad provision and the use of BIS funding to cover working capital. This will enable the service to achieve a real-terms reduction in insolvency case administration fees of 2.5 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="100325m0001.htm_para4"><a name="10032542000057">Action will continue to be taken against bankrupts and company directors in respect of financial misconduct or dishonesty and the service will continue to investigate the affairs of companies in the public interest. In 2009 the service undertook a new stakeholder satisfaction survey for confidence in its enforcement regime, achieving an overall confidence level of 68 per cent. I have asked the service at least to maintain this level during 2010-11 and I have also set a target in relation to the timeliness of instigating disqualification proceedings in appropriate cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="100325m0001.htm_para5"><a name="10032542000058">I have set targets in relation to the timeliness of releasing reports to creditors in bankruptcy and insolvency cases, and of processing claims for redundancy payments. Also, a target has been set in relation to the overall satisfaction levels of the service's users.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="100325m0001.htm_para6"><a name="10032542000059">The corporate plan will be available from 1 April 2010 at: http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/aboutus/Corporate Plan.pdf</p>

 I am publishing today for consultation a prospectus setting out our detailed plans for reforming council housing finance in England. My objective in doing this is to dismantle the Housing Revenue Account Subsidy system which was introduced in 1935 and has operated in its current form since 1989. I want to replace it with a devolved system of responsibility and funding for council housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="100325m0001.htm_para38"><a name="10032542000129">I want to provide more flexibility in finances and more transparency in the operation of the system. I want to devolve control from central to local government. And, in return, I want to increase local responsibility and accountability for long term planning and housing management to meet the needs of local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="100325m0001.htm_para39"><a name="10032542000130">The current redistributive Housing Revenue Account Subsidy system has a long history and a clear rationale. Councils have different spending needs and different capacities to raise income. Without redistribution, some councils would have to charge higher rents or deliver lower quality services. But the annual uncertainty of subsidy decisions has inhibited long-term planning and asset management and it has meant that council landlords are less accountable to their tenants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="100325m0001.htm_para40"><a name="10032542000131">On 30 June 2009 I announced the Government's proposals for replacing the centralised annual subsidy system with a devolved self-financing system. Under this, councils will finance their own housing from their own rents, in exchange for a one-off redistribution of housing debt to make the settlement financially neutral between central and local government. Freeing councils from the annual funding decisions in the current system will enable them to plan long-term, secure greater efficiencies and improve the management of their homes and the quality of service to their tenants. This reform involves 1.8 million homes, 177 councils and a total annual budget of over £6 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="100325m0001.htm_para41"><a name="10032542000132">The consultation on our broad proposals ended on 27 October 2009. We received 223 responses showing strong support for our proposed system of self-financing, which many in local government have been calling for over many years. Since then we have worked closely with local authorities, experts and representative bodies in a Government-led project group to develop soundly based and detailed proposals. I am grateful to all those who have contributed to this work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="100325m0001.htm_para42"><a name="10032542000133">The detailed plans I am publishing today for local self-financing and management mean 4.2 million people living in council homes will have landlords with more money to maintain their homes and neighbourhoods. This reform will guarantee tenants whose homes have been upgraded through the Government's Decent Homes programme that their homes will be maintained at least to this standard for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="100325m0001.htm_para43"><a name="10032542000134">I can confirm the detailed principles and terms on which our plan for this self-financing settlement is based. These include:</p>
<a name="100325m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="10032542000322"><ul><p class="tabletext">All councils will have at least 10 per cent. more each year to spend on managing, maintaining and repairing their homes-the equivalent of over £500 million more per year nationally. This deals with the underfunding for maintenance which was identified in the review of Council Housing Finance last year.</p>
</ul><a name="100325m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="10032542000323"><ul><p class="tabletext">There will be a one-off distribution and allocation of debt between local authorities in order to put all councils in an equal position to support their stock from their future income without the need for annual subsidy. The total debt that is supported in the current system will be around £21.48 billion by April 2011. The value of the stock under self-financing using our lead option of a 7 per cent. discount rate is £25.13 billion. This means there will be a net receipt for Government of around £3.65 billion at the point of the self-financing settlement, making this settlement neutral between central and local government.</p>
</ul><a name="100325m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="10032542000324"><ul><p class="tabletext">All rents and receipts from sales of houses and land within the HRA will be retained in full by the local authority.

I have now made social housing grant available to local authorities and released funding for two rounds of local authority new build schemes. As a result, we have underway this year, with the first round funding, schemes to build over 2,000 new council houses, the largest council house building programme for nearly two decades. In total over 87 councils, led by all political parties, will start more than 4,000 homes over this year and next.</p>

My plans set the self-financing settlement with a 7 per cent. discount rate at a level which will give councils, after they have met the spending needs to manage and maintain their existing homes, the capacity to fund 10,000 new council homes each year from 2014-15-a five-fold increase in the council house building programme in the current   <br>

year; this would generate over 20,000 jobs and over 1,000 apprenticeships. Councils will be able to build new homes without increasing local authority borrowing once the self-financing settlement is in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para1"><a name="10032542000137">I am looking to establish as part of this consultation whether local authorities have the will to use this funding capacity to build new homes to help meet local housing needs. The response of local government to this challenge in the consultation will help us determine whether our lead option of a 7 per cent. discount rate is appropriate for the final terms of the self-financing settlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para2"><a name="10032542000138">The Government are totally committed to completing the Decent Homes programme and recognise that £3.2 billion of works are still needed to meet their Decent Homes commitment. Meeting this investment need will therefore be a central element of their decisions on investment priorities at the next spending review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para3"><a name="10032542000139">Self-financing will fundamentally change the relationship between central Government and local authority landlords. It both strengthens local accountability and creates a more strategic relationship between local authorities and central Government. Today's consultation makes proposals for improving the accounting and financial framework within which self-financing will operate. This will provide assurances that, there will be sufficient safeguards for tenants and local and national taxpayers, under a devolved financing system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para4"><a name="10032542000140">The settlement will provide councils with the resources they need for effective management of their housing without recourse to further borrowing. Because of this, we will set a cap on the borrowing each local authority can service from the HRA, based on the opening debt. The prospectus sets out details for the calculation of this cap. It is a fiscally prudent deal which protects the interests of tenants and taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para5"><a name="10032542000141">This is a once and for all settlement. Any major future policy changes would need also to take into account the financial consequences as an additional consideration and funding transaction. If this plan and the terms set out in the prospectus are broadly accepted by local authorities, this devolved system of financing and accountability could be in place by 2011-12 through a voluntary agreement between Government and councils. If not, legislation will be required, delaying implementation by at least a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para6"><a name="10032542000142">I hope local authorities will seize this opportunity for radical reform of the HRA subsidy system which they have long criticized, and this opportunity to build new council homes for their local communities.</p>

 This statement concerns council tax and the action the Government propose to take in relation to authorities that have set excessive budget requirements for 2010-11.</p>
<br>


<meta name="Date" content="25 Mar 2010">

<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>25 Mar 2010 : Column 51WS</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para9"><a name="10032542000146">Yesterday my Department released figures showing that the average band D council tax increase in England next year will be 1.8 per cent.-the lowest ever average increase. This is welcome news for council tax payers and has been made possible by concerted action by both Government and local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para10"><a name="10032542000147">The Government have ensured that all authorities overall have benefited from good grant increases during the current three-year settlement period, with above inflation grant increases in all of the years of the current three year settlement-including an increase of 4 per cent. overall in 2010-11. This, combined with rigorous enforcement of the "new burdens doctrine" and action to cap excessive council tax increases in previous years, has helped ensure that 2010-11 will see the lowest average increase in council tax since its introduction in 1993-94.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para11"><a name="10032542000148">Local government has also played its part. It is clear from the figures that most authorities have behaved responsibly and taken into account the effect of their 2010-11 increases on council tax payers. A number of authorities have frozen or reduced their council tax. In many cases, they will have made tough choices about local priorities and delivered efficiency savings to do this. I commend these authorities for working hard to keep demands on council tax payers to a minimum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para12"><a name="10032542000149">Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that council tax payers are protected from excessive increases. All authorities are aware that the Government are prepared to use its capping powers to achieve this. In my statement to the House on the provisional local government finance settlement made on 26 November 2009, I made clear we would take action against excessive rises where necessary. I restated this in a letter to all local authority leaders dated 9 December 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para13"><a name="10032542000150">Where council tax payers are faced with excessive increases it is right that we should once again take action to protect them. I am therefore setting out for the House the action that we are proposing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para14"><a name="10032542000151">Our capping principles are that an authority's 2010-11 budget requirement is excessive if:</p>
<a name="100325m0002.htm_brev0"><a name="10032542000328"><ul><p class="tabletext">the amount calculated by the authority as its budget requirement for the financial year 2010-11 is more than 3.5 per cent. greater than the authority's budget requirement for the financial year 2009-10; and</p>
</ul><a name="100325m0002.htm_brev1"><a name="10032542000329"><ul><p class="tabletext">the amount calculated by the authority as its band D council tax for the financial year 2010-11 is more than 4.5 per cent. greater than the authority's band D council tax for 2009-10.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para15"><a name="10032542000152">An authority must exceed both the budget requirement principle and the council tax principle to be subject to capping action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para16"><a name="10032542000153">Two authorities-the police authorities of Greater Manchester and Nottinghamshire-have exceeded these principles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para17"><a name="10032542000154">The action the Government have decided to take against these authorities is to cap both in advance for 2011-12. The Government are minded to propose a maximum budget requirement ("a cap") for 2011-12 for each authority at a level which is equivalent to a council tax increase of around 4.5 per cent. for each of the financial years 2010-11 and 2011-12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para18"><a name="10032542000155">The statutory process involved is that at this stage the Secretary of State "nominates" the authorities under section 52D of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 ("the Act") and decides whether to "designate"  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="25 Mar 2010">

them in advance for 2011-12 under section 52L of the Act. In due course, the Secretary of State will designate the authorities under section 52M of the Act and propose a cap for each authority for 2011-12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para19"><a name="10032542000156">This action means that the authorities will not need to undertake rebilling in 2010-11, but council tax payers in those areas can be reassured that action is being taken to restrict these authorities' council tax increases in 2011-12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para20"><a name="10032542000157">My officials are writing to both authorities today to inform them of their nomination and of the Secretary of State's decision to designate them in advance for 2011-12. However, the authorities will not be designated and informed of their proposed caps for 2011-12 until later in the year. This will be at around the same time as the provisional local government finance settlement for 2011-12 is announced. At that point, the authorities will have 21 days in which to challenge their proposed 2011-12 caps and raise any specific issues which they feel justify a different capping level. Any challenge will be carefully considered before a final decision is taken on the capping level for 2011-12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para21"><a name="10032542000158">If an authority accepts its proposed cap for 2011-12 without challenge, a notice can be issued to the authority confirming its cap. Otherwise, a draft order will be laid for the approval of the House before any 2011-12 cap can take effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para33"><a name="10032542000173">The type 26 Combat Ship will provide the backbone of the Royal Navy's future surface combatant force from early in the next decade. We envisage it being optimised for anti-submarine warfare, providing protection to maritime task groups, the strategic deterrent, and land forces in the littoral environment though it will also be able to operate in a wide variety of other roles, able to deploy an embarked military force by boat or helicopter, undertake surveillance and intelligence gathering activities, conduct counter-terrorism and counter-piracy operations, and support disaster relief and humanitarian operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para34"><a name="10032542000174">The assessment phase will be a £127 million, four-year contract with BAE Systems Surface Ships that will deliver a cost-effective ship specification for development and manufacture. Among other things, it will examine whole life costs, consider the potential for international export, develop tailored logistic support arrangements and produce a full ship specification for consideration prior to the main investment decision. In doing so, this work will protect skills and employment in the warship design sector and maintain a key industrial capability for the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para35"><a name="10032542000175">We have delayed proceeding with this work until the recent planning round was completed, and any further significant delay would increase the risk that we would be unable to maintain the maritime industrial workload at a cost-effective level once carrier manufacturing is past its peak. It would also increase the risk of our having to retire the type 22 and 23 Frigates before the type 26 is ready to replace them. However, to ensure that we can incorporate any changes to the design or concept of operations that might result from the strategic defence review (SDR), a mid-programme review point has been included as part of the work.</p>

We announced our intention to negotiate a so-called TOBA with Babcock Marine in 2007 following the acquisition of Devonport Management Ltd by Babcock International Group, and it has been under negotiation for many months. This agreement will guarantee Babcock Marine's role as our lead industrial partner for submarine support, maintenance and decommissioning, and our preferred supplier for engineering and other services for surface warships and submarines at Her Majesty's Naval Bases Devonport and Clyde. Babcock Marine will also continue to advise the Ministry of Defence on the initial phases of submarine dismantling options and will play a more active role in Through-Life Capability Management for the Royal Navy's fleet, ensuring maximum availability and value for money in the support of future warships and submarines.</p>

These savings will flow from performance improvement and efficiency measures enabled by long-term confidence, and will be embedded in the contracts for goods and services that will be negotiated within the framework of the agreement. I would emphasise that, because the agreement will not guarantee a specified level of work, we can be confident that the choices available in the SDR will not in any way be constrained but by proceeding now we will ensure that we can start delivering the savings envisaged as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para38"><a name="10032542000178">The Government have also made a contractual commitment to proceed with the initial build of Astute Boat 5 and long-lead procurement activities associated with Astute Boat 6, at a total cost of over £300 million. This commitment is necessary now to ensure a consistent workload for the UK's submarine building industry. This investment will allow the timely delivery of the Astute class boats, which are the biggest and most advanced attack submarines ever ordered for the Royal Navy. Furthermore, since the same industrial skills, experience and capability are necessary to deliver the successor deterrent submarine programme, this investment will play a part in ensuring a smooth transition from the Astute programme to the successor deterrent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="100325m0002.htm_para39"><a name="10032542000179">These decisions demonstrate the Government's commitment to the long-term future of the Royal Navy and the UK's maritime defence industry. They will deliver vital defence capability and sustain a world class, efficient sovereign maritime industry.</p>

 I wish to inform the House today of the findings of the Royal Air Force service inquiry into the crash of the RAF Tornado F3, ZE 982, on 2 July 2009 into a mountainside in Argyll, Scotland. Tragically, both the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Kenneth Thompson, and the navigator, Flight Lieutenant Nigel Morton, were killed. Our deepest sympathies remain with their families and friends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="100325m0003.htm_para0"><a name="10032542000182">The purpose of a service inquiry is to establish the circumstances of the loss and to learn lessons from it; it does not seek to apportion blame. The service inquiry was convened on 3 July 2009 and has now presented its findings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="100325m0003.htm_para1"><a name="10032542000183">The service inquiry found that Tornado ZE 982 was the lead of a pair of Tornado F3 aircraft flying a routine low level training sortie out of RAF Leuchars on 2 July 2009. From the accident data recorder information available to them, the service inquiry was able to identify the sequence of airborne events and concluded that the cause of the accident was controlled flight into terrain due to insufficient turning room being available within the valley to complete the turn. Effectively, once the aircraft had entered into the final turn it was all but impossible to achieve the turn safely. As a consequence, the aircraft crashed into the north slope of Glen Kinglas,  <br>

Argyll, 14 minutes after take-off. The second Tornado crew witnessed the crash and took immediate recovery action, in due course returning safely to RAF Leuchars. The service inquiry concluded that the aircraft's flying control systems, engines and structure were serviceable and all critical systems operated correctly during the sortie and that there was no evidence to prove that any equipment issues caused the aircraft's loss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="100325m0003.htm_para2"><a name="10032542000184">The inquiry findings serve to demonstrate that military flying is never without risk and that low level flying presents additional challenges.</p>

<p><a name="st_51"><a name="10032542000207"><a name="100325m0003.htm_spmin4"><a name="10032542000393"><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Gillian Merron):</b>
 We are today laying before Parliament the Government's response (Cm 7857) to the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee report on Nanotechnologies and Food, which was published on 8 January 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="100325m0003.htm_para20"><a name="10032542000208">Nanoscience and nanotechnologies have advanced in recent years to the stage where there are a range of innovative products on the market that contain nanomaterials, ranging from cosmetics to surface coatings for glass. While developments in the food industry are generally at an early stage, applications of nanotechnology in this sector have the potential to bring about benefits to both industry and consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="100325m0003.htm_para21"><a name="10032542000209">The Science and Technology Committee's inquiry is therefore timely and their report provides a detailed and extremely thorough analysis on a range of issues including support for innovation, research into health and safety implications, regulation and public engagement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="100325m0003.htm_para22"><a name="10032542000210">The Government's response welcomes the Committee's report and its recommendations. Some of the issues that have been raised by the Committee are specific to food while others are wider in scope. The Food Standards Agency has therefore liaised closely with other Government Departments-the Departments for Business, Innovation and Skills, and for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs-in considering the Committee's recommendations and developing the overall response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="100325m0003.htm_para23"><a name="10032542000211">In several places the response cross-refers to the Government's UK Nanotechnologies Strategy "Small Technologies, Great Opportunities", which was published on 18 March 2010. The Government's position on nanotechnologies is set out in the strategy as follows:</p>
<a name="100325m0003.htm_brev15"><a name="10032542000360"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The UK's economy and consumers will benefit from the development of nanotechnologies through Government's support of innovation and promotion of the use of these emerging and enabling technologies in a safe, responsible and sustainable way reflecting the needs of the public, industry and academia".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="100325m0003.htm_para24"><a name="10032542000212">This approach applies equally in the food sector, where the role of public engagement is of particular importance. The Committee rightly highlights the heightened public sensitivities about new food technologies and the value of effective public communication and openness. Therefore, in addition to taking forward the other recommendations in the report, the Food Standards Agency will be working closely with industry, consumer groups and other stakeholders to ensure that the public have accurate and impartial information about the way that nanotechnologies are being applied to food.</p>

 On 15 December 2009 I announced the establishment of the Hillsborough Independent Panel and the appointment of the Right Reverend James Jones, Bishop of Liverpool as the panel's chairman. The appointment of seven panel members was announced in my written statement of 26 January 2010.</p>

 My written ministerial statement of 10 December 2009, <i>Official Report</i>, column 31WS reported the conclusions of the work programme set in train following the Privy Council review of January 2008, to implement the use of intercept as evidence, consistent with protecting the public and national security. This concluded that the "PII Plus" model of IAE, recommended for further work by the Privy Council review, would not be legally viable, and would worsen rather than enhance our ability to bring the guilty to justice.

 My right hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Ed Balls) and I welcome the report published today, "Safeguarding the Future: A Review of the Youth Justice Board's Governance and Operating Arrangements" (the YJB Review). This highlights the significant improvements in youth justice since 1998, as well as making important recommendations for the future. We are grateful to Dame Sue Street and Frances Done for their thoughtful and thorough analysis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para15"><a name="10032542000248">The creation of the Youth Justice Board (YJB) and pioneering multi-agency youth offending teams through the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 is described by the YJB Review as "amongst the most significant [reforms]   <br>


<meta name="Date" content="25 Mar 2010">

<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>25 Mar 2010 : Column 64WS</b><br>
ever made to the criminal justice system". The 1998 Act brought co-ordination and consistency to the previously ineffective and disparate system that was so heavily criticised by the 1996 Audit Commission report, "Misspent Youth". Crucially, for the first time it put in place a distinct, formal structure for dealing with young offenders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para16"><a name="10032542000249">Now, instead of pulling in different directions, the police, social services, schools and local authorities are working closely together to protect the public through prevention and where that fails, punishment and reform. One key focus is on tackling problems before they are allowed to take root, challenging bad behaviour before it escalates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para17"><a name="10032542000250">At the same time, there are also serious consequences for those who do offend. Custody must remain an option open to sentencers for serious and persistent offenders or those who fail to respond to other interventions. We have also expanded the range of community punishments to hold young offenders to account where appropriate and to make them give redress to the communities they have wronged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para18"><a name="10032542000251">All this work is underpinned by the £100 million youth crime action plan, which has already impacted on more than 300,000 young people, as well as a new sentencing framework, the "Youth Rehabilitation Order", which combines rigorous punishment with interventions to help young offenders to reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para19"><a name="10032542000252">The evidence suggests that this approach is having an effect: the number of young people entering the criminal justice system has fallen by over 12 per cent. between 2000-01 and 2008-09; the frequency rate of reoffending has fallen by nearly a quarter between 2000-2008; and, the number of young people sentenced to immediate custody has also fallen significantly over this period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para20"><a name="10032542000253">This progress is encouraging. The Youth Justice Board has played an important part, for which it deserves credit. However, we want to achieve a further step change: fewer victims, less reoffending, the best outcomes delivered across the country. That is why we commissioned a review of the Youth Justice Board in September 2009, and why we accept the review's message that the YJB needs to achieve a stronger grip on performance, provide clearer direction, and give the best value for public money. The current leadership have shown themselves to be ready to rise to this challenge. We accept the review's recommendation that the board should build on its strengths and reinvigorate its role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para21"><a name="10032542000254">As today's report highlights, protecting the public must be clearly recognised as the first priority within an integrated approach that improves outcomes for young people. This is central to our approach to justice. We accept the recommendation that the YJB should further emphasise and publicise its role in protecting the public from youth crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para22"><a name="10032542000255">The review makes clear the importance of strong partnership working between the YJB and central Government and makes a number of important recommendations to strengthen this further. We will seek to implement these immediately, building on the successful work through the youth crime action plan. We agree that the Home Office should have greater involvement in that partnership working with the YJB and its sponsoring departments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para23"><a name="10032542000256">We will now develop proposals for putting into practice all the review's recommendations. We will examine how  <br>

to achieve the Youth Justice Board's purpose and objectives with the best value for money for the tax-paying public and publish a detailed response in the summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para24"><a name="10032542000257">We will build on our success in preventing crime and reducing reoffending. The Youth Justice Board will continue to ensure there are sufficient places in secure accommodation for the most serious, persistent young offenders. And where there are weaknesses in performance, the board will focus considerable attention on monitoring and raising standards in local areas, on holding local authorities and providers of youth justice services to account, and on spreading best practice across the country. The review makes clear that there is more to do in this respect. We accept that and will immediately work with the YJB to ensure it happens. The board will be strengthened in its role through provisions in the Children, Schools and Families Bill which give the Government the power to intervene directly in poorly performing youth offending teams.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para25"><a name="10032542000258">The best partnership working should be shared and built upon across the country.

 Following a general debate on 22 February, the House resolved 11 motions without a vote giving effect to many recommendations in the First Report of the House of Commons Reform Committee, Session 2008-09, "Rebuilding the House" (HC 1117). On 4 March 2010 after a further debate on outstanding issues, further motions were approved.

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para26"><a name="10032542000260">In order to give effect to these resolutions, I have tabled motions which appear in today's order paper to create and amend Standing Orders to give effect to the recommendations relating to the establishment of a Back-Bench business committee, namely to set the process for election and procedural conduct of the committee, to allocate time for Back-Bench proceedings and to define Back-Bench business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para27"><a name="10032542000261">The Reform Committee has proposed its own motion following the decisions of the House on 4 March. The Reform Committees motion differs from the decisions of the House in the following ways:</p>

No voting system was agreed to by resolution of the House. The Government's Standing Order provides a method analogous to that agreed by the House for other Select Committees, allowing for a balance of parties and to guarantee some representation of women and men.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para29"><a name="10032542000263">Adoption of the agenda-The Standing Order proposed by the Committee provides for the Back-Bench business committee's report to be agreed to by the House on a  <br>

Question put forthwith. This was not agreed to by resolution of the House. The Government's Standing Order provides for the Back-Bench business committee to schedule business directly within the time allocated to it (as the Opposition does on Opposition days).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para30"><a name="10032542000264">Number of allotted days-The Standing Order proposed by the Committee provides for thirty-five days or its equivalent to be allotted in each session for proceedings in the House on Back-Bench business. The Government's Standing Order provides for one day a week or its equivalent, which reflects the specific wording of the recommendation (30) of "Rebuilding the House" to which the resolution agreed by the House referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para31"><a name="10032542000265">Topical Debates-The Standing Order proposed by the Committee would remove current limits on speaking time for Front-Bench spokespeople. This was not agreed to by resolution of the House. We would seek to retain them but to remove the requirement for a Minister to open the debate so that a Back-Bencher can do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para32"><a name="10032542000266"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para33"><a name="10032542000267">Westminster Hall -The Committee proposes that Thursday sittings in Westminster Hall should be available to the Back-Bench business committee, subject to 20 days being at the disposal of the Liaison Committee. The scheduling of business in Westminster Hall is currently a matter for the Chairman of Ways and Means, not the Government. As the Committee's proposal was not specifically agreed by resolution of the House, the Government motion maintains the status quo for business off the floor of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para34"><a name="10032542000268">Private Members' Bills-The Committee Standing Order would allow the Back-Bench business committee to programme Private Members' Bills.

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="100325m0004.htm_para35"><a name="10032542000269">Because these changes to Standing Orders do no more than give effect to the changes the House has agreed by resolution, I recommend the House to agree them without further debate.</p>

 In January 2009, my right hon. Friend the Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon) the then Secretary of State for Transport announced the launch of a second round of Kickstart bus funding.

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="100325m0005.htm_para1"><a name="10032542000306">The scheme was launched with funding of £25 million, this has been revised to £15 million.

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="100325m0005.htm_para2"><a name="10032542000307">Kickstart is targeted at schemes which have the potential to become successful but which initially might be more marginal in commercial terms and require some financial help to start them off, or which are currently marginal schemes that with some extra support could be made more successful.</p>

It will also contribute to objectives on improving accessibility and social inclusion. This round focused on schemes which make use of the new bus powers in the Local Transport Act 2008. We hope this will allow us to build up good practice on the use of these powers to promulgate to other local authorities and operators.</p>

 I am making this statement with my hon. Friend the Minister of State for Borders and Immigration, the member for Oldham East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas), as part of a joint programme of work between the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and the United Kingdom Border Agency under the auspices of the immigration enforcement strategy "Enforcing the Deal".</p>

There is already strong operational co-operation between DVLA and the UK Border Agency to prevent identity and immigration fraud by foreign nationals. The Government's strategic objective is to move to a position where possession of an identity card for foreign nationals issued under the UK Borders Act 2007 becomes a qualifying criteria for non-EEA nationals wishing to obtain a UK driving licence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="100325m0005.htm_para5"><a name="10032542000311">As a preliminary measure, I am informing the House that from today those applying for a provisional as well as full driving licence will have to demonstrate that they are lawfully resident in the UK, not simply lawfully present, in order to qualify for a driving licence. Those who are present in the UK on temporary permission or temporary release under the Immigration Act 1971 will not be considered eligible for a driving licence. Those granted leave to enter or remain in the UK for at least 185 days will continue to be able to apply for a licence while their leave is extant, provided they otherwise qualify.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="100325m0005.htm_para6"><a name="10032542000312">It is right that those whose status remains undecided and those without leave should not be seeking to establish the benefits of ordinary settled life in the UK, including access to driving licences.
