<p><a name="st_94"><a name="08121648000025"><a name="81216m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="08121648000188"><b>The Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. John Hutton):</b>
 The House will be aware of widespread public concern over the thirty-seven deaths of British servicemen and women in Iraq and Afghanistan as a result of injuries sustained while using Snatch Land Rovers. I have recently been asked to institute a public inquiry into the use of these vehicles. After very careful consideration, I have decided that a public inquiry would not be the right way to proceed. Given the level of parliamentary and public interest in this issue, I want to explain to the House the reasons for my decision. First, however, I wish to put on record my appreciation of the bravery and dedication of each of those thirty-seven people who have so tragically died in the service of their country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="81216m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08121648000026">I have sought comprehensive advice on whether the continued use of Snatch is necessary, particularly given the substantial investment we have made in new protected vehicles in recent years. The clear advice to me from military operational commanders, unanimously endorsed by the chiefs of staff, is that Snatch remains essential to the success of our operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In the light of this authoritative assessment, I have decided that it would be inappropriate and unnecessary to conduct an inquiry. These are matters on which I must rely on the considered judgment of military commanders who have experience of conditions in Iraq and Afghanistan and access to specialised military engineering expertise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="81216m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08121648000027">It has been suggested that Snatch should be replaced by more heavily armoured vehicles, such as the Warrior or the very successful Mastiff. These are good vehicles and they have an important role to play in our operations, but they cannot be used for all purposes. Even the new Ridgback, the smaller version of Mastiff, will be three times heavier than Snatch. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the nature of the operating environment means that heavier vehicles, which are often constrained largely to main roads, are simply unable to access the places we need to be in order to deliver our objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="81216m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08121648000028">Furthermore, our tasks in Iraq and Afghanistan are largely ones of counter-insurgency. To do this, we need to win the support and confidence of local people. This can only be done by face-to-face interaction, demonstrating to the local people that we are working in their interests. Our experience in Iraq and Afghanistan has proven that better armoured vehicles, which tend by definition to be larger and heavier, are viewed by the local population as aggressive and intimidating. Their size and weight mean too that they can cause serious damage to roads, buildings, irrigation channels and drainage systems. All these factors can inflame local opinion against UK troops&#151;working in favour of our enemy and actually increasing the threat levels to our people.</p>

<notus-date day="16" month="12" year="2008" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>16 Dec 2008 : Column 104WS</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="81216m0001.htm_para3"><a name="08121648000029">It is for these reasons that military commanders require a range of vehicles, from which they can choose the one best suited to the required task&#151;and in this context, there remains a critical requirement for a Light Protected Patrol Vehicle (LPPV), such as the Snatch Land Rover. Small, mobile and agile, it is ideal for allowing engagement with the local population, often in areas which would be inaccessible to heavier vehicles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="81216m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08121648000030">However, Snatch itself is not the &#147;unarmoured&#148; vehicle which it is sometimes claimed to be; although lightly armoured, that armour has saved many lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition, the Snatch&#146;s ballistic protection is derived from composite materials, rather than steel. This limits splintering when penetrated, and means that casualty rates are lower than in comparable vehicles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="81216m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08121648000031">It is also important to be clear that we cannot assume that if all those 37 servicemen and women had been in more heavily armoured vehicles they would have survived. We cannot make Snatch, or indeed any other vehicle, invulnerable; any vehicle can be overmatched if faced with an overwhelming attack. It is precisely for this reason that armour can only ever be one factor in the way we protect our people. We employ a layered approach to protection, of which armour is but one part, and the innermost layer. We seek first to avoid being seen by the enemy; then, if seen, to avoid being hit. In both cases, a low profile, coupled with speed and agility, are important factors which critically complement our well tested tactics, techniques and procedures. The recent introduction of the light-strike Jackal vehicle, which has proved very popular, demonstrates the importance we place on these factors, none of which are characteristic of more heavily armoured vehicles. Finally, if hit, we seek to prevent the vehicle from being penetrated. This is the sole reason for armouring our vehicles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="81216m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08121648000032">This is not by any means to say that nothing further can be done to protect those servicemen and women who need to operate LPPVs. The Snatch Land Rover has undergone a number of technical enhancements since its first deployment to Iraq in 2003. Most recently, we have modified the current variant, the Snatch 2A, to enhance significantly its power, mobility and protection. This effectively generates a new variant, the Snatch Vixen, especially configured for operations in Afghanistan. Some of these vehicles are already in service in Afghanistan and over the coming year we will be increasing the size of the fleet. This, together with the &#163;700 million procurement of new vehicles which the Prime Minister announced in October, will enable us to continue reducing the scope of the Snatch 2A vehicle&#146;s role until it is used only within our camps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="81216m0001.htm_para7"><a name="08121648000033">We do not believe that there is a better vehicle than Snatch Vixen currently available anywhere in the world to fulfil the LPPV requirement. But we are also looking to the future and anticipating new threats, and we have begun a programme to develop the next generation of LPPV which will in due course take the place of Snatch Vixen.</p>

Afghanistan. In his statement to the House yesterday, the Prime Minister recognised the hard and dangerous work being undertaken by our armed forces, and reiterated United Kingdom&#146;s objectives in Afghanistan. The next roulement of UK forces in Afghanistan will take place in April 2009. The force package that we plan to deploy will see the current lead formation, 3 Commando Brigade, Royal Marines, replaced by 19 (Light) Brigade which will command the majority of the units serving in Afghanistan.

 My right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Health, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, the Secretary of State for Defence, the Secretary of State for Justice and I wish to alert the House to new checks which have uncovered a problem with payments to an estimated 5 per cent. of public service pensioners paid, by successive administrations dating back as much as 30 years, by the NHS, Teachers, Armed Forces, Judicial and Civil Service pension schemes, as a result of the incorrect indexation of an element known as the Guaranteed Minimum Pension or GMP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="81216m0002.htm_para16"><a name="08121648000146">The problem dates back to 1978 when public service occupational pension schemes contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pensions Scheme (SERPS). As a condition of contracting out members had a guarantee of a minimum amount of occupational pension. This GMP applied to those who were members of a contracted out scheme between 1978 and 1997 and who would otherwise have been entitled to SERPS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="81216m0002.htm_para17"><a name="08121648000147">Public service pensions are uprated in April each year in line with the retail price index. The occupational pension scheme pays for all the uprating before state pension is claimed, but thereafter part of the uprating is paid with the state pension, depending on the GMP entitlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="81216m0002.htm_para18"><a name="08121648000148">To enable the correct pension increases to be applied, pension scheme administrators need accurate GMP information derived from the individual&#146;s National Insurance contribution record. Our investigations have revealed that in 95 per cent. of cases this information is correctly recorded. But, in some cases it is not. In those cases schemes have paid the annual increase on the full pension each year instead of on an amount adjusted to reflect the GMP entitlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="81216m0002.htm_para19"><a name="08121648000149">The five schemes mentioned are administered by central Government departments. Scheme administrators and HMRC have now checked more than 2 million pension records.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="81216m0002.htm_para20"><a name="08121648000150">An estimated 95,000 people are currently affected across the five schemes. This represents around 5 per cent. of the total number of pensioners in those schemes. The total amount of overpayments made by successive administrations over the 30 years since 1978 to these pensioners is estimated at &#163;126 million. There are separate NHS and teachers schemes in Scotland and Northern Ireland and a separate civil service scheme in Northern Ireland. Separate statements are being made in respect of these schemes by the Scottish and Northern Ireland executives today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="81216m0002.htm_para21"><a name="08121648000151">The advice of the accounting officers of the five schemes is that it is unlikely to be cost-effective to attempt recovery of these monies from individuals.  <br>

Correct pension payments will be ordered immediately from April 2009. This means that some pensioners will have their payments reduced and others will see increases in their payments in 2009 which are less than the annual inflation uprating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="81216m0002.htm_para22"><a name="08121648000152">Scheme administrators for the five schemes mentioned have written to all those pensioners affected and will write again with full details in the new year.

Support will include advising people to enquire what additional state benefits they may be entitled to.</p>

 The Chancellor&#146;s pre-Budget report on 24 November announced that, following consultation earlier this year, the Government will be introducing changes to the Department for Transport&#146;s Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG) to incentivise the use of low-carbon buses and buses with smartcard and global positioning systems and that we would also be challenging the industry to improve its fuel efficiency. I am now announcing further details of these, and a number of other, measures and the steps we are taking to implement them in consultation with the industry and other stakeholders. A summary of the responses to our consultation document &#147;Local Bus Service Support&#151;Options for Reform&#148; is today being placed on the Department&#146;s website and in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"><a name="81216m0002.htm_para24"><a name="08121648000155">An important element of the measures is a change to the present arrangement under which changes in the rate of fuel duty are matched by changes in BSOG rates. Given the challenge of the Climate Change Act to reduce UK carbon emissions, automatic uprating of BSOG is no longer appropriate. It is important, however, to give bus operators time to adjust to this change and to put in place action to improve fuel efficiency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="81216m0002.htm_para25"><a name="08121648000156">Accordingly, I have decided that BSOG rates in England should be increased to match the 2p increase in fuel duty which was implemented on 1 December. There will then be no further increases in BSOG rates which will apply automatically to all claimants of the grant. Instead, in April 2010, BSOG rates will be uprated for those operators who have achieved an improvement in fuel efficiency equivalent to 3 per cent. per annum for each of the two previous years; we will be reviewing the figure annually to consider the scope for increasing the efficiency requirements. This is an achievable target as has been shown by studies into the improvements in fuel efficiency that can be brought about by improved driving techniques. Final arrangements on this&#151;and on the measures below&#151;will follow detailed discussions between officials and the bus industry.</p>

The amending regulation consolidates and strengthens the earlier regulations, with the aim of improving the performance and sustainability of the European aviation system: Ministers were in agreement on the technical elements of the new proposal. I joined several other Ministers in expressing strong support for the package. It was not however possible for member states to reach a general approach, as an issue regarding applicability of the new legislation to Gibraltar was raised just before the Council. I and the Spanish Minister undertook to resolve this issue bilaterally, so that Council agreement on this important proposal can be achieved soon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"><a name="81216m0003.htm_para0"><a name="08121648000162">The Council was given a presidency progress report on an amending regulation extending the responsibilities of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The Council reached a partial general approach&#151;on extension of EASA&#146;s scope to air traffic management and air navigation services. The progress report also covered the provisions on extension of scope to aerodrome safety matters. The presidency underlined the Agency&#146;s important work of inspection and certification in these areas, as an integral part of the Single European Sky package.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="81216m0003.htm_para1"><a name="08121648000163">The Council adopted two decisions authorising the Commission to open negotiations towards comprehensive aviation agreements with Tunisia and Algeria. The UK supports these mandates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="81216m0003.htm_para2"><a name="08121648000164">The presidency and the Commission reported on the successful outcome of negotiations on an EU-Canada aviation agreement. I thanked the Commission for its work on this good agreement, which may be signed during the Czech presidency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="81216m0003.htm_para3"><a name="08121648000165">The presidency tabled a report on progress to date in consideration of a proposed Directive to amend Directive 1999-62 on charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructure&#151;the &#147;Eurovignette&#148; Directive. The proposal aims to provide member states with the flexibility to introduce charges for lorries, to internalise the costs of congestion, noise and air pollution. The presidency noted that considerable progress had been made towards agreement on a number of issues, but further discussion would be needed on questions such as the inclusion of congestion charging, the methodology for calculating the level of external cost charges and the question of hypothecation&#151; earmarking&#151;of income from charges. The UK supports the principles underlying the proposal but opposes mandatory hypothecation of revenues. The Czech Republic will aim to reach agreement on this proposal in Council during its presidency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"><a name="81216m0003.htm_para4"><a name="08121648000166">The presidency gave a progress report on the proposed directive on cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety, noting that there had been a wide consensus on the need to take action in this area and hoping that further progress will be made during the Czech presidency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"><a name="81216m0003.htm_para5"><a name="08121648000167">The Council adopted conclusions on the greening of transport, the Commission&#146;s strategy for the internalisation of external costs in transport and the reduction of rail noise on existing rolling stock. The UK supported the conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"><a name="81216m0003.htm_para6"><a name="08121648000168">The Council adopted a resolution on the establishment of a European regional data centre for the Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) of ships. This is the implementation in Europe of a Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) regulation adopted by the IMO in 2006. The resolution is acceptable to the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="81216m0003.htm_para7"><a name="08121648000169">Adopted by the Council without debate&#151;as &#147;A points&#148;&#151;were common positions on proposals on flag state requirements and the civil liability of shipowners, both of which are part of the third maritime legislative package. The other six proposals in the package had already been adopted by the Council, and the presidency announced agreement on those between the Council and the European Parliament in the Conciliation Committee the previous day.</p>
