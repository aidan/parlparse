 Today I have launched a consultation on the requirements for local authority validation of planning applications. This follows on from an earlier consultation on proposals for a standard application form.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="60725m0001.htm_para0"><a name="06072524000026">The consultation proposes that there is a core and mandatory list of national requirements for applicants to comply with in submitting a planning application, which is to be supplemented by a list of local authority requirements. These local requirements must be consulted on by the local authority prior to being published on their website. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) intends to publish guidance for local authorities on what the local lists should contain, and will also make clear that there are a number of national requirements on applicants to provide information on such areas as flooding, and land contamination. The proposals provide that where an application does not meet the published national requirements and locally consulted on requirements, the authority will not be required to validate it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="60725m0001.htm_para1"><a name="06072524000027">The consultation is linked with the development of the standard application form, and the proposals are intended to complement the streamlining and efficiency benefits that will result from there being a single national form.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="60725m0001.htm_para2"><a name="06072524000028">The consultation period ends on 30 September 2006. Any proposed legislative changes would be brought in by April 2007, and local authorities would have to adopt these by July 2007, the date on which the standard application form would become mandatory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="60725m0001.htm_para3"><a name="06072524000029">The consultation paper has been published on the DCLG website at http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=l017165 and a copy of the paper has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="60725m0001.htm_para4"><a name="06072524000031">The code provides clear statutory guidance on how local authorities should carry out their homelessness functions and will assist authorities in providing appropriate and effective responses to homelessness and potential homelessness. It also complements other forms of advice, guidance and best practice which have been produced to help local authorities strengthen the services they provide to help people avoid homelessness, wherever possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="60725m0001.htm_para5"><a name="06072524000032">The revised code strengthens the guidance on dealing with vulnerable groups, including people fleeing violence and families with children. It also includes stronger guidance on preventing homelessness, on providing a wide range of housing options, and limiting the use of bed and breakfast accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="60725m0001.htm_para6"><a name="06072524000033">Copies of the revised Homelessness Code of Guidance for Local Authorities are being made available in the Libraries of both Houses.

The Government are conducting a thorough review of how police, probation, parole and prison services balance public protection and individual and collective rights and, if necessary, will legislate to ensure that public protection is given priority. Other initiatives include a major push for the provision of better and more consistent guidance and training on human rights within Departments; and a proactive, strategic and co-ordinated approach to human rights litigation, so that it has the maximum possible impact on future case law under the Human Rights Act. The Government will also lead a drive to ensure that the public s well as the wider public sector are better informed about the benefits which the Human Rights Act has given everyone in the UK.&#148;</p>

proposed framework regulating the community-based restorative justice schemes that are currently operating in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="60725m0001.htm_para31"><a name="06072524000064">That period of consultation afforded the opportunity for all interested parties to make their views known to Government and generated responses from 56 organisations and individuals across the statutory and voluntary sectors as well as from members of the public. The consultation revealed general support for restorative justice as a concept but highlighted serious concerns about the way in which some key aspects of schemes might operate.

Those concerns centred on: the ability for schemes to use third parties to distance themselves from direct engagement with the police; arrangements for determining the suitability of persons working in schemes; the need for a robust independent complaints mechanism; and the need to set demanding standards for schemes underpinned by an effective inspection regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="60725m0001.htm_para36"><a name="06072524000069">As a consequence of those concerns I have:</p>

<a name="60725m0002.htm_brev0"><a name="06072524000120"><ul><p class="tabletext">Removed the provision for schemes to report offences to the Police Service of Northern Ireland through a third party. The protocol now requires that schemes engage, and have a direct relationship, with police on all matters governed by the protocol. The centrality of the police to the way in which schemes operate is non-negotiable.</p>
</ul><a name="60725m0002.htm_brev1"><a name="06072524000121"><ul><p class="tabletext">Agreed arrangements for a panel, comprising representatives of relevant statutory bodies, to determine the suitability of individuals to work in posts governed by the protocol. The panel will consider criminal records and other pertinent information provided by statutory agencies, including the police, in determining the suitability of any individual in accordance with published criteria contained in the protocol.</p>
</ul><a name="60725m0002.htm_brev2"><a name="06072524000122"><ul><p class="tabletext">Agreed with the Probation Board for Northern Ireland that they will establish an independent complaints mechanism for victims and offenders who may have cause to raise concerns about how a scheme has handled their case.</p>

<a name="60725m0002.htm_brev3"><a name="06072524000123"><ul><p class="tabletext">Ensured that the new protocol sets exacting standards which schemes must meet to achieve accreditation, with continued compliance tested by a rigorous, regular and unannounced inspection regime undertaken by the Criminal Justice Inspectorate who shall publish their inspection reports.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="60725m0002.htm_para0"><a name="06072524000070">The protocol would establish the relationship between schemes and the criminal justice system in dealing with low-level criminal offences and offenders and, by definition, govern cases which have both achieved the criminal threshold and been deemed suitable by the Public Prosecution Service for referral for a restorative disposal. While the protocol cannot therefore formally extend to schemes&#146; other activities, as part of the inspection regime records on non-criminal cases handled by schemes will be examined to help ensure that all cases attaining the criminal threshold have been referred to the police. Schemes which achieve accreditation will, as organisations, have demonstrated the attainment of the high standards required in the protocol which I expect to see reflected in all aspects of their activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="60725m0002.htm_para1"><a name="06072524000071">Due to the significant nature of the changes I want to allow for a further period of consultation on the new protocol, which will run in parallel with an Equality Impact Assessment to explore the potential for any of its measures to adversely impact on equality of opportunity for any of the nine categories set out in section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. This will be launched shortly and will involve a 12-week public consultation period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="60725m0002.htm_para2"><a name="06072524000072">It has never been a direct corollary that schemes which sigh up to the protocol will receive NIO funding. However I expect that accredited schemes meeting the exacting standards set out in the protocol should be in the best position, where they meet the appropriate grant criteria, to apply for funding from whatever statutory or charitable sources are currently available to them. Conversely any scheme which does not sign up to them will not receive any funding whatsoever from Government for community-based restorative justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="60725m0002.htm_para3"><a name="06072524000073">I hope that the revised protocol can provide an effective way forward but I am keen to hear the views of all the stakeholders and interested parties during the consultation period.</p>

 I have today published a consultation document on the Government&#146;s proposals to implement the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive (the WEEE Directive).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="60725m0002.htm_para4"><a name="06072524000092">The Government are firmly committed to sustainable development and recognises that effective implementation of the WEEE directive has a key role to play in achieving this goal. Electrical and electronic equipment is the fastest growing category of waste across the European Union, with an estimated 17 to 20 kg per person produced every year. The UK alone generated around 1 million tonnes of WEEE last year. By ensuring that WEEE is treated, recycled and disposed of to high environmental standards as required by the directive, we protect the environment and human health from the risk of hazardous contamination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="60725m0002.htm_para5"><a name="06072524000093">The proposals published today follow on from the implementation review announced last December, and have been developed through extensive consultation with companies and other interested parties who will be directly affected by the new regulations. They represent a balance of controls needed to identify and discourage free-riders and give companies the freedom to find the most cost-effective routes to meet their obligations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="60725m0002.htm_para6"><a name="06072524000094">The intention is, subject to the outcome of public consultation, that the directive should be transported into UK law early in 2007, leading to full implementation on 1 July 2007.</p>

 The Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission published a report on unfair terms in contracts in February 2005 (Law Com No. 292; Scots Law Com no. 199). It set out detailed recommendations, together with a draft Bill designed to produce a unified regime replacing the Unfair Contracts Terms Act 1977 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 for the whole of the UK in a way that is much clearer and easier to follow, and also addressed some gaps in protection that the Commissions identified.

This acceptance is subject to further consideration of the detail of the issues, and to further work to identify potential cost impacts. The proposed legislation will be subject to full public consultation.</p>
