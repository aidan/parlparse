 The Government confirm that they have simplified the Solutions For Business portfolio. The Solutions for Business portfolio announced in March 2010 contained 32 interventions, designed to help businesses at different stages of their development. Going forward we believe that the portfolio should target only those areas where a Government lead is required, including supporting innovation and helping companies reach international markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para0"><a name="11031756000025">Ministers have decided to proceed with simplification of the portfolio which will see it streamlined, with 13 products in the new portfolio, with a focus on growth. The details of the products in the new portfolio are being published today, alongside new information to help local enterprise partnerships as they establish their economic priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para1"><a name="11031756000026">The 13 products in the new nationally funded portfolio are:</p>

For most of those starting out in business for the first time, or looking for straightforward advice and guidance on running their business, the improved businesslink.gov.uk website and start-up hub will be available to provide high quality online support. This will be supplemented by a telephone contact centre for businesses unable to access the internet or who cannot find the information they are looking for online. In addition, where businesses have challenges that cannot be met through the website, access to experienced business mentors will be available through the new volunteering gateway.</p>

 My noble Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, Baroness Wilcox, has today made the following statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para5"><a name="11031756000031">The EU Competitiveness Council took place in Brussels on 9 and 10 March 2011. Andy Lebrecht, the UK's Deputy Permanent Representative to the EU represented the UK on research issues on 9 March and I represented the UK on internal market and industry issues on 10 March. A summary of those discussions follows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para6"><a name="11031756000032">The main research issues discussed on 9 March  were the Commission's Europe 2020 (long-term EU competitiveness) strategy's annual growth survey (from the research perspective); the interim evaluation of the seventh EU research framework programme; and the European innovation union flagship initiative. There was also a lunchtime discussion on the Commission's proposed new "common strategic framework" for future EU research and innovation funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para7"><a name="11031756000033">On the Commission's annual growth survey, Ministers debated research and innovation priorities to help Europe recover from the economic crisis. The UK emphasised that it was maintaining its science spending and that there should be increased focus on innovation-oriented EU public procurement and on addressing issues regarding access to finance for innovators. The UK also said it planned to monitor the effectiveness of EU research and innovation reforms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para8"><a name="11031756000034">The Council adopted conclusions on the seventh EU research framework programme in response to the independent interim evaluation. The conclusions called for simplification of funding rules, a greater economic impact from EU research investment and examination of the reasons for low participation in certain member states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para9"><a name="11031756000035">On the European innovation union flagship initiative, the Commission reported plans to develop a new innovation performance indicator, a new EU standardisation policy and to look at how EU-wide procurement schemes and a proposed pan-EU venture capital fund could better support innovation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para10"><a name="11031756000036">In the lunchtime discussion on future EU research and innovation funding, the Commission reported plans to introduce a more co-ordinated approach. Member states generally supported the Commission's approach and identified the simplification of existing EU funding rules as a priority. The UK emphasised the importance of scientific excellence when allocating EU funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para11"><a name="11031756000037">The research any other business items discussed were a report on "The knowledge-based bio-economy towards 2020" conference held in September 2010 and proposals for a framework programme for nuclear research and training activities for 2012 to 2013.</p>

There was also a lunchtime discussion on the Commission's mid-term review of the Small Business Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para13"><a name="11031756000039">On the Single Market Act, the Commission reported that 770 online responses had been received and that it would be difficult to identify priorities that would meet everyone's concerns. The UK called for an emphasis on growth and that EU single market priorities should be progress on services, on the digital single market and on better regulation. Most member states supported a focus on growth. The Commission concluded that further work was needed to agree priorities with member states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para14"><a name="11031756000040">On the EU patent, the Commission said that it was vital to help EU competitiveness. In discussion, the UK stressed that it saw the EU patent as a package and that it was studying the European Court of Justice opinion on the patent court that had been issued on 8 March. Council legal services confirmed that consideration of the opinion did not prevent agreement on the enhanced co-operation process and 25 member states (including the UK) confirmed their support for the authorisation decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para15"><a name="11031756000041">In the lunchtime discussion reviewing the Commission's Small Business Act initiative, the UK highlighted the importance of better regulation. In the annual growth survey discussion, the UK emphasised its support for measures supporting growth. The majority of member states stressed the importance of the EU single market and to improve the EU regulatory framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para16"><a name="11031756000042">The Council also adopted conclusions on the progress of implementation of the EU services directive and on the Commission's raw materials initiative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para18"><a name="11031756000045">The current dependency of councils on central grant allocations makes planning difficult, weakens accountability, and stifles local innovation. In the future, I am keen to move to a radically different system of funding and support for councils that is built on strong incentives, is driven by local decision making and breaks this dependency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para19"><a name="11031756000046">I have therefore set up a review of local government resources that will consider how we can recast the distribution of business rates and formula grant to  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para20"><a name="11031756000047">The review will consider the way in which local authorities are funded, with a view to giving local authorities greater financial autonomy and strengthening the incentives to support growth in the private sector and regeneration of local economies.</p>

 Today we are publishing validated data, based on returns from 151 local authorities showing that across the country 84.6% of families received an offer at their first-preference secondary school-compared with 83.2% last year.

95.6% were offered a place at one of their three preferred schools. In total, 97.2% of families were offered a place at one of their preferred schools. I am placing a copy of these data in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para31"><a name="11031756000060">There is considerable variation in these figures nationally. Outside London, more than 87.8% of parents were offered a place at their first-preference school. The north-east had the highest percentage of first-preference offers with 94.3% and west midlands the lowest with 81.1%. For Greater London, this figure is 66.2%.

Through the White Paper, "The Importance of Teaching", we announced our intention to review the school admissions framework, with a view to delivering a simpler, more streamlined admissions and appeals code. We are determined to remove unnecessary burdens on schools while retaining accountability, transparency and fairness. We shall shortly be consulting on slimmer, less bureaucratic admission and appeals codes.</p>

Only when every school is a good school will we be able to remove the anxiety parents feel when selecting a school for their children. These figures show that too few parents, especially in London, have access to good school places, with one in six parents failing to secure their first preference.</p>

The Secretary of State recently wrote to all local authorities asking them to develop school improvement plans for those schools below the floor standards. These plans will help identify the action needed to turn around those schools that are failing to provide a high quality of education. Schools will be supported to improve but if they do not do so quickly, we will look to transform them through conversion to academy status, under strong sponsors with a proven record in turning around underperformance. We will also continue our drive to increase the number of academies and to open more free schools to respond to demand.</p>

right hon. Friend the Prime Minister stressed to Parliament in his statement of 14 March, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 25-27 (see link below), HMG's position is that Europe must seize this opportunity to support ordinary people in north Africa and across the middle east in their aspirations for a more open and democratic form of government. The EU now needs to follow through on its declaration of 11 March with a real and credible offer to these countries, based around the massive economic opportunities which lie in greater trade and co-operation with Europe. Discussion of Libya and other specific country issues will depend on events in the next few days.</p>

We want to see a clear statement that there can be no extension of the Transitional Federal Institutions beyond August without reform to make them more representative and legitimate in the eyes of the Somali people.

 The Equality Act 2010 includes a new single public sector Equality Duty which will replace the existing race, disability and gender equality duties and will extend to also cover gender reassignment in full, age, religion or belief and sexual orientation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para94"><a name="11031756000128">The Act contains a power enabling a Minister of the Crown to make regulations imposing specific duties on public bodies listed in parts 1 (general) and 4 (cross-border authorities) of schedule 19 to the Act to enable them to carry out the Equality Duty more effectively. Following a public consultation on draft specific duties regulations which ran from August to November last year, revised draft regulations were published alongside the Government's response to the consultation on the Government Equalities Office website on 12 January 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para95"><a name="11031756000129">Since then, we have considered the draft regulations further in the light of our policy objective of ensuring that public bodies consider equality when carrying out their functions without imposing unnecessary burdens and bureaucracy. As a result, we think there is room to do more to strip out unnecessary process requirements. Today, we are publishing a policy review paper seeking views on new draft specific duties regulations. Our proposals are designed to deliver a clear focus on transparency, freeing up public bodies to take responsibility for their own performance in delivering equality improvements and to publish the right information so that the public can hold them to account. This approach will be better for equality because it will focus on the delivery of results, not the performance of bureaucratic processes.</p>

 I announced on 26 January the findings from my review of counter-terrorism and security powers. This included a recommendation that the Government consider whether the police needed the new counter-terrorism stop and search power more quickly than the Protection of Freedoms Bill would allow. On 1 March 2011 I announced that, given the current threat environment, I had concluded that the police do need the powers more quickly than the Bill would allow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para99"><a name="11031756000134">The most appropriate way of meeting the legal and operational requirements concerning the counter-terrorism stop and search powers exercisable without reasonable suspicion is to make a remedial order under section 10 of the Human Rights Act 1998 to make immediate changes to the legislation. I therefore made a remedial order concerning the Terrorism Act 2000 on 16 March and that order has today been laid before Parliament. The new powers contained in that order are supported by a robust statutory code of practice. I have used the urgency procedure provided by paragraph 2(b) of schedule 2 to the Human Rights Act to make the remedial order because I have concluded that having these powers available to the police now is in the interests of national security and is needed to protect the public from a risk of terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para100"><a name="11031756000135">The remedial order replaces sections 44 to 47 of the Terrorism Act 2000 with a more targeted and proportionate power. The provisions in the order will cease to have effect on the coming into force of the similar provisions in the Protection of Freedoms Bill-in other words, the order makes temporary provision and Parliament will have the opportunity to fully scrutinise the replacement powers in the usual way during the passage of the Protection of Freedoms Bill. The order removes the incompatibility of sections 44 to 46 of the Terrorism Act 2000 with the European convention of human rights in the light of the European Court of Human Rights' judgment in the case of Gillan and Quinton which became final in June 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para101"><a name="11031756000136">The making of a remedial order using the urgency procedure means that it will come into force on 18 March. It will cease to have effect if both Houses have not approved the order by resolution within 120 days of the remedial order being made (the calculation of "days" for this purpose does not include any time during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued, or both Houses are adjourned for more than four days).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="110317m0001.htm_para102"><a name="11031756000137">The decision to make a remedial order means that the discredited, ineffective and unfair "no suspicion" stop  <br>

and search powers provided by sections 44 to 47 of the Terrorism Act 2000 are, in effect, replaced by a much more targeted and proportionate power. The use of an urgent remedial order is a necessary and sensible step to ensure that the police have the necessary powers in place to continue to protect the public from a risk of terrorism.</p>
