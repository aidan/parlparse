 The ECOFIN Council met on Tuesday 2 December 2008. The Chancellor and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury represented the UK. The following items were discussed:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="81209m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08120943000022"><i>Preparation of the December European Council</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="81209m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08120943000023">Finance Ministers discussed and agreed ECOFIN&#146;s input to the European Council. The contribution covers the Commission&#146;s European Economic Recovery Plan, which included recommendations regarding macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, and guidance regarding the implementation of SGP. Input on the response to the international financial crisis was discussed, following up on both the informal meeting of Heads Of State or Government on 7 November, and the Washington summit on 15 November. On both these workstreams, the Government are fully supportive of a Europe in favour of the need for economic reform and financial stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="81209m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08120943000024"><i>Reduced rates of VAT</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="81209m0001.htm_para3"><a name="08120943000025">Following discussions at the September informal and meetings in October and November, Ministers held a brief discussion on reduced rates of VAT. Discussion was focused on a French presidency compromise text based on the Commission&#146;s July proposal to allow reduced rates for a specified set of goods and services. The UK believes that member states should be allowed the flexibility to apply reduced rates of VAT where they do not materially affect the functioning of the single market. The presidency concluded that unanimity was not achievable at this meeting. Further discussion is expected to take place under the Czech presidency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="81209m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08120943000026"><i>Taxation of savings</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="81209m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08120943000027">ECOFIN agreed a set of conclusions on the ongoing extension of the savings directive, in line with the Government&#146;s view to include a reasonable extension to the scope of the directive while seeking to minimise any unnecessary additional burdens placed on business as a result of changes to the directive. Ministers agreed that negotiations should continue with non-EU financial centres to apply equivalent measures. The Government believe that the directive is an important tool in fighting tax fraud and continue to support its extension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="81209m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08120943000028"><i>Code of </i><i>c</i><i>onduct on business taxation</i></p>

Following agreement at a recent code of conduct meeting, ECOFIN adopted the code group&#146;s future work package. The Government continue to support the work of the group to tackle harmful tax competition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="81209m0001.htm_para9"><a name="08120943000031">The European Court of Auditors presented ECOFIN with the annual report on the implementation of the EC Budget for the financial year 2007. While some progress had been made, the court was unable to provide a clean bill of health for the majority of expenditure. The Commission emphasised the responsibility of member states. Work by the UK and three other member states on national declarations was welcomed, and the Commission confirmed that a communication on tolerable risk would issue shortly. ECOFIN will hold a further discussion in February regarding the Council&#146;s recommendation to the European Parliament on discharging the Budget.</p>

 A meeting of the Education, Youth and Culture Council was held on 20 and 21 November. The Welsh Assembly Government Minister for Heritage, Alun Ffred Jones, represented the UK for the cultural and audiovisual agenda items taken on the morning of 20 November.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="81209m0001.htm_para10"><a name="08120943000034">The Council adopted the conclusions on a new European heritage label. A number of member states welcomed the new label as adding value to existing initiatives such as the UNESCO world heritage list. Initially the UK had some concerns about the European heritage label, but these were adequately addressed in the final text of the conclusions. The UK was able to support their adoption, in particular the voluntary nature of the scheme. The Commission will now bring forward a legislative proposal in 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="81209m0001.htm_para11"><a name="08120943000035">Council conclusions on the contribution of architecture to sustainable development were agreed. The UK supported the adoption of the conclusions as they reflect the UK&#146;s approach to architecture, sustainable design, and built environment education. The forthcoming Swedish presidency announced they would build on this with a conference towards the end of 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="81209m0001.htm_para12"><a name="08120943000036">The role of culture in the external relations of the EU was also discussed at the Council meeting.

was content with this outcome and supported the adoption of the conclusions. However, some member states felt that more needed to be done to ensure equality of all EU languages and called for a declaration to this end. These countries were also critical of the Commission for the lack of translation of some documents they produce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="81209m0001.htm_para13"><a name="08120943000037">These issues were again raised during the discussion of section 4 of the resolution on multilingualism and translation. In particular, some member states wanted assurances that a presidency background note that called for new EU activity on translation (including a possible new centre for translation) was not binding. The UK intervened in Welsh to show its support for the multilingualism agenda, but also to support the scepticism expressed about a new European translation centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="81209m0001.htm_para14"><a name="08120943000038">Ministers adopted conclusions on Europeana, the European digital library, and were supportive of this new cultural resource. The UK welcomed the aspiration to digitise European content and to increase accessibility to our shared cultural heritage and supported the adoption of these conclusions. During the discussion concerns were raised about the possible impact on the availability of content of Commission proposals to extend copyright term from 50 to 95 years.</p>

Sweden raised concerns about the Commission communication on state aid to public service broadcasting. Germany raised an information point on support for digitisation of cinemas.

The plan also applicable to other exotic animal diseases.

 Smoking remains the single greatest cause of preventable death and is one of the primary causes of health inequality in the United Kingdom.

According to Cancer Research UK, since the ban on advertising of tobacco introduced by the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002, display of tobacco in retail environments has become the primary source of tobacco marketing for young people. We believe that taking action on display of tobacco at the retail point of sale should not represent a significant financial burden on retailers.</p>

We will aim to ensure requirements do not place unnecessary costs or burdens on the retail industry. We will also ensure ample lead-in time before any legislation is commenced to support businesses to prepare.</p>

 The United Kingdom Border Agency is withdrawing DP5/96, a concession which has also been referred to as the seven year child concession, as of 9 December 2008. The concession set out the criteria to be applied when considering whether enforcement action should proceed or be initiated against parents of a child who was born here and has lived continuously to the age of seven or over, or where, having come to the UK at an early age, they have accumulated seven years or more continuous residence. The original purpose and need for the concession has been overtaken by the Human Rights Act and changes to immigration rules. The fact that a child has spent a significant period of their life in the United Kingdom will continue to be an important relevant factor to be taken into account by case workers when evaluating whether removal of their parents is appropriate. Any decision to remove a family from the UK will continue to be made in accordance with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Immigration Rules.</p>

of the ECHR will ensure a fairer, more consistent approach to all cases involving children, whether accompanied or unaccompanied, across UKBA. Withdrawing the policy will also prevent those overstaying or unlawfully present in the UK having the benefit of a concession which does not apply to those persons who comply with the Immigration Rules and remain in the UK lawfully.</p>
