 A key principle of the Government&#146;s approach to addressing the health concerns of veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict is that there should be appropriate research into veterans&#146; illnesses and factors that may have a bearing on these.</p>

The main body of work involved monitoring multiple factors in marmosets for up to 18 months following the administration of vaccines and/or pyridostigmine bromide (the active ingredient in nerve agent pre-treatment tablets).

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="60720m0001.htm_para19"><a name="06072031000087">The proposals relate to managing coexistence between farms and focus on the specific measures that would be needed for crops of maize, beet, potato and oilseed rape. It is proposed that the key measures required for an effective co-existence regime will be implemented on a statutory basis, with other, less significant measures to be applied via an industry code of practice.</p>

 My noble Friend the Minister of State Lord Rooker has today published the Government's response to the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (RCEP) report &#147;Crop Spraying and the Health of Residents and Bystanders&#148;. This response sets out the Government's view on the recommendations made by the Royal Commission and indicates how we intend to address them.

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="60720m0001.htm_para23"><a name="06072031000098">Firstly, I would like to thank the Royal Commission for producing this report which was requested by my right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="60720m0001.htm_para25"><a name="06072031000100">I firmly believe that these concerns are best addressed at the local level through dialogue between residents and farmers to identify and understand the issues and to develop mutually agreeable solutions. I also believe that this can be achieved most rapidly through a voluntary approach that allows for innovative and flexible solutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="60720m0001.htm_para26"><a name="06072031000101">Existing voluntary schemes such as Farm Assurance and the Voluntary Initiative have demonstrated how effective non-statutory approaches can be in changing behaviour. I want to see schemes such as these playing a crucial role in ensuring that both farmers and  the public can have a greater mutual understanding of the problems they each face. These schemes have the potential to provide farmers both with the practical support and the incentive to be good neighbours in this regard and I will be discussing with these organisations and others how this might be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="60720m0001.htm_para27"><a name="06072031000102">I believe that the proposals set out in the Government's response, a number of which are already underway, can achieve the majority of outcomes envisaged by the Royal Commission without the need for additional burdensome regulation on the agricultural sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="60720m0001.htm_para28"><a name="06072031000103">The Government have also noted the concern of both the Royal Commission and some members of the public with how the risks to residents and bystanders are considered in the approvals process. To address this concern I have requested a complete review of the model used to assess resident and bystander exposure as part of the pesticide approvals process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="60720m0001.htm_para29"><a name="06072031000104">The current approvals process is adequate with clear safety margins built in. However, I recognise that it needs to be more clearly demonstrated to the public that approvals are based on high quality underpinning science. To address this the revised exposure model will give more explicit consideration to a wider range of possible exposure routes and will reflect modern farming practices. The research to develop this model has already begun. A former member of the Royal Commission was one of the peer reviewers for the proposal before it was approved and Defra's Chief Scientific Adviser will ensure the development of the model meets acceptable scientific standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="60720m0001.htm_para30"><a name="06072031000105">The UK is also taking a primary role on this issue in Europe, taking the lead in revising the guidance on acceptable exposure limits, including the assessment of resident and bystander exposure, for the European Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="60720m0001.htm_para31"><a name="06072031000106">The Government have considered the findings of the report very thoroughly alongside additional independent scientific advice. The Department of Health has sought the views of the Committees on Toxicity and on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment on the report's health recommendations and Defra has additionally considered advice from the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Advisory Committee on Pesticides on the wider recommendations of the report. In addition to this scientific advice we have also considered the views of interested parties from all sides of the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="60720m0001.htm_para32"><a name="06072031000107">The scientific advice we have received is clear that there is insufficient evidence to support the Royal Commission's recommendations for additional regulatory measures on safety grounds. Introducing regulations for other reasons such as perceived nuisance from spraying would be incompatible with the Government's Better Regulation policy. We have therefore decided against introducing any new regulations at this time.</p>

 This statement sets out my plans to reform liquor licensing law in Northern Ireland. The last review of the law governing liquor licensing and registered clubs took place some 10 years ago. Since then the social and economic climate in Northern Ireland has changed and improved immensely. The peace dividend has altered the shape of the tourism and hospitality sectors and of town and city centres. There is great potential for further growth, and liquor licensing law must keep pace with these developments and with modern expectations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="60720m0003.htm_para0"><a name="06072031000212">Coupled with that is the need for a more transparent, accountable and better regulated framework for the licensed trade. There are clear anomalies in the current licensing system and a requirement for greater enforcement powers for the Police Service of Northern Ireland to deal with breaches of licensing law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="60720m0003.htm_para1"><a name="06072031000213">The consultation on proposed changes to the existing legislation was launched in November 2005. Since then I have had a number of discussions with political representatives and other interested parties. There has been support from both local political parties and the licensed trade for many of my proposals. Concerns have been expressed by politicians and parts of the licensed trade regarding two of the proposed changes. These are the transfer of responsibility for liquor licensing from courts to district councils and the abolition of the &#145;surrender&#146; principle. I welcome the views that have been put and now confirm that my plans for the reform of the law on liquor licensing and registered clubs in Northern Ireland are as follows:</p>
<a name="60720m0003.htm_brev0"><a name="06072031000214"><ul><p class="tabletext">The introduction of six new objectives to underpin licensing policy, legislation and regulation. These are&#151;Promotion of public health; Promotion of public safety; Prevention of crime and disorder; Prevention of public nuisance; Protection of children from harm; Fair treatment of all stakeholders.</p>
</ul><a name="60720m0003.htm_brev1"><a name="06072031000215"><ul><p class="tabletext">New, more effective enforcement measures, including immediate temporary closure powers for the police, a penalty points system for licensees who break the law and new council liquor licensing officers.</p>
</ul><a name="60720m0003.htm_brev2"><a name="06072031000216"><ul><p class="tabletext">Moving responsibility for granting and renewing licences and certificates of registration from courts to district councils, leading to a more accountable, transparent system.</p>
</ul><a name="60720m0003.htm_brev3"><a name="06072031000217"><ul><p class="tabletext">Replacing the current twelve categories of licences in favour of a dual system of personal and premises licences.</p>
</ul><a name="60720m0003.htm_brev4"><a name="06072031000218"><ul><p class="tabletext">Abolishing the provision which requires an existing licence for a pub or off-licence to be &#147;surrendered&#148; to a court before a new one may be granted. This will be subject to an assessment of the business impact of my proposal which will help decide how this is addressed in the second stage of reforms. I hope it will be the Northern Ireland Assembly that will consider these matters.</p>
</ul><a name="60720m0003.htm_brev5"><a name="06072031000219"><ul><p class="tabletext">A voluntary proof-of-age scheme and more flexibility to allow under-18s in certified licensed premises and registered clubs when accompanied by responsible adults.</p>
</ul><a name="60720m0003.htm_brev6"><a name="06072031000220"><ul><p class="tabletext">A modest extension of current opening hours for licensed premises and registered clubs, creating scope for opening up to 2.00am Monday to Saturday. Sunday opening hours will remain unchanged as will opening hours for off-licences.</p>
</ul><a name="60720m0003.htm_brev7"><a name="06072031000221"><ul><p class="tabletext">Revoking the financial controls and accounts formats for registered clubs, prescribed in the Registration of Clubs (Accounts) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1997, in favour of best practice guidance.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="60720m0003.htm_para2"><a name="06072031000222">The proposals will give police the powers they need to crack down on irresponsible drinkers and rogue traders and make the licensing system more transparent and accountable, giving communities more information and a louder voice in decision-making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="60720m0003.htm_para3"><a name="06072031000223">Allowing licensed premises and registered clubs to apply to the courts to extend their opening hours up to 2.00am is the result of careful consideration of the changes in people&#146;s social habits and the opportunities available for developing the night time economy. I have listened very carefully to the arguments made by the licensed trade, the police, health interests and others, and balanced the economic and social advantages of extending opening hours with the public interest and public safety. Accordingly, I have decided that opening  <br>

to 2.00am will be available to those licensed premises entitled under existing law to apply for later opening but not to off-licensed premises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="60720m0003.htm_para4"><a name="06072031000224">Transferring responsibility for granting liquor licences and club certificates from a court-based system to district councils will create a more accountable system where pubs, off-licences, registered clubs and other licensees will have to explain in detail how their businesses will support the six licensing objectives. There have been concerns expressed about the ability of councils to administer a new liquor licensing system. However, councils already operate a number of regulatory systems including entertainments licensing and street trading, and their range of responsibilities will be greatly enhanced under the Review of Public Administration. The capacity of new councils to undertake these new responsibilities is an issue that is being addressed in the period leading up to the full implementation of the Review of Public Administration. I wish to reassure those concerned that responsibility for liquor licensing will only move to councils once they have built the capacity to administer the new system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="60720m0003.htm_para5"><a name="06072031000225">The new system will operate under clear guidelines that will be issued to councils. They will be required to produce a statement of licensing policy that clearly articulates how they plan to control liquor licensing in line with the six licensing objectives. There will be further safeguards. Before councils reach a decision they will have to seek the views of responsible authorities and interested parties such as the Police Service of Northern Ireland, local residents and local businesses. All applications for a licence will be open to objection and a licence may be reviewed, revoked or suspended at any time if there is cause for concern. Those seeking a premises licence will be required to produce an operating plan setting out the nature of the business for approval by councils, and the need for any new licence will have to be clearly demonstrated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="60720m0003.htm_para6"><a name="06072031000226">I am replacing the current twelve categories of licence with a dual system of personal and premises licences. This will result in a more robust licensing regime. Personal licences are being introduced for the first time to ensure that those managing licensed premises have accredited qualifications and demonstrate clean backgrounds. This will improve operating standards across the licensed trade and protect against infiltration by those involved in organised crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="60720m0003.htm_para7"><a name="06072031000227">The surrender provision has created anomalies in the licensed trade. At present only pubs and off-licences are required to surrender a licence before being granted a new one. This has capped the overall number of such premises in Northern Ireland, but it has not prevented the growth of alcohol sales in other premises such as large hotels, nor the clustering of pubs and off-licences in particular areas. It is also an artificial barrier to entry to the market and its abolition will create a more equitable commercial environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="60720m0003.htm_para8"><a name="06072031000228">I have listened to the views of local politicians and parts of the licensed trade about the implications of the abolition of surrender. In response to their concerns, I will commission an assessment of the business impact of abolition before making any further decision on the way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="60720m0003.htm_para10"><a name="06072031000230">With regard to the move to councils, I intend to defer the consideration of this aspect of the legislation, along with some of the other proposals that depend on the new system being operational, to a second, later legislative vehicle. The Review of Public Administration is due for completion in 2009 and the target date for making legislation to transfer responsibility for licensing from courts to district councils and for the introduction of new licensing objectives will be linked to this. This tranche of legislation will also see the abolition of the existing categories of licence and, subject to an impact assessment, the surrender provision. The final decisions on this will hopefully be taken by a devolved Assembly, should it be successfully restored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="60720m0003.htm_para11"><a name="06072031000231">I believe this is a balanced package of measures that weighs up the rights, needs and demands of the various interested parties. They will bring licensing law in Northern Ireland up to date, both to deal more effectively with the alcohol-related problems we currently face and to meet modern day expectations. They will result in a more democratic approach that allows local people to have greater influence in how and where the licensed trade operates. They will promote a safe, welcoming environment in town and city centres where the evening and night-time economy can flourish and will encourage investment, variety and high standards of service in the hospitality, tourism and entertainment sectors.</p>

 On the 19 July last year I announced that I had asked the Highways Agency to carry out a detailed review to allow an informed decision to be taken on the case for building a new tolled Expressway to run parallel with the M6 between Birmingham and Manchester as an alternative to widening the existing M6 by one lane in each direction. This followed a consultation exercise undertaken in 2004 on the broad concept of an Expressway.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="60720m0004.htm_para17"><a name="06072031000307">The Government had accepted the need for more road capacity in this corridor, as shown by the Midlands to Manchester multi-modal study (Midman), which reported in July 2002. The issue was how best that capacity could be provided. Given the high level of investment involved whatever option would be taken forward, it was clearly important that we properly considered the potential for the extra benefits that might be achievable from an Expressway.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="60720m0004.htm_para18"><a name="06072031000308">The 2004 consultation document &#147;M6: giving motorists a choice&#148; suggested that the Expressway might be delivered more quickly than the widening, by avoiding the need to build new structures such as bridges, and avoiding substantial disruption to traffic during construction. The evidence from the detailed development work undertaken by the Highways Agency has not borne this out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="60720m0004.htm_para19"><a name="06072031000309">The Highways Agency&#146;s modelling suggests that an Expressway would have a significant impact on both the levels and the mix of traffic using the Expressway and the M6. In particular, it is likely that the proportion of heavy freight traffic on the M6&#151;which is already relatively high&#151;would increase further, requiring additional infrastructure works at junctions to provide safely for traffic joining and leaving the road. This, together with providing for the appropriate range of access options at each junction between the Expressway and the existing M6, would require the demolition of many existing structures and reconstruction of 20 per cent. of the existing carriageway. The Expressway would also have a much larger land take, requiring some 50 per cent. more land than the widening. The Expressway and associated works would cause more disruption to existing traffic and would cost some 15 per cent. more than widening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="60720m0004.htm_para20"><a name="06072031000311">Although on-line widening would necessarily involve some disruption to M6 traffic during construction, the phasing of works could mean additional capacity being provided sooner than an entirely new road, with efforts focused on the most heavily trafficked sections first.</p>

 On 11 October 2005 my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh South-West, (Mr. Darling), announced his decision to review the role of the British Transport Police (BTP).

 Today the Department for Transport has published the West Midlands Regional Planning Assessment for the railway (RPA), the third in a series of 11 RPAs covering England and Wales. The West Midlands RPA covers the whole of the West Midlands Region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="60720m0004.htm_para37"><a name="06072031000343">RPAs are the key link between regional spatial planning (including preparation of regional transport strategies) and planning for the railway by both Government and the rail industry and are designed to inform the development of the Government's strategy for the railway. They look at the challenges and options for development of the railway in each region over the next twenty years, in the wider context of forecast change in population, the economy and travel behaviour. An RPA does not commit the Government to specific proposals. Instead it sets out the Government's current thinking on how the railway might best be developed to allow wider planning objectives for a region to be met, and identifies the priorities for further development work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="60720m0004.htm_para38"><a name="06072031000344">The area covered by the West Midlands RPA has a population of just over 5.3 million of which 2.5 million live in the West Midlands conurbation centred on Birmingham. While population levels are not expected to grow significantly, structural changes in the type of employment available and greater prosperity are expected to lead to more trips being made. Growth in rail passenger journeys is forecast for the region and it is expected that there will be particular growth in longer distance journeys, especially to London, and commuting to central Birmingham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="60720m0004.htm_para39"><a name="06072031000345">Planning for railways in the West Midlands needs to take into account a changing economic and social context set out in the Regional Spatial Strategy and Regional Economic Strategy.

rail capability and capacity will be needed over the next twenty years, and the options for responding to that need. The focus of the RPA is making better use of the existing network but it also draws attention to the need to improve access to stations, including interchanges, and the expected need to increase train capacity to meet forecast growth in demand.</p>
