<p><a name="st_10"><a name="08062686000027"><a name="80626m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="08062686000575"><b>The Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Mr. John Hutton):</b>
 As promised in my statement of 23 January 2008, I am publishing today a consultation on the ways the UK could increase renewable energy in order to meet the UK&#146;s proposed share of the EU target to achieve 20 per cent. of all Europe&#146;s energy from renewable sources in 2020.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="80626m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08062686000028">Increasing renewable energy is a key element of our strategy for delivering our two key goals of tackling climate change and ensuring that the UK has a secure supply of affordable energy. Measures set out in the 2007 Energy White Paper will already triple our use of renewables from 1.5 per cent. overall energy in 2006 to 5 per cent. by 2020, but we recognise we need to do more. Investment in renewable generation will help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels at a time of rising prices, particularly oil and gas. This consultation will inform the UK renewable energy strategy to be published in spring 2009, once the final EU Directive implementing the target for EU renewable energy has been agreed and the UK share decided. The consultation will run for three months and we will publish the responses this autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="80626m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08062686000029">Currently, the proposed UK share of the EU target is to achieve 15 per cent. of our energy&#151;electricity, heat and transport&#151;from renewables by 2020. Our negotiating position has been to ensure that the targets contained in the draft directive are credible, by giving member states enough flexibility to deploy renewables in the most cost-effective manner. This need for credibility applies to other key parts of the draft directive, including the 10 per cent. renewable transport target for biofuels, so the UK has been pushing hard for robust sustainability criteria to be included.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="80626m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08062686000030">The challenge that a target of 15 per cent. renewable energy represents should not be underestimated. It may require a tenfold increase in renewable generation in the UK from 2006 levels. This might mean, for example, needing up to an extra 4,000 onshore and 3,000 offshore wind turbines, a major challenge for the supply chain and UK business. We are also conducting a feasibility study on the range of tidal power options in the Severn estuary that could provide up to 5 per cent. of UK electricity. The consultation seeks views on how we can meet the 15 per cent. target in the most cost-effective way. Regardless of our final approach, success will require action right across the economy, from industry and investors, but also from the devolved Administrations, local and regional bodies and consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="80626m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08062686000042">In the short term, the impact of our measures on utility bills is likely to be almost zero; however, such rapid action will not come without some associated cost. The extent of these rises will depend on the cost of alternatives, particularly fossil fuels, and we can limit their effect, both on energy bills and fuel poverty by promoting an essential, ongoing role for energy efficiency. As part of this, DEFRA will publish a consultation in the autumn looking at energy efficiency across all sectors with a particular emphasis on households, and within that, what we can do to improve the efficiency of our existing housing stock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="80626m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08062686000043">We are committed to developing the most cost-effective approach to delivering the scale of renewable energy required. To ensure we have investigated all the options, we are also consulting on the role that using provisions in the draft EU renewables directive relating to trading could play in reducing the overall cost to the UK of meeting the target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="80626m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08062686000044">There are costs associated with increasing renewable energy. However, we believe they are worth paying for. As the Stern review concluded, the costs of tackling climate change could be far higher in the longer term than the costs of taking action now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="80626m0001.htm_para7"><a name="08062686000045">The business benefits from an expansion in renewable energy in the UK could include up to 160,000 new jobs generated in the renewable energy sector by 2020. The Government&#146;s ambition is to ensure that as many of these jobs are based in the UK as possible. Annual revenues from marine energy for example could be as much as &#163;900 million by 2020. The consultation seeks views on how we can ensure the UK receives the maximum benefit from the rapid expansion of the renewable energy  <br>

 The Secretary of State has today laid regulations to update the home loss payments thresholds in section 30 of the Land Compensation Act 1973 (as amended). Home loss payments are paid at a rate of 10 per cent. of the market value to owner-occupiers who are displaced from their homes as a result of compulsory purchase or certain housing orders. They are paid in addition to the compensation awarded for the value of the property taken, which is based on the open market value of the property together with disturbance payments. Home loss payments are subject to maximum and minimum thresholds. Tenants receive a flat rate equal to the minimum payment to owner-occupiers.</p>

 On 27 March I made a statement to the House on council tax capping for eight authorities.

Those eight authorities were Portsmouth city council, and the police authorities of Bedfordshire, Cheshire,  <br>

Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Surrey and Warwickshire. All eight authorities were &#145;designated&#146;, and the Government proposed maximum 2008-09 budget requirements for each authority under the Local Government Finance Act 1992.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="80626m0001.htm_para12"><a name="08062686000052">All eight authorities exercised their right to challenge their proposed maximum budget requirements and made written submissions in support of their cases. I met a delegation from Portsmouth city council and was joined by the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing to meet delegations from each of the seven police authorities to hear all of the cases in person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="80626m0001.htm_para13"><a name="08062686000053">Having carefully considered the representations all authorities have made, both orally and in writing, and having taken into account all relevant information I can now confirm decisions on how the Government intend to proceed in each case. In putting forward their challenges, no authority has, in the Secretary of State&#146;s view, presented strong arguments as to why an excessive increase was necessary. Furthermore, no authority has demonstrated that the pressures identified acted disproportionately upon them to any significant extent compared to other authorities. We intend therefore to take action in all cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="80626m0001.htm_para14"><a name="08062686000054">After careful consideration, taking account of both service and tax impacts on residents in the areas concerned, the Secretary of State has decided on the following actions:</p>

This &#145;designation after nomination&#146; will provide protection to council taxpayers by limiting the authorities&#146; capacity to increase council tax in 2009-10, and allow the authorities a phased return to setting non-excessive budget requirements. We intend to limit increases in the budget requirements of these authorities to the equivalent of an increase of 3 per cent. in council tax precept in both 2009- 10 and 2010-11. This firmly protects taxpayers but avoids the need for re-billing; and</p>

For Bedfordshire police authority the proposed notional budget requirement is &#163;95,790,000, for Norfolk police authority &#163;137,901,000, for Portsmouth city council &#163;148,530,000, and for Surrey police authority 189,622,000. Nomination and setting a notional budget for Bedfordshire, Norfolk and Surrey police authorities and for Portsmouth city council will limit these authorities&#146; capacity to set excessive increases in future years by measuring for capping purposes future budget requirement increases against their 2008-09 notional budget requirement. This will provide their council taxpayers with extra protection in future years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="80626m0001.htm_para15"><a name="08062686000058">My officials are writing to all authorities today informing them of these decisions. Subject to approval of an order I am laying before the House today, Lincolnshire police authority will need to re-set its budget requirement and precept. This means that its residents will be re-billed for a lower council tax.</p>

 I am pleased to announce that the sixth annual report of the appointed person under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 has been laid before Parliament today. The appointed person is an independent person who scrutinises the use of the search power introduced to support the measures in the Act to seize and forfeit criminal cash.</p>

 I have today laid before Parliament the Coroners (Amendment) Rules 2008. These rules amend rule 43 of the Coroners Rules 1984 regarding coroners&#146; powers to make reports to prevent future deaths, and introduce a new rule to allow coroners to share relevant information with Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs) to enable them to carry out their statutory functions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="80626m0003.htm_para2"><a name="08062686000529">The amended rule 43 places a new statutory duty on organisations receiving reports from coroners to respond within 56 days. Coroners must share reports and responses with those, including bereaved families, to whom they have assigned &#147;interested person&#148; status. They must also share reports and responses with the Lord Chancellor and they may share reports and responses with other interested organisations. Reports and responses will be centrally collated for the first time so that lessons learned can be disseminated widely where appropriate and there is national oversight more generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="80626m0003.htm_para3"><a name="08062686000530">A new rule will require coroners to notify LSCBs of any child death that is reported to them, and over which they have jurisdiction, and allow them to share information (such as reports from post-mortem examinations and documents given in evidence at an inquest) with LSCBs. This will enable LSCBs to better meet their statutory duty to conduct child death reviews and will contribute to the fulfilment of their statutory obligations more generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="80626m0003.htm_para4"><a name="08062686000531">The rule was developed in partnership with the Department for Children, Schools and Families, which is responsible for legislation regarding LSCBs.</p>

 During 2006, in response to the continuing terrorist threat to the rail network, the Department for Transport carried out passenger screening trials to test the ability of available equipment and dogs to detect explosives, or traces of explosives, in an operational environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="80626m0003.htm_para7"><a name="08062686000568">The London Underground and National Railways (LUNR) passenger screening trials took place at five locations over a six-month period, with the full co-operation of the British Transport Police, Network Rail, London Underground and other stakeholders. Public attitudes surveys were conducted in parallel with the trials. Since then, we have been considering the results of the trials with key stakeholders and the implications for rail security policy.</p>

public attitudes research. Copies have also been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. We are not publishing detailed reports on the individual trials for security reasons, due to the sensitivity of the information within them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="80626m0003.htm_para9"><a name="08062686000570">At the same time, the British Transport Police is announcing enhancements to its current screening capability through the use of x-ray equipment and explosive detection dogs capable of screening moving passengers. These enhancements will build on the BTP&#146;s existing measures to screen a proportion of passengers and their bags, with minimal delay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="80626m0003.htm_para10"><a name="08062686000571">The enhancements are a direct response to the conclusions from the trials which showed that:</p>
<a name="80626m0003.htm_brev3"><a name="08062686000572"><ul><p class="tabletext">Screening equipment and dogs can be effective in the railway environment. However, given the very large passenger flows and thousands of entry points on the UK rail and underground networks, 100 per cent. airport-style screening is currently not feasible using today&#146;s technology.</p>
</ul><a name="80626m0003.htm_brev4"><a name="08062686000573"><ul><p class="tabletext">The public recognises the threat to the rail network, and is broadly supportive of the need for security measures, providing they are proportionate to the threat. However the public would be unlikely to accept major delays to journeys, and wants to ensure that personal privacy is protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="80626m0003.htm_para11"><a name="08062686000574">We will continue to work with the BTP and operators to assess the effectiveness and impact of these new measures and will use this evidence, and that from elsewhere in the UK and abroad, to develop further ways of keeping the travelling public secure using proportionate measures.</p>
