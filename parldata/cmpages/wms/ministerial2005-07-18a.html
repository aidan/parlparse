<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50718m01.html_spmin3"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Yvette Cooper): </b> 
 This statement announces three new planning policy documents which the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) is publishing today:






<br>&nbsp;<br>18 Jul 2005 : Column 44WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">A policy consultation paper &quot;Planning for Housing Provision&quot; which sets out a proposed new approach to planning for housing provision, in response to recommendations in the &quot;Barker review of housing supply&quot; published in March 2004.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">A consultation paper on a proposed new green belt direction, as foreshadowed in the ODPM five-year strategy &quot;Homes for All&quot;, published in January 2005.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">A new circular on planning obligations, following the consultation launched in November 2004.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para3"><a name="stpa_3">ODPM is also publishing today research on the use of planning obligations to deliver affordable housing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para4"><a name="stpa_4">Alongside these documents ODPM is also publishing jointly with HM Treasury a document setting out the importance of the Government&#039;s housing agenda for achieving the UK&#039;s social and economic priorities and for delivering stability and opportunity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para5"><a name="stpa_5">Copies of these documents are being placed in the Libraries of the House.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para6"><a name="stpa_6"><i>Planning for Housing Provision</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para7"><a name="stpa_7">In April 2003 the Government commissioned Kate Barker to carry out a review of issues underlying the lack of supply and responsiveness of housing supply in the UK. Demand for housing has increased over the last 30 years, driven by demographic trends and rising incomes. Yet the supply of new housing has fallen by 30 per cent. compared to 30 years ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para8"><a name="stpa_8">The Barker review of housing supply report, &quot;Delivering stability: Securing our future housing needs&quot;, published in March 2004, made a number of recommendations relevant to the planning system, in particular, its ability to release appropriate land for housing in an effective and timely manner. Planning was seen as a key constraint on the delivery of housing. The revision of current policy on planning for housing, set out in planning policy guidance note 3: housing (PPG3), was regarded as a priority, in order to improve delivery of sufficient homes and to achieve housing targets more effectively.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para9"><a name="stpa_9">The Government agree with the Barker review proposition that the planning system must be able to deliver sufficient land, in the right places, to meet need and be more responsive to demand. If plans fail to deliver appropriate land for housing, house prices will continue to increase, there will continue to be worsening affordability, and key workers will continue to seek in vain for homes near their jobs. Equally, if the planning system fails to address low demand, the difficulties faced by communities, in terms of abandonment and crime, will increase.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para10"><a name="stpa_10">The challenge for the planning system is to find the right way to respond flexibly to housing market pressures, in order to achieve social justice, and sustainable development. The Government believe that consideration of housing market pressures must be part of the planning system, so that it can operate swiftly and effectively, in the public interest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para11"><a name="stpa_11">ODPM is therefore publishing today a consultation paper &quot;Planning for Housing Provision&quot; which sets out the Government&#039;s objectives for delivering a better supply of housing through the planning system. Improving housing supply and access to housing is critical to improving affordability in the long term and securing the wider benefits that housing brings to the economy and society. The consultation paper proposes 





<br>&nbsp;<br>18 Jul 2005 : Column 45WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

a new policy approach to ensuring that appropriate land is allocated in plans to meet the need for housing, respond more effectively to changes in demand, and promote consumer choice. It also continues the priority given to brownfield development. It provides for different approaches in areas such as the Thames Gateway which are designated for high levels of housing growth compared to other areas where the level of new housing needs to be carefully managed. It promotes longer term planning as well as much more rapid reviews of plans where demand changes. The Government will respond to the other recommendations of the Barker review by the end of the year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para12"><a name="stpa_12">This consultation will be an important input to a new planning policy statement on planning for housing (PPS3). In the autumn Government will consult on a new draft PPS3 which will set out the broad national policy framework for planning for housing. The aim will be to ensure that the planning system is used to its maximum effect to ensure that everyone has the opportunity of a decent home, which they can afford, within a community which is sustainable and in which they want to live and work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para13"><a name="stpa_13">The new draft PPS3 will also draw on the consultation paper &quot;Planning for Mixed Communities&quot; published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in January 2005, and the responses to it.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para14"><a name="stpa_14"><i>Consultation Draft of a New Green Belt Direction</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para15"><a name="stpa_15">The Government recognise the need to protect the green belt in taking forward new development. It has set a target for each region to maintain or increase the area of green belt designated in local plans. As a demonstration of the continuing importance the Government attach to the protection of the openness of the green belt, and to the prevention of urban sprawl, the ODPM is also publishing today a consultation paper on a proposed new town and country planning (green belt) direction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para16"><a name="stpa_16">This new direction would, for the first time, specifically require that planning applications for inappropriate development of certain types and scale in the green belt, which local planning authorities are minded to approve, should be referred to the First Secretary of State. While the Secretary of State would continue to use his powers of intervention selectively, the new direction would ensure that he has the opportunity to consider whether to call in for a public inquiry and his own determination, the more significant and potentially most harmful development proposals in the green belt.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para17"><a name="stpa_17"><i>Planning obligations</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para18"><a name="stpa_18">The system of planning obligations is important in delivering essential infrastructure and other matters necessary to ensure all new development is sustainable in planning terms. However, planning obligations have in the past been responsible for delays in the system. The ODPM is today publishing a new circular on planning obligations&#151;circular 05/2005&#151;aimed at speeding up the system, so as to support the delivery of development, including new housing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para19"><a name="stpa_19">In November 2004 the ODPM published a draft revised circular on planning obligations. This led to a very fruitful consultation period in which 279 





<br>&nbsp;<br>18 Jul 2005 : Column 46WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

respondents contributed their views in writing and discussions were held in regional seminars and bilateral meetings.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para20"><a name="stpa_20">The overarching aims of the new circular are to increase transparency, predictability, accountability and speed in the negotiation of planning obligations, and to promote the good practice that already exists in many local authorities. It also brings planning obligations into line with the new arrangements established by the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, and provides a firmer policy basis for the provision of affordable housing through planning obligations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para21"><a name="stpa_21">The final version of the circular makes a number of changes from the draft for the sake of clarity and precision, and introduces some new procedural guidance but the policy scope of planning obligations remains the same.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para22"><a name="stpa_22">The circular will be supported by the publication of good practice guidance on the use of planning obligations later this year. A standard legal document for planning agreements and unilateral undertakings will accompany this guidance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para23"><a name="stpa_23">The revision of planning obligations policy is intended to improve the existing system. In the meantime, the Government are continuing to examine Kate Barker&#039;s recommendations for a planning-gain supplement and associated changes to the system of planning obligations, made in the final report of her review of housing supply. The Government will announce their full response to the Barker report by the end of the year.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para24"><a name="stpa_24"><i>Value for money of delivering affordable housing through section 106 agreements</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para25"><a name="stpa_25">In November 2003, ODPM commissioned the university of Cambridge to undertake a study on the value for money of delivering affordable housing through the planning system i.e. through section 106 agreements. The aim was to provide evidence on how much affordable housing is being delivered through planning obligations and how it is being funded. The study also examined how far providing affordable housing in this way contributes to mixed communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para26"><a name="stpa_26">The study confirms the importance of using planning obligations in the delivery of affordable housing. The research indicates that as developers and local authorities are becoming more familiar with using planning obligations, the system is improving. The study also found that delivering affordable housing in this way makes a valuable contribution to the Government&#039;s aim of mixed communities, in particular by providing access to land in high value areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m01.html_para27"><a name="stpa_27">However, the research also suggests that there is room for improvement. The main drawbacks of the current system are perceived to be the delays in negotiation and the resulting costs. The new circular on planning obligations aims to address some of these issues.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50718m02.html_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Ruth Kelly): </b> 
 The Green Paper &quot;Youth Matters&quot; has today been laid before Parliament.






<br>&nbsp;<br>18 Jul 2005 : Column 47WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m02.html_para0">&quot;Youth Matters&quot; addresses key issues relating to the way in which we provide opportunities, challenge and support to our teenagers. The proposals in &quot;Youth Matters&quot; build on the ambition of &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; that all young people should achieve five key outcomes&#151;being healthy, staying safe, enjoying and achieving, making a positive contribution, and achieving economic well-being.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m02.html_para1"><a name="stpa_28">We should not lose sight of the fact that most young people are doing well, achieving more at school and going on to further study. We need to support these young people with more and better information, advice and guidance, which takes into account how jobs are changing and our proposed 14&#150;19 curriculum reforms, and which is delivered in a way that suits young people including through the use of modern technologies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m02.html_para2"><a name="stpa_29">We also want to provide a wider choice of positive activities for young people to do when they are not in school, college or work and we want to encourage more young people to get involved in volunteering. It is a fundamental part of our proposals that young people and their parents should have a greater influence over the things that are provided for them locally. Proposals include supporting local authorities to develop a card for young people which will give them discounts on activities and could be credited with amounts that young people can spend on their choice of sports and other constructive activities. We also propose a new youth opportunity fund to be spent at young people&#039;s discretion on projects to improve things to do and places to go in their area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m02.html_para3"><a name="stpa_30">We want to improve the way in which we support young people with specific needs and problems including providing them with a nominated lead professional who will be a single point of contact and making sure that support is provided in a coordinated, convenient and integrated way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50718m02.html_para4"><a name="stpa_31">But we should also recognise that some young people have problems and some get involved in antisocial behaviour and crime. This can have a negative impact on their own life chances and affects the view the wider community has of all young people. Those who fail to behave well should be supported in improving their behaviour but should not benefit from the proposed discount card until they do so.
</p>

<a name="50718m03.html_para1"><a name="stpa_46">In January 2003, we announced a number of changes to the regulatory regime of the accountancy and audit professions, including the establishment of a new independent inspection unit, located within the Financial Reporting Council, and a Professional Oversight Board for Accountancy (POBA), to take over, from this Department, my functions under Part II of the Companies Act 1989 in respect of the recognised supervisory bodies. I am pleased to report that these bodies are now established and in operation. The delegation of these powers is dependent on legislation being passed by Parliament, a process that has been delayed due to other pressures on parliamentary time. Legislation will be laid before Parliament before the summer recess. In the meantime my Department continues to have responsibility for oversight of the recognised supervisory bodies.

<p><a name="st_12"><a name="50718m03.html_spmin2"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Mr. James Plaskitt): </b> 
 On 10 March 2005 the Government published the consultation paper &quot;Local Authority Investigative Powers Regulatory Reform Order&quot;. This set out our proposals to reduce burdens on local authorities by using powers in the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. The proposed changes would enable local authorities to tackle benefit fraud more effectively by giving them clear powers to investigate and prosecute offences against national social security benefits alongside local ones.

<p>
<a name="50718m03.html_para3"><a name="stpa_47">We received 48 responses to the consultation document, the overwhelming majority of which were in favour of the proposals. Our intention was to resolve this issue by use of a Regulatory Reform Order. From the responses we have received it has become clear that the powers that we could provide for local authorities by using a Regulatory Reform Order would be inadequate for their effective use. We have, therefore, decided not to proceed with the Regulatory Reform Order but to make the legislative changes that local authorities need alongside wider reforms to housing benefit announced in the Queen&#039;s speech. This should not significantly delay our plans to implement these changes, and we remain committed to seeking a swift resolution to this issue.

<a name="50718m03.html_para4">The open method of coordination in pensions was launched by the Laeken European Council in December 2001.

It does not include any information not in the public domain already, it does not signal any state pension reform and contains only pre-existing data to support the 11 objectives.
