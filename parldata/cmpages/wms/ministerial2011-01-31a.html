 : This statement sets out the forthcoming changes to the current Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) structure, which the CPS is introducing from 1 April 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para0"><a name="1101313000025">Under the current CPS structure there are 42 areas aligned to individual police force boundaries. These areas are presently organised as 13 regional groups. In the new structure the 13 groups will become 13 new larger areas, with a chief Crown prosecutor (CCP) supported by a number of deputy chief Crown prosecutors to provide leadership across the new areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para1"><a name="1101313000026">This change builds on the experience and success that the CPS group structure has provided over recent years. It establishes a solid foundation for the future and provides the CPS with greater capacity, capability and flexibility to respond to the challenges that lie ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para2"><a name="1101313000027">The CPS has carefully considered the changes taking place in the criminal justice system (CJS) and believes that the new structure will provide a better strategic fit with its partners and places the CPS in the best possible position to deal with the modernisation of the CJS including digital working. The new structure will also provide an improved service for serious and sensitive casework, especially work received from regional intelligence units and regional asset recovery teams.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para3"><a name="1101313000028">Under these new arrangements there will continue to be a strong presence in each police force area with dedicated teams working with local police forces and senior CPS leaders to provide a strong focus on local liaison, partnership and accountability.</p>

 The Government have today announced the climate change levy [CCL] exemption for supplies of gas in Northern Ireland will be replaced with a lower rate from 1 April 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para6"><a name="1101313000058">Following discussion and agreement with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland, legislation will be introduced in the Finance Bill 2011 to remove the exemption and replace it with a lower rate for a transitional period of 1 April 2011 to 31 October 2013, after which the main CCL rate for gas will apply in Northern Ireland. During the transitional period such supplies will become subject to the levy at a rate of £0.00059 per kilowatt hour, which is 65% lower than the full rate of CCL on gas for business and public sector consumers. Domestic consumers do not pay CCL.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para7"><a name="1101313000059">Following consultation with the European Commission, the Government consider it is unlikely that they would be able to secure re-approval for the exemption. The measure is therefore necessary to ensure compliance with European tax law and state-aid rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para8"><a name="1101313000060">To give gas suppliers and business gas consumers certainty over their tax affairs, this announcement is being made early to allow energy suppliers and businesses in Northern Ireland time to start to prepare for the introduction of the lower rate on 1 April 2011.</p>

 I have today laid before the House the "Local Government Finance Report (England) 2011-12 (HC 748)". This report establishes the amounts of revenue support grant and non-domestic rates to be paid to local authorities in 2011-12, and the basis of their distribution. A draft of this report was issued for consultation on 13 December 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para11"><a name="1101313000064">We received a total of 330 written responses from 283 individual authorities, formal and informal groupings of authorities and others during the consultation, and Ministers met delegations from the Local Government Association, London Councils and a large number of individual local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para12"><a name="1101313000065">Having considered the views of all those who have commented on the provisional settlement, I have decided to broadly confirm the proposals for the distribution of formula grant for 2011-12 as announced in December, after correcting a number of minor errors and inconsistencies that came to our attention during consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para13"><a name="1101313000066">We received many representations on concessionary travel. This is a prime example of how the last Government introduced a policy with no idea of how it would be  <br>

funded fairly. It has left us with a challenging legacy. I have decided to help compensate shire district councils for the loss of what they used to spend on concessionary travel. To address this, a further £10 million has been added to formula grant-for 2011-12 only-in order to mitigate the impact of the transfer on shire districts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para14"><a name="1101313000067">We have also improved the minimum guarantee so that now no council will receive a "revenue spending power" reduction of more than 8.8% in either 2011-12 or 2012-13. Details on "spending power" are set out in an explanatory note which is being placed in the Library of the House. In finalising our methodology, we have accepted a number of representations including the exclusion of parish precepts from our spending power calculations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para15"><a name="1101313000068">The need to reduce public spending means that this is a unique settlement-we are looking for councils to show how efficient they can be, and to root out the wasteful spending that still exists while ensuring that money goes to the front-line public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para16"><a name="1101313000069">Despite the huge pressures on public finances, the coalition Government have taken unprecedented steps to protect councils most reliant on central Government funding and freeze council tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para17"><a name="1101313000070">We have taken a progressive and fair approach to calculating how the £29 billion of central taxpayer funding for local government grants this year will be allocated. More money is being channelled to those areas of the country that have the highest levels of need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para18"><a name="1101313000071">We are also helping to protect the public from excessive council tax rises with our £650 million fund so town halls can freeze council tax this April. This will offer real help to families and pensioners. We will provide each authority that does not increase its basic level of council tax with a grant equivalent to the revenue it would have generated had it increased it by 2.5%. I would like to impress upon authorities that under the terms of the scheme they will not receive any grant if they increase their council tax at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para19"><a name="1101313000072">The Government anticipate that authorities will choose to take up the freeze. However, where authorities opt to increase their council tax instead the Government are prepared to take capping action against excessive increases. The Secretary of State will set out the capping principles that he intends to use to compare authorities' budgets in the next few days, leaving ample time for authorities to consider their budgeting before the deadlines for setting their council tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para20"><a name="1101313000073">I have also today laid before the House the "Limitation of Council Tax and Precepts (Alternative Notional Amounts) Report (England) 2011-12 (HC 774)". This report takes account of changes to authorities' functions and grants during 2010-11, and contains details of the figures that will be used to compare authorities' budgets between years, should capping be necessary.</p>

 The Government announced in a written ministerial statement, 15 September 2010, <i>Official Report</i>, column 39WS that preparations were under way to launch an open market process to resolve the future of the Tote. This followed the announcement in the Budget of 22 June 2010 that the future of the Tote would be resolved within 12 months in a way that secures value for the taxpayer and which recognises the support the Tote currently provides to the racing industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para23"><a name="1101313000077">The Government can now inform the House that the first stage of that open market process has been successful.

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para25"><a name="1101313000079">Given the commercially sensitive nature of the process the Government will not be making public the details of the individual proposals received as part of the open market process nor the identity of those parties that have been invited to participate in the next stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para26"><a name="1101313000080">The Government can also confirm that in the event that the Tote is sold on the open market it will honour the commitment of the previous Government to share 50% of the net cash proceeds of sale with racing. The proceeds will be made available over the spending review period (or longer if the sale proceeds are particularly high) because of the broader fiscal position and the need to spend the funds consistent with EU state aid rules, but the Government will pay interest on the outstanding balance in the normal way. The Government look forward to working closely with racing in the event of an open market sale to design appropriate arrangements.</p>

By late December the Afghan national army had reached a total size of 146,000, and the Afghan national police 116,000.

In the last week of December, the 2000th recruit since its inauguration graduated from the centre. Two UK-funded buildings were opened in December: a new detention centre and a temporary facility for juvenile prisoners. The UK supported training for Helmand's statutory justice officials on criminal law and on judicial ethics. The UK-funded Helmand legal aid office hired the province's first female paralegal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para40"><a name="1101313000096">The programme of modernisation we have set out is essential both to drive efficiency in the short-term, and help ensure that the NHS meets the ambition to achieve outcomes for patients that are among the best in the world.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces and I wish to make the latest of our quarterly statements to the House with details of the inquests of service personnel who have died overseas. We remain deeply grateful to all of our service personnel who are serving, or who have served, in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="110131m0001.htm_para47"><a name="1101313000724">Our most sincere condolences go, as ever, to the families of those service personnel who have lost their lives in the service of their country, and in particular to the nine who have died since our last statement. All of the families whose loved ones have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country, or who have otherwise lost their lives in connection with the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, remain very much in our thoughts.</p>

As a result of these improvements, the dedication of coroners and the support from both Departments, 130 inquests were completed in 2010, compared with 58 inquests being completed in 2009. There are no outstanding inquests into deaths prior to 4 December 2008.</p>

These resources have been provided to the Wiltshire and Swindon coroner, Mr David Ridley, due to the repatriation of service personnel at RAF Lyneham and the formation of the MOD Defence Inquests Unit in 2008.

 The House will be aware of the announcement made by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) on 21 December 2010. In that statement, the PPS confirmed that, following a review of all the available evidence including that given to the Hamill tribunal, it concluded that the test for prosecution is met in respect of two persons for an offence of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and one person for an offence of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice.</p>

I understand from the inquiry that it is also the family's wish that the legal proceedings are not prejudiced by the publication of the report.
