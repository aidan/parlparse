 In the Fourth Cohesion Report, published on 30 May 2007, the European Commission assesses the impact of cohesion policy at community, national and regional levels in the European Union. The report also identifies a range of challenges that cohesion policy may be confronted with in the coming years and puts forward a set of questions for consultation. The consultation was formally launched at the Fourth Cohesion Forum in Brussels, held on the 27-28 September 2007, which I attended, and will close on 31 January 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07112768000026">Cohesion policy is supported by actions at EU, national, regional and local levels. The consultation is not therefore solely about the Structural and Cohesion Funds (SCFs) which have new objectives for the 2007-13 period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para1"><a name="07112768000027">The SCFs are, however, a significant part of the EC budget, on which the Commission has recently published a Communication: &#147;Reforming the Budget, Changing Europe&#148;, also for public consultation, to prepare for the Budget review in 2008-09. According to the Communication, the Commission&#146;s approach is one of openness and with nothing ruled in and nothing ruled out: it will prepare this review with no preconceptions and encourages all interested parties to contribute to the consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07112768000028">The Government are considering their approach both to the Commission&#146;s consultation on the future of cohesion policy and to the budget review process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para4"><a name="07112768000032">The Government&#146;s view on the EC budget is that it should be reformed so that the EU is better equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Its approach is set out in the recent publication &#147;Global Europe: Meeting the Economic and Security Challenges, October 2007&#148; publication. This identifies budgetary reform as one of the priority areas for EU action and sets out the three principles that will guide the Government&#146;s approach when considering how to achieve budgetary reform. Based on these principles, a priority for reform in the future will be</p>

Its goal is to improve outcomes and the experience of public services for all children, young people and families. ContactPoint will provide a tool to support better communication among practitioners across education, health, social care and youth offending. It will provide a quick way for those practitioners to find out who else is working with the same child or young person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para10"><a name="07112768000041">ContactPoint will be a simple basic online tool containing:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para13"><a name="07112768000050">Over the last few months we have been considering the substantial stakeholder feedback we have received and looked at the implications that the resulting proposed changes could have on the system. It is clear from the considerable work we have done so far that we will need more time than we originally planned to address the changes to ContactPoint which potential system users suggested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para14"><a name="07112768000051">The change to the timetable will mean that deployment of ContactPoint to the &#145;Early Adopters&#146; local authorities and national partners will be in September or October 2008. It will be deployed to all other local authorities and national partners in 2009, between January and May, depending on final deployment slots. The additional time available presents a number of opportunities to do more work in the period prior to ContactPoint deployment that will help to realise some benefits earlier. The fundamental design of ContactPoint will not change; the alterations will make sure the system works even more effectively for users and improves the ability of local authority ContactPoint teams to manage user access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para15"><a name="07112768000052">The news on Tuesday 20 November of the loss of large volumes of child benefit data from HMRC has raised questions about the safety of large scale personal data in other Government systems, including ContactPoint. ContactPoint will not contain any financial information (such as bank details) or case information (such as case notes, assessments, medical records, exam results or subjective observations).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para16"><a name="07112768000053">On Tuesday 20 November, the Department conducted an assessment of how personal data are stored and protected in the Department. As a result of that assessment, I am confident that we have very robust procedures in place. On Wednesday 21 November, the Prime Minister confirmed this approach when he asked all Departments to check their procedures for the storage and use of data. In light of the security breach at the HMRC, we are continuing to check our procedures to ensure standards are as high as they can be. To this end, on 20 November, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families decided to commission an independent assessment of its security procedures. This will be undertaken by Deloitte. Delaying the implementation of ContactPoint will enable the independent assessment of security procedures to take place as well as address the changes to ContactPoint that potential system users have told us they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para17"><a name="07112768000054">Delivery partners will receive further information early in the new year. In the meantime, progress will be reported to local project managers regularly through their ContactPoint implementation co-ordinators. They will work with individual authorities and national partners to agree new deployment slots as soon as it is possible to do so.</p>

 In the white paper &#147;Planning for a Sustainable Future&#148;, published on 21 May 2007, we set out a wide-ranging package of proposals for reform of the planning system.</p>
<br>


<meta name="Date" content="27 Nov 2007">

<notus-date day="27" month="11" year="2007" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>27 Nov 2007 : Column 12WS</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para18"><a name="07112768000056">Planning is critical to protecting the countryside and our environment, building sustainable homes and communities, and supporting growth and prosperity. It also plays a vital role in ensuring individuals and local communities have a say in what gets built.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para19"><a name="07112768000057">Since 1997 we have made major improvements to town and country planning: more houses are being built, with better use of brownfield land; more development in town centres is helping to revitalise our towns and cities; planning decisions are being made quicker; and we have made the system more efficient and customer focused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para20"><a name="07112768000058">But significant problems remain. The planning system remains too complex, bureaucratic and inefficient. These problems are particularly acute for major infrastructure projects, which are subject to different planning regimes. Currently a single project may require consent under numerous different regimes. Lack of clarity in national policy, poor preparation of specific project proposals, lengthy and adversarial inquiry processes and slow decision-making mean that some planning decisions have taken years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para21"><a name="07112768000059">These delays, combined with the lack of certainty in the system, can result in high costs for business; prolonged uncertainty and blight for communities; and pose a serious threat to UK competitiveness, growth and jobs. Moreover delays in the provision of essential infrastructure needed to ensure clean, secure energy and water supplies and decent transport have quality of life implications for everyone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para22"><a name="07112768000060">We need to ensure that the planning system enables us to meet the long-term challenges we face as a society:</p>
<a name="71127m0001.htm_brev12"><a name="07112768000061"><ul><p class="tabletext">to meet our climate change objectives by speeding up the shift to renewable and low carbon energy, supporting the development of low and zero carbon homes and businesses; and ensuring development is resilient to the impacts of climate change;</p>
</ul><a name="71127m0001.htm_brev13"><a name="07112768000062"><ul><p class="tabletext">to achieve our target of 3 million new homes by 2020 so current and future generations have access to a decent home at a price they can afford;</p>
</ul><a name="71127m0001.htm_brev14"><a name="07112768000063"><ul><p class="tabletext">to enable us to meet the challenge of globalisation by being efficient and responsive to business needs; and supporting the development of vital infrastructure, such as ports, roads and airports, needed to ensure that the UK continues to attract investment and jobs;</p>
</ul><a name="71127m0001.htm_brev15"><a name="07112768000064"><ul><p class="tabletext">to provide certainty for investment in new infrastructure such as power stations, gas storage facilities and electricity networks need to ensure energy supplies are secure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para24"><a name="07112768000066">The White Paper proposed that we should establish a new, single consent regime for nationally significant transport, energy, water and waste infrastructure projects under which:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para27"><a name="07112768000076">The proposal to produce national policy statements for major infrastructure sectors has been welcomed by the large majority of respondents to the White Paper. Over the forthcoming months, my colleagues the Secretaries of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, for Transport, and for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will set out further details of how they propose to ensure national policy in their infrastructure sectors is clearly set out; a short summary of proposals is at Annex A.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para28"><a name="07112768000077">We acknowledge that it is essential to ensure that our objectives in relation to sustainable development are central to consideration of future infrastructure needs. The Bill will therefore include a duty on Ministers to ensure that national policy statements are drawn up with the objective of contributing to the achievement of sustainable development.

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para29"><a name="07112768000078">The Bill will also put effective public consultation and participation at the heart of all three key stages in the regime:</p>
<a name="71127m0001.htm_brev23"><a name="07112768000079"><ul><p class="tabletext">By creating a clear duty to ensure effective public consultation on national policy statements. We intend that this consultation should include positive and proactive means of engaging citizens and communities. Where national policy statements identify locations or potential locations for development, there will be a duty to consult in those locations.</p>
</ul><a name="71127m0001.htm_brev24"><a name="07112768000080"><ul><p class="tabletext">By placing clear legal obligations on developers to consult local communities before they submit a planning application, and ensure that this consultation is of high quality.</p>
</ul><a name="71127m0001.htm_brev25"><a name="07112768000081"><ul><p class="tabletext">By making planning inquiries accessible and ensuring peoples&#146; rights to be heard are protected.

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para30"><a name="07112768000082">In order to support more effective engagement with communities and hard-to-reach groups, we will be increasing the resources we provide to bodies that promote community engagement in planning.

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="71127m0001.htm_para31"><a name="07112768000083">Finally, the Bill will strengthen accountability and ensure decision-making is fair and transparent:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="71127m0002.htm_para3"><a name="07112768000090">We have noted concerns that the White Paper may have defined too narrowly the matters the IPC may take into account in reaching decisions. We are clear that the national policy statement should be the primary policy consideration for the Commission. However we agree that the Commission must be able in taking decisions to have discretion to take account of all information specific to the case before it which it considers relevant and important to its decision, including all such local impacts. The Bill will make it clear that this is the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="71127m0002.htm_para4"><a name="07112768000091">We have also concluded that there may be some very exceptional circumstances in which it would not be appropriate to leave final decisions to the Commission. These circumstances would arise where new issues or evidence are raised relevant to an application before the Commission which are so significant that the Government consider they may justify a change of national policy. Where this was the case, the relevant Secretary of State could direct the Commission to suspend consideration of the application until he or she had reviewed the national policy statement. However where there is an application before the IPC which needs to be determined urgently in the national interest, the Bill will enable the Secretary of State to direct the IPC to produce a recommendation with the final decision to be taken by the Minister. We would expect such cases to be very rare so the Bill will therefore set out clearly the conditions that will apply to the exercise of this power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="71127m0002.htm_para6"><a name="07112768000093">In addition to our proposals for reform of major infrastructure, the Bill will include a number of significant measures aimed at ensuring that the town and country planning better supports housing growth and climate change, and is more streamlined and efficient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="71127m0002.htm_para7"><a name="07112768000094">The Bill will implement our proposals to introduce a new charge, entitled the Community Infrastructure Levy, to enable local authorities to secure a bigger contribution from developers towards the costs of infrastructure. We are pleased that our proposals have been widely welcomed by developers and local government. We will publish further details of the proposals on my Department&#146;s website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="71127m0002.htm_para8"><a name="07112768000095">Local plans have a key part to play in enabling local authorities to set a clear strategic vision for their communities. The Bill will therefore include a number of provisions to make plan-making simpler and more flexible, which will be supported by a revised planning policy statement. It will also include a new duty on local authorities to take action on climate change through local plans. This duty will be underpinned by a new planning policy statement on climate change which we will publish before the end of the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="71127m0002.htm_para9"><a name="07112768000096">Finally, the Bill will include provisions to reduce the number of planning applications, speed up appeals and simplify the tree preservation order system.

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="71127m0002.htm_para10"><a name="07112768000097">These provisions in the Bill will be supported by a range of measures to make it easier for homeowners to extend their homes and to install microgeneration technology, to introduce new planning performance agreements which will ensure large applications are dealt with effectively, and to allow an increase in fees for planning applications in order to enable local authorities to improve the quality of service they provide.

Alongside legislation on Housing and Regeneration, Climate Change, Energy and Local Transport this Bill will help to deliver our objectives in relation to housing, climate change, energy security, transport provision, and prosperity and quality of life for all. The Planning Bill will do this by ensuring that we have an efficient planning system which produces fair and transparent outcomes on decisions which are vital both to the local communities they most affect, and to the long term challenges facing us as a nation.</p>

The national policy statement will also be informed by parallel to planning and price review processes such as the Water Resource Management Plans which water companies will produce and the quinquennial reviews of water company sewerage charges.</p>

The Commission&#146;s subsequent proposals for taking forward the deployment through a public procurement were published in September and were presented to Ministers at the October Council. At that Council, Ministers called for an integrated decision by the end of this year.

Parliament that the measure should not apply to voyages on inland waterways. Our previous concerns in respect of subsidiarity have been resolved by the changes made in negotiation. The second maritime measure is a recast directive designed to update the existing directives relating to ship inspection and survey organisations. The proposal seeks to establish mutual recognition of the certificates which the organisations issue, introduces a financial penalty system to address poor performance, and places a requirement on the organisations to create a new certification system to improve their oversight. The Government are expecting that it will be possible to reach a political agreement, although there are some drafting issues relating to the proposed financial penalty system which need refinement.</p>

Negotiations on both of these proposals continue and we hope will go forward under the Slovenian presidency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_442"><a name="71127m0004.htm_para5"><a name="07112768000225">The Council will aim to reach a political agreement on each of three proposals <i>on rail interoperability and safety</i> which have been negotiated together. These are: a directive on interoperability of the Community rail system, combining three previous directives; a directive amending the 2004 directive on rail safety; and a directive amending the 2004 directive which established the European Rail Agency. The October Council reached a General Approach on the first two of these. The UK supports the objectives of the Commission's proposals and welcomes any initiative that improves cross-acceptance of rolling stock, and simplifies and modernises the technical part of the regulatory framework for rail. The texts being put to the Council are acceptable to the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_443"><a name="71127m0004.htm_para6"><a name="07112768000226">The Council will aim to reach a General Approach on a directive on <i>airport charges</i>, which aims to establish a framework of common principles as to how airports determine their charges for aircraft landing, take-off and handling of passengers. As part of this, the directive requires the establishment of independent regulators. In negotiation, the UK has sought a proportionate text that does not impose unnecessary regulatory burdens on airlines or airports, and a number of amendments to this effect have been made to the draft.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_444"><a name="71127m0004.htm_para7"><a name="07112768000227">The Council will aim to reach Political Agreement on a recast regulation on <i>common rules for the operation of air transport services</i> in the Community (the &#147;third package review&#148;). This consolidates the three existing regulations of 1992, which established the aviation single market. The proposal seeks to update the regulations in the light of experience of the single market. The UK broadly supports the proposal, in particular on pricing and consumer protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_445"><a name="71127m0004.htm_para8"><a name="07112768000228">Two issues of <i>aviation external relations</i> are on the agenda. The Council will be asked to adopt decisions giving the Commission mandates to negotiate with Jordan on a Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement, and with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on an agreement regarding aviation security audits and inspections and related matters. The UK is content for both mandates to be granted by the Council.</p>

 Today I am announcing the distribution of a package of funding of more than &#163;4 billion to improve local transport outside London over the remaining three years of the Local Transport Plan period. An indicative announcement of half of this funding package was made last year. This announcement confirms that funding is available now the comprehensive spending review has been completed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_446"><a name="71127m0004.htm_para9"><a name="07112768000230">It builds on the &#163;8.5 billion provided to the 122 local transport authorities, including the six passenger transport authorities, over the last seven years for small local transport improvements and capital highways maintenance. These improvements tackle pinch points, improve integration and provide genuine alternatives to the car.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_447"><a name="71127m0004.htm_para10"><a name="07112768000231">The &#163;4,036 billion package consists of &#163;1.768 billion for integrated transport improvements and &#163;2.268 billion for highways capital maintenance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_448"><a name="71127m0004.htm_para11"><a name="07112768000232">This capital funding is in addition to the &#163;2.3 billion made available in regional funding allocations for local authority major schemes and Highways Agency schemes of regional significance over the next three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_449"><a name="71127m0004.htm_para12"><a name="07112768000233">Local transport plans have now been implemented for more than six years. Local transport authorities can be proud of the way they are creating safer, cleaner environments. They have made great progress in reducing local road casualties, improving the condition of many local road networks, providing facilities for cyclists and pedestrians and integrating transport planning alongside that of health, education and housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_450"><a name="71127m0004.htm_para13"><a name="07112768000234">Alongside this year's settlement we have also confirmed financial planning guidelines (announced last year) for a specific road safety grant set up as part of the move to integrate safety cameras into the wider road safety delivery process from 1 April 2007. The funding totals &#163;330 million over three years&#151;that is, &#163;110 million per year. Some &#163;286 million of this is being distributed to local authorities outside London. The remaining &#163;44 million is for London and national agencies. This funding represents a long-term commitment to fund further improvements in road safety and provides local authorities and their partners with the flexibility to implement a locally agreed mix of road safety measures that will deliver the greatest reductions in road casualties in their area.</p>
