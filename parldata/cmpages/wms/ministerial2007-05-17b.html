 The Government are today publishing a consultation document setting out proposals for the distribution of unclaimed assets within the UK. This second unclaimed assets consultation document&#151;&#147;Unclaimed Assets Distribution Mechanism: A Consultation&#148;&#151;follows on from the previous document published in March this year<sup>(1)</sup> and provides further detail on how unclaimed assets will be reinvested in the community, with a focus, in England, on funding for youth services and financial capability and inclusion. The devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will determine their own priorities for distribution which reflect the needs of communities in each country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="70517m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07051786000029">The consultation document proposes using the Big Lottery Fund (BIG) as the main UK-wide unclaimed assets distribution body. BIG has a UK-wide distribution infrastructure in place, capacity to handle assets on this scale, extensive experience of delivering community programmes&#151;with emphasis on young people, and the know-how on distributing funding through a different range of organisations, particularly from the third sector. Using BIG, an existing organisation, to distribute these assets will also help to limit spending on administration costs, meaning that more money reaches the front line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="70517m0001.htm_para1"><a name="07051786000030">The Government also want to use a proportion of unclaimed assets to help develop the social investment market and invest in the long-term sustainability of the third sector, and will look at another delivery option to channel funds into this area.</p>

Some 199 of the 200 decisions&#151;99.5 per cent.&#151;made by the Secretary of State during this period on cases other than appeals under tree preservation orders were made within their statutory timetables, as were 694 out of 702 decisions&#151;98.9 per cent.&#151;on tree preservation order appeals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="70517m0001.htm_para4"><a name="07051786000035">These provisions relate to decisions on called-in planning applications; planning appeals recovered for the Secretary of State's decision; other cases linked to such decisions, including listed building consent, conservation area consent, advertisement consent and enforcement notice appeals; and tree preservation order appeals.

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="70517m0001.htm_para5"><a name="07051786000037">The &#163;1 million contribution to the fund announced by the Chancellor will be used by the Red Cross to administer two separate schemes. &#163;900,000 will establish an ongoing fund that will offer immediate small scale payments to UK victims bereaved or injured in terrorist attacks overseas. Payments will be made in two phases using a simple application process. Phase 1 payments of &#163;3,000 will be paid immediately. Phase 2 payments of &#163;12,000 will be available on application, to those severely injured or bereaved. Twenty-one interim payments of &#163;3,000 have already been made since March 2006; all those who have received interim payments will also be eligible to apply for second phase payments of &#163;12,000.

life-threatening illnesses and their families. This review offers an important opportunity to look at current provision and consider what more can be done to improve the sustainability and accessibility of services in both the statutory and voluntary sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="70517m0001.htm_para11"><a name="07051786000054">I welcome the thorough review that has been conducted by Professor Sir Alan Craft and Sue Killen and thank them for their efforts. Their report comes at an important point in the evolution of children&#146;s services and it is critical that children and their families have confidence in the valuable support that palliative care services currently provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="70517m0001.htm_para12"><a name="07051786000056">I also recognise and pay tribute to the pioneering work carried out over the years by the voluntary sector and by hugely committed doctors, nurses and other care workers that has got us to this point. Together they have raised the profile of children&#146;s palliative care and this has resulted in a model of care which enables the children and families who use those services to live in dignity and comfort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="70517m0001.htm_para13"><a name="07051786000058">The independent reviewers have made various recommendations to improve and develop palliative care services and the commissioning and planning systems in which they operate. In the longer-term, they recommend that palliative care should become a sub-specialty in its own right and be a properly funded service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="70517m0001.htm_para14"><a name="07051786000060">Some of the recommendations are contingent on the comprehensive spending review, the results of which will not be known for some months, while others are for consideration by the voluntary sector, the royal colleges, regulators and other Government Departments such as the Department for Education and Skills. We are committed to working with these key partners to achieve real and lasting change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="70517m0001.htm_para15"><a name="07051786000062">The Government will consider carefully the recommendations and their implications for life-limited children and young people and for the health and social care system across the country. A detailed Government response will be formed alongside plans to take forward any recommendations coming out of HM Treasury and the Department for Education and Skills review of disabled children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="70517m0001.htm_para16"><a name="07051786000064">In the meantime, I am setting up a delivery group of key stakeholders to co-ordinate delivery on those recommendations that can be taken forward immediately, including the development of a national strategy for children&#146;s palliative care. I very much hope those invited will accept the offer to work with the Government to help achieve the step-change we all desire.</p>
