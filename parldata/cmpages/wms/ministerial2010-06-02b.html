 The EU Competitiveness Council took place in Brussels on 25 and 26 May 2010. The Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, my right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="100602m0001.htm_para2"><a name="1006028000016">The Council approved conclusions on the future of the trade mark system in Europe and the Commission confirmed their commitment to the harmonisation of EU trade marks systems and the enforcement of intellectual property rights.

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="100602m0001.htm_para4"><a name="1006028000018">The any other business items discussed covered a draft regulation on textile labelling, the Commission's EU digital agenda document, the latest EU consumer markets scoreboard and a legal framework for gambling and betting in the EU.
