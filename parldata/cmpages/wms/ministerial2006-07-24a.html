provided 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>24 July 2006 : Column 64WS</b><br>for a three year transitional period in which policies in old style
plans could remain in force pending adoption of policies in the new
development plan documents (DPDs) and regional spatial strategies
(RSS). The policies in the old style plans in place at commencement of
the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 are saved until the end
of the three year transitional period, which ends on 27 September 2007.
However, policies in plans that are adopted or approved after
commencement of the PCPA 2004 will be saved for three years from
adoption or approval date. If policies in old style plans are not
extended after the three year saved period and policies in DPDs and
RSSs have not replaced them, there will be a risk of a policy gap for
local planning authorities and regional planning bodies in carrying out
their planning functions. My officials will be writing to all local
planning authorities and regional planning bodies shortly to inform
them about the procedures that they will be required to follow when
making applications for extension of old style policies and the type of
polices that are likely to be given favourable
consideration.</p><p><a name="0607246000076">The
assessment of the case for saving old style policies will be based on
the criteria set out in Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 12 which
are:</p><a name="0607246000077"><ul><p class="tabletext">where
appropriate, there is a clear central
strategy;</p></ul><a name="0607246000078"><ul><p class="tabletext">the

Minister for Housing and Planning (Yvette Cooper):</b> In our
December response to the Kate Barker review of housing supply we
committed to reform the planning delivery grant to support local
housing delivery and conduct a wider consultation on local planning and
housing incentives. Today we launch the consultation on a proposal for
a new housing and planning delivery grant and the criteria for
allocations for the final year of the current planning delivery grant.
The consultation will run until 17 October 2006.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>24 July 2006 : Column 65WS</b><br><p><a name="0607246000086">The Government's
aim is to encourage local authorities to respond more effectively to
local housing demand. Over 200,000 new households are formed each year
but last year just under 170,000 additional homes were built, with
upward pressure on house prices as result. The Government believe that
local authorities do not have sufficient incentives to respond to
housing
need.</p><p><a name="0607246000087">Under
our proposals, a performance related grant would be paid to local
authorities as a reward for meeting the housing needs of the community
and in improving planning performance. The proposal is part of the
Government's package of measures to improve housing affordability and
our commitment to create and maintain sustainable
communities.</p><p><a name="0607246000088">The
Government's aim with a new grant would be to encourage local
authorities to become active in the delivery of new housing to meet
local housing demand. The grant would be awarded to local authorities
with high levels of demand who are delivering additional housing. The
proposal envisages that the grant would continue to resource planning
to ensure effective delivery of the new planning
system.</p><p><a name="0607246000089">We
are also consulting on the criteria to allocate
&#163;120 million of planning delivery grant for
the financial year 2007-08. Within this allocation we are proposing to
increase the percentage of planning delivery grant awarded to support
housing. This is to ensure that the grant better supports areas which
are delivering high numbers of new homes and areas struggling with
issues of low demand. We plan to announce the first part of this grant
in November 2006, with further announcements planned for spring
2007.</p><p><a name="0607246000090">Copies

Communities and Local Government, my right hon. Friend the Member for
South Shields
(Mr.Miliband).</p><p><a name="0607246000095">This
Government have an ambitious agenda for housing and regeneration. My
letter of 12 July to the Prime Minister outlined my vision for
developing mixed communities and increasing the supply of affordable
and market
housing.</p><p><a name="0607246000096">Delivering
this agenda requires a step-change in our activities. It is therefore
vital that we get our delivery arrangements absolutely right, with
clear, focused and accountable delivery
chains.</p><p><a name="0607246000097">The
current review of housing and regeneration provides an important
opportunity to build on the existing strengths of English Partnerships
and the Housing Corporation and ensure a coherent approach to
delivering new housing and mixed sustainable communities. We must make
the most of the skills and expertise of these bodies, and maximise the
use of private investment, public subsidy, land holdings and assets to
support and deliver local and regional housing and regeneration
strategies.</p><p><a name="0607246000098">At
the same time, the creation of the Department for Communities and Local
Government (DCLG) as a new strategic department, focused on delivering
for people and places, offers an opportunity to evaluate our wider
departmental delivery chain for housing and regeneration. I have
therefore asked my officials to undertake further work in three key
areas.</p><p><a name="0607246000099">First,
in addition to addressing the Housing Corporation and English
Partnerships, I have asked officials to examine the DCLG's delivery
functions to determine the scope for rationalising existing delivery
focused activities across the piece. Secondly, I have asked officials
to undertake a distinct stream of work on modernising the regulation of
affordable housing, particularly in the light of the increasing
involvement of the private sector. Finally and relatedly, I have asked
officials to carry out further work and analysis on the range of
potential modernisation and structural options for
reform.</p><p><a name="0607246000100">I
will make a further announcement in the autumn on my plans for creating
a modern, dynamic delivery chain to support stronger communities and
create places in which people feel proud to
live.</p><h4 align="center"><a name="0607246000027">The Queen Elizabeth

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Angela E. Smith):</b> Careless handling of
smokers' materials continues to be one of the major causes of UK
accidental fire deaths in the home. Evidence has shown that Reduced
Ignition Propensity (REP) cigarettes decrease the risk of inducing
ignition or progressive smouldering in materials, therefore reducing
the number of accidental fire deaths in the
home.</p><p><a name="0607246000110">RIP
cigarettes have been legislated for in New York State, California,
Vermont, Illinois, New Hampshire and Massachusets and are all now in
place, including Canada. The legislation requires that all cigarettes
conform to American Society of Testing and Materials Standard (ASTM
International).</p><p><a name="0607246000111">At
the request of the UK, supported by Sweden, the European Commission
undertook to look into the case for developing an appropriate technical
standard for RIP cigarettes. The Department for Communities and Local
Government will be working very closely with the Department of Health
which has led Government work on tobacco regulation, and the Department
for Trade and Industry which leads on consumer product safety. It is
expected that further discussion on the case for developing a European
technical standard for REP cigarettes will take place at the next
General Product Committee meeting in Brussels this September.</p><h4 align="center"><a name="0607246000029">Planning

Government, usually because the development is large and controversial
(out of a total of 25,000 appeals, some 150 were recovered for decision
by the Secretary of State last year). This statement sets out the
Secretary of State's policy on recovering planning appeals and replaces
the previous policy on which appeals are recovered for the Secretary of
State's determination (which was set out in a House of Commons Hansard
Written Answer for 25 July 2000). These changes are being made to
achieve a greater focus on those cases which merit Ministerial
decision, and over time to lead to a reduction in the number of cases
recovered and produce time savings in decision
making.</p><p><a name="0607246000113">In

received Royal Assent on 11 July 2006. The Act aims to tackle four
areas at the core of a healthy democracy by improving access, improving
confidence, extending openness and transparency of party financing and
maintaining professional delivery of
elections.</p><p><a name="0607246000130">In
line with the Government's commitment to bring as many of the important
provisions in the Act into force as soon as possible a commencement
order has been made which includes the following key
provisions:</p><a name="0607246000704"><ul><p class="tabletext">New
rules for transparency and permissibility of
loans,</p></ul><a name="0607246000705"><ul><p class="tabletext">Registration

permissibility to that set out for donations in Political Parties,
Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA) to loans from political
parties will come into force on 11 September 2006. The Government
consider that it is important for the new regime to be brought into
force at the earliest opportunity. Political parties will be required
to report to the Electoral Commission all regulated transactions
existing at that date and any entered into between that date and the
end of that month, within 30 days from the end of September. Taken
together, the existing donations regime and the new regulated
transactions regime provides a robust and transparent mechanism to
ensure that significant financial benefits to political parties are
disclosed.</p><p><a name="0607246000132">We
have also brought into force a package of offences in the Electoral

both the application for postal and proxy votes as well as offences
around the conduct of elections. We believe that it is vital that we
tackle potential problems of fraud in relation to elections. Along with
other provisions in the Act that will be brought into force in time for
the May 2007 elections we believe this represents a comprehensive set
of legislative changes that will improve the confidence in the
electoral
system.</p><p><a name="0607246000133">The
Government are also committed to improving the accuracy of the register
and tackling potential registration fraud at the earliest opportunity.
We have therefore commenced those provisions in the Act that relate to
the annual canvass process so that they can be in place for the 2006
annual canvass. This includes the new duty on Electoral Registration
Officers (EROs) to carry out necessary steps to maintain the register
and the new registration offence of supplying false information in
connection with registration. Both these provisions will come into
force on 11 September
2006.</p><p><a name="0607246000134">In
addition, the Electoral Administration Act contains miscellaneous
provisions in part 7 which are designed to simplify and streamline
procedures for the regulation of political parties and many of these
will come into force on 11 September
2006.</p><p><a name="0607246000135">The
power for the Electoral Commission to set performance standards in
relation to electoral activity will also come into force on 11
September. This will allow the Electoral Commission to carry out the
important preparatory work in relation to the performance standards
scheme.</p><p><a name="0607246000136">We
aim for the Electoral Administration Act to be implemented in full,
where possible, for the May 2007 elections. We will therefore be making

In an environment where concerns about identity fraud are growing and

to the economy and to society as a whole, it is essential for people to
be confident their personal data will not be willfully or recklessly

the risks that come with greater data use. The aim of this proposal is
to provide an appropriate and effective level of deterrent for those
who seek to profit from the illegal trade in personal information. We
welcome the recent report by the Information Commissioner 'What price

Minister of State, Ministry of Defence (Mr. Adam
Ingram):</b> The then Secretary of State for Defence, (John
Reid), announced on 30 January 2006, <i>Official Report</i>, column 3WS
the move of 4 Mechanised Brigade (4 Armoured Brigade) to the
UK from Germany. At the same time, we made clear that we would take the
opportunity to make further adjustments to our forces in Germany, where
it made sense to do so. I want today to announce that an initial review
of the opportunities for further rationalisation of our basing
arrangements in Germany has developed proposals for the possible return
to the UK of Headquarters Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (HQ
ARRC), 102 Logistic Brigade (102 Log Bde) and 1 Signal Brigade
(1 Sig Bde), over the period 2008-2012, including identifying exactly
where these units will be based in the UK. A project team is being
established to assess these proposals in greater detail, and to
determine whether they are practicable and offer value for money. An
important part of the team's remit will be to consider in more depth
where in the UK we could re-locate HQ ARRC and the two brigades. The
team will produce an initial report around the end of the year; it is
unlikely that we will be in a position to announce final decisions
until well into
2007.</p><p><a name="0607246000143">I

nation, of our plans, and the Chief of Defence Staff has written to the

assignment as Headquarters NATO Rapid Deployment
Corps
(UK).</p><p><a name="0607246000144">Separately,
we also plan a series of minor moves within Germany which will lead to
the closure of Osnabr?/4ck Station from early 2009. This will
entail moving 1 Close Support Medical Regiment (1 CSMR) from its
current base in M?/4nster Station to alternative British army
estate in Germany, and replacing them with another unit, the identity
of which will be determined by further analysis. These moves will
enable Osnabr?/4ck Station to close. Subject to the conclusions of
the project team, further moves are envisaged in due course that would
enable us to close Minister Station and therefore Osnabr?/4ck
Garrison as a whole. The current planning assumption is that this would
not take place before 2010. The relocation of HQ ARRC, 102 Log
Bde and 1 Sig Bde would also enable us to close Rhine Garrison in the
period 2010-2012. This will concentrate our Germany-based forces in
Hohne, Paderborn and Gutersloh
garrisons.</p><p><a name="0607246000146">We
also plan to return 12 Regiment Royal Artillery from Paderborn to the
UK as early as summer 2007, as we re-organise our air defence regiments
and capitalise on UK based facilities for High Velocity Missile Stormer
vehicles. As a result, 12 Regiment will collocate with 47 Regiment
Royal Artillery at Thorney Island. Consequently, 16 Regiment Royal
Artillery, which we had previously envisaged moving from Woolwich to
Thorney Island, will now be based in North Luffenham in summer 2007. In
order to enable the necessary re-balancing in Germany, 12 Regiment's
barracks in Paderborn will be occupied by another unit, the identity of
which will be determined by further
analysis.</p><p><a name="0607246000147">We
will continue to make further modest adjustments to our force levels in
Germany, but our plan remains to base UK forces in the country, in the
form of 1 Armoured Division and its supporting units, for many years to
come. These moves and the work of the project team in no way signal a
change in either our commitment to the NATO Alliance or in our overall
defence policy, nor do they in any way devalue the continued close
bilateral relationship between the UK and
Germany.</p><h4 align="center"><a name="0607246000036">General Service

961, I announced the settlement package for the Royal Irish (Home

normalisation process in Northern Ireland. Included within the
settlement package was an alternative to redundancy; a taxable
&#163;10,000 engagement bounty offer to all those eligible R IRISH
(HS) personnel who wished to transfer, and are accepted for a general
service engagement in the wider army. We had anticipated that around
250 such personnel would take the opportunity to continue with their
military career in the army, but, to date, only a handful of
the R IRISH (HS) personnel are in the process of being
accepted into general service army.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>24 July 2006 : Column 73WS</b><br><p><a name="0607246000149">I very much meant

a result, I am announcing today a one-off increase to the general

decision to increase the bounty was taken in order to encourage more
eligible R IRISH (HS) personnel to opt for transfer, rather

Civilians in Northern

Minister of State, Ministry of Defence (Mr. Adam
Ingram):</b> I am pleased to announce the severance package
for the estimated 1,500 MOD civilians in Northern Ireland being made
redundant during the period 1 August 2006 to 31 December 2008, as a
result of the process of
normalisation.</p><p><a name="0607246000152">You
will recall that when I announced the package for the Royal Irish (Home
Service) (R IRISH (HS)) on 9 March 2006, <i>Official Report,
</i>Column 961 I explained that a process of consultation would take
place with the trades unions on the civilian redundancies in accordance
with our duties under Section 188 of the Trades Unions and Labour
Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. That consultation has now been
concluded and the redundancy package has been
decided.</p><p><a name="0607246000153">First
of all, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the
dedication and commitment shown by MOD civilians in Northern Ireland
over many years in supporting the armed forces, and in helping bring
about the enabling environment for the current security normalisation
programme. While normalisation is good news for Northern Ireland, it
also brings substantial change for our civilian work force and my
Department has been working hard to draw up an enhanced redundancy
package for those affected. I am now in a position to provide details
of that
package.</p><p><a name="0607246000154">In
addition to the normal occupational redundancy package (which, for the
majority, will be compulsory terms under the Civil Service Compensation
Scheme (CSCS)), affected staff will receive a flat rate financial
recognition award (FRA) payment of &#163;14,000
gross.</p><p><a name="0607246000155">The
payment is being made, in recognition of a unique set of circumstances,
to MOD civilians based in Northern Ireland which are a combination of
the following
factors:</p><a name="0607246000710"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
pressures and restrictions arising from their association with the
armed forces in Northern Ireland, which they experienced while working
for MOD and are likely to continue to affect them in the immediate
aftermath of being made
redundant;</p></ul><a name="0607246000711"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
difficulties they may experience as a result of normalisation and
directly arising from their former association with the armed forces in
Northern Ireland; and</p></ul><a name="0607246000712"><ul><p class="tabletext">The effect of those
pressures being exacerbated by the fact that the whole of the R IRISH
(HS) is being disbanded, affecting over 3,000 individuals and nearly 50
per cent. of the civilian workforce are losing their jobs over a
compressed
timescale.</p></ul><p><a name="0607246000156">In summary,
during the period 1 August 2006 to 31
December 2008 MOD civil servants made redundant through the process of
normalisation will receive:</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>24 July 2006 : Column 74WS</b><br><a name="0607246000713"><ul><p class="tabletext">Redundancy compensation
under the terms of their occupational redundancy
scheme;</p></ul><a name="0607246000714"><ul><p class="tabletext">Access
to the MOD outplacement service for a period of 12 months (an
increase over the normal 6
months);</p></ul><a name="0607246000715"><ul><p class="tabletext">A
re-training allowance of up to &#163;1,000 per person,
and</p></ul><a name="0607246000716"><ul><p class="tabletext">A flat
rate additional payment of &#163;14,000
gross.</p></ul><p><a name="0607246000157">The package,
which goes significantly beyond statutory entitlements, is well
deserved and we hope will be well received by MOD civilians in Northern
Ireland. To put this into context, typically an individual who is aged
50 or over and made redundant between 1 August 2006 and 31
December 2008 will receive the immediate payment of an enhanced pension
(and a tax free pension lump sum for those in the 1972 section of the
Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS)), redundancy
compensation of up to six months pensionable pay and the FRA of
&#163;14,000. To give examples, a 51-year-old band C with an average
salary of &#163;26,167 and 31 years service will receive a lump sum
payment of &#163;27,084 (this is the redundancy compensation and the
FRA), in addition they will receive their pension lump sum of
approximately &#163;30,419 and an annual pension; a 54-year-old B and
E/skill zone 3 with an average salary of 17,975 and 34 years
service will receive a lump sum payment of &#163;22,987 (this is the
redundancy compensation and the FRA), in addition they will receive
their pension lump sum of approximately &#163;25,136 and an annual
pension. Those staff under age 50 and made redundant in the same period
will typically receive a preserved pension payable at age 60,
redundancy compensation up to three times their annual pensionable pay
and the FRA of &#163;14,000. To illustrate, a 34-year-old band
E/Skill Zone 3 with an average salary of &#163;17,975 and 16 years
service will receive a lump sum payment of &#163;43,958; a 27 year
old band D/skill zone 4 with an average salary of &#163;20,617 and 9
years service will receive a lump sum payment of &#163;29,463. These
lump sums are the combined totals of redundancy compensation and the
FRA. Redundancy compensation and the FRA combined will be tax free up
to the first &#163;30,000 in accordance with the Income Tax (Earnings
and Pensions) Act
2003.</p><p><a name="0607246000158">This is a
generous package for a unique set of circumstances for those MOD
civilians in Northern Ireland made redundant between 1 August 2006
and 31 December

Enhancements</h4><p><a name="0607246000159"><b><a name="0607246000744">The
Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne):</b> I have made
clear my determination to ensure the armed forces on operations have
the resources they need to do the job. I said I would update the House
on developments in two particular areas of operational capability:
additional options for armoured vehicles and helicopter support for
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="0607246000160">As I told the
House on 26 June, I ordered an urgent review of our armoured vehicle
fleet, particularly focused on the evolving threat in Iraq, but
covering the whole operational picture including Afghanistan, to ensure
we were providing commanders with the best
options.</p><p><a name="0607246000161">That
review has now concluded. It has confirmed that there is a growing
requirement for a protected 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>24 July 2006 : Column 75WS</b><br>vehicle with capabilities between our heavy armour, such as Warrior, and
lighter patrol vehicles, such as SNATCH. The review has also identified
feasible options to address the gap in the short term. We have now
completed a very rapid assessment of those options and have identified
three, complementary, ways forward. Two of these build on, and
accelerate, work already ongoing in the Department. The third is new.
The necessary funding will come in part from acceleration of existing
funding within the defence budget, and in part from substantial new
funding from the
Treasury.</p><p><a name="0607246000162">The
first element is an additional buy of around 100 VECTOR, our new
Pinzgauer based protected patrol vehicle, for Afghanistan, on top of
the 62 already on contract. VECTOR provides good protection and,
importantly, increased mobility and capacity compared to SNATCH which
makes it very suitable for the rugged terrain and long patrol distances
in
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="0607246000163">The
second element is to provide around 70 additional up-armoured and
upgraded FV430 to equip a mechanised infantry battlegroup for Iraq by
the spring of 2007, again on top of the 54 we have already ordered. The
FV430 will be delivered incrementally with the first vehicles currently
expected to be delivered this
autumn.</p><p><a name="0607246000165">Significantly
smaller and lighter than Warrior, the up-armoured FV430 will provide a
similar level of protection while being less intimidating and having
less impact on local infrastructure&#151;thereby providing commanders
with an important additional option. Since it is able to carry out many
of the same tasks as Warrior, it will also relieve pressure on heavily
committed Warrior vehicles and armoured infantry
battlegroups.</p><p><a name="0607246000166">The
third, new element is the Cougar manufactured by Force Protection
Incorporated of Charleston, South Carolina. We judge that this vehicle
meets our requirement for a well protected, wheeled patrol vehicle with
a less intimidating profile than tracked vehicles like Warrior or
FV430. We are arranging to rapidly procure around 100 vehicles through
US military sources. We have received excellent co-operation from the
US Government, military and industry&#151;an example of the special
relationship bringing real benefits for our soldiers on the ground.
Once we take possession of the vehicles, we must then customise them
with Bowman radios and electronic counter-measures&#151;and then fit
additional armour beyond the standard level, to ensure they have the
best possible protection. This procurement and enhancement process
takes time. But we expect to be able to deliver the vehicles, in
batches, with an effective capability in place before the end of the
year and continuing through the next six month rotations in Iraq and
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="0607246000168">These three
vehicles will complement existing Warrior and SNATCH. Warrior will
continue to provide the capability to deal with the most demanding
threats, but its profile and weight makes is unsuitable for some
operations and situations, such as Afghanistan. SNATCH, with a much
less intimidating profile, enables troops to interact with locals and
promotes a sense of normality and will remain a key tool for building
and maintaining consent. The up-armoured FV430, the Cougar medium PPV,
and 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>24 July 2006 : Column 76WS</b><br>VECTOR fill the requirements for varying degrees of protection, mobility
and profile between these two extremes. But I am confident that
together these vehicles provide commanders with the right range of
options to deal with the situations and threats they
face.</p><p><a name="0607246000169">In
my Afghanistan Statement on 10 July 2006, <i>Official Report</i>,
Columns 1131-35, I detailed the additional forces we shall deploy to
Southern Afghanistan. I also undertook to provide farther details of
the enhancement of the Support Helicopter force deployed as part of the
Helmand Task Force once I had received definitive advice on the needs
of our Commanders on the ground. I have now had that advice, as
endorsed by the Chief of the Defence Staff, and I have directed that
those needs be met in
full.</p><p><a name="0607246000170">I
have therefore directed that two extra CH-47 CHINOOK be deployed: the
first in early September 2006, and the second in October. Helicopter
force levels will remain under constant
review.</p><p><a name="0607246000171">I
also wish to update the House on the units assigned to provide
additional forces for Afghanistan. Force protection for 28 Regiment,
Royal Engineers will be provided by W Company, 45 Commando, Royal
Marines, not a composite unit as has been suggested. Finally, I
erroneously referred in my earlier Statement to 12 Signal Regiment. The
unit listed should have been 14 Signal
Regiment.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="0607246000007">Communities

today, 24 July 2006, in Brussels. I am attending on behalf of the Home
Office. I thought it would be useful if I were to outline the main
issues I expect to be
discussed.</p><p><a name="0607246000198">The
Council will take an initial presentation by the Commission on the
Hague programme review. There will also be discussion of migration
issues and, in the Mixed Committee format, the second generation
Schengen Information System. On the first of these, the Commission will
present four communications: the future direction of the Hague
programme which includes a proposed use of Article 42 TEU (the
passerelle clause); reviewing the implementation of the Hague programme
to date (the scorecard); options for better evaluation of the impact of
EU policies in the area of Justice and Home Affairs (JHA); and a
legislative proposal based on Article 67(2) TEC adapting the provisions
of the European Court of Justice under Title IV (immigration, asylum
and civil law matters). The presidency has indicated that they will
focus on procedure and handling and is not looking for substantive
discussion on these items at this Council. Detailed discussion,
including in relation to the more controversial aspects, such as the
possible use of Article 42 TEU (the passarelle clause) and Article
67(2) TEC (adapting the remit of the ECJ in Title IV) will take place
later in the year, including at the September Informal JHA Council in
Finland. Those aspects aside, the Governments initial view is to
welcome the focus on implementation and more effective evaluation
contained in the
communications.</p><p><a name="0607246000200">There
will be information items on the EU preparations for the UN high-level
dialogue on international migration and development and the report on
the outcome of the Euro African ministerial conference on migration and
development held in Rabat on 10-11 July 2006. The Government welcome
the adoption of the EU common position at the General Affairs and
External Relations Council last week, 13 July; we will continue to feed
into preparations for the UN High Level Dialogues on

There will also be a presentation by the Commission and Frontex (EU
Border Agency) on the situation in the Mediterranean and Africa. We
expect there to be a focus on the continuing influx of illegal
immigrants to the Canaries and Malta. The UK strongly supports EU joint
operational activity in the Mediterranean and has offered technical
assistance to the Spanish and Maltese
authorities.</p><p><a name="0607246000202">There
will be discussion on the management of migration flows; specifically
on the two Commission Communications on: a policy plan for legal
migration; and a common policy on illegal immigration. The presidency
will be seeking a first exchange of views on both items. The UK will be
encouraging solutions of sharing best practice and establishing common
principles, while advising against inflexible, detailed prescription,
especially in the form of legislative measures on labour
access.</p><p><a name="0607246000204">The
Government are fully committed to tackling the problem of illegal
immigration of third country nationals and notes with interest the
Commission&#146;s Communication; we will examine concrete proposals
for measures when they are tabled in due
course.</p><p><a name="0607246000206">In
the mixed committee format the presidency will be hoping to agree a
general approach on the key outstanding issues in the three legal
instruments establishing SIS II&#151;a regulation covering
immigration aspects, a Council decision covering law enforcement
aspects and a regulation covering access by vehicle registration
authorities&#151;with a view to reaching a First Reading deal with
the European Parliament in September. This is the last opportunity to
resolve the major outstanding issues within the Council before the
expected EP vote in September. The UK will not participate in the
regulation covering immigration but will participate in the other two
legal
instruments.</p><p><a name="0607246000208">Two
further presentations by the Commission are expected in the margins of
the meeting. These are on: i) a proposal for a regulation setting up
the powers and the financing of teams of national border control
experts of member states (Rapid Border Intervention Teams) to provide
joint EU technical and operational assistance at the external EU
Border, co-ordinated by Frontex and ii) a proposal for a community code
on visas&#151;a Schengen measure in which the UK will not
participate. Although the UK will not participate in the first
proposal, we support the concept of nominated experts deployed at short
notice to respond to emergencies to help enhance the security of the EU
external border, but will wish to look carefully at the
detail.</p><p><a name="0607246000210">Finally there is

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Joan
Ryan):</b> I wish to announce that the publication entitled
Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals&#151;Great
Britain&#151;2005 is being presented as a Command Paper (6877) today.
Copies will be placed in the House Library.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>24 July 2006 : Column 82WS</b><br><p><a name="0607246000213">This annual report
meets the requirement in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986
to keep Parliament informed about the use of animals for experimental
or other purposes. It also forms the basis for meeting periodic
reporting requirements at EU level. There has been criticism in
previous years, including from a House of Lords Select Committee, for
providing too much detail and not being very digestible or
reader-friendly. Therefore some changes have been made to improve the
contents and layout of this publication with the intention of making
the publication easier to comprehend and
follow.</p><p><a name="0607246000215">The
report shows an overall increase over the previous year of 1.4 per
cent. in the number of procedures undertaken. The total number of
procedures was 2.9 million, an increase of 41,300 over the
previous year. Although this is the highest total since 1992, it does
not necessarily signal an established upwards trend in animal use. A
number of factors, including the economic climate and global trends in
scientific endeavour, determine the overall level of scientific
procedures.</p><p><a name="0607246000217">Non-toxicological
procedures accounted for about 86 per cent. of the procedures carried
out in 2005. These included studies for fundamental biological or
applied research in human and veterinary medicine, with the main areas
of use being for immunological studies, pharmaceutical research and
development, and cancer
research.</p><p><a name="0607246000219">Procedures
for toxicological purposes accounted for the remaining 14 per cent. of
all procedures. About 73 per cent. of these were for testing
the safety and efficacy of new drugs and
medicines.</p><p><a name="0607246000221">In
keeping with previous years, those procedures that used mice or rats
(or other rodents) were the great majority at 84 per cent. Those using
fish amounted to 8 per cent. and those using birds, 4 per
cent. The total of all procedures using dogs, cats, horses and
non-human primates, that is, those species offered special protection
by the Act, was less than 1 per cent. of the
total.</p><p><a name="0607246000223">Genetically
normal animals were used in about 1.65 million regulated
procedures, representing 57 per cent. of all procedures for 2005
(compared with 59 per cent. in 2004 and 84 per cent. in 1995).
Genetically modified animals (nearly all rodents) were used in 957,500
regulated procedures representing, 33 per cent. of all procedures for
2005 (compared with 32 per cent. in 2003 and 8 per cent. in
1995).</p><p><a name="0607246000225">These trends have
been evident over recent years, reflecting the changing balance in use
between genetically normal and modified animals, and are set to
continue as advances in genetic science open up new and promising
avenues of
research.</p><p><a name="0607246000227">I
should point out in relation to the statistics that the Home
Office, as regulatory authority under the 1986 Act, does not control
the overall amount of animal research and testing which takes place,
the imperative being to minimise the numbers of animals used for
justifiable purposes. We ensure, in carrying out our licensing
function, that the provisions of the Act are rigorously applied in each
programme of work. All animal use must be justified, and that for each
particular programme of work the number of animals used, and the
suffering caused must be minimised.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>24 July 2006 : Column 83WS</b><br><h4 align="center"><a name="0607246000048">Passport

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Joan
Ryan):</b> The Privy Council has made an Order in Council, the
Consular Fees (Amendment) Order 2006, which gives authority for a
revision in passport fees. The revision will take effect on 5 October
2006. The fee for a standard 32 page passport will increase from
&#163;51 to &#163;66 while the fee for a 48 page passport will
increase from &#163;62.50 to &#163;77. The fee for a passport for a
child will increase from &#163;34 to &#163;45. The fee for an adult
using the guaranteed one week counter service for a standard 32 page
passport will increase from &#163;77.50 to &#163;91, for a child
from &#163;70 to &#163;80 and a 48 page jumbo from &#163;87 to
&#163;97. The fee for an adult using the guaranteed same day service
for a standard 32 page passport will increase from &#163;96.50 to
&#163;108, for a child from &#163;83 to &#163;93 and for a 48
page passport from &#163;104.50 to &#163;114.50. The fee for a
collective passport, for organised trips for schools and youth groups,
will remain unchanged at
&#163;39.</p><p><a name="0607246000230">This
increase represents the second stage of the two year fee agreement
reached with HM Treasury last year. This followed a stringent review of
costs to ensure that the fee for each type of passport service closely
reflects the production costs accrued by that service and bear its
share of the cost of consular protection services. This increase will
deliver extensive improvements required in the ongoing efforts to
combat passport and identity
fraud.</p><h4 align="center"><a name="0607246000049">United Kingdom

Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary
Benn):</b> I am deeply concerned about the humanitarian
situation in the Lebanon and in the Gaza
Strip.</p><p><a name="0607246000233">In
Lebanon, the crisis has led the UN to estimate that at least 500,000
people have been displaced. Insecurity and damaged infrastructure is
making it difficult to reach those in need of medical care, food and
water supplies. The supply of electricity has stopped to most villages
and towns in southern Lebanon. Stocks of fuel will be exhausted in two
weeks. Factories producing medicines, milk, wood, and housing supplies
have been destroyed. It is clear from 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>24 July 2006 : Column 84WS</b><br>aid agencies that they need immediate and safe access to the displaced
and the wounded and those requiring humanitarian assistance. I support
the proposals by the UN and ICRC for safe humanitarian access, but
ultimately the security situation needs to stabilise in order to ensure
that vital assistance can get where it is
needed.</p><p><a name="0607246000234">We
have responded to international appeals for humanitarian aid. Following
the initial response I announced last week, I am today committing a
further &#163;2.2 million to support humanitarian relief, including
for the UN Flash appeal, which has been launched today. The UN Central
Emergency Response Fund is also providing an initial contribution of $5
million (of which the UK share is $1.4 million [&#163;770,000]). This
brings the total UK commitment to &#163;5 million, and we stand ready
to do more as needed. DFID is deploying two humanitarian advisers to
the region. Two stabilisation and recovery advisers will join them
shortly. The Post Conflict Reconstruction Unit is helping
cross-government planning for the UK&#146;s contribution to
stabilisation and recovery, immediately hostilities
cease.</p><p><a name="0607246000235">The
situation in Gaza is also very difficult. Following the Israeli attack
on Gaza&#146;s only power station, electricity is limited to supplies
received from Israel. Households receive six to eight hours&#146;
electricity per day. Electricity is vital for hospitals and clinics,
which need constant supplies of power to run medical equipment and keep
drugs at constant temperatures. It is needed to pump fresh water to
houses and to treat sewage. It is essential for the safe storage of
food and for processing flour to make bread. Most households in Gaza
are receiving two hours of water per day. This means they do not have
reliable access to water for drinking, personal hygiene and washing
clothes. According to the World Health Organisation, cases for
diarrhoea among refugee children in Gaza in early July were 50 per
cent. higher than the same period last year. Humanitarian supplies are
vital. The Rafah crossing was opened temporarily on 18 July to allow
those stranded at the crossing in desperate conditions to enter, and
the Karni crossing was temporarily open for humanitarian and commercial
imports. But both are now closed again. Action is needed to ensure
unrestricted humanitarian access, including the supply of medical
equipment, fuel, food and electricity.</p><p><a name="0607246000236">The UK made a
contribution of &#163;15 million to the United Nations Relief and
Works Agency (UNRWA) in April, which provides basic services for
Palestinian refugees in Gaza, Lebanon, and elsewhere in the Middle
East. This is helping UNRWA provide healthcare and other basic services
to Palestinian refugees, which comprise 70 per cent. of Gaza&#146;s
population. The EU collectively provides over half of UNRWA&#146;s
funding, and the UK last year was the third largest bilateral
donor.</p><p><a name="0607246000237">The
European Union has established a temporary international mechanism to
support the basic needs of the Palestinian people. The mechanism will
provide support to health, education and social affairs, help to pay
for utilities and assist the very poorest Palestinians. The UK stands
ready to allocate up to &#163;12 million to the mechanism, plus our
share of the European Community contribution, giving a total of up
to &#163;25 million. The mechanism has already enabled much

power station was damaged by military action. These fuel deliveries are
keeping hospitals open, water pumps going and waste treatment plants
open. The mechanism will soon start making payments to health workers
in both Gaza and the West Bank to ensure they can continue to provide
essential medical care. We welcome the decision of G8 leaders to
immediately expand the mechanism to provide wider assistance to the
people of Gaza, we are working closely with the quartet and others to
ensure that this
happens.</p><p><a name="0607246000238">The
UK is also providing assistance to the United Nations Office for the
Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs to enable it to monitor closely
the humanitarian situation in Gaza to assist donors and others to make
sure help gets to those who need it
most.</p><p><a name="0607246000239">It
is particularly important for the humanitarian welfare of innocent
civilians in Lebanon, Israel, and Gaza that there is an end to the
violence on all sides. The UK Government support efforts to put in
place a durable
ceasefire.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06072413000001">Northern

the new Service was formally launched in June 2005 it initially only

of all youth offences occurring in the PSNFs Armagh, Banbridge and
Newry and Mourne districts as well as all prosecutions from the five
police districts within Fermanagh and Tyrone. A new Lisburn office,
serving as headquarters of the PPS eastern region opened in March 2006
and will be fully operational by October of this year when it will add
a further six police districts to those already within the PPS
structure.</p><p><a name="0607246000533">The
roll out of the PPS will continue through this year and next and when
completed will operate from six regional offices planned for Belfast,
Lisburn, Newry, Omagh, Londonderry and Ballyrnena. This regional
approach, with each office having its own regional prosecutor, will
encourage local involvement with the service, helping the community
understand its work and how it goes about reaching decisions and
thereby building public confidence in the criminal justice system. The
annual report and business plan is part of this process and will be of

review that I announced in December last year and the public
consultation launched in February this
year.</p><p><a name="0607246000647">I
will give a full update on progress in delivering these new measures in
the
autumn.</p><p><a name="0607246000648">I
will continue to scrutinise closely the way in which the scheme
operates and how it is used. Should further action be merited, I will
ensure that it is taken
quickly.</p><p><a name="0607246000649">The
new measures are as
follows:</p><p><a name="0607246000650"><i>New
Requirements for evidence of &#145;reasonable
cause&#146;</i></p><p><a name="0607246000651">(1)
New detailed guidance on what is likely to constitute
&#145;reasonable
cause&#146;.</p><p><a name="0607246000652">(2)
Clarity that behaviour in using data will be considered in judging
whether a particular applicant&#146;s assertions as to the
&#145;reasonable cause&#146; for his application are to be
believed; and in deciding upon whether approved conditional access is
granted or
maintained.</p><p><a name="0607246000655">(3)
For all applications where &#145;reasonable cause&#146; relates to
a vehicle left on land without permission or in breach of terms and
conditions, evidence is required that the applicant is the landowner or
has the permission of the landowner to pursue the vehicle
keeper.</p><p><a name="0607246000659">(4) For
all applications where &#145;reasonable cause&#146; relates to the
pursuit of a penalty charge, evidence is required that a penalty scheme
was indeed in place on that piece of land (that is, that there was
signage).</p><p><a name="0607246000662"><i>New
requirements for &#145;approved conditional
access&#146;</i></p><p><a name="0607246000663">(5)
Those bodies and companies seeking approved conditional access that do
not have an appropriate regulatory body are required to be current
members of an &#145;accredited&#146; trade association. Part of the
process for &#145;accrediting&#146; trade associations will include
ensuring that there is a clear and enforced code of conduct (for
example relating to conduct, parking charge signage, charge levels,
appeals procedure, approval of ticket wording; and appropriate pursuit
of penalties that is, approach by letter only and county court action
only to permit a house
call).</p><p><a name="0607246000666">(6)
Organisations that do not comply with the terms of the accredited trade
association will be expelled and without valid membership of another
accredited trade association will lose their approved conditional
access. Trade associations that do not police the conditions of
membership adequately will lose their
accreditation.</p><p><a name="0607246000667">(7)
All those seeking approved conditional access will be required to serve
a &#145;probationary&#146; period of six months or, if longer, for
the period of time it takes to make 20 requests&#151; during which
all requests should be made on a case by case
basis.</p><p><a name="0607246000670"><i>New
Measures to ensure awareness of the vehicle
keeper</i></p><p><a name="0607246000671">(8)
That all those who receive data, as evidence of their
&#145;reasonable behaviour&#146; and as a condition of
&#145;approved conditional access&#146;, include in any
correspondence with the keeper a leaflet or statement advising them
of:</p><a name="0607246000675"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
&#145;reasonable cause&#146; which formed the basis of the
request;</p></ul><a name="0607246000676"><ul><p class="tabletext">the

both DVLA and the Information Commissioner if they believe their data
have been used inappropriately;</p></ul><a name="0607246000677"><ul><p class="tabletext">the
appeals procedure (for the regulatory body) if they feel that, for

information is also placed on the DVLA
website.</p><p><a name="0607246000679">(9) That
DVLA maintain on its web site a list of organisations and companies who
have requested data and the reasons for their
request.</p><p><a name="0607246000680">(10) That
a reference to the location on the DVLA website of guidance and advice
and all other information relating to the release of vehicle keeper
data are included on all DVLA documentation sent to the vehicle
keeper&#151;including the annual VED
reminder.</p><p><a name="0607246000684"><i>New
Auditing Procedures and action to combat misuse or
complaints</i></p><p><a name="0607246000685">(11) A rolling 3-year
programme of audit check including targeted checks on those where
concerns have been
raised:</p><p><a name="0607246000687">(12) A
clear set of procedures where such concerns are
raised:</p><a name="0607246000688"><ul><p class="tabletext">An
audit is triggered by complaints of substance representing a
disproportionate level of granted requests or any complaint of a
serious nature if following implementation of the audit recommendations
a disproportionate level of complaints of substance are received an
organisation with approved conditional access will be required to
submit requests on a case by case basis; if it is already subject to
request on a case by case basis it will be subject to additional
scrutiny of each request it
makes;</p></ul><a name="0607246000689"><ul><p class="tabletext">if
a disproportionate level of further complaints of substance are
received and a company is found to be consistently using data
inappropriately or a serious complaint of abuse of the system by an
applicant is substantiated then there is a distinct possibility that we
will not believe the applicant to have reasonable cause upon a future
request and, if so, data release would then be declined in that
case.</p></ul><p><a name="0607246000690"><i>New
Complaints
Procedures</i></p><p><a name="0607246000691">(13)
A clear procedure by which data subjects can notify DVLA if they feel
that their data has been used inappropriately and take steps to draw
this to the attention of vehicle keepers by including information in
paperwork sent to them and on the DVLA website. This will include
information of how they can notify the Information Commissioner of the
misuse of their
data.</p><p><a name="0607246000693">(14)
Complaints received will form part of the evaluation of whether an
applicant&#146;s assertion of &#145;reasonable cause&#146; is
valid.</p>

These show that obtaining data from trustees is the key to making
payments and highlight the need to significantly strengthen the skills

data, concluding that this can best be achieved through an injection of
skills from the private sector or the pension protection fund. These
skills can best be managed from within DWP.</p><br><notus-date day="24" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>24 July 2006 : Column 98WS</b><br><p><a name="0607246000699">The review has
