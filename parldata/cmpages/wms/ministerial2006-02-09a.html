Inward transfers include; &#163;389,0000 from the Department of Trade and Industry to fund the Equalities Review, &#163;335,000 from various Government Departments to fund protective security measures relating to State and Government assets in central London and End Year Flexibility draw down of &#163;7,900,000.

<a name="60209m01.html_para3"><a name="stpa_3">The change in the capital element of the DEL arises from the transfer of &#163;20,000 capital as part of the MoG transfer to the Privy Counsel Office and &#163;1,110,000 as part of the MoG transfer of Government Car and Despatch Agency to the Department for Transport. There is also a transfer of &#163;557,000 to Her Majesty&#039;s Government Communications Centre for the provision of a new building and infrastructure at Hanslope Park.
