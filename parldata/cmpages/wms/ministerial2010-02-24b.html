<a name="subhd_1"><a name="100224m0001.htm_sbhd0"><a name="10022461000011"><h4 align="center">Capital Distributions</h4>

<p><a name="st_109"><a name="10022461000024"><a name="100224m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="10022461000292"><b>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</b>
 There is, at the moment, considerable uncertainty in relation to the corporation tax treatment of distributions. This uncertainty is causing significant problems to UK business and this statement is intended to establish with certainty a result that will be consistent with established expectations of HMRC practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="100224m0001.htm_para0"><a name="10022461000025">In the Finance Act 2009, the Government introduced a new distribution exemption regime. Since then most income distributions received by UK companies are exempt from corporation tax unless they are linked to tax avoidance. The rules ensure that the UK corporate tax regime remains competitive and represent a significant reduction in the compliance burden faced by UK companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="100224m0001.htm_para1"><a name="10022461000026">As intended, the exemption regime excludes distributions of a capital nature, which are subject to the chargeable gains rules where other exemptions may apply. However, the introduction of the new legislation has prompted HMRC to look more closely at the issue of whether a distribution is of a capital nature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="100224m0001.htm_para2"><a name="10022461000027">Before 2005 it was possible to interpret the law as saying that all UK distributions were income in nature unless a specific rule said otherwise-for example, distributions in a winding up. In 2005 a Tax Law Rewrite Act, in clarifying the law, made that view impossible to sustain. Despite this, prevailing practice remained unaltered and so UK distributions have generally been regarded until recently as income in nature and potentially exempt from corporation tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="100224m0001.htm_para3"><a name="10022461000028">In the absence of a rule treating distributions as income, companies in receipt of capital distributions may now face an unexpected tax charge. In some cases, it has become clear that commercial transactions have been put on hold until the tax consequences become clear, with a corresponding effect on the normal business of those companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="100224m0001.htm_para4"><a name="10022461000029">In order to resolve the issue, the Government will introduce legislation in the Finance Bill with a view to restoring previous expectations about the way that distributions are taxed. The changes will apply retrospectively where appropriate and will be subject to an opt out to ensure that UK retrospective application of the new legislation does not increase tax liabilities. These new rules will give UK companies the clarity they need to carry on their normal business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="100224m0001.htm_para8"><a name="10022461000034">The Government believe that Greece must act swiftly to implement these recommendations in line with the given timetable, and welcome the evaluation by the European Commission and ECB as well as the technical assistance being provided by the IMF, which has the experience to play an important supportive role.

 Following the successful legal and capital restructuring of Northern Rock, which took effect on 1 January 2010, the Government, in conjunction with the Financial Services Authority, have reviewed the guarantee arrangements applying to retail deposits held with Northern Rock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="100224m0001.htm_para15"><a name="10022461000042">The restructuring has resulted in the formation of a strong, well-capitalised, highly liquid bank that remains in Government ownership. The bank is authorised and  <br>

regulated by the FSA and customers' deposits are secure. The Government, in consultation with the FSA, have therefore assessed that it is now appropriate to give notice to remove the guarantee covering retail deposits in Northern Rock plc.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="100224m0001.htm_para16"><a name="10022461000043">Accordingly, HM Treasury has today given three months' notice that the Government's retail savings guarantee for Northern Rock plc will no longer apply from 5 pm on 24 May 2010. This excludes guarantee arrangements for fixed-term deposits in existing accounts, which will terminate on maturity on the relevant fixed term. For fixed-term products, renewed or extended after today's announcement, the guarantee arrangements in respect of that deposit, will terminate on the date of maturity existing prior to its renewal or extension. The guarantee for wholesale borrowings of Northern Rock plc, to the extent it relates to sums which are attributable to retail deposits made with Northern Rock (Guernsey) Limited, will be also lifted at the same time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="100224m0001.htm_para17"><a name="10022461000044">Following lifting of the guarantee, every Northern Rock retail customer will continue to have the first £50,000 of their total deposit protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, whether their deposit is fixed term, non-fixed term or a combination of both. This is the same level of protection that is provided for retail customers of all banks and building societies in the UK. Customers of Northern Rock (Guernsey) will continue to benefit from the Guernsey banking deposit compensation scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="100224m0001.htm_para18"><a name="10022461000045">The guarantee applying to Northern Rock's retail deposits was put in place as a temporary measure during a period of unprecedented instability in the financial markets. It was never intended to be permanent. Today's announcement affirms the strength of the new Northern Rock plc, and is a positive step in the bank's progression towards independence. Removal of the specific Northern Rock plc retail guarantee more closely aligns Northern Rock's retail depositor protection arrangements with those of all other UK banks, an important step in the normalisation of the UK retail banking market.</p>

 As outlined in schedule 7 to the Counter-terrorism Act 2008, the Treasury has undertaken to report to Parliament following the end of each calendar year in which a direction under the powers has been issued. This is the first of these reports, and covers the 2009 calendar year.</p>

 I am publishing today the Government's implementation plan in response to the Lamb inquiry on parental confidence in the special educational needs-SEN-system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="100224m0001.htm_para29"><a name="10022461000058">The inquiry, under the chairmanship of Brian Lamb, the chair of the Special Educational Consortium, was tasked with investigating a range of ways in which parental confidence in the SEN assessment process might be improved. The inquiry's final report was published on 16 December 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="100224m0001.htm_para30"><a name="10022461000059">The inquiry found that, while the SEN framework functions well for the majority of parents, within the same legislative framework there are parents who have been poorly served and have had to battle to get the needs of their child identified and met. This varied picture must be redrawn so that it is common practice to have access to skilled professionals who understand the needs of children and who have high expectations of what children can achieve.</p>

role of the SEN co-ordinator-SENCO-in schools. All SENCOs are required to be qualified teachers and those new to the role must undertake nationally accredited training and gain a national award. We are investing £10 million per annum to deliver this. We are also investing £12 million over 2008-11 to improve the skills and confidence of trainee and existing teachers, which includes new SEN and disability units in initial teacher training and the inclusion development programme for serving teachers. Our response to Sir Jim Rose's review into teaching children with dyslexia included funding course places for an additional 4,000 specialist dyslexia teachers. The implementation plan builds on this existing investment with up to £4 million for the Training and Development Agency for Schools, including for starting to deliver on the Lamb inquiry recommendation for advanced-level training around the five main SEN areas-learning difficulties; behavioural, emotional and social difficulties; dyslexia; autism spectrum disorders; and speech, language and communication needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="100224m0001.htm_para34"><a name="10022461000063">In addition to improved achievement for children with SEND, parents want to be assured that children are safe from bullying. The Government's pupil and parent guarantees make a commitment to all pupils and their parents, including those with SEND, that their schools will have effective policies in place to prevent and tackle all forms of bullying. We have started work with the Anti-Bullying Alliance to review the most effective approaches to anti-bullying.</p>

We want to build on this good practice through incorporating SEN and disability in the training that leaders of children's services receive. The plan also details the training for local authority SEN officers in how to work well with parents, which will start in March, and guidance and training for those drawing up statements of SEN will be issued this July.</p>

We will strengthen training on SEND for school governors, with improved legal resources available for all governors in December and the national training programme for new governors will reflect the conclusions of the inquiry. School improvement partners-SIP-play an increasingly important role in providing high-quality challenge and support to school leaders and, this summer, the national strategies will roll out SEND training to all local authority SIP managers.</p>

To provide additional support to households during the early stages of economic recovery, the 2009 pre-Budget report announced that the Government will bring forward a proportion of the increases expected in April 2011 a year earlier, thereby providing a 1.5 per cent. increase for those benefits normally uprated by RPI.</p>

 The Justice and Home Affairs Council is due to be held on 25 and 26 February 2010 in Brussels. My noble Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice, Lord Bach and I, intend to attend on behalf of the United Kingdom. As the provisional agenda stands, the following items will be discussed:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="100224m0002.htm_para0"><a name="10022461000232">The Council will begin by agreeing the text on the internal security strategy which was discussed at the January Informal Council in Toledo. The Government support the internal security strategy as currently drafted, in particular the reference to an EU organised crime strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="100224m0002.htm_para1"><a name="10022461000233">The presidency will then update Ministers on plans to establish the Standing Committee on operational co-operation on internal security-COSI-setting out its legal basis and outlining the next steps for the committee. The Government have supported the creation of COSI and look forward to its first meeting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="100224m0002.htm_para2"><a name="10022461000234">The Council will have an orientation debate on a proposal for a European pact against drug trafficking designed to co-ordinate member state activity in this  <br>

field. The pact focuses on three thematic areas; the "cocaine route" from Latin America via West Africa to Europe; the "heroin route" through Turkey and the Western Balkans; and money-laundering. The Government support this proposal which is in line with UK objectives on drug trafficking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="100224m0002.htm_para3"><a name="10022461000235">The presidency will update Ministers on EU-US relations following its high level meeting with US officials in January, which focused on data protection, child protection and terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="100224m0002.htm_para4"><a name="10022461000236">There will also be a discussion for Interior Ministers on what the next steps should be for the EU-US agreement on the processing and transfer of financial messaging data for the purposes of the terrorist tracking finance programme-the so-called SWIFT agreement-following the European Parliament's decision to reject the Council decision intended to conclude it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="100224m0002.htm_para5"><a name="10022461000237">After lunch, the presidency will update the Mixed Committee, with non-EU Schengen states, on the results of the evaluation of the first milestone test of the second-generation Schengen information system-SIS II -which took place at the end of January. The  Government support the need for a thorough evaluation of the first milestone test and will seek to ensure that the remaining milestone tests are conducted in a timely fashion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="100224m0002.htm_para6"><a name="10022461000238">The Council will then discuss the official Canadian response to the Commission's October 2009 report which criticised the Canadian Government for its decision to re-introduce visas for Czech nationals. The Government have maintained a neutral position so far and will continue to urge a proportionate solution to this issue, either resolved bilaterally or brokered by the Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="100224m0002.htm_para7"><a name="10022461000240">The presidency will present a draft instrument establishing a European agency for the management of operational co-operation at the external borders of the member states of the European Union-Frontex. The Government will consider the draft regulation carefully as soon as it is published.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="100224m0002.htm_para8"><a name="10022461000241">Finally, the Mixed Committee will discuss the ongoing issue of illegal migration on the southern border of the European Union. The Government recognise the significance of these flows and support strong, strategic and evidence-based EU collaboration on this issue through co-operation with countries of origin and transit, and practical action at, and beyond, the EU's borders, including a strong focus on returns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="100224m0002.htm_para9"><a name="10022461000242">On the second day of the Council meeting, there will be a state-of-play report on the negotiations that have been taking place about a proposed directive on the European protection order. Ministers will then be given the opportunity to comment. This is a member state initiative, presented by the Spanish presidency, and it is designed to assist victims who have obtained a protection order in one member state who subsequently move to another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="100224m0002.htm_para10"><a name="10022461000243">The presidency will then provide Justice Ministers with information about the state of play of the negotiations on the proposed directive on interpretation and translation. This proposal was negotiated as a framework decision under the Swedish presidency and reached political agreement at the October JFIA Council. However, it lapsed when the Lisbon treaty came into force, and so has had to be retabled as a directive under the new treaty. The Government support this proposal.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Minister for Europe and I wish to announce that following the treaty of Lisbon's entry into force on 1 December 2009, the Government intend that the extra seat in the European Parliament which is assigned to the UK under the treaty will be filled in accordance with the results at the June 2009 European Parliamentary elections. The treaty of Lisbon establishes an overall cap on the size of the European Parliament and an adjustment of the distribution of MEPs between 12 EU member states. The number of UK MEPs increases from 72 to 73.</p>

At EU level, unanimous agreement is needed for such a protocol, as it will mean a temporary increase in the number of MEPs allowed by the treaty. At UK level, a Bill will be required after the general election to ratify the treaty change in the UK. Legislation will also be required to provide for the seat to be filled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="100224m0003.htm_para4"><a name="10022461000249">Should the seat be awarded to a European Parliamentary electoral region of Great Britain, the results from that region at the 2009 election will be used to determine which party would have been awarded the next seat had an additional seat been available. The system used in Northern Ireland to elect its MEPs-the single transferable vote-is different from that used in Great Britain. If the extra seat is allocated to Northern Ireland therefore, the seat would go to the highest ranking candidate not to have reached the quota at the 2009 election following completion of the count.</p>

 The need for an additional human rights framework that reflects the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland was recognised in the Belfast agreement and given shape through the commitment to set up a Bill of Rights forum as part of the St. Andrews agreement.

After taking in to consideration the fact that the error was due to the Department and not Transport for London, that London had still only marginally missed the full payment threshold and as the priority of the fund is to identify and tackle the causes of congestion, it has been decided to retain London's original performance fund allocation of £3.9 million under tranche 2.
