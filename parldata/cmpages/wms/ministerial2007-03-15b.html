 The Secretary of State has today laid Regulations to control outdoor advertisements in England. A circular is being published to accompany the Regulations and a Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07031543000030">This coincides with the launch of a database on unlawful advertisements and fly-posting, which will help local planning authorities to take enforcement action against those who flout the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para1"><a name="07031543000031">The new Regulations update and improve the current arrangements for controlling outdoor advertisements and make the legislation more responsive to rapidly changing forms of advertising. The circular explains the legislation and provides guidance for local planning authorities and businesses to help ensure that the system operates effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07031543000032">Copies of the Regulations, the circular and the Regulatory Impact Assessment will be placed in the House Libraries or may be obtained via the Department for Communities and Local Government website at:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para4"><a name="07031543000034">The unlawful advertisements and fly-posting database is launched today. The database will enable enforcement officers within local planning authorities to input and extract details of prosecutions and formal cautions against companies and individuals who have unlawfully displayed advertisements alongside motorways and trunk roads. The database will also include this information about those guilty of fly-posting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para5"><a name="07031543000035">This service will help local planning authorities to build a case for prosecution within their own administrative areas. It will also help authorities have an idea of a company's history and assist them in tracking down persistent offenders. It could assist the courts when awarding costs and ensuring that the fine imposed reflects the seriousness of the offence and takes into account whether the person found guilty is a first time or persistent offender. This in turn should help to reduce the number of unlawful advertisements displayed alongside motorways and trunk roads and reduce the incidence of fly-posting.</p>

<p><a name="st_76"><a name="07031543000041"><a name="70315m0001.htm_spmin2"><a name="07031543000153"><b>The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (David Miliband):</b>
 I am pleased to announce that I am today laying before Parliament and publishing Government White Paper Command 7047, &#147;A Sea Change&#148;, a Marine Bill White Paper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para8"><a name="07031543000042">In 2001, the Prime Minister committed the UK Government to new measures to improve marine conservation, including a series of Marine Stewardship Reports. The first of these reports, &#147;Safeguarding Our Seas&#148;, jointly published a year later by the UK Government and devolved Administrations, set out the shared vision of clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse oceans and seas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para9"><a name="07031543000043">&#147;Safeguarding our Seas&#148; also described the Government's strategy for the conservation and sustainable development of the marine environment. Part of that strategy has been to examine how we can streamline regulation for those who make a living from the sea and how we can better protect the marine environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para10"><a name="07031543000044">The arrangements in place for managing marine activities and protecting marine wildlife and the marine environment are complex and can be confusing and costly for all involved. New activities, changes in technology and a deepening understanding of the seas around us and the way we affect them have also exposed some gaps and limitations in this system. A number of published reports and reviews have shown that as the pressures on our seas increase and change we do not have all the tools we need to fully protect our marine environment or manage the full range of demands that we place on the marine area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para11"><a name="07031543000045">In 2005, we completed an integrated assessment of the &#147;State of Our Seas - Charting Progress&#148;. The overall picture that emerged was that UK seas are productive and support a wide range of fish, mammals, seabirds and other marine life. The levels of monitored contaminants and pollution have decreased significantly. However, human activities have resulted in adverse changes to the marine ecosystem and continue to do so. These direct human activities, along with climate change, pose a real threat to the balance and integrity of the marine ecosystem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para12"><a name="07031543000046">This White Paper sets out our plans for legislation that will enable us to take a significant step forward in the way that we manage the activities that take place in the marine area. The changes we are proposing will mean we will be able to obtain best value from the many different uses of our valuable marine resources whilst maintaining and protecting the ecosystems upon which they depend. They will improve the delivery of policies relating to marine activities operating in coastal and offshore waters and to marine natural resource protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para13"><a name="07031543000047">The principles of sustainable development, good regulation and modern government underpin these proposals. We will simplify existing legislation and streamline administration. We will establish modern and flexible new arrangements and structures that will stand the test of time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para14"><a name="07031543000048">We will introduce a new system of marine planning encompassing all marine activities and providing a strategic approach to the use of marine space and the interactions between its uses. It will clarify our marine objectives and priorities for the future, and direct decision-makers and users towards more efficient, sustainable use and protection of our marine resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para15"><a name="07031543000049">We will establish a marine licensing system that is more efficient and transparent, simplifying marine licensing processes and providing for a rationalised and more integrated approach. This will deliver better, more consistent licensing decisions more quickly and at less cost to all, through a system that is proportionate and easier to understand and to use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para16"><a name="07031543000050">We will add to existing tools for the conservation of marine ecosystems and biodiversity with a new approach to protected areas for important species and habitats. This will enable us to tackle the deterioration in the state of the UK's marine biodiversity and promote recovery and ensure environmental considerations are at the heart of decision-making processes. They will allow the UK to fully deliver on its vital European and international conservation obligations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para17"><a name="07031543000051">We will modernise inshore fisheries management arrangements and enable a more active approach to managing recreational sea angling. We will also strengthen fisheries enforcement powers and provide for recovery of the costs of fishing vessel licence administration. This will strengthen fisheries and environmental management arrangements so that more effective action can be taken to conserve marine ecosystems and help achieve a sustainable and profitable fisheries sector. Our fisheries proposals will apply in England and in some cases Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para18"><a name="07031543000052">For the UK Government and Northern Ireland administration we will establish a new Marine Management Organisation to help effectively deliver many marine policies across UK waters. We will incorporate into this new organisation a number of existing Government agencies and functions. This will make a unique contribution to sustainable development by bringing together within a single independent body the delivery of strategic planning, streamlined marine licensing, fisheries management and enforcement, and nature conservation enforcement.</p>

They will provide an integrated approach to sustainable management, enhancement and use of the marine natural environment for the benefit of current and future generations. They will facilitate economic growth in the marine area in a sustainable manner and protect the environment providing us with a marine and coastal environment that can be enjoyed by all.</p>

 The Justice and Home Affairs Council was held on 15 February 2007 in Brussels. Baroness Scotland and I attended on behalf of the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para21"><a name="07031543000057">The German presidency opened the Council with adoption of the &#145;A&#146; points list which was approved apart from point 9, a mandate to open negotiations on the exchange of passenger name records. The items adopted included a regulation establishing an EU agency for fundamental rights, and a report on the extent of trafficking of human beings during the 2006 world cup in Germany and the measures taken by Germany to deal with this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para22"><a name="07031543000058">The presidency hosted an informal dinner for Ministers the evening before the Council, at which Ministers discussed how best to prepare the post-2009 JHA programme. The discussion built on the ideas put forward by the German presidency at the informal JHA Council in Dresden; notably, the idea of setting up an informal group of the next six presidencies and the Commission to co-ordinate this work. Member states generally welcomed the idea of preliminary work by such a group to assist in the thorough preparation of any future work programme, while recognising that this would be without prejudice to any formal discussions and decisions in the Council at the appropriate time. The UK secured agreement that the group should include a common law expert, that it  <br>

should adopt transparent working methods to allow contributions from those outside the group, and should report regularly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para23"><a name="07031543000059">One of the principal items considered by JHA Ministers last week was the exchange of policing information between member states in the context of incorporating the Pr√1/4m treaty into the EU legal order. This will facilitate the identification and subsequent exchange of information on fingerprints, vehicle registration and DNA. The Council mandated experts to prepare a Council decision for adoption in the coming months which will transfer the third pillar (police co-operation and data sharing) elements of that treaty into the EU, subject to deletion of a provision on measures in the event of immediate danger. I welcomed this approach and the importance of effective exchange of information more generally. I noted however that in taking forward this work further consideration needed to be given to the detail of the data protection regime and that sufficient time would be required for national Parliaments to scrutinise the proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para24"><a name="07031543000060">The Council also secured a general approach on a framework decision which will provide for the exchange of prisoners between member states so that custodial sentences can be served in the prisoner&#146;s home state, close to family and friends. Once finalised and implemented we believe that this will benefit both member states and our citizens in aiding the re-integration into societies of our prisoners. While participating in this general approach the UK maintained its parliamentary scrutiny reserve. Once adopted the Government expect this to reduce numbers of foreign prisoners in UK jails.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para25"><a name="07031543000061">On migration there was discussion on a common approach to partnership agreements with countries of origin and transit. It was suggested that these agreements should include information on legal migration channels, national quotas, circular migration and capacity building, in exchange for readmission, safeguarding human rights and a commitment to manage migration. There was general agreement from member states on this approach although a majority were against the inclusion of quotas. The UK stressed the need for a flexible approach, highlighting a points- based system as an alternative to quotas. The Council noted that the first of the Commission&#146;s proposals on legal migration would be expected in May.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para26"><a name="07031543000062">There was a lunchtime discussion on the framework decision on racism and xenophobia. It is clear that there is a commitment to reaching agreement on this measure and member states supported the text as a basis for further work. However, the UK, along with a number of other members states, could not accept article 8(2) on mutual legal assistance, which we argued had been superseded by the European evidence warrant. One member state argued for the retention of this article. The presidency indicated that it would seek agreement to the text at the April JHA Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para27"><a name="07031543000063">In the Mixed Committee the Council took note that the SISOne4all project was running on time. The global rescheduling of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) was also noted. The focus on SISOne4all has meant that there will be a six-month delay to the SIS II programme; the SIS II operational date for those member states already connected to the SIS 1+ will be mid-December 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para29"><a name="07031543000065">The increasing numbers of Moldovan applications for Romanian nationality was discussed under AOB, the Commission asking member states to participate in the common consular centre initiatives.

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="70315m0001.htm_para30"><a name="07031543000066">Finally, as another AOB item, the Commission presented their proposal for a directive setting criminal sanctions for environmental crimes.
