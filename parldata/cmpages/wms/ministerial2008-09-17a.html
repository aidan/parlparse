 I can confirm to the House that the Government will shortly commence the early recruitment and appointment of a chair and chief executive of the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC), before Royal Assent of the Planning Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="80917m0001.htm_para0"><a name="0809173000016">The IPC will act as the decision-maker for the majority of major infrastructure consents, acting within a national policy framework set by Government. Early appointments will give infrastructure developers the confidence to work on applications for development consent under the new regime, with the knowledge that the IPC will be operational and able to provide advice by the time the first national policy statements are designated, anticipated to be towards the end of 2009.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government is publishing on 30 September the final revision of the &#147;Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS) for the North-West of England&#148;. This is a slight amendment to the late August or early September date which my 17 July statement suggested, <i>Official Report</i>, column 42WS. The reports of a consolidated &#147;Sustainability Appraisal, a Habitats Regulations Assessment and Sustainability&#148; statement will also be published alongside the RSS on 30 September.</p>

A draft revision of the &#147;Regional Spatial Strategy&#148; was submitted to Government in January 2006 by the North-West Regional Assembly. It was subsequently tested in an examination in public between November 2006 and February 2007, and the report of the independent panel which conducted this examination was published in May 2007.

of State considered the recommendations of this independent panel, and took into account the representations made on the draft revision, and also changes in Government policy since the draft revision was submitted, before publishing proposed changes for further public consultation between March and May 2008.</p>

Prior to their deployment, and on completion of their mobilisation procedures, the reservists will undertake a period of training and integration with their respective units. For the majority, their deployment to theatre will commence in November and most will serve on operations for six to seven months, although some may have shorter tours. The reservists will predominantly reinforce regular units and will perform a wide range of activities including force protection duties, intelligence and logistic tasks. As part of this commitment, we expect up to 10 members of the sponsored reserves to be in the operational theatre at any one time.</p>

<a name="subhd_9"><a name="80917m0001.htm_sbhd5"><a name="0809173000013"><h4 align="center">Suicide Act</h4>

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="0809173000073"><a name="80917m0001.htm_spmin5"><a name="0809173000090"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Maria Eagle):</b>
 There has been growing concern in recent years about whether current law is adequate to deal with misuse of the internet to promote suicide and suicide methods. The Government share the concerns that have been expressed about such misuse, in particular about suicide websites and the influence they may have over vulnerable people, especially young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="80917m0001.htm_para9"><a name="0809173000074">In response to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) on 11 March 2008, my right hon. Friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice said that we were looking at this issue and would make an announcement as soon as possible, <i>Official Report</i>, column 141. The Government subsequently accepted in full the recommendations of the Byron review including that consideration should be given to whether the law in this area could usefully be clarified. This statement sets out our conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="80917m0001.htm_para10"><a name="0809173000075">The law of suicide comprises two offences. The first is the offence under section 2 of the Suicide Act 1961 of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring a suicide or a suicide attempt; and the second is an offence under section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 of attempting to aid, abet, counsel or procure a suicide or a suicide attempt. Actions to assist or attempt to assist suicide can be carried out on or offline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="80917m0001.htm_para11"><a name="0809173000076">The complexity of the law in this area stems from the unusual nature of the offence in section 2 of the Suicide Act which provides accessory liability in respect of something that is not of itself criminal. We believe that the law as it stands is capable of catching the sort of material that is causing concern and, more generally, the encouragement of suicide through the medium of the internet. But in practice the application of the law, particularly in terms of what constitutes an attempt to commit the section 2 offence is complicated. It is difficult both to understand and to explain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="80917m0001.htm_para12"><a name="0809173000077">Accordingly, we have concluded that the scope of the current law should not be extended but that the existing statutory language of section 2 of the Suicide Act should be simplified and modernised in a way that will make it clearer for everyone to understand. Simplifying and modernising the language of the law should provide reassurance that the law is capable of reflecting the new ways of communicating and accessing information. This approach also builds on a recommendation from the Law Commission that there is a strong case for updating the language of section 2.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="80917m0001.htm_para13"><a name="0809173000078">We therefore intend to legislate to update the Suicide Act as soon as parliamentary time allows. And with the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins), Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office and the Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety in the Northern  Ireland Executive (Michael McGimpsey), the legislation will also include Northern Ireland. The updated legislation will comply, as does the existing law, with the requirements of the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002.</p>
