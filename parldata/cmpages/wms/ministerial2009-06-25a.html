 I should like to inform the House that, in the light of our review of national procurement in the fire and rescue service (FRS) in England, we propose to make a number of changes affecting Firebuy Ltd, the professional buying organisation for the service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="90625m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09062550000026">Firebuy Ltd was established as a non-departmental public body on 30 March 2006 to deliver the 2005-08 national procurement strategy for the FRS. Within the current arrangements, Firebuy has been effective in establishing national fire-specific procurement for vehicles and equipment and has delivered benefits for the service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="90625m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09062550000027">There is a continuing need to drive procurement efficiency at a national level in the FRS, particularly in the light of targets for collaborative procurement set by the Government&#146;s operational efficiency programme and we believe that a national procurement body represents the best way to deliver fire-specific collaborative procurement. This will be reflected in the revised national procurement strategy, which we intend to publish in July, taking account of responses to the consultation last year and the recommendations of the operational efficiency programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="90625m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09062550000028">However, going forward there is a need to consider the future role and structure of the body delivering  FRS national procurement, particularly given that the Department must also make longer term provision for managing ongoing FiReControl and Firelink contracts. We propose, therefore, that Firebuy&#146;s functions should in future be carried out within a larger organisation, integrating national procurement with the management of the service contracts for the Fire And Resilience programme (Firelink, FiReControl and New Dimension). Firebuy already performs this function in respect of New Dimension. More detailed proposals for in-service management of the Fire and Resilience programme will be set out in a consultation paper, which we will publish shortly.</p>

 I am today laying before the House the first annual update to the National Security Strategy of the United Kingdom Security for the Next Generation (cm 7590), and the Government&#146;s first Cyber Security Strategy, Safety, Security and Resilience in Cyber Space (cm 7642).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="90625m0002.htm_para0"><a name="09062550000062">The purpose of the national security strategy, published for the first time in March last year, is to bring together in a single strategic framework the Government&#146;s analysis of, and response to, the full range of national security risks&#151;recognising that today more than ever these risks, and the underlying drivers, are increasingly interconnected and require a more co-ordinated approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="90625m0002.htm_para1"><a name="09062550000063">The 2009 update fulfils the Government&#146;s commitment to report on activity and progress over the past year, from counter-terrorism, to military and civilian support to Afghanistan, to peacekeeping and conflict resolution in a range of countries, and to combating H1N1 influenza.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="90625m0002.htm_para2"><a name="09062550000064">The report also updates our assessment of the security challenges facing the United Kingdom, including a detailed analysis of the implications of the current global economic downturn, which has shown&#151;and this view is shared by our key partners and by external experts&#151;that so far the nature of the security landscape has not altered fundamentally, although we will need to remain vigilant, especially against the dangers of instability in already poor regions, or any trend towards protectionism. The events of the past year have also reinforced the importance of a strongly internationalist approach, and the strategy update sets out detailed and ambitious plans for strengthening the international response to  <br>

the long-term global security risks arising from climate change, poverty, and energy shortages, building on the concerted global action to stabilise the world economy over the past year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="90625m0002.htm_para3"><a name="09062550000065">The report covers the different &#145;domains&#146; in which security challenges must be addressed, and identifies cyber space as one increasingly important domain in which individual, commercial and state security can be threatened, whether by other states, or terrorist or criminal networks. We are therefore publishing, alongside the overall strategy update, the UK&#146;s first national cyber security strategy, outlining improvements to Government structures, additional funding, measures to enhance our ability to detect attack, better risk assessments, programmes to develop cyber security industrial capabilities and workforce skills, and support and advice for individual citizens.</p>

It takes advice from the expert national security forum. Parliamentary scrutiny is provided by the Joint Committee on the national security strategy, which will start work this summer. The strategy is a comprehensive and transparent account of the risks the UK faces and the action we are taking to tackle them, and provides a basis for Parliamentary and wider public debate on our national security priorities.</p>

<a name="90625m0002.htm_brev0"><a name="09062550000090"><ul><p class="tabletext">I am today announcing that the UK Government are in the course of concluding their negotiations with SNCF and SNCB to incorporate the existing tri-national Eurostar operations into a single company. The UK Government, via London and Continental Railways Ltd, will have a substantial minority shareholding in the new Eurostar company. Subject to further work and final agreement, this shareholding will be in the order of 40 per cent.</p>
</ul><a name="90625m0002.htm_brev1"><a name="09062550000091"><ul><p class="tabletext">Eurostar is the pre-eminent international passenger train operator. This is recognised by the record 9 million passengers that used the service to travel between London and the continent last year, following the opening of the High Speed 1 line from  St Pancras International station. Eurostar is not only very successful service, but has also saved around 40,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions as a result of attracting extra travellers who would otherwise have travelled by plane since the move to High Speed 1.</p>
</ul><a name="90625m0002.htm_brev2"><a name="09062550000092"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Government&#146;s aim, as shareholders, have always been to provide Eurostar with the stability and sustainability to develop its services on a properly stand-alone commercial basis, operating in a newly competitive market.</p>
</ul><a name="90625m0002.htm_brev3"><a name="09062550000093"><ul><p class="tabletext">The proposals under finalisation with SNCF and SNCB are designed to achieve those objectives.</p>
</ul><a name="90625m0002.htm_brev4"><a name="09062550000094"><ul><p class="tabletext">The principal part of the discussions to be concluded is to convert the present Eurostar operation, which is an unincorporated joint venture operating cooperatively but separately in the three partner countries, into a single incorporated company. As such the UK will contribute to the new venture the assets and interests of Eurostar (UK) Ltd, which is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of London and Continental Railways Ltd.</p>
</ul><a name="90625m0002.htm_brev5"><a name="09062550000095"><ul><p class="tabletext">The company will have a strong board with an independent chairman and independent non-executive representation, as well as UK and other partner shareholder representatives. There will be proper shareholder rights and protections for the UK as a minority shareholder.</p>
</ul><a name="90625m0002.htm_brev6"><a name="09062550000096"><ul><p class="tabletext">The final terms remain subject to further work being undertaken by the Eurostar management and final commercial agreement between the parties and a confirmation that SNCB will join the new venture. I would expect to make a further announcement on these matters later this year.</p>
