 The House will recall that on 29 April 2008, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced the deployment of the 2nd Battalion, The Rifles (2 Rifles) to Kosovo during June as part of our existing commitment to the NATO/EU-shared pan-Balkans Operational Reserve Force (ORF).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="80701m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08070188000029">During this period the security situation in Kosovo has remained calm. There were no significant incidents of inter-ethnic unrest and a number of key political dates passed peacefully. In particular, the implementation of a new constitution represented an historic moment in Kosovo&#146;s progress towards establishing itself as a stable, democratic and multi-ethnic state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="80701m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08070188000030">Against this background, NATO has now assessed that its Kosovo force has the capability to maintain a safe and secure environment without further recourse to the ORF. As a result, I am pleased to announce that 2 Rifles completed its mission on 30 June 2008 and is in the process of returning to UK. The UK will, however, remain committed to the NATO/EU pan-Balkans ORF until the end of this year, at a lower readiness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="80701m0001.htm_para7"><a name="08070188000031">The deployment of the UK ORF Battalion confirmed yet again the professionalism of our armed forces and demonstrated our commitment to the security of Kosovo during a politically sensitive period.</p>

 I am pleased to inform the House that the Department is releasing the final report of the mild Traumatic Brain Injury Project Team established by the Surgeon General in June 2007. A copy will also be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="80701m0001.htm_para8"><a name="08070188000033">I previously informed the House of the conclusions of the project team in my written ministerial statement on 15 January 2008 (<i>Official Report</i>, columns 23-24WS). Release of the final report provides further rationale and explanation of the key conclusions that:</p>

</ul><a name="80701m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="08070188000035"><ul><p class="tabletext">The majority of cases of mTBI become symptom-free within two to three weeks and 80 per cent. are symptom-free within three months.</p>
</ul><a name="80701m0001.htm_brev5"><a name="08070188000036"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) has identified 585 cases of casualties between February 2003 and November 2007 with Traumatic Brain Injury (whether mild, moderate or severe) out of some 36,000 referrals to deployed UK operational emergency departments. This represents 1.6 per cent. of all medical presentations during the period, and 0.5 per cent. of the deployed UK military population.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="80701m0001.htm_para9"><a name="08070188000037">The report also provides further detail of the actions we have already taken to address mBTI, including  the roll-out of a diagnostic and surveillance tool to  deployed theatres, and the establishment of a treatment protocol covering information for deployed service personnel, telephone-based support for patients, and outpatient and inpatient treatment at the Defence Medical   <br>

They provide a sense of perspective, explaining that mTBI is almost certainly not a new phenomenon, and that it is impossible to draw clear distinctions between organic and psychological effects in the case of brain injury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="80701m0001.htm_para13"><a name="08070188000041">As I explained in my previous statement, research continues both here and in the US.
