 Guidance on how the Data Protection Act 1998 applies to the use of biometric data in schools is published today by the British Education Communications and Technology Agency (BECTA).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="70723m0001.htm_para1"><a name="0707239000027">Biometric data are increasingly being used in schools as the benefit for schools of running cashless lunch queues, and improved school libraries and attendance systems, become clear. This guidance advises schools to fully involve parents in any decision to introduce this new technology. It restates school&#146;s freedom to run themselves for the benefit of young people&#151;including introducing new technology to make day-to-day administrative tasks easier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="70723m0001.htm_para2"><a name="0707239000028">The guidance also underlines that headteachers and governing bodies should be clear and open with all parents and pupils about this and all aspects of their education. This will involve explaining what biometric technology is, how it will be used, what is involved, what data will be held and stored, why it is required, how it will be secured, and for how long it will be retained. It also advises that schools should recognise some parents&#146; or pupils&#146; concerns over the introduction of biometric technology and offer alternative systems, like smartcards, to access the same services if they want to opt out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="70723m0001.htm_para3"><a name="0707239000029">Today&#146;s guidance sets out how Data Protection Act 1998 applies to the use of biometric data in schools&#151;building on BECTA&#146;s existing guidance on data security and the data protection law.</p>

We give schools complete freedom to run their own affairs and I back every head teacher&#146;s right and professional judgment to choose technology to improve their day-to-day running&#151;but it is plain common sense for them to talk to parents about this and all issues relating to their pupils to demystify how schools operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="70723m0001.htm_para6"><a name="0707239000038">I have seen at first hand how well these systems work. They can speed up lunch queues, remove the need for children to carry money and take away the stigma of singling out those on free school meals. Moreover, they can enable schools to register pupils more easily as they move from class to class.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="70723m0001.htm_para7"><a name="0707239000039">Schools are well used to handling sensitive information like attendance registers, behaviour records and home addresses.

This means that this data can only be used for its explicitly stated purpose, cannot be shared with third parties beyond its stated purpose: and it must be destroyed when the pupil leaves the school.</p>

It also forms the basis for meeting periodic reporting requirements at EU level. Some changes have been made to improve the contents and layout of this publication; in particular a more concise report with just the key tables is available in hard copy and supplementary information with additional tables is available on the Home Office website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="70723m0001.htm_para22"><a name="0707239000064">The report shows an overall increase over the previous year of 4 per cent. in the number of procedures undertaken. The total number of procedures was 3.01 million, an increase of 115,800 over the previous year. There has now been a relatively small increase for the fifth year running and is the highest total since 1992 and marks an overall 15 per cent. increase since 2001. A number of factors, investment in research and development and strategic priorities determine the overall level of scientific procedures</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="70723m0001.htm_para23"><a name="0707239000065">Non-toxicological procedures accounted for about 86 per cent. of the procedures carried out.

About 74 per cent. of these were for testing the safety and efficacy of new drugs and medicines. In keeping with previous years, those procedures that used mice or rats (or other rodents) were the great majority at 83 per cent. Those using fish amounted to 9 per cent. and those using birds, 4 per cent. The total of all procedures using dogs, cats, horses and non-human primates, that is; those species offered special protection by the Act, was less than 1 per cent. of the total.</p>

Genetically modified animals (nearly all rodents) were used in 1.04 million regulated procedures representing, 34 per cent. of all procedures for 2006 (compared with 33 per cent. in 2005 and 8 per cent. in 1995).</p>

It allows a more precise and often less invasive study of physiological processes and disease mechanisms than was previously possible. Most of the animals concerned are mice, which appear and live as normal. Many are only used in breeding programmes.</p>

These recommendations will be taken forward as part of the Government&#146;s overall programme to support independent living for disabled people. In the meantime the funds will continue in their present form.</p>

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="0707239000083"><a name="70723m0002.htm_spmin0"><a name="0707239000110"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Mr. James Plaskitt):</b>
 People claiming incapacity benefit are entitled to receive national insurance credits for periods when they are unable to work. Such credits count towards accrued entitlement to state pension, incapacity benefit and other contributory benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="70723m0002.htm_para0"><a name="0707239000085">Details of such credits are held on HMRC&#146;s National Insurance Recording System (NIRS2) and this Department&#146;s Pension Strategy Computer System (PSCS) which records details of periods of incapacity for people claiming incapacity benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="70723m0002.htm_para1"><a name="0707239000087">It has become clear that discrepancies exist between the data held on these two systems&#151;as was noted in the National Audit Office&#146;s report on the National Insurance Fund in February 2006. These discrepancies have their origin in the introduction of NIRS2 in 1998 and the subsequent transfer of data from PSCS to NIRS2 on periods of incapacity. These discrepancies mean that some people may be receiving the wrong amount of contributory benefit. The main benefits affected are state pension and incapacity benefit. The cases most likely to be affected are those where an individual made a claim for incapacity benefit between 1998 and 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="70723m0002.htm_para2"><a name="0707239000089">Action has been taken to ensure that these credits are now being correctly recorded and, accordingly, I am now in a position to announce how this Department intends to handle those past cases where errors have occurred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="70723m0002.htm_para3"><a name="0707239000091">We estimate that up to 30,000 people may have had underpayments of benefit and about 90,000 have had overpayments. In cases of underpayment, the error does not necessarily mean that individuals have been receiving less money through benefits. For example, in the majority of the cases involving state pension, the underpayments will have been made up by additional pension credit payments. In the case of incapacity benefit underpayments some individuals will have received income support which will have reduced or extinguished any potential loss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="70723m0002.htm_para4"><a name="0707239000093">It is, nevertheless, clearly right that all such underpayments should be identified and the correct amount of contributory benefit paid, and any associated income related benefit reviewed. This Department will begin this work in August and aims to have completed it by early 2008. In all cases this Department will individually contact those affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="70723m0002.htm_para5"><a name="0707239000095">Similarly, in the case of overpayments, many of those overpaid state pension would have had a correspondingly lower payment of pension credit. In respect of incapacity benefit this would, in some cases, have led to a correspondingly lower payment, or no payment, of income support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="70723m0002.htm_para6"><a name="0707239000097">In respect of cases where an overpayment may have occurred, the payments will have been made and received in good faith and I do not believe it would be right to reduce them. I propose, therefore, to introduce regulations that will allow us to continue paying these benefits at their current level to the individuals concerned for the duration of their claim. The draft regulations will be referred to the Social Security Advisory Committee in the normal way before being made and laid before Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="70723m0002.htm_para7"><a name="0707239000099">Where the individual is under pension age we will also correct the national insurance contribution records so that future claims will be correctly assessed. Where correcting the record creates any gaps in an individual&#146;s contribution record, HMRC will write to the individuals concerned advising them of their options, if they wish to pay any missing contributions.</p>
