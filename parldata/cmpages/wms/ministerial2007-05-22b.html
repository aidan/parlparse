 I am today laying before Parliament, the annual European Community Finances White Paper &#147;Statement on  the 2007 EC Budget and measures to combat fraud and financial mismanagement&#148; (Cm 7090). This White Paper is the 27th in the series. It gives details of revenue and expenditure in the 2007 EC Budget and covers recent developments in EC financial management and measures to counter fraud against the EC Budget. It also includes information on the upcoming review of the EC Budget and recent measures taken to improve the management and control of the EC Budget, including the initiative the Government announced in November 2006.</p>

 The tax credit system has delivered three key achievements: it has improved incentives to work, reduced the tax burden on low to middle income families and helped to dramatically reduce child poverty. The National Statistics published on 22 May show that the total number of families benefiting from tax credits rose to 5.94 million in 2005-06. These statistics contain a wide range of other information about tax credits, and show that:</p>
<a name="70522m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="07052291000028"><ul><p class="tabletext">339,000 families benefited from the childcare element of Working Tax Credit (an 11 per cent. increase in the number benefiting in 2004-05).</p>
</ul><a name="70522m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="07052291000029"><ul><p class="tabletext">89,000 families benefited from the disabled worker element (a 13 per cent. increase compared to 2004-05).</p>
</ul><a name="70522m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="07052291000030"><ul><p class="tabletext">As a proportion of gross spending, end year adjustments leading to an overpayment have halved since the introduction of new tax credits to just ten per cent.</p>
</ul><a name="70522m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="07052291000031"><ul><p class="tabletext">In line with expectations, end of year adjustments leading to an overpayment have fallen by a further &#163;100 million since 2004-05, building on the significant progress made between 2003-04 and 2004-05 when overpayments fell by a fifth.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="70522m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07052291000032">Tax credits today provide support to 20 million people including 6 million families and 10 million children. Take-up of tax credits is a significant success. In 2004-05 take-up of the Child Tax Credit rose from 79 per cent. to 82 per cent., with over 90 per cent of the money available being claimed. Take-up among those on incomes below &#163;10,000 is 97 per cent; and take-up among lone parents is 93 per cent. This is higher than for any previous system of income-related financial support for in-work families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="70522m0001.htm_para1"><a name="07052291000033">Tax credits play a major role in moving people into work and helping people move up the employment  <br>

ladder, ensuring that work pays over welfare. Tax credits and economic stability have helped to increase the number of people in work by over 2.5 million since spring 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="70522m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07052291000034">As a result of the Government's reforms to the tax and benefit system since 1997, from April 2007, in real terms:</p>
<a name="70522m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="07052291000035"><ul><p class="tabletext">families with children are, on average, &#163;1,550 a year better off, while those in the poorest fifth will be, on average, &#163;3,450 per year better off; and</p>
</ul><a name="70522m0001.htm_brev5"><a name="07052291000036"><ul><p class="tabletext">a single-earner family on half average male earnings with two children is &#163;3,900 a year better off.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="70522m0001.htm_para3"><a name="07052291000037">The tax credit system has also played a key role in tackling child poverty. Since 1998-99, 600,000 children have been lifted out of relative poverty, compared to a doubling of child poverty in the previous 20 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="70522m0001.htm_para4"><a name="07052291000038">Tax credits are designed to tailor support to families' specific circumstances, and to respond to their changing needs. Household incomes and circumstances that can, of course, change during the course of the year. Payments are therefore subject to adjustment during the course of the year and, if necessary, at the end of the year once these changes are known. The only way to avoid these end-year adjustments would be to have a system where payments were fixed, based on past information. This would mean that families could not benefit from this flexibility to give extra support when they need it most. Statistics published today show that between 2004-05 and 2005-06 720,000 families experienced a fall in their income, and benefited from extra support through tax credits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="70522m0001.htm_para5"><a name="07052291000039">Building on the significant progress made in 2004-05 when overpayments fell by a fifth, National Statistics show that end-year adjustments leading to an overpayment fell by a further &#163;100 million in 2005-06. The figures for end-year adjustments do not show the impact of measures announced at the time of the 2005 Pre-Budget Report. Once these come fully into effect the level of end-year adjustments are expected to fall by a further third in future years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="70522m0001.htm_para6"><a name="07052291000040">HMRC is making good progress in implementing this package of measures, and this is already making a significant improvement to the way in which the tax credit system operates and to the outcomes for families:</p>
<a name="70522m0001.htm_brev6"><a name="07052291000041"><ul><p class="tabletext">the amount by which ongoing tax credit payments can be reduced in order to recover an in-year overpayment has been restricted. This gives greater certainty of award for claimants, and reduces the effect of reported changes on continuing payments.</p>
</ul><a name="70522m0001.htm_brev7"><a name="07052291000042"><ul><p class="tabletext">the income disregard has been successfully increased to &#163;25,000. This has ensured that almost all families with increasing incomes will not have their tax credit entitlement reduced in the first year of the increase, further boosting work incentives and reducing overpayments. Analysis based on data from the first two years of the system's operation indicates that about 600,000 families per year will benefit from the increase in the disregard, and two-thirds of those beneficiaries will be in the bottom 30 per cent of the income distribution.</p>
</ul><a name="70522m0001.htm_brev8"><a name="07052291000043"><ul><p class="tabletext">the renewal period has been successfully reduced to five months. As a result, 1.4 million more claimants had their 2005-06 awards finalised and were off provisional payments by 31 August 2006 than by this point in the previous year. As a result of this success, in the 2006 Pre-Budget Report the Government announced that in 2007 the renewal period will be further shortened to four months. This will further reduce the time over which claimants are paid on the basis of information rolled forward from the previous tax year, which is often out of date.</p>
</ul><br>

<notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2007 : Column 67WS</b><br>
<a name="70522m0001.htm_brev9"><a name="07052291000044"><ul><p class="tabletext">new reporting arrangements have been introduced to increase the number of changes in circumstances that are reported to HMRC and reduce the time taken to report these changes. This has shortened the time when people are potentially paid too much (or too little), and was supported by an advertising campaign &#147;when life changes&#148;. HMRC have also sent a mailshot to claimants to remind them of the new reporting requirements and initial feedback suggests that tax credit claimants are aware of the need to report changes of circumstances promptly to HMRC.</p>
</ul><a name="70522m0001.htm_brev10"><a name="07052291000045"><ul><p class="tabletext">HMRC has started to adjust future payments when an estimate of lower current year income is reported but not make a one-off payment for the earlier part of the year. When the award is finalised after the year end, any necessary adjustments to payments will be made. This will tackle the problems associated with families overestimating falls in income.</p>
</ul><a name="70522m0001.htm_brev11"><a name="07052291000046"><ul><p class="tabletext">ahead of the renewals exercise, earlier this year HMRC also wrote to around 2 million low-income claimants to encourage them to provide an up-to-date estimate of income so that their provisional payments for 2007-08 can be more accurately set.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="70522m0001.htm_para7"><a name="07052291000047">In addition to these measures, Budget 2007 announced a four-week run-on in entitlement to Working Tax Credit from the day a claimant ceases to work over 16 hours. This will reduce the number and value of overpayments occurring when people are late in reporting that they are no longer entitled to Working Tax Credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="70522m0001.htm_para8"><a name="07052291000048">Accuracy in processing and calculating awards rose from 78.6 per cent. in 2003-04 to 97.7 per cent. in 2005-06. This improved performance of the tax credits system has meant that fewer overpayments are being caused by IT or administrative error.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="70522m0001.htm_para9"><a name="07052291000049">The service received by tax credit customers has also been improved. Award notices and guidance have been improved and the "reasonable belief&#148; test HMRC uses to decide whether to write off an overpayment has been clarified. HMRC has also improved its processes for dealing with disputed overpayments, and claimants can now expect disputed overpayments to be dealt with within four weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="70522m0001.htm_para10"><a name="07052291000050">Since the introduction of tax credits HMRC has had processes in place to deal with hardship and where appropriate can provide additional payments or collect money owed over a longer time or, in exceptional circumstances, write-off an overpayment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="70522m0001.htm_para11"><a name="07052291000051">End-year adjustments would be a feature of any flexible system that could respond across the year to families' circumstances as they change. Eliminating the need for adjustments would require a move to a fixed and less responsive system.</p>

 I am announcing today, subject to trades union consultation and appropriate Parliamentary consent, the creation of a new defence support group by merging together ABRO, retained DARA business units and certain other defence support facilities. This new group, operating as a trading fund, will begin formal trading by April 2008 and will focus solely on the delivery of the Defence Industrial and Technology Strategies by being a flexible, responsive, operationally excellent organisation  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="70522m0001.htm_para12"><a name="07052291000053">DARA is undergoing a major transformation programme: the Fast Jet and Engines businesses closed in March 2007; the Rotary Wing and Components businesses are currently going through a sale process; and we have already announced the retention of the electronics business at Sealand. The VC10 business unit at St Athan has also been subject to a market testing exercise. However, as it is now apparent that sale is unlikely to offer best value for defence, the sale of the VC10 business unit will not now proceed. By retaining ownership, MOD will better manage the interface between the VC10 business and the Defence Training Review, both of which are based at St Athan in South Wales. A decision will be taken shortly on whether the best value for defence can be secured by transferring; the Rotary and Components businesses outside the MOD. If not, these business units will also form part of the new defence support organisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="70522m0001.htm_para13"><a name="07052291000054">Commitment from the MOD to sustain essential levels of capability and capacity will provide the new defence support group with greater clarity and allow it to implement a programme of continuous improvement. At the same time, the new organisation will look to consolidate and build on ABRO's and DARA's existing defence industry relationships and partnerships, by entering into agreements on future equipment programmes. These will ensure MOD retains the Intellectual Property and design skills required to maintain operational sovereignty in key areas as set out in the Defence Industrial and Technology Strategies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="70522m0001.htm_para14"><a name="07052291000055">This announcement draws both organisations more closely into delivering key MOD strategies and supporting the Armed Forces.

practical benefits to the Police Service have become clear to see. Impact Nominal Index (INI) continues to prove itself to be an invaluable tool in the Police's armoury against those who would seek to do harm to the vulnerable, for example, with over 140,000 searches conducted on the system by the end of March and decisions in some 670 child protection cases referred to the police being changed as a result. But there is still some way to go to realise the ultimate goals of the Programme. After a review of options in consultation with the main stakeholders, we have decided not to deploy the CRISP application as an interim solution. Our primary focus and efforts are now delivery of the new Police National Database, which will meet our pledge of a national police intelligence sharing capability. This work is now being led and managed by the Police Service itself, through the new National Policing Improvement Agency with its clear focus on policing needs, and is forming the central strand of its comprehensive and practical strategy for matching information systems and technology to policing priorities. The Agency is also overseeing the ongoing implementation by Police Forces of the statutory Code of Practice on police information management, which came into force in 2005. This, together with the accompanying operational guidance, will ensure improved national standards are properly embedded in day to day policing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="70522m0002.htm_para1"><a name="07052291000078">The other major focus of our work has been the implementation of the new Vetting and Barring Scheme, which will cover those seeking to work with children and replace the existing arrangements. Following Royal Assent for the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, under which the Scheme is established, work has been stepped up to deliver what represents a world-leading and highly innovative system for controlling access to children and vulnerable adults.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="70522m0002.htm_para2"><a name="07052291000079">Cabinet colleagues at DfES and DH continue to work closely on this important initiative and we look forward to the launch of the Independent Barring Board in 2008, which will work alongside the Criminal Records Bureau and lead the discretionary decision-making process for the more difficult cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="70522m0002.htm_para3"><a name="07052291000080">Elsewhere, progress is being made although in some areas technical issues have meant that timetables have had to be revised. The Home Secretary reported last May that we hoped to have achieved direct updating of Courts' resulting to the Police National Computer by the end of 2008. Whilst my determination&#151;and that of Ministerial colleagues at the Ministry of Justice&#151;to achieve this remains undiminished, it has been necessary to drive forward this complex change in step with the wider IT-enabled reforms to the criminal justice system the Ministry of Justice is delivering and so we plan to achieve delivery of Recommendation 7 by the end of the 2008-09 financial year. In the meantime, Police Forces' performance in updating PNC under the current arrangements remains a broadly sound and improving picture, under the close scrutiny of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="70522m0002.htm_para4"><a name="07052291000081">We continue to see increasing take-up of the voluntary training for head teachers and school governors, which focuses on the critical importance of being aware of safeguarding issues when recruiting  <br>

staff. And we have now developed and rolled out new initiatives to extend the training more widely, in schools and other local authority sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="70522m0002.htm_para5"><a name="07052291000082">While we continue to make progress in implementing the Recommendations, it is important to note this work is about more than simply delivering new frameworks and arrangements, such as best practice guidance. We are seeking to address cultural or organisational obstacles through IT-enabled business change, such as new information sharing capabilities. We have already achieved real improvements but must be ever vigilant about the risks to the vulnerable members of society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="70522m0002.htm_para6"><a name="07052291000083">Furthermore, we must join up systems effectively between the various jurisdictions within the UK and internationally. The difficulties around the notifications of UK citizens convicted in Europe, which came to light earlier this year and which we have been addressing, were a strong reminder that we must be constantly vigilant to ensure systems, both local and national/ international, are all working as they should. Within government and in the key agencies delivering public services, work to safeguard the vulnerable members of the community must be a core priority.</p>

 Further to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary's statement to Parliament on 16 January, I would like to provide an update to the House on the work that has been undertaken to deal with the issue of overseas convictions of UK citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="70522m0002.htm_para8"><a name="07070516000001">Members will recall that, during a Home Affairs Select Committee meeting on 9 January, it came to light that there was a backlog of files containing information about such convictions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="70522m0002.htm_para9"><a name="07052291000087">It was clear that that the existing systems were inadequate and the Home Secretary asked Sir David Normington to initiate an immediate inquiry to find out how the backlog arose and why it was not dealt with sooner. The inquiry was undertaken by Dusty Amroliwala and reported on 2 March. Sir David has acknowledged that there are lessons to be learned from the report in a number of key areas including working practices, risk management and leadership. The Home Office already has a comprehensive programme of reform in place and these lessons are being incorporated in that reform agenda.</p>

I am pleased to be able to report that it was fully processed onto the Police National Computer (PNC) before the end of April. Copies of a report on the process and outcome have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses today.</p>

This is not helped by the differences in systems, procedures and criteria for recording information about criminality and using it for public protection purposes, both within this country and beyond the UK. The Home Secretary has therefore asked Sir Ian Magee to undertake a review, comprising two distinct parts. The first will focus on scoping the problems, assessing what deficiencies there are and where they lie. The second part will concentrate on conclusions and recommendations for improving the recording and sharing of criminality data, with a firm grounding in what is realistic and achievable.</p>

We also need to ensure we continue to balance the needs of the economy with those of our environment and society.
