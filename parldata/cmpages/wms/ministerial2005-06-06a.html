 With the support of Her Majesty&#039;s Government, the United Nations Security Council on 18 April 2005 adopted resolution 1596, which extends the arms embargo on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to the entire territory of the DRC with conditioned exemptions for the new Congolese army, the UN organisation mission in the DRC and non-lethal military equipment for humanitarian or protective use.

 The 2004 spending review settlement required the Northern Ireland Prison Service to commission an independent review of its strategy for reducing unit costs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para15"><a name="stpa_17">The review was led by Hamish Hamill, the retired head of the Scottish Justice Department who was assisted by Michael Cook, governor of HM prison, The Verne and Gary Law, unit manager HM prison Edinburgh. I am very grateful to them for their report which makes five principal recommendations:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para16"><a name="stpa_18"><i>Recommendation 1</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para17"><a name="stpa_19">the key target for NIPS should be to reduce its costs per prisoner place in real terms year-on-year by an agreed amount that is valid in the Northern Ireland context,
</p>

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para18"><a name="stpa_20"><i>Recommendation 2</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para19"><a name="stpa_21">a wider review of the prisons estate is urgently required to inform long term investment decisions,
</p>

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para20"><a name="stpa_22"><i>Recommendation 3</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para21"><a name="stpa_23">NIPS should urgently explore the option of contracting out the full range of escort services in preference to reactivating prisoner custody officer recruitment,
</p>

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para22"><a name="stpa_24"><i>Recommendation 4</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para23"><a name="stpa_25">a better understanding between management and staff representatives should offer quick wins for both sides and must be a top priority for the new director general,
</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para25"><a name="stpa_27">the development of an enhanced model to assist in the provision of regular forecasts of the prisoner population, taking account of the range of relevant criminal justice system variables, should be given greater priority than it has had until now.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para27"><a name="stpa_29">To take the report&#039;s recommendations forward, I have asked Robin Masefield, the director general of the service, to prepare a strategic development plan aimed at drawing up the blueprint for the long term development of the Northern Ireland Prison Service.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para29"><a name="stpa_31">This study will draw up the blueprint for the long term development of the Northern Ireland Prison Service. It will create a firm platform for the Service&#039;s estate strategy and value for money investment decisions in relation to accommodation, facilities and services for prisoners.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para30"><a name="stpa_32">The study will build on the earlier estate strategy review completed in 2002 which concluded that Northern Ireland required three separate establishments. It is not intended to challenge that particular assumption, but the study will take account of:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para31"><a name="stpa_33"><i>(a)</i> potential changes in the prisoner population over the next 10&#150;15 years and the foreseen operational needs of the service;
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para33"><a name="stpa_35"><i>(c)</i> work in progress to clarify the role of individual establishments eg. the review of the regime for life sentence prisoners;
</p>

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para34"><a name="stpa_36"><i>(d)</i> the approach to the private sector in prison services in Great Britain and the potential for reductions in the cost to the taxpayer;
</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para36"><a name="stpa_38"><i>(f)</i>other relevant factors, including likely timescales, the merits of alternative locations for prisoners in Northern Ireland, and the employment effects in the northwest;

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para39"><a name="stpa_41">The study is to take note of all other relevant evidence, including the recent report of the independent review led by Hamish Hamill and reports based on the concept of a healthy prison by the Inspectorates in relation to both Magilligan and Hydebank Wood.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50606m02.html_para40"><a name="stpa_42">The work will consist of a number of strands taken forward under the oversight of a central steering group. Trade union and staff association representatives will be consulted fully during the study.
