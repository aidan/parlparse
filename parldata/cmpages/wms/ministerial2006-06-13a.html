22 March, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer
announced the Government's intention to consult on replacing the
Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), whose outcomes are based on the

cost to universities and higher education funding bodies, while
continuing to recognise and reward research
excellence.</p><p><a name="06061330000017">The

particularly important features. My hon. Friend the Member for Stirling
stressed the importance of the agenda for growth and jobs. This offered
the best route out of poverty; but we must be sure to give people the
tools they need to take it and overcome poverty of ambition. She agreed
with several ministerial colleagues that there was no need for a new

working time. Negotiations revolved around the opt-out from the 48 hour
working week. The presidency sought views at the lunchtime discussion
on a presidency text. In the second session, it tabled a revised
compromise proposal which was not agreed. The presidency introduced its
final compromise in the final session, which many Member States argued
they could not support, some because the text did not phase out the opt
out and some, including the UK, who felt proposals for restrictions and
limitations on the opt out went too far. The Council failed to reach
political
agreement.</p><p><a name="06061330000104">The
