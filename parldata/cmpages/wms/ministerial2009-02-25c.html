 I have decided to appoint the new RDA Board Chairs listed below.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09022581000014">Sir Roy McNulty&#151;Advantage West Midlands (AWM)</p>

<p><a name="st_157"><a name="09022581000021"><a name="90225m0001.htm_spmin1"><a name="09022581000047"><b>The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Andy Burnham):</b>
 I am pleased to be able to announce to the House the creation of a unique fundraising partnership for elite sport. The partnership brings together, for the first time ever, UK Sport, the British Olympic Association and the British Paralympic Association to raise funds for elite sport, along with the London Organising Committee of the London Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG). All the partners have today agreed a formal heads of agreement to pool their collective rights to help raise additional funds for elite sport in the run-up to London 2012 and beyond. This follows on from the challenge I set UK Sport last December to put in place a new partnership within Government to develop our private fundraising effort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para7"><a name="09022581000022">Building on our Medal Hopes scheme the partners have assembled an enhanced package of rights for sale as an official LOCOG activation programme. This will offer sponsors rights to branding, access and events surrounding our Olympic and Paralympic sports. The scheme will allow businesses to be associated with the success of all Olympic athletes, and all Olympic sports, through the UK Sport&#146;s World Class Performance Programme&#151;rights that no other sponsorship deal  can deliver.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09022581000023">This is why I believe, despite the challenging current economic conditions, the scheme has great potential for success. There will also be opportunities for regional and local companies, and individual patrons, to get involved in supporting our athletes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para9"><a name="09022581000024">In the 2006 Budget statement the Government announced a &#163;600 million package for the remaining three years of the Beijing cycle and for the London cycle, comprising &#163;200 million of Exchequer funding matched by &#163;100 million of private sector investment, and supported by &#163;300 million of lottery investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09022581000025">Last December I announced a record public sector funding settlement when I allocated a total of &#163;550 million of public funds&#151;an additional &#163;50 million&#151;to UK Sport to fund its elite programme. This consisted of additional Exchequer funding of &#163;29 million to UK Sport over the four years to 2012; plus a projected uplift in lottery income of &#163;21 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para11"><a name="09022581000026">This meant that for the London cycle the elite sport system will receive &#163;304 million, the highest level of public funding ever made available over a four-year Olympic-Paralympic cycle. UK Sport confirmed that this funding package enabled it to set a target to attain a place in the top four in the Olympic Games, and second place in the Paralympic Games in 2012&#151;aiming to win more medals in more sports than in Beijing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para12"><a name="09022581000027">I was clear that this new funding was the limit of public investment in elite sport, with any further funding having to come from our private fundraising initiative. Since last summer we have been working with Fast Track Ltd and UK Sport in developing the Medal Hopes sponsorship package and this will now be subsumed within the new wider fundraising scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para13"><a name="09022581000028">However, my aim has not only been to keep the full fundraising ambition in play but also to establish a commercial funding structure to continue raising funds for elite sport beyond 2012. Funding has moved from lottery money for Sydney and Athens, to Exchequer and lottery money for Beijing, and now Exchequer, lottery and private money for London. I consider this mixed economy funding for elite sport to be the right long-term approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para14"><a name="09022581000029">The creation of a unique fundraising partnership involving the wider Olympic family and the establishment of a third funding stream from the private sector will form a permanent legacy of the London Games. Both these measures, along with the record amount of public funding I have secured, leave elite sport with the best possible opportunity for a secure and successful future.</p>

with an equivalent force of Tornado GR4s by spring 2009 to Kandahar airfield. Delays in construction of the necessary supporting infrastructure and our  current estimate of the time required to complete the Tornado Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR) enhancements means that the Tornado GR4s will now deploy in summer 2009. We expect delivery of the UORs in advance of completion of the infrastructure project and will keep both programmes under constant review to ensure completion as quickly as possible. In the interim, Joint Force Harrier will continue to contribute to the provision of close air support to  UK and Allied Forces in southern Afghanistan; 1 (Fighter) Squadron will therefore replace IV (Army Co-operation) Squadron in mid-April.</p>

 The Justice and Home Affairs Council is due to be held on 26 and 27 February 2009 in Brussels. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary (Jacqui Smith), my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Lord Bach) and the Scottish Solicitor General (Frank Mulholland), intend to attend on behalf of the United Kingdom. As the provisional agenda stands, the following items will be discussed:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para15"><a name="09022581000032">During the mixed Committee with Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Lichtenstein, Ministers will be asked to adopt Council conclusions on the second generation of the Schengen Information System. These reflect discussions at the informal Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council in January on action required in light of an analysis which identified problems with the central system. The conclusions set a direction for the central SISII project, and include a set of criteria against which the SISII based scenario and the alternative scenario, based on a SIS I platform, will be assessed. They call for a decision regarding the future of the project to be taken by June 2009 at the latest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para16"><a name="09022581000033">The presidency will present to the mixed Committee the current state of play on the implementation of regulation establishing the Visa Information System (VIS). The UK does not participate in the VIS. The presidency will also report on the outcome of the Swiss air borders evaluation which took place on 9-13 February. Providing the air borders evaluation does not throw up any shortcomings and is fully compliant with the Schengen Acquis, Switzerland will be able to abolish checks on persons at its air borders on 29 March 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para17"><a name="09022581000034">The Council will then exchange initial views on a new proposal from the Commission for a regulation establishing a European asylum support office. The aim of the office will be to co-ordinate practical co-operation on asylum between member states. The UK will have 3 months to decide whether to opt in to this proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para18"><a name="09022581000035">The presidency will present the recent report by the Commission on the implementation of the Free Movement Directive (2004/38/EC) by all member  <br>

states. The UK strongly supports correct implementation of free movement rights and also welcomes the Commission&#146;s undertaking to provide effective guidelines on abuse of free movement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para19"><a name="09022581000036">The Council will discuss key issues around combating illegal immigration in the Mediterranean. This arises out of Migration Pact discussions. Four countries are calling for greater EU support in managing illegal migration flows through this region. The Government recognise the significance of these flows and support strong EU co-operation on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para20"><a name="09022581000037">The Council will discuss the situation of Iraqi  refugees informed by Council conclusions agreed on 27-28 November. The UK has already committed to resettling 1,000 Iraqi refugees during 2008-2010&#151;financial years&#151;and does not have capacity to include additional spaces. This has been communicated to the Council. The UK will encourage other EU member states to set up their own resettlement programmes and will offer technical support based on our longstanding experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para21"><a name="09022581000038">The Council will have a discussion over lunch on the appointment of the new Europol director. The United Kingdom will push for adoption of the unanimous recommendation of the Europol Management Board that the UK candidate was the most suitable for appointment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para22"><a name="09022581000039">The presidency will seek a steer from the Council on various aspects of the proposed framework decision in conflicts of jurisdiction in criminal matters. The proposal sets out a mechanism at union level to prevent potential conflicts of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings and determine the most appropriate jurisdiction in cases where more than one member state could potentially exercise jurisdiction over the same case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para23"><a name="09022581000040">The presidency will ask the Council to adopt a negotiating mandate for a mutual legal assistance agreement between the EU and Japan. The Government are happy with  the mandate in its current format. A key priority for the UK is to ensure the inclusion of video conferencing to give testimony.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para24"><a name="09022581000041">The presidency will update the Council about the implementation of the European e-justice action plan, which was approved by the Council in November 2008. The Government welcome the Presidency&#146;s commitment to the e-justice action plan and supports the development of a more detailed roadmap to ensure proper implementation of projects such as the e-justice portal and video conferencing</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="90225m0001.htm_para25"><a name="09022581000042">Under any other business, the Council will discuss any potential role of the EU in the closure of Guantanamo while the Commission will present an outline of a report by Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere on the processing of member states&#146; personal data by the US&#151;Treasury Department&#151;for counter-terrorism purposes. The Council will also have a discussion on the EU anti-drug policy, originally planned for the informal JHA Council in January. This will enable the UK to emphasise the continued necessity of EU action in tackling cocaine trafficking through West Africa. Greece is expected to highlight the third Global Forum on Migration and Development taking place in early November in Athens. The chosen overall theme is &#147;Integrating Migration policies in development strategies for the benefit of all&#148;. The UK is (as in previous years) a member of the steering group for the Athens Forum and will in that capacity help oversee and shape preparations.</p>
