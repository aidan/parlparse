Government</h3><h4 align="center"><a name="06060864000012">PPS22</h4><p><a name="06060864000023"><b><a name="06060864000131">The
Minister for Housing and Planning (Yvette Cooper):</b> On 9
February my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy informed the Standing
Committee of the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Bill that I
would undertake an urgent review of local plans to determine whether
there is a problem with emerging plans that do not fully incorporate
PPS22 guidance. That review has now been
completed.</p><p><a name="06060864000024">The
review has shown that in emerging new style regional spatial strategies
and local development frameworks there has been a strong take-up of the
policy in PPS22 on the use of on-site renewables in new developments.
For those authorities preparing new plans where an appropriate stage in
plan making has been reached, 26 out of 29 surveyed have devised
policies to secure on-site renewables in new developments. The majority
of them have set a requirement for 10 per cent. on-site renewables,
where it is viable. Many of those at an earlier stage of developing
their local development frameworks have not yet included PPS 22
policies, although they still have time to do so. We strongly encourage
them to do so. For those areas still completing old style plans, such
as unitary development plans, policies on on-site renewables are less
likely to have been
included.</p><p><a name="06060864000025">It
is essential that all planning authorities follow this example and take
account fully of the positive approach to renewables set out in PPS22
at the earliest opportunity in their plan-making. In particular the
Government expect all planning authorities to include policies in their
development plans that require a percentage of the energy in new
developments to come from on-site renewables, where it is viable. Such
policies have a vital role to play in reducing emissions, through the
use of carbon-neutral energy sources. Local authorities who are now
updating their plans through new local development frameworks should
take the opportunity to update their policies in this area. The
Government's forthcoming draft planning policy statement on climate
change will be an opportunity to consider further how the planning
process more generally can help combat climate change by extending the
contribution of renewables from both on-site and off-site
sources.</p><p><a name="06060864000026">A
more detailed breakdown of plans that were examined for this review of
PPS22 policies has been published today on the DCLG website at:
http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1500549 and is available in
the Libraries of both Houses. I have instructed my officials to write
to all chief planning officers enclosing a copy of this ministerial
statement

Indemnity
Scheme</h4><p><a name="06060864000027"><b><a name="06060864000132">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport
(Mr. David Lammy)</b>: The provision for the Government Indemnity Scheme
is made by the National Heritage Act 1980. The scheme facilitates
public access to loans of works of art and other objects for public
display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by
private owners and non-national institutions. It does this by
indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to objects they loan. Loans
covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also
covers loans of such objects for study purposes within borrowing
institutions where this would contribute materially to the public's
understanding or appreciation of the object loaned. Examples of this
are enhancing interpretation or explanation to the public of objects,
or bringing into the public domain the conclusions of any
study.</p><p><a name="06060864000028">The
limit on the contingent liabilities which may be incurred in
relation to the Government Indemnity Scheme for non-national museums
and galleries in England approved by the Treasury in May 2004 was
&#163;1.2 billion. As a result of two major temporary exhibitions
taking place in non-national museums and galleries and the high value
of the objects included in those exhibitions, it has been necessary to
temporarily increase the limit to &#163;1.74 billion, effective from
June 2006 until July
2006.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06060864000004">Education

Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (David
Miliband):</b> I represented the United Kingdom at the
Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting in Brussels on 22 May 2006.
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Ben Bradshaw, represented the UK for
the fisheries
item.</p><p><a name="06060864000034">The
Council held a policy debate on a proposal on organic farming, which
aims to simplify and improve the structure of current regulations. All
member states welcomed the proposal but could not agree on a number of
points: the proposal to include mass catering and the obligation to use
the EU logo or an EU organic indication. The Presidency noted the
discussion and informed Council that two further working groups would
now be held and that work on a compromise text would continue under the
Finnish
Presidency.</p><p><a name="06060864000035">Sweden,
formally supported by the Czech Republic and the UK, urged the
Commission to relax import restrictions on olive oil to reduce recent
high EU price rises caused by a drop in supply. The Commission noted
that production in 2005 had been exceptionally low due to drought in
Spain and would continue to monitor the
situation.</p><p><a name="06060864000036">The
Commission noted that in several member states farmers had missed the
deadline for single farm payment applications due to technical
difficulties. The Commission would consider a derogation for these
cases to avoid penalising farmers. A UK request is under
consideration.</p><p><a name="06060864000037">The
Council adopted conclusions on the co-existence of genetically
modified, conventional and organic
crops.</p><p><a name="06060864000038">The
Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner presented a progress report
on the status of the veterinary agreement between the EC and the
Russian Federation. Significant progress has been made and memoranda
have been signed on regionalisation and intra-Community transit and
fraud.</p><p><a name="06060864000039">Under
any other business, the Council took note of a written update on Avian
influenza H5N1 by the Commissioner for Health and Consumer
Protection.</p><p><a name="06060864000040">Over
lunch, the Agriculture Commissioner urged the EU to press for a package
in WTO agricultural negotiations. She said there would be no unilateral
commitment by the EU but that failure to agree a package was not in the
EU7s
interest.</p><p><a name="06060864000041">The
only fisheries item was the proposal for a European Fisheries Fund, on
which the Council had hoped to reach political agreement. However,
member states failed to reach agreement on a compromise and it is
likely that this proposal will return to Council during the Finnish
Presidency.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06060864000006">Foreign

cover developments on the ground and ways in which the EU can continue
to support the new Iraqi
Government.</p><p><a name="06060864000069">We

Process</i></p><p><a name="06060864000074">The
GAERC will consider the Middle East Peace Process declaration for the
European Council. This is likely to welcome: the development of the

Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Margaret
Beckett):</b> In recognition of the increasing importance of
the FCO network in delivering our climate change goals, I have looked
again at our strategic international priorities, set out in the
Government White Paper &#147;Active Diplomacy for a Changing World:
the UK's International Priorities&#148;, published in March. Climate 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 38WS</b><br>change was covered in the White Paper and implicit in strategic
priorities five and six. I believe that we need to emphasise its
central importance to our international agenda by creating a new
Strategic Priority. This will
be:</p><a name="06060864000083"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Achieving
climate security by promoting a faster transition to a sustainable, low
carbon global
economy.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060864000084">This
wording is designed to draw attention to the outcome that the effort on
climate change needs to achieve; and to underline the reality, which is
not yet fully reflected in the priorities of foreign ministries
worldwide, that climate change has become a core foreign policy
challenge.</p><p><a name="06060864000085">I
am also announcing today the appointment of John Ashton as my Special
Representative for Climate Change. His primary focus will be to build a
stronger political foundation for international action on climate
change, working to build consensus among key governmental and
non-governmental actors in priority
countries.</p><p><a name="06060864000086">DEFRA
will continue to lead our internationalwork on climate change.
But the new Strategic Priority and John Ashton's appointment will
strengthen significantly the contribution the FCO can
make.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06060864000007">Home

of&#163;2.5 million to the London Bombings Relief Charitable
Fund to give assistance to bereaved and the injured victims of the 7
July London

(Ethiopia)</h4><p><a name="06060864000092"><b><a name="06060864000138">The
Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary
Benn):</b> In a written statement on 24 January 2006 I
informed the House that the UK, along with all other donors, had
decided to withhold direct budget support to the Government of Ethiopia
as a result of concerns about the governance and human rights situation
following the elections in June last year.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 39WS</b><br><p><a name="06060864000094">I assured the
House at that time that the UK remained committed to reducing poverty
in Ethiopia and that we were looking at alternative ways to support
poor people. I can now inform the House that I have approved &#163;94
million for a new Protection of Basic Services Grant. Its objective is
to maintain and expand basic services, such as primary schooling, basic
health care, water supply and sanitation, and agricultural extension,
in order to continue Ethiopia's slow but steady progress towards
meeting the Millennium Development Goals while promoting transparency
and accountability in the delivery of these services. It is also being
supported by the World Bank, whose Board has just approved funding of
$215 million (&#163;123
million).</p><p><a name="06060864000096">The
project will provide for regular financial monitoring and reporting to
ensure that funds are being allocated fairly and are being used for the
agreed purposes. For the first time detailed budgetary information will
be provided to citizens to increase local accountability. I hope that
Civil Society organisations will play an important role in helping
citizens to understand how money in the budget is allocated and what it
is used for, and in bringing those responsible to account for spending
decisions.</p><p><a name="06060864000097">I
have also recently approved &#163;30 million for the Productive
Safety Nets Programme for the current year to provide assistance to 7
million chronically food insecure households&#151;the poorest people
in the country. This programme removes the need for the annual
emergency food appeal by providing poor people with predictable and
guaranteed cash and food in exchange for work on public projects such
as local roads and water schemes. During my visit to Ethiopia earlier
this year, I was able to see for myself the way in which this programme
was providing vital assistance to poor people to enable them to build
better
lives.</p><p><a name="06060864000099">Improving
the governance and human rights situation in Ethiopia has to be a
priority for the UK. My colleagues and I continue to raise with the
Government of Ethiopia the need to improve governance and human rights
in the country, in the light of the criminal trial of some leading
Opposition, media and Civil Society leaders on serious charges. We have
urged the Ethiopian Government to ensure that the trials are fair,
transparent and speedy, and are supporting the observation of the trial
by an international
jurist.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06060864000009">Transport</h3><h4 align="center"><a name="06060864000020">Rail
Franchises</h4><p><a name="06060864000100"><b><a name="06060864000139">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Derek
Twigg):</b> I am today announcing the publication of
consultation documents for the new East Midlands, West Midlands and
cross-country rail franchises. Copies of the consultation documents
have been placed in the House Library and are availableon the
Department for Transport website at: www.dft.gov.uk.</p><p><a name="06060864000101">On 18 October
2005, the Secretary of State announced that three new rail franchises
would be created (East Midlands, West Midlands and a new 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 40WS</b><br>cross-country) from four currently existing franchises (Central,
Silverlink, Cross-Country and Midland mainline). The new franchises
will begin operation on Sunday 11 November
2007.</p><p><a name="06060864000102">The
publication of the three documents begins the formal consultation
process on the service levels the new train operators should provide.
The documents are a consultation on the franchise specifications and
seek views on the minimum service level the Department for Transport
(DfT) will wish to procure. This consultation and the responses
received will later inform the Invitation to Tender (ITT) that bidders
for each franchise will be asked to bid against this autumn. Bidders
will have to provide the minimum service levels the ITT sets out and
will be able to propose additional services above this minimum subject
to any operational constraints and
affordability.</p><p><a name="06060864000103">Our
aim is to ensure that all three franchises build on the recent success
of current operators. Passenger numbers on Britain&#146;s railway are
growing, particularly on key routes served by these new franchises. We
want to see those numbers continue to
grow.</p><p><a name="06060864000104">These
new franchises are expected to meet current and future passenger demand
and deliver a 2-5 per cent. increase in the number of trains operated
per day. Bidders will also be required to build on recent performance
improvements, and deliver value for money for both fare and
taxpayers.</p><p><a name="06060864000105">The
documents propose service levels that will address crowding, allow for
future growth and will put faster services in place on key routes.
Passenger capacity will increase. On the cross-country franchise, DfT
is proposing a timetable structure that allows bidders to put forward a
substantial increase in capacity on key crowded trains. The department
expects bidders to propose additional carriages and longer trains on
busy routes. Overall, the cross-country network is expanding with extra
stations served. In particular, the consultation documents propose
service levels that further capitalise on the &#163;7.6 billion
investment on the West Coast main
line.</p><p><a name="06060864000106">This
is an important consultation that covers the provision of over 2,000
daily rail services. The consultation will run until 7 August 2006.
Over the coming weeks the Department will be having extensive
discussions with local interested stakeholders. It is important to
ensure that these new franchises deliver further improvements for
current and future rail
passengers.</p>

<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 41WS</b><br>negotiations with the USA; and the draft proposals on vessel traffic
monitoring and port state
control.</p><p><a name="06060864000109">The
Austrian presidency has indicated that they will be aiming for the
Council to reach a political agreement on the draft public service
obligation (PSO) regulation. This would establish new rules for the
payment of subsidy and the award of exclusive rights for public
passenger transport services by rail and by
road.</p><p><a name="06060864000110">In
the negotiations to date we have secured some changes to ameliorate
potentially adverse effects on UK public transport arrangements. We
have also succeeded in amending the proposal in such a way as to create
a more level playing field for operators and to create an environment
for further opening of the passenger transport
market.</p><p><a name="06060864000111">However,
there are still some issues to be resolved. These include, in
particular, the extent to which authorities should be permitted to
award contracts directly without competition and the safeguards that
should be put in place to ensure operators benefiting from direct
awards may not compete unfairly in competitive
markets.</p><p><a name="06060864000112">At
the Council the Government will be prepared to support a deal if the
final text on the table appears to offer a satisfactory
balance.</p><p><a name="06060864000113">I
expect the Council to adopt a set of Council conclusions welcoming
progress on road safety&#151;in particular, the publication of the
Commission's mid-term review of the 2003 road safety action programme.
The mid-term review indicates that progress will need to be accelerated
in order to meet the EU target to halve road deaths by 2010. The
conclusions also recognise that measures need to be strengthened at the
appropriate level&#151;community or member state&#151;to deal with
particular issues. In addition, the conclusions acknowledge the role of
technology, campaigns and the road safety charter and will invite the
Commission to take necessary actions, including, where appropriate,
making legislative
proposals.</p><p><a name="06060864000114">The
Council will also be debating Council conclusions in regard to the
Commission's communication on inland waterways&#151;NAIADES
(navigation and inland waterway action and development in Europe). The
conclusions agree the action programme to promote inland waterways for
freight transport and comment on the detailed proposals of the
recommendations contained within it. Although the communication only
has limited relevance to the United Kingdom&#151;as our inland
waterways are not connected to those on the continent&#151;the
Government recognise the potential of Europe's inland waterways to help
reduce traffic congestion and harmful effects on the environment as a
whole.</p><p><a name="06060864000115">The
presidency has proposed the signature of the transport protocol to the
Alpine Convention, which is an international agreement aimed at
protecting the Alpine environment. The UK would in principle be
prepared to support the signature but believes that the Council should
take account of the views of a member state that is directly affected
and opposed to the
protocol.</p><p><a name="06060864000116">There
will be two substantive maritime items on the agenda. The Council is
expected to reach a general approach on the proposed directive amending
Directive 2002/59/EC establishing a community vessel 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 42WS</b><br>traffic monitoring and information system. This directive contains a
number of disparate provisions including the fitting of automatic
identification system (AIS) technology to fishing vessels. The
Government support the presidency text of the directive, subject to
achieving a satisfactory agreement on detailed points concerning the
length of the fishing vessels to be fitted with AIS technology and the
implementation timetable for the different categories of fishing
vessels (according to their overall
length).</p><p><a name="06060864000117">The
Council will also hear a progress report from the Commission on the
proposed directive on port state control which will simplify the
existing much amended legislation. The proposed directive will also
make for better use of limited port state control inspection resources,
targeting for inspection those ships which pose the greatest risk while
reducing the inspection burden on the owners/operators of quality
ships. The requirements of the directive should be compatible with the
outcome of the current work on targeting ships for inspection being
undertaken by the Paris memorandum on port state control (which
comprises EU port States plus Russia, Canada, Iceland and
Norway).</p><p><a name="06060864000118">The
Austrian presidency expects the Council to reach a general approach on
the proposal to establish a joint undertaking to develop SESAR, the
project for the new generation air traffic management system in Europe.
The Government support the SESAR project as a key element of the Single
European Sky. The joint undertaking will allow for an integrated
approach to the development of SESAR involving all parts of the
aviation
industry.</p><p><a name="06060864000119">The
second aviation item will see the Commission reporting on two aspects
of aviation external relations&#151;on the state of play on
negotiations to agree an &#147;open skies&#148; agreement with the
US, and on negotiations with Russia over the issue of Siberian
overflight
payments.</p><p><a name="06060864000120">The
Commission will provide an oral report, expected to include the key
elements of the concession contract, for the Galileo satellite
navigation project. The Government will argue strongly for a robust PPP
which is affordable for the
Community.</p><p><a name="06060864000121">The most
significant of the &#147;Any Other Business&#148; items
are:</p><a name="06060864000122"><ul><p class="tabletext">A report
from the Commission on the implementation of the first railway
package;</p></ul><a name="06060864000123"><ul><p class="tabletext">A report

Aviation Safety Agency

Discrimination Act 1995 (Code of
Practice)</h4><p><a name="06060864000124"><b><a name="06060864000141">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Mrs. Anne
McGuire):</b> I havetoday laid a draft code of
practice prepared by the Disability Rights Commission (DRC), before
Parliament in accordance with the procedure set out in section
53A(4) of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. This draft code will
replace the existing code of 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 43WS</b><br>practice on &#147;Rights of Access: Goods, Facilities, Services and
Premises&#148;, published in May
2002.</p><p><a name="06060864000126">During
the passage of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 2005, the
Government said that the DRC would be issuing guidance to assist in the
implementation of the new duties. The Government believe that clear and
accessible advice and guidance for those with rights and
responsibilities under the DDA is important. The Government therefore
warmly welcome the draft revised code which provides clear advice and
guidance for those with obligations under part 3 of the Act on how to
avoid acts of disability discrimination, and to landlords and tenants
on how to deal with requests by tenants for consent to make
disability-related alterations to their homes to improve access for
disabled
people.</p><p><a name="06060864000128">The
draft revised code takes account of new duties in part 3 and part 5B of
the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, inserted by the Disability
Discrimination Act 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 44WS</b><br>2005; and new duties introduced by the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006. The
new duties mainly come into force from4 December 2006. They
affect public authorities in the carrying out of their functions (other
than those functions which are services and already covered by the
DDA); private members clubs; and landlords and managers of rented
premises in relation to reasonable adjustments and disability-related
alterations to let residential premises. In preparing this code the DRC
has consulted extensively among disabled people, their organisations,
landlords and the wider
public.</p><p><a name="06060864000130">Subject
to Parliament's approval of the draft code, the DRC proposes to issue
and publish the revised code later this summer, giving those with
responsibilities under the Act adequate time to read it before the new
duties come into force. The Secretary of State willthen
provide for the new code to come into force on4 December 2006,
replacing the existing code fromthat
date.</p>
