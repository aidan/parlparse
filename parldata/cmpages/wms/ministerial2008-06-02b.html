 My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools and Learners (Lord Adonis) has made the following written ministerial statement:</p>
<a name="80602m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="0806021000020"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;1. I intend to introduce charges for education at academies for non-EEA pupils in specific circumstances, decided on a case-by-case basis.</p>

It currently has two non-EEA pupils on its educational roll. They are in year 11 and had expected to complete their education at the school to Year 13. Under the current immigration regime, they will be in breach of the requirements of their visas if they attend the new academy, because it is not an &#147;independent fee-paying school outside the maintained sector&#148;.</p>
</ul><a name="80602m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="0806021000022"><ul><p class="tabletext">3. The Minister of State for Borders and Immigration has confirmed that he will make an exception to the immigration rules for these pupils, allowing them to complete their education as planned. This exception has been granted on the basis of these pupils not accessing education at UK taxpayers&#146; expense. In order to satisfy this requirement, I am introducing charging for education into the academy&#146;s funding agreement. This will enable the academy to charge these pupils for their education and ensure that they do not benefit from public funds.</p>
</ul><a name="80602m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="0806021000023"><ul><p class="tabletext">4. The ability to charge for education will only be introduced into the funding agreement of this academy.

 I am pleased to announce the award of a contract to Ascent valued at &#163;635 million, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and VT Group, for the UK military flying training system, which is designed to meet the long-term flying training needs of the UK armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="80602m0001.htm_para3"><a name="0806021000029">Ascent has been appointed as training system partner to work with the Ministry of Defence to incrementally procure and deliver flying training capability, the first part of which is a ground-based training environment, funded under a private finance initiative, for the advanced jet trainer, Hawk 128. Our intention is to add other elements of flying training in due course so that all flying training is brought within a single training architecture, making UK military flying training system the first step in a 25-year programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="80602m0001.htm_para4"><a name="0806021000030">This contract signals our intention to overhaul our training schemes and bring them together into one modern and cohesive programme.

We will continue to ensure that our flying personnel are equipped to meet contemporary and future threats, but the new contract should allow us to reduce overall costs and also improve training throughput to frontline units by improving the overall training times for aircrew and reducing delays between flying courses.</p>

 Since 2004, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has offered specific consular assistance for British victims of terrorist incidents and their families. This assistance, known as the Aftercare Plan, recognised that in many cases travel insurance explicitly excluded acts of terrorism from cover. The plan provided support to victims of terrorist attacks overseas and family members in the exceptional circumstances where travel insurance was not available to meet support and repatriation costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="80602m0001.htm_para6"><a name="0806021000033">Acts of terrorism overseas, as opposed to other crimes, justify this level of support because we consider terrorism to be acts taken against society as a whole, in which individuals are usually random victims. Although the same might be said of other serious, violent incidents, these measures are distinctly for incidents we deem to be acts of terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="80602m0001.htm_para7"><a name="0806021000034">The Aftercare Plan, now more than three years old, has been revised to reflect the FCO&#146;s experience with victims and families, and to reflect that travel insurance is now more likely to cover terrorism. Our new policy is called &#147;Exceptional Assistance Measures for Terrorist Incidents Overseas&#148;, in order to more accurately describe the purpose of this financial assistance and our role in providing support to victims and their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="80602m0001.htm_para8"><a name="0806021000035">As was the case with the Aftercare Plan, this provision is not a form of compensation. It is a means by which the Foreign and Commonwealth Office can recompense for actual expenditure, following a terrorist incident overseas, where there is no other available source of financial assistance. The measures aim to alleviate the immediate needs of those affected.</p>

the latest challenges. If we are to achieve universal access and to halt and reverse the spread of AIDS, the evidence demonstrates we require a long-term approach, across a range of health systems and services. Our new commitment to spend &#163;6 billion on health systems and services up to 2015 demonstrates the UK&#146;s determination to remain at the forefront of global efforts to achieve universal access. This is in addition to the unprecedented long-term commitment by the UK, announced in September 2007, to provide &#163;1 billion to the global fund between 2008 and 2015.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="80602m0001.htm_para16"><a name="0806021000060">This strategy commits &#163;200 million over three years to expand social protection programmes, which will help ensure that more orphans and vulnerable children have access to better child nutrition, health and education. The UK remains committed to meeting the needs of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC). &#147;Taking Action&#148; helped increase global funding for OVCs. But we now need to ensure the needs of OVCs are systematically met. Evidence shows that this can best be achieved through integrating OVCs&#146; needs into health, education and social protection plans. We will regularly review this approach by publishing a report following the biennial global partners forum on children affected by HIV and AIDS, to ensure that the approach outlined here supports the most effective ways of meeting the needs and rights of OVCs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="80602m0001.htm_para22"><a name="0806021000080">The correct answer should have been:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="80602m0001.htm_para23"><a name="0806021000081">The pension contribution of hon. Members increased from 9 per cent. to 10 per cent. of salary in April 2004 for those opting for one fortieth pension accrual. It remained at 6 per cent. of salary for one fiftieth accrual. These pension contribution rates also applied to ministerial salaries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="80602m0001.htm_para24"><a name="0806021000082">As for many public sector pensions, the increases applied each April to pensions in payment under the parliamentary contributory pension fund, in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension, were linked to the increase in the retail prices index as at the previous September. These increases applied to pensions paid to former Cabinet Ministers, Ministers of State and Parliamentary Under-Secretaries.</p>

 My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Family and I are today announcing publication of a White Paper, &#147;Joint Birth Registration: Recording Responsibility&#148;, outlining the Government&#146;s proposals to require unmarried parents to register the birth of a child jointly and to make birth registration a more accessible process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="80602m0002.htm_para5"><a name="0806021000132">In June 2007 the Government published a Green Paper seeking views on their proposals on making joint birth registration a legal requirement. There was a good level of response and today we are publishing a White Paper which sets out firm proposals which have been informed by the Green Paper consultation and further work on this issue. Copies of the White Paper are available from the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="80602m0002.htm_para6"><a name="0806021000133">Currently there are up to 45,000 children born in England and Wales each year who do not have both parents identified on their birth certificate. It is the Government&#146;s ambition to significantly decrease the number of sole registrations in England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="80602m0002.htm_para7"><a name="0806021000134">Registering a birth is a significant act. It is one of the first milestones in the life of a child which can shape its future identity. It is also a key moment for parents, when a mother and father publicly acknowledge that they have responsibility for their child&#151;not only as its legal representative, but also in the expectation that together they will safeguard and promote their child&#146;s health, development and welfare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="80602m0002.htm_para8"><a name="0806021000135">&#147;Joint Birth Registration: Recording Responsibility&#148; sets out changes to the law in England and Wales to make joint birth registration a legal requirement for all unmarried parents unless this is decided by the registrar to be impossible, impracticable or unreasonable. Alongside this the White Paper sets out a series of non-legislative measures to promote and support joint birth registration and changes to give mothers a right to insist that the father acknowledges his responsibilities to his child by registering on the birth certificate. Equally, it gives a father a new right to insist that he is registered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="80602m0002.htm_para9"><a name="0806021000136">Last year&#146;s Green Paper acknowledged that there will be situations where a joint registration is not a possible or desirable outcome and so set out a list of specific exemptions where a sole registration would be permitted. Following response from stakeholders, we have broadened these exemptions to cover situations where the registrar believes a joint registration would be impossible, impracticable, or unreasonable. Mothers will not be required to name fathers, and fathers will not be permitted to be recorded if a joint registration would compromise the safety and well-being of the child or mother. In developing legislation the Government will work further with stakeholders to ensure the protection of vulnerable women and children.</p>
