 The Government have recently issued a licence for the export of goods to be used as part of the process of drilling oil and gas wells. These goods include HMX pellets which could be suitable for use in anti-personnel landmines. However, the Government are satisfied that these HMX pellets, specifically designed for cutting collars and perforating tubes, are intended only for the legitimate end-use stated. The risk of these goods being diverted for use by the Iranian military is minimal.
