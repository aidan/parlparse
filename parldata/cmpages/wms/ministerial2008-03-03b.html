The questionnaire asked Ministers to identify their three priorities for the health check and to present their objectives for dairy reform. The UK called for full decoupling, the dismantling of all market instruments, an increase in compulsory modulation to fund environmental challenges and we opposed limits on higher farm payments, due to the distortion and bureaucracy which that would entail.

 I am today announcing plans for my Department to take forward work to consider the long-term capacity of the M11 motorway and the West Anglia main line. This is in recognition of the proposed growth in the draft East of England plan and the need to support this with effective and sustainable transport links.

This work will take account of the forecast growth in the region and ensure that, in seeking to exploit the region&#146;s economic opportunities, we do so in a socially and environmentally sustainable way, considering a range of ways to provide the additional capacity that is needed.</p>
