Our defence exports licensing system is one of the most rigorous and open in the world and this annual report is a symbol of our commitment to transparency and accountability. This will be the Government&#039;s seventh annual report (the first report was published in 1997). The report will be available on the FCO website: www.fco.gov.uk and also published through the Stationery Office.
