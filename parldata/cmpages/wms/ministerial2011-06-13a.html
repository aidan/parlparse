It also sets down detailed rules to ensure harmonisation and the proper functioning of the internal market. These are intended to rectify variations in the implementation of Directive 86/609/EEC which have tended to create barriers to trade in products and substances developed using animals in research and testing.</p>

Currently, only those who have indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom are able to sponsor their other dependent relatives from abroad and those refugees with limited leave must make their applications outside of the rules and these are considered at the Secretary of State’s discretion. We want to ensure that refugees with limited leave have the same opportunity to sponsor their other dependent family members as those coming through the normal route and this will also include a requirement that they be able to maintain and accommodate them.</p>

Through taking on responsibility for raising the taxes required to fund the spending decisions they make, the Scottish Parliament will be more accountable to the Scottish people. Once the measures are fully implemented the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Ministers will have more powers, will be more accountable, and will be better equipped to respond to Scotland’s needs within the United Kingdom.</p>

The Bill has successfully passed through Committee stage in the House of Commons and in March 2011 the Scottish Parliament voted overwhelmingly in support of a legislative consent motion agreeing to the measures set out in the Bill, by a margin of 121 to 3.</p>
