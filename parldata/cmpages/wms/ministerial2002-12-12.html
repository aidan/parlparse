<P>
<P>
<a name="21212m01.html_spmin4"><B>The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  Margaret Beckett): </B> 
 I am pleased to report to the House that Government are today launching a Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food. Later today, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and I will meet farmers and leaders of the food industry, rural, environmental and consumer bodies to discuss the new strategy and hear examples of good practice from across the food chain.
<P>

<a name="21212m01.html_para24">The strategy is further evidence of this Government's commitment to help deliver innovative and practical solutions to the challenges faced by those involved in the food chain. We do not underestimate the scale of these challenges: farm incomes remain under pressure and the foot and mouth disease outbreak also added to the momentum for change.
<P>

<a name="21212m01.html_para25">This strategy builds on the invaluable work conducted by the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food to chart a way through these challenges. It sets out how industry, Government and consumers can work together to secure a profitable and internationally competitive future for our industries, whilst contributing to a better environment, improving nutrition and public health and prosperous communities.
<P>

<a name="21212m01.html_para26">The strategy is backed by #500 million from Government over the next three years. Subject to clearance under the usual EU procedures, this will provide:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a new entry-level agri-environment scheme: developing a simple scheme, suitable for all farmers which will pay them to farm in a more sustainable way, a core Curry Commission recommendation. Subject to successful piloting, this would be rolled out nationally in 2005.
<P>
<BR>
Continued expansion of premium rural and environmental schemes like Countryside Stewardship: further work to improve the targeting of these schemes and make them simpler to applicants.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="21212m01.html_para27">A new 'whole farm' approach to management and regulation: helping farmers plan their business as a whole to meet commercial and regulatory needs. The Government also plan to develop an audit-based approach to identify a farm's strengths and weaknesses as a basis for cutting red tape and the number of inspections required.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The new Agricultural Development Scheme: to improve competitiveness and marketing, including the priority areas of co-operation, farm assurance and spreading best practice.
<P>
<BR>
New funding to assist small regional food producers: extra money channelled through Food from Britain will enable it to work with Regional Development Agencies and the Regional Food Groups to expand this sector.
<P>
<BR>
More money for skills and training: knowing how to make a profit is fundamental, but respecting the environment and marketing require different skills and knowledge. We are reviewing training and advice services to help farmers develop and to exploit new opportunities.
<P>
<BR>
A Food and Health Action Plan: led by the Department of Health, to build on existing work to improve diet and nutrition, working with industry and consumers. The Plan will address food production and access as well as consumer information.
<P>
<BR>
A network of demonstration farms: in early 2003 a pilot network of farms will open their doors to share best practice and experiences.
<P>
<BR>
Improving animal health and combating diseases: government is drawing up a new animal health and welfare strategy, has strengthened our emergency preparations and efforts to combat illegal meat imports.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="21212m01.html_para28">In addition, the Government will ask the Institute of Grocery Distribution, in conjunction with the Food Chain Centre to undertake analysis of the impact of nutrition initiatives such as the National School Fruit Scheme and the five-a-day programme, on the food chain. This will highlight the commercial opportunities for English farmers and growers and other sectors of the food industry.
<P>

<a name="21212m01.html_para29">The strategy&#151;which builds on the work of the Curry Commission&#151;also underlines the need for farming to reconnect with its markets, better cooperation with the food chain, investment in people and technology and the adoption of environmental best practice. There are many examples of good practice to build upon:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>More than 25,000 farm holdings in existing government environmental schemes.
<P>
<BR>
More than 400 farmers' markets offering producers the opportunity to sell direct to their markets.
<P>
<BR>
Over 78,000 farmers and growers are already members of farm assurance schemes with their produce branded under logos such as the Red Tractor and a number of industry initiatives being taken forward as part of the strategy:
<P>
<BR>
The Food Chain Centre is working to improve the efficiency of the food chain through the provision of information, analysis and training and promotion of benchmarking and best practice.
<P>
<BR>
The Red Meat Industry Forum is working to improve efficiency and information flow in the red meat supply chain.
<P>
<BR>
English Farming and Food Partnerships, established by the industry with Defra support, will promote co-operation between farmers and between farmers and the rest of the food chain.
<P>
<BR>
Assured Food Standards is working to broaden support for farm assurance within the food chain and to consolidate and develop assurance standards.

<P>
<a name="21212m02.html_spmin1"><B>The Secretary of State for the Home Department   (Mr. David Blunkett): </B> 
 I have considered the current arrangements on the use of intrusive surveillance of prison cells during hostage incidents and have concluded that the current arrangements do not assist the Prison Service in bringing a hostage incident to a safe conclusion. As things stand, the Prison Service Incident Commander is required to obtain my authorisation of any hostage incident where he considers it necessary to use surveillance in the management of the incident. This can take an hour or more, which could be a dangerous delay.
<P>

<a name="21212m02.html_para3">It makes no sense that the Prison Service is hampered in its safe management of the incident through concerns about the hostage-taker's privacy. The Prison Service has taken advice of the Chief Surveillance Commissioner, who concluded that a hostage-taker forfeits his right to privacy by engaging in this activity. I agree with this approach and I have instructed the Prison Service to alter procedures accordingly.
<P>

<a name="21212m02.html_para4">This will mean that in future the Director General or Deputy Director General will authorise applications for covert surveillance in hostage incidents. The Prison Service will however be required to maintain an audit trail of each authorisation demonstrating that the use of 



<P>
<P>12 Dec 2002 : Column 28WS<P>
surveillance was necessary, proportionate and consistent set out in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA).
<P>

<a name="21212m02.html_para5">Should the Prison Service require the use of intrusive surveillance of a prisoner's cell for any other purpose, those applications will still come to me, as they are likely to raise issues of privacy.

 The Department for Education and Skills, in conjunction with the National College for School Leadership, carried out a wide-ranging consultation exercise earlier this year on our proposals to make the NPQH mandatory for first time headteachers. Over 650 responses were received from individuals, LEAs and the main teachers' professional associations. Respondents were in favour of the NPQH being made mandatory for first time headteachers. Following this consultation, I have taken the decision that from 1 April 2004, all those appointed to their first headship post in the maintained sector, including nursery schools, and in non-maintained special schools, will be required to hold, or be working towards, the NPQH.
<P>

<a name="21212m02.html_para8">Working towards NPQH means that appointees must have at least successfully applied for a place on the course prior to their first headship appointment. The working towards arrangement is a transitional measure that will be in place for five years until 31 March 2009. After this date, the requirement to hold the NPQH will be a pre-appointment requirement for those appointed to their first headship post.

<a name="21212m02.html_para9">Those currently serving as headteachers will not be required to gain the qualification.
<P>

<a name="21212m02.html_para10">The NPQH provides aspiring headteachers with practical, professional training and the introduction of the mandatory requirement will give governing bodies a choice of qualified, well prepared new candidates for headship, in addition to any applications from experienced headteachers. We have carried out

extensive modelling work and we are confident that there will be enough holders of the NPQH by April 2004 to meet demand.

<a name="21212m02.html_para18">A significant number of respondents indicated a need for a more strategic approach to neighbour noise. I agree that there is a need for a separate Neighbour Noise Strategy and as a first steps towards developing this I am pleased to launch a study to examine neighbour noise, both from the point of view of the noise makers and their victims.

<a name="21212m03.html_para1">The scheme was introduced in August 2000 as a result of price increases in the generics market that started in 1999. It was rolled forward in October 2001. The scheme has restored stability in the generics market and the NHS has saved some #330 million annually as a result. The continuation of it will ensure that this stability continues and that the expenditure savings are maintained.

The review will report to me with recommendations, and a plan for their implementation. I will inform the House of the outcome.
