<p><a name="st_99"><a name="08020666000020"><a name="80206m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="08020666000179"><b>The Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):</b>
 The Government will today&#151;Wednesday 6 February 2007&#151;publish their initial response to the public consultation on &#147;UK Strategic Export Controls&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="80206m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08020666000021">On Monday 18 June 2007, I announced to the House, the launch of a public consultation on strategic export controls. In this consultation, the Government sought views both on the controls they introduced in 2004 under the Export Control Act 2002&#151;to establish whether they are having the intended effect without imposing unnecessary or disproportionate burdens on business&#151;and on a range of options for further change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="80206m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08020666000022">Prior to the closure of the consultation period on 30 September 2007, the Government received a total of 23 substantive responses from a range of groups, including industry and non-governmental organisations, and over 5,000 brief emails and letters. These have now been published on the BERR website at: http://www. berr.gov.uk/europeandtrade/strategic-export-control/legislation/export-control-act-2002/review/index.html</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="80206m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08020666000023">Since the public consultation period closed, the Government have been analysing the responses and considering the case for change. The initial response commits the Government to introduce change in a number of areas of significant concern. Notably it puts into action the commitment announced by the Prime Minister, in his Mansion House speech on 12 November 2007, to extend export laws to control brokering and trafficking of small arms by UK persons anywhere in the world and to give consideration to extending these controls to cover other weapons of concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="80206m0001.htm_para3"><a name="08020666000024">The initial response also commits the Government to:</p>
<a name="80206m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08020666000025"><ul><p class="tabletext">extend the coverage of extra-territorial trade controls to include trading in MANPADs (that is, portable weapons designed to fire missiles at aircraft) and those cluster munitions which cause unacceptable harm to civilians when carried out by UK persons anywhere in the world;</p>
</ul><a name="80206m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="08020666000026"><ul><p class="tabletext">rationalise the licensing treatment of long range missiles and unmanned air vehicles;</p>
</ul><a name="80206m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="08020666000027"><ul><p class="tabletext">add &#147;sting sticks&#148; to the current UK list of torture equipment, to which the most stringent controls are applied;</p>
</ul><a name="80206m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="08020666000028"><ul><p class="tabletext">start EU negotiations to introduce a new &#147;torture end use control&#148; that will allow all EU states to bring under control any item which is known to be for use in torture.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="80206m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08020666000029">The Government are currently undertaking further research and consultation with a view to reaching an agreement on some of the other change options that have been proposed. We hope to publish a further response to the change proposal in spring 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="80206m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08020666000030">Once the Government have finalised their position, they will aim to introduce the new legislation in three stages. The addition of &#147;sting sticks&#148; to the UK list of torture equipment is relatively straightforward to implement; this will be our first priority and we will act with immediacy. In the next stage we will then focus on the more complex changes to the controls on small arms, MANPADs and cluster munitions, so that change in these areas of high concern is also implemented speedily. In the final stage, the Government will introduce any further changes that may be necessary following further consideration, for example the potential extension of extra-territorial trade controls beyond small arms, to other types of weapons; the case for strengthening of controls on the export of non-controlled equipment for military end use in destinations of concern and introducing a register of traders in military equipment.</p>

<p><a name="st_100"><a name="08020666000031"><a name="80206m0001.htm_spmin1"><a name="08020666000180"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for  Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Mr. Gareth Thomas):</b>
 The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) is the UK&#146;s independent regulator and standard setter for accounting, auditing and the actuarial profession. The FRC&#146;s remit was expanded in 2004 as a result of the Government&#146;s review of audit and accounting regulation, and again in 2006 to include actuarial standards and regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="80206m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08020666000032">The Government believe the FRC has adapted well to its new responsibilities, and in particular welcome the recent changes it has made to its governance arrangements to increase its effectiveness and efficiency. The Government remain strongly supportive of the FRC. The FRC continues to exercise functions delegated to it by the Secretary of State, and indeed the Secretary of State is in the process of delegating additional functions concerning audit regulation to the FRC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="80206m0001.htm_para7"><a name="08020666000033">Corporate reporting and governance in the UK are widely recognised domestically and internationally as being of a very high standard generally. The FRC&#146;s integrated and market-led approach to regulation underpins these standards. This approach continues to receive strong support from companies, investors, the accountancy profession and other stakeholders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="80206m0001.htm_para8"><a name="08020666000034">For many years the Government have contributed one third of the FRC&#146;s core operating costs for its responsibilities for accounting, auditing and corporate governance. However, this position is not consistent with the funding arrangements for other similar regulatory bodies such as the Financial Services Authority and the Pensions Regulator, or with funding for the FRC&#146;s actuarial regulation. Nor does it sit well with the FRC&#146;s new board, which is now composed largely of private sector rather than Ministerial appointees. The Government have therefore concluded that, as a market-led regulator, the FRC should in future be funded largely by market participants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="80206m0001.htm_para9"><a name="08020666000035">The FRC will consult market participants on the options for new funding arrangements. In order to allow an orderly transition to stable, new, long-term funding arrangements, the Government have confirmed that they will maintain their current contribution to the FRC&#146;s costs for at least the 2008-09 financial year.</p>

These objectives should be achieved through concrete measures and be based on a cross-sectoral approach, youth empowerment, and through developing the youth dimension in the Lisbon agenda.The UK is content with this approach to youth policy.</p>

 Following our announcement of 5 December [Official Report, Column 65WS] on decisions on unitary proposals, I have today requested the Boundary Committee under section 4 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 to advise on certain matters respectively relating to the unitary proposals made by Exeter city council, Ipswich borough council, and Norwich city council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="80206m0001.htm_para11"><a name="08020666000040">These proposals are three of the 26 proposals submitted by councils in response to the Secretary of State&#146;s invitation to councils issued on 26 October 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="80206m0001.htm_para12"><a name="08020666000041">On the basis of her judgements that there was not a reasonable likelihood that these proposals would meet all of the outcomes specified by the five criteria set out in the invitation, the Secretary of State is at present not minded to implement these proposals. However, she believes, having regard to the circumstances of each area and to certain strengths that the proposals possess, notwithstanding her assessment of them against the criteria, that there could be alternative proposals covering the whole or part of the wider county area which would achieve those outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="80206m0001.htm_para13"><a name="08020666000042">We have requested the Boundary Committee to advise on these proposals by 31 December 2008.

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="80206m0001.htm_para14"><a name="08020666000043">I have placed copies of the request and guidance in the Library of the House and they are also available on the Departmental website.</p>

sought include whether for the areas affected by these proposals&#151;in each case the city or borough area and the remaining county area&#151;there could be alternative unitary proposals that would meet the five criteria specified in the request.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="80206m0001.htm_para16"><a name="08020666000045">Our request also specifies the possibility of the Committee making alternative proposals, which may involve merging the whole or part of the districts of Great Yarmouth and Waveney or, if essential, involve changes to the boundaries of the existing Devon unitaries&#151;Plymouth city and Torbay borough. Given that these latter councils are already established unitary councils, our request about alternative proposals is on the basis of maintaining the concept of the city and the borough.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has today announced the end of its immediate requirement for testing on live goats as part of its hyperbaric research in support of the MOD&#146;s Submarine Escape Rescue and Abandonment System (SMERAS).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="80206m0002.htm_para2"><a name="08020666000130">This research programme has been aimed at improving the accuracy of the information relating to the likely risk of the incidence of decompression illness following escape from a submerged submarine in varying depths and internal submarine pressures. Information obtained from these trials has been used to provide advice to submarine crews in the event of early abandonment of a disabled submerged submarine. This information enables the crew to make an informed judgement of the relative risks of delaying abandonment until rescue arrives. The welfare of its personnel is paramount to the MOD and this advice forms an integral part of MOD&#146;s duty of care to its submarine staff.</p>

This requirement has now been achieved, and the review has concluded that the remaining associated areas of uncertainty in submarine escape and rescue relate to events that are considered highly unlikely, and do not therefore need to be addressed by means of animal testing. The MOD has endorsed these recommendations and as a result, it has no immediate need to continue animal testing of this type.</p>

the Points-Based System (PBS). The PBS will build on a package of measures already being introduced to deliver our four objectives of protection, prevention, accountability and compassion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"><a name="80206m0002.htm_para5"><a name="08020666000134">Steps to strengthen our border protection will include: checking fingerprints before we issue a visa, screening all travellers against watch lists and introducing a single border force with police-like powers for frontline staff. The PBS will form part of a robust system that is designed to prevent illegal migration. Associated measures will include big fines for employers who do not make checks and compulsory ID cards for foreign nationals make checks easier. We will continue to welcome those who promise to abide by the rules but we will hold to account those who break the rules, including automatic deportation for those who commit a serious offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="80206m0002.htm_para6"><a name="08020666000135">The new rules for the points system strengthen our power to automatically refuse applications in which deception is used. Those who breach our immigration laws will be barred from returning to the UK for a fixed period of up to ten years. The new rules also begin to implement the PBS Tier 1 (General) route for highly skilled migrants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="80206m0002.htm_para7"><a name="08020666000136">Separately from the PBS changes, we are laying today amendments to the immigration rules that will restrict migrants in certain circumstances from taking employment as a doctor in training.</p>

At the same time, we are toughening the immigration rules to make it easier to keep out migrants whom we do not want. All PBS migrants will need to provide original documents to prove that they are entitled to the points they claim. Where we have any suspicions about the documents, we will conduct rigorous checks and will disregard any document that we cannot verify. Any application in which deception is used will be refused automatically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"><a name="80206m0002.htm_para10"><a name="08020666000139">Under the new rules, those who try to cheat their way into Britain by lying in their immigration applications will automatically be refused. Those who breach our immigration laws will be barred from returning to the UK for a fixed period of up to ten years. This sends out the message that, although we welcome highly skilled migrants who wish to contribute to our society, we will not tolerate those who do not play by the rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"><a name="80206m0002.htm_para11"><a name="08020666000140">Anyone who has used deception when applying for a visa will have any future applications to come here refused for ten years.

 On the 22 February 2005 the then Secretary of State for Transport introduced a hybrid Bill to provide for the construction, maintenance and operation of Crossrail. At this time, directions were also issued for the safeguarding of the main Crossrail route, from Maidenhead to Shenfield and from Whitechapel to Abbey Wood, for the associated construction worksites, and for the possible extension of Crossrail from Abbey Wood to Hoo Junction. This safeguarding protects the route from any conflicting developments that could interfere with the construction or operation of Crossrail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="80206m0002.htm_para21"><a name="08020666000159">As a result of negotiations with affected parties and the development of engineering design works, there have been changes to the land needed for the construction and operation of Crossrail. This means that some land that has been safeguarded will no longer be needed, while we are proposing to use other sections of land that are not currently safeguarded. Accordingly, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has issued revised safeguarding directions for the main route that reflect these changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="80206m0002.htm_para22"><a name="08020666000160">In July 2005, the Department consulted on the possibility of safeguarding land between Maidenhead and Reading West Junction, which would protect land potentially required, should it be decided to extend Crossrail services to Reading. The Department also consulted on updating the safeguarding directions in the Abbey Wood to Hoo Junction corridor, to allow for additional works considered necessary for an extension of Crossrail services to Ebbsfleet. A decision was deferred following an instruction by the House to the Select Committee, where it considered appropriate, to consider any petitions on the extension of Crossrail to Reading (and Ebbsfleet) and to report to the House whether there was a case for the extension to be made by an order under the Transport and Works Act 1992. The Committee heard some evidence but did not make any recommendation on these matters in its &#147;Special Report&#148;, published on 23 October 2007.</p>

While I am clear that Crossrail services will terminate at Maidenhead and have no plans to extend them to Reading, this measure gives the flexibility to be able to extend Crossrail in the future, should there be a business case. This safeguarding of the route would also protect the possibility of undertaking electrification works on the route to Reading, even without the extension of Crossrail. Again,  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_379"><a name="80206m0002.htm_para24"><a name="08020666000162">There is no need for works powers to extend to Reading to be included in the Crossrail Bill, which would seriously delay the passage of the Bill through Parliament. If such powers were needed these could be sought by means of a Transport and Works Act Order. There is also sensible advance planning through designing station improvement works at both Reading and Maidenhead so as to allow for the possibility of the future extension of Crossrail services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_380"><a name="80206m0002.htm_para25"><a name="08020666000163">The next step on safeguarding is to consult Network Rail on which sites should be protected if any works were to be undertaken on the safeguarded route.</p>

Having regard to the commitments in my predecessor&#146;s letter of March 2003 and to the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review, I will make available to the GLA a grant under section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003 of &#163;1.7 billion specifically for the use of LUL for the payment of the Put Option Price.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_390"><a name="80206m0002.htm_para35"><a name="08020666000174">The timetable for payments under the Put Option Agreements means that a cash advance of &#163;1.7 billion is needed from the contingencies fund to make the grant payment. Parliamentary approval for this new expenditure, repaying the contingencies fund advance, will be sought at the earliest opportunity in a supplementary estimate for the Department for Transport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_391"><a name="80206m0002.htm_para36"><a name="08020666000175">The net effect of this grant payment and other changes to my Department&#146;s resource accounts made as part of the settlement with Transport for London will be &#163;2 billion, that will go through the Operating Cost Statement as capital grants. In addition to the sums associated with the Put Option, this funding provides:</p>

</ul><a name="80206m0002.htm_brev8"><a name="08020666000177"><ul><p class="tabletext">Additional grant payments to give TfL short term flexibility while the costs associated with Metronet&#146;s administration remain uncertain.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_392"><a name="80206m0002.htm_para37"><a name="08020666000178">The settlement gives London Underground the resources needed to manage Metronet&#146;s administration, and to support moving toward a more stable long term footing and to continue the work to maintain, renew and upgrade the Underground.</p>
