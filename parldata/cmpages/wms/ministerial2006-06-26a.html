Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs
(Bridget Prentice):</b> My right hon and noble Friend the
Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor (Lord Falconer of Thoroton) has
made the following written ministerial
statement:</p><a name="0606261000014"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;On
24 May this year, the Government published their draft Legal Services
Bill. The draft Bill is currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny
by Joint Committee chaired by Lord Hunt of Wirral. It develops
proposals set out in our White Paper &#147;The Future of Legal
Services: Putting Consumers First&#148; and it will put consumers at
the heart of a new framework for the regulation and delivery of legal
services.</p></ul><a name="0606261000015"><ul><p class="tabletext">One
of the core components of the draft Bill is the proposal to establish a
single, independent complaint handling body, the Office for Legal
Complaints. The OLC will deal with all consumer complaints about
regulated legal service providers. Our aim in establishing it is to
simplify the current arrangements for the handling of complaints,
increase the accountability and transparency of the complaints handling
system, improve the way in which complaints are handled and increase
consumer
confidence.</p></ul><a name="0606261000016"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
Government are aware that the creation of the OLC will have a
significant impact upon staff working in organisations within the
existing framework and it is in an effort to relieve staff uncertainty
that I would like to announce that the Government's preferred option
for the location of the proposed OLC is the West
Midlands.</p></ul><a name="0606261000017"><ul><p class="tabletext">This
announcement only relates to the area of the country in which the OLC
will be located. Further work will be needed to identify a specific
site, however Leamington Spa will not be considered. This is to ensure
that the OLC will be a new organisation independent of the existing
framework and can take advantage of a larger local labour market and
the benefits associated with moving to a new
site.</p></ul><a name="0606261000018"><ul><p class="tabletext">This
announcement will not pre-empt the parliamentary process but is being
made on the basis that this is the Government's preferred option
subject to the report of the Joint Committee and any subsequent
legislation which may be taken
forward.&#148;</p></ul><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="0606261000003">Environment,
