 The Government has received and welcomed the first report from the Justice Oversight Commissioner, the right hon. the the Lord Clyde, on the progress achieved in implementing the recommendations of the Criminal Justice Review in Northern Ireland. Consistent with his terms of reference, the report was submitted to the Attorney-General, Lord Filkin, Minister for the Northern Ireland Court Service, and myself in December.
<P>

<a name="40122m01.html_para0">Lord Clyde concludes that the degree of progress achieved so far in the process of implementation has been significant and impressive. He also acknowledges the real commitment of the criminal justice agencies in Northern Ireland to taking the recommendations forward. The Government warmly endorses these conclusions.
<P>

<a name="40122m01.html_para1">Copies of the Commissioner's report have been placed in the Library.

 On 10 September I announced that DTI's engineering inspectorate would be launching an investigation into the power cuts that affected large areas of south London and parts of Kent on 28 August, and the West Midlands on 5 September. In particular, investigators were to check for compliance with the Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations 2002. With the agreement of the Secretary of State for Transport, the investigation also

looked into the security of electricity supplies to Network Rail (Southern and Midlands Regions) and London Underground.
<P>

<a name="40122m01.html_para2">I also referred to the separate and independent Ofgem investigation, which is focusing on whether any of the companies involved have breached, are breaching or are likely to breach their statutory duties and/or licence conditions, and what if any enforcement action should be taken or penalty applied should a breach be found.
<P>

<a name="40122m01.html_para3">The engineering inspectorate investigation has now been concluded, and it has highlighted a number of issues in connection with the power cuts. The inspectors' conclusions and recommendations are being passed to the electricity companies concerned, so that they can take the necessary action to enhance the robustness of their networks, and so make such occurrences less likely. The engineering inspectorate will be holding discussions with the companies concerned and monitoring the action they take. It has powers to ensure compliance with any recommendations made.
<P>

<a name="40122m01.html_para4">The material the engineering inspectorate has gathered in connection with this investigation is commercially sensitive and its disclosure is restricted by the provisions of the Utilities Act 2000. Therefore the report will not be published. The recommendations and conclusions are being passed to the companies concerned on a confidential basis so that they can take the necessary action.
<P>

<a name="40122m01.html_para5">Once the Ofgem investigation has been concluded, it will be for the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority to make a decision as to whether there have been statutory or licence breaches, and what if any enforcement action should be taken or penalty should be imposed.
