               <b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Robert Neill):</b>
 Between 1997 and 2010, council tax bills doubled. One of the reasons for this was central Government imposed unfunded or under-funded burdens on local authorities.</p>

               <a name="1106201000010"> The coalition Government are committed to ensuring that the net additional costs of all such new burdens from central Government policy or initiatives are fully funded to help keep council tax down.</p>

It applies to all Departments and covers all local authorities, including police authorities, fire and rescue authorities and local precepting authorities.</p>
