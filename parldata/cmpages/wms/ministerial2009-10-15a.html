 The Government announced to the House of Commons in November 2006 that, as part of its work to improve the accountability of EU funds, HM Treasury would prepare an annual consolidated statement on the use of funds from the budget of the European Communities (EU funds) in the United Kingdom. In line with this commitment, we are today laying before Parliament the second of these statements for the year ending 31 March 2008, along with the Comptroller and Auditor General&#146;s (C&amp;AG) audit opinion and report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="91015m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09101539000015">Our aim is to strengthen the audit and Parliamentary scrutiny of the UK&#146;s use of EU funds, which will help detect any weaknesses in the UK&#146;s management of these funds so that they can be effectively and rapidly tackled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="91015m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09101539000016">The C&amp;AG&#146;s positive opinion on regularity clearly shows that the management of EU funds by UK authorities during the period covered by the statement has been sound, and that there has been no evidence of material irregularity in the payments made to beneficiaries. The Government welcome this finding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="91015m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09101539000017">The C&amp;AG&#146;S opinion is that this is true and fair except for debtor, creditor, cash balances and the treatment of provisions. It is clear therefore that more needs to be done to improve the consistency with which EU funds are accounted for and recorded across the UK. The Government continue to work to ensure these accounting issues are addressed. Being able to make this type of improvement was a key motivating factor behind producing this statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="91015m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09101539000018">The Government also hope this statement and the C&amp;AG&#146;s audit opinion will be helpful to the European Court of Auditors and the Commission when they are performing their own audits and controls; and that the statement and the C&amp;AG&#146;s audit opinion will encourage similar initiatives from other EU member states, whose contributions to improving financial reporting and management across the EU are also important.</p>

was essential for planning for the future, although emphasised that recovery is still fragile and full implementation of the current support measures must continue. Ministers then held a general discussion on the economic and financial situation, including an assessment of the outcomes of the Pittsburgh G20 summit. ECOFIN also held a first round of views on the Commission&#146;s draft legislation proposals for reform of financial supervision and regulation in the EU.</p>

 In December 2008, my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton), asked Bernard Gray to undertake a review to identify improvements that we could make in the acquisition of defence equipment. I am today publishing Mr. Gray&#146;s report and placing a copy in the Library of the House. I am very grateful to Bernard Gray for the effort he has devoted to this, the analysis he has produced, and for his support in developing with my Department proposals to implement many of his recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="91015m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09101539000026">This is not a new issue. As Bernard Gray&#146;s report highlights, all countries with significant defence capabilities face the same inherent complexities of military acquisition and&#151;over many decades&#151;have had to deal with cost  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="15 Oct 2009">

<notus-date day="15" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>15 Oct 2009 : Column 35WS</b><br>
and time over-runs. Indeed, as the report says, many of our allies are complimentary about the UK&#146;s efforts to drive reform in this area and model their systems on ours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="91015m0001.htm_para9"><a name="09101539000027">In the last 12 years, we have implemented a succession of initiatives to improve acquisition processes, including &#147;Smart Acquisition&#148;, the defence industrial strategy and more recently the defence acquisition change programme. These have had a significant impact on performance, as the National Audit Office has recognised in successive reports. At its best, my Department&#146;s project management is very good indeed. As the report observes, there are dedicated people at all levels in the Ministry of Defence, and among our suppliers, with a strong commitment to ensure the services have the equipment they need to deliver success on current operations and in the future. The system works best when the need is most urgent. We have successfully provided &#163;4.1 billion worth of equipment to theatre in Iraq and Afghanistan through urgent operational requirements since operations began. Our people, military and civilian, can be proud of that achievement. And the service chiefs have made clear that our service personnel are never asked to undertake missions unless we are fully satisfied that they have the right equipment to do the job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="91015m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09101539000028">However, the Gray report also brings out, through analysis of a sample of individual projects, the problems which still persist. These include not only the tendency of programmes to cost more and take longer to deliver than was initially estimated, but the further cost growth to which this gives rise and the pressure it places on limited resources&#151;even in a period when the defence budget as a whole has grown substantially in real terms. It points to remaining skills gaps and to shortcomings in the existing arrangements for managing the equipment programme. And it argues for regular defence reviews to provide a strategic context for decisions on the equipment programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="91015m0001.htm_para11"><a name="09101539000029">To some extent the difficulties we and others face in estimating the cost and time to deliver projects reflect the fact that much modern defence equipment is at the leading edge of technology and is constantly having to adapt to meet evolving military requirements. Providing our armed forces with the best involves a degree of technological risk and uncertainty. But there are steps we can and must take, in the light of the Gray report, to build on earlier reform and deliver a radical improvement in performance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="91015m0001.htm_para12"><a name="09101539000030">First, I have already announced that we will undertake a strategic defence review immediately after the general election. Preparatory work is already underway, and I intend to publish a Green Paper early in the new year. We will also examine legislative frameworks for implementing Bernard Gray&#146;s recommendation that a strategic defence review be conducted early in the term of each new Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="91015m0001.htm_para13"><a name="09101539000031">Secondly, we will work to adjust our equipment programme to bring it into balance with future requirements and the likely availability of resources, through the current planning round and in due course the strategic defence review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="91015m0001.htm_para14"><a name="09101539000032">Thirdly, we will plan equipment expenditure to a longer time frame, with a 10-year indicative planning horizon for equipment spending agreed with the Treasury,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="15 Oct 2009">

<notus-date day="15" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>15 Oct 2009 : Column 36WS</b><br>
and will increase transparency by publishing that planning horizon and an annual assessment of the affordability of our programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="91015m0001.htm_para15"><a name="09101539000033">Fourthly, we have already strengthened board-level governance within the Ministry of Defence by establishing a new sub-committee of the defence board, as recommended by Mr. Gray, chaired by the permanent secretary as accounting officer and charged with determining, for agreement by the board and Ministers, an equipment plan that is aligned with strategy, affordable and realistic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="91015m0001.htm_para16"><a name="09101539000034">Fifthly, we will improve the way we cost projects in the equipment plan, using better and more sophisticated techniques applied more consistently, and ensuring that investment decisions are based on the most reliable available forecasts. We will also improve the management of risk across the programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="91015m0001.htm_para17"><a name="09101539000035">Sixthly, we will introduce stronger controls over the entry of new projects into the equipment programme, and over changes in performance, cost and timing of individual projects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="91015m0001.htm_para18"><a name="09101539000036">Seventhly, we will sharpen the business relationship between Ministry of Defence head office, the Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S) organisation, and the service commands, by further clarifying roles and responsibilities, and by establishing new arrangements to provide greater visibility of project management costs in DE&amp;S to the Capability Sponsor in head office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="91015m0001.htm_para19"><a name="09101539000037">Finally, we will accelerate the improvement of key skills (including in cost forecasting and programme management) in DE&amp;S and the Ministry of Defence head office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="91015m0001.htm_para20"><a name="09101539000038">All of these changes are consistent with Bernard Gray&#146;s main recommendations. I do not intend to take up his suggestion to establish DE&amp;S as a Government-owned, contractor-operated entity, to put it more at arm&#146;s length from the rest of the Ministry of Defence. The Government have thought about this carefully, but we are not convinced that such a change would ultimately lead to better outcomes for the armed forces or defence generally. Having the DE&amp;S as fully part of defence ensures a close working relationship with the military. Equipment acquisition is core business for my Department, and we have to get it right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="91015m0001.htm_para21"><a name="09101539000039">Based on these proposals, I intend to publish a wider, more detailed strategy for acquisition reform in the new year, to contribute to work on the strategic defence review. I am delighted that Bernard Gray has agreed to work with us on this.</p>

He then gave details of his three step transitional proposal. This involves alleviations for third country transfer passengers, potentially from next April, and then introduction of technological checks by 2012  <br>

in large airports and by 2014 for smaller airports. This was the first opportunity for EU Transport Ministers to collectively consider the Commissioner&#146;s proposal. I was one of many Ministers strongly supporting an extension of the existing liquids restrictions after April 2010, until such a time as technological solutions which provide robust detection performance and a better passenger experience are ready for deployment. We are keen to move from the current restriction-based system to one using new screening technologies but only when we are convinced that they can meet the challenge of ensuring the utmost levels of security for passengers, while striving to improve their air travel experience. Aviation security experts will now consider the detail of the Commission proposal, which will then be subject to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny (by the European Parliament). DfT Ministers will be writing to the Lords and Commons Scrutiny Committees shortly.</p>

They declared that the EGNOS (European geostationary navigation overlay system) signal, which improves the accuracy of GPS, had officially started operations on 1 October. On Galileo, the Commission said that it plans to have all the procurement contracts with suppliers let by the end of 2010, with the first two being let by the end of 2009. It is expected that the first satellite launches will take place in 2012 and that a Galileo service would be available from 2013. The UK is continuing to work with the presidency, the Commission and other member states to progress the Galileo programme and ensure that we remain focussed on meeting this timetable.</p>
