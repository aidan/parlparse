 I am today publishing "National Service Framework for Renal Services, Part One: Dialysis and Transplantation".
<P>

<a name="40114m01.html_para0">The national service framework (NSF) programme is a major part of our agenda to tackle health inequalities and to drive up standards across the National Health Service. Part one of this NSF covers dialysis and transplantation; and sets standards and identifies markers of good practice that will help the NHS, and its partners, to manage the demand for renal services, increase fairness of access, and improve choice and quality in dialysis and kidney transplantation.
<P>

<a name="40114m01.html_para1">This is an important part of our modernisation programme to improve renal dialysis and transplantation services over the next 10 years. The framework sets out five quality standards to provide a flexible, responsive service that provides patients with better access and choice. It identifies 30 markers of good practice drawn from national and international evidence. This NSF builds on the programme of modernisation set out in the NHS Plan and the national service frameworks for diabetes, coronary heart disease, older people, and children. It reflects the principles of empowering patients and frontline staff contained in the NHS Plan and "Shifting the Balance of Power", and of extending patient choice as set out in "Building on the Best: Choice, Responsiveness and Equity in the NHS" (Cm 6079).
<P>

<a name="40114m01.html_para2">This NSF complements "Saving Lives, Valuing Donors&#151;A Transplant Framework for England" and supports our aim to increase the number of kidneys available for transplantation.
<P>

<a name="40114m01.html_para3">The five NSF standards for renal services set out a vision of a service that is equitable and integrated, and that provides people with the support they need to make individual choices and to manage their own condition.
<P>

<a name="40114m01.html_para4">The NSF for renal services sets out five steps for the NHS to take by 2006:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>use national data to support planning and to identify local priorities, including the needs of black and minority ethnic groups;

 I am announcing today that I have commissioned an end-to-end review of the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) and its business processes, including its role in the provision of information technology and communications services to the police.
<P>

<a name="40114m01.html_para10">PITO is a non-departmental public body established as a body corporate under the Police Act of 1997. PITO was to have been reviewed under the now superseded quinquennial arrangements. We now intend that the review will address itself primarily to an examination of how PITO delivers its organisational objectives of ICT provision to the police. Within that context the review will also examine the current structure of PITO, to determine whether it is appropriate to deliver the best possible provision of ICT to the police service and the criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="40114m01.html_para11">The provision of high quality information and communications technology to the police and the criminal justice system is vital, not only to manage 



<P>
<P>14 Jan 2004 : Column 31WS<P>
efficiency throughout the system, but also to ensure officers are better equipped to deliver front-line policing. PITO has a key role to play and the purpose of this review is to look at how well its current structure supports that objective and to make recommendations for changes if necessary.
<P>

<a name="40114m01.html_para12">I have asked Robert McFarland to lead the review. He has previous experience of public sector reviews, having served on the review of the Crown Prosecution Service in 1998, and having led the review of the Forensic Science Service in 2002&#150;03.

<P>
<a name="40114m01.html_spmin4"><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department   (Paul Goggins): </B> 
 I am today announcing a change to the home detention curfew scheme (HDC).
<P>

<a name="40114m01.html_para14">HDC has been in operation since 1999. It provides an effective and measured transition for offenders moving from custody into the community. Eligible prisoners are subject to a careful risk assessment before any decision is taken to grant them early release. Previous amendments to the scheme have balanced extensions to the period of early release with restrictions designed to maintain public confidence in the scheme as a whole. In April 2003 the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State announced an extension of HDC to a maximum of four and a half months. The extension was accompanied by the introduction of a presumption against release for prisoners convicted of certain serious offences&#151;those which the Government consider cause the public particular concern.
<P>

<a name="40114m01.html_para15">Prisoners released under the HDC scheme serve the remainder of their custody period at home under electronic curfew, usually from 7pm to 7am. At present there are approximately 3,700 prisoners on electronic tag. The scheme is kept under constant review.
<P>

<a name="40114m01.html_para16">Public confidence in the scheme is essential. It is for this reason that the Home Secretary has already made it clear that offenders serving sentences for certain current offences and prisoners with any history of sexual offending must be considered unsuitable for release on HDC unless exceptional circumstances exist. This presumption against HDC will continue to apply.
<P>

<a name="40114m01.html_para17">A recent case has highlighted the fact that, in addition, there will be exceptional cases where an offender may be considered unsuitable for HDC even though he or she has not committed one of the offences which give rise to the presumption, if to grant HDC would undermine public confidence in the scheme. This will depend on the circumstances of the particular case.




<P>
<P>14 Jan 2004 : Column 32WS<P>

<P>

<a name="40114m01.html_para18">The Home Secretary has decided that such exceptional cases should be referred to the Chief Executive of the National Offender Management Service who will take the decision whether or not to grant HDC.

<P>
<a name="40114m02.html_spmin0"><B>The Minister for Housing and Planning   (Keith Hill): </B> 
 The Government have always been clear that county councils and other authorities with strategic planning expertise would play a key part in preparing draft revisions of regional spatial strategies and in their implementation. Draft planning policy statement 11, which we published for consultation in October, sets out in some detail how the county councils and these other authorities can assist the regional planning body, including exercising functions on behalf of that body within a partnership arrangement.
<P>

<a name="40114m02.html_para0">The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill already encourages regional planning bodies to enter into arrangements with county councils and these other authorities but it does not require them to do so. The Local Government Association, the County Councils Network and others have expressed concern that, without a guarantee of involvement for county councils on the face of the Bill, their role could be marginalised under the new arrangements.
<P>

<a name="40114m02.html_para1">I have discussed with the Association and the County Councils Network how we might secure in legislation our policy intention for the future role of county councils without creating unnecessary bureaucracy or providing opportunities for unreasonable delay or obstruction. I am pleased to announce to the House that, as a result of these discussions, we will be tabling an amendment to the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill that is currently in the House of Lords. Whether or not the Bill is amended is ultimately a matter for that House to decide.
<P>

<a name="40114m02.html_para2">This amendment would require regional planning bodies to seek advice on the preparation, review and monitoring of the implementation of regional spatial strategies from county councils and other authorities with strategic planning expertise. They would in turn be under an obligation to provide advice, providing that their delivery of services was affected in some way. I 



<P>
<P>14 Jan 2004 : Column 33WS<P>
would also amend our draft planning policy statement 11 on regional planning to explain in more detail how this would work in practice.
<P>

<a name="40114m02.html_para3">The amendment would also allow regional planning bodies to enter into arrangements with counties, other authorities with strategic planning expertise and district councils to carry out functions on behalf of the regional planning body.
<P>

<a name="40114m02.html_para4">I am delighted that, in the light of this proposal, the Local Government Association and the County Councils Network have agreed to give their full support to making the new regional planning arrangements a success. I look forward to our promoting together a system that I believe will deliver better strategic plans for our regions in the years ahead.
