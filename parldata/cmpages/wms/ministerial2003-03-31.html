 I am today announcing my decision on recommendations contained in the O'Hare report on the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development's arrangements for the provision of agri-food education and R&D in Northern Ireland. I first announced my proposals on 25 November 2002, at which time I issued the proposals for public consultation. Having taken account of this consultation, I am now confirming the final decisions.

<P>31 Mar 2003 : Column 36WS<P>

<P>

<a name="30331m01.html_para10">Full legal protection will apply to terms and conditions of any staff who transfer to the chosen university. Full consultation with unions, staff and the receiving university will be an integral part of the process.

<a name="30331m01.html_para11">Rationalisation of the Three DARD Colleges into a Single College on three sites
<P>

<a name="30331m01.html_para12">The three DARD Colleges will be combined to form a single college within DARD leading to greater efficiency in service delivery. The single DARD college, under a single Principal, will have a separate business plan, targets and budget and will produce separate accounts.
<P>

<a name="30331m01.html_para13">It will continue its advisory, teaching and lifelong learning provision.
<P>

<a name="30331m01.html_para14">A Management Committee will be appointed with external representation. Representatives will be chosen according to pre-set criteria.
<P>

<a name="30331m01.html_para15">In addition, the single college will have overall responsibility for the delivery of knowledge and technology transfer and adoption and will liaise closely with the new NDPB, the retained Science Service, universities, research institutes and other providers to ensure cohesive and comprehensive delivery.
<P>

<P>

<a name="30331m01.html_para18">A new NDPB will be set up to deliver R&D and analytical and diagnostic services currently provided by DARD Science Service.

<P>

<a name="30331m01.html_para19">A board will be appointed to manage the new NDPB. Appointments will be made using a transparent process and according to pre-set criteria. The NDPB will continue to provide R&D services for other Government Departments under suitable contractual arrangements.

cohesive and comprehensive delivery, irrespective of the delivery location. I recognise the concerns expressed in the consultation exercise that the continuation of comprehensive technology transfer provision is essential to the future development of the agri-food industry.

<P>

<a name="30331m01.html_para27">Introduction of a Competitive Bidding process for DARD funded R&D

However, an R&D programme of sufficient size and quality will be core-funded at the NDPB to ensure that the required skills base is maintained. Core funding will also be provided for the analytical, diagnostic and surveillance functions carried out by the NDPB.

<a name="30331m01.html_spmin1"><B>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland   (Mr. Paul Murphy): </B> 
 The report on the Review of the Criminal Justice System in Northern Ireland, which flowed from the Belfast agreement, recommended in the area of youth justice that the Juvenile Justice Board, a statutory non-departmental public body with responsibility for the provision of youth justice services in custodial and community settings, should be replaced by a next steps agency. This statement announces the creation of that agency within the Northern Ireland Office, to be known as the Youth Justice Agency, on 1 April 2003.
<P>

<a name="30331m01.html_para31">A full consultation exercise was undertaken in relation to all the recommendations in the Criminal Justice Review. There was broad support for the creation of an agency.
<P>

<a name="30331m01.html_para32">The agency will play a central and leading role in addressing youth crime in Northern Ireland, by facilitating the development of a strong professional management team responsible for the provision of youth justice services and an increased emphasis on accountability, transparency and effective service delivery.
<P>

<a name="30331m01.html_para33">The agency will also implement a range of new diversionary measures for dealing with child offenders, including youth conferencing arrangements based on restorative justice principles, new community orders and bail support schemes. The agency will build on partnerships with others that already exist in helping young people to avoid crime.
<P>

<a name="30331m01.html_para34">In taking these developments forward, the agency will provide the appropriate structures, supported by challenging targets and key performance indicators, to ensure that the best value and outcomes are obtained from the substantial investment being made in youth justice provision in Northern Ireland.




<P>
<P>31 Mar 2003 : Column 38WS<P>

<P>

<a name="30331m01.html_para35">The agency will concentrate on service delivery. The continuing task of developing policy and monitoring the agency's performance against targets will be undertaken by a small unit within the core Department.
<P>

<a name="30331m01.html_para36">The agency's Framework Document and Corporate and Business Plan have been published and are now available in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.

 Legislation will be introduced in the Finance Bill 2003, to take effect from 1 April 2003, which will increase the standard rate of landfill tax from &#163;13 per tonne to &#163;14 per tonne. The increase is part of a series of &#163;1 per tonne escalator increases, announced in the Budget 1999. These increases have been publicised in the landfill public notice (LFT1). HM Customs and Excise is writing to all landfill operators registered for the tax to confirm the date of the change.

<P>
<a name="30331m01.html_spmin3"><B>The Minister for Energy and Construction   (Mr. Brian Wilson): </B> 
 Following detailed analysis of a number of potential locations, I am able to announce that the Government have decided on West Cumbria as its preferred location for the head office of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.
<P>

<a name="30331m01.html_para38">The Government believe that&#151;while a number of other locations could offer similar benefits in terms of the operational needs of the NDA&#151;the NDA will bring significant benefits to the community of West Cumbria by providing a catalyst for economic growth and diversification. These benefits are particularly important to a community that has suffered significantly from economic setbacks and recent job losses. West Cumbria is already a high priority area for economic regeneration and has a long history of engagement in the nuclear business.
<P>

<a name="30331m01.html_para39">The decision is the outcome of a two-stage assessment process. The first stage conducted by the Department of Trade and Industry compared eight locations throughout the UK and concluded that the North West was the region of choice.
<P>

<a name="30331m01.html_para40">The second stage, conducted by the North West Development Agency, compared two areas within the region&#151;West Cumbria and the area west of Manchester. The results showed that while there were some differences in the two locations, both locations would deliver against the operational needs of the NDA. Hence, their respective needs for investment and economic regeneration became the deciding factor and on this basis I have chosen West Cumbria.




<P>
<P>31 Mar 2003 : Column 39WS<P>

<P>

<a name="30331m01.html_para41">Today's decision clearly demonstrates the Government's commitment (made in the White Paper on Managing the Nuclear Legacy) to support the communities in which the NDA will operate and in particular, to generate new growth and opportunities in areas such as West Cumbria.

<a name="30331m02.html_spmin0"><B>The Minister of State, Department of Health   (Jacqui Smith): </B> 
 The Department's Public Service Agreement (PSA), published July 2002, included a commitment to review the target on the education of children in care, in light of the Social Exclusion Unit (SEU) project on that subject. Work on the SEU project is nearing completion, and I am now in a position to announce the new target, which is to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Improve life chances for children, including by substantially narrowing the gap between the educational attainment and participation of children in care and that of their peers by 2006.
This target will have been achieved if, by 2006:
<P>
<BR>
outcomes for 11 year olds in English and maths are at least 60 percent as good as those of their peers;
<P>
<BR>
the proportion who become disengaged from education is reduced, so that no more than 10 per cent reach school leaving age without having sat a General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) equivalent exam; and
<P>
<BR>
the proportion of those aged 16 who get qualifications equivalent to GCSEs graded A*-C has risen on average by 4 percentage points each year since 2002; and in all authorities at least 15 per cent. of young people in care achieve this level of qualifications.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30331m02.html_para0">The elements of the PSA target relating to the level of education, training and employment outcomes for care leavers aged 19, the proportion of children in care who are cautioned or convicted, and the under-18 conception rate, remain unchanged.
<P>

<a name="30331m02.html_para1">In developing the target I have been keen to encourage action to support attainment by all children in care. This includes younger children, those who are able and have the potential to achieve at a high level, and those with difficulties who need support to remain engaged with education at all.
<P>

<a name="30331m02.html_para2">I therefore welcome the SEU's proposal that as part of the existing planning process, individual education targets should be set for all children in care and local authorities should monitor both the appropriateness and the achievement of these targets. We will be consulting stakeholders on how best to achieve this.
<P>

<a name="30331m02.html_para3">In order that the target reflects the influence of the care system on attainment, it will apply only to children who have been in care for one year or more. Nonetheless, I believe that promoting the attainment of children who spend a shorter time in care is important. I have therefore agreed with My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills that he will put in place arrangements to analyse data from the pupil level annual school census, in order to improve our understanding of outcomes for those young people who have spent any time in care. The results of this analysis will be used to inform the development of future policy.

 RPG13 sets out the spatial development strategy that encompasses proposals for the development of the Region's economy, housing and transport infrastructure, and other land uses. Within the terms of the strategy, priority is to be given to sustainable development and investment within the North West Metropolitan Area (especially the Regional Poles of Manchester/Salford and Liverpool), together with defined Regeneration Priority Areas. RPG13 also sets out proposals for the conservation, management and enhancement of the Region's natural and cultural environment.
<P>

<a name="30331m02.html_para5">I am pleased that much of the vision, objectives and core strategy of RPG13 carries forward to a great extent what was proposed in the original draft RPG prepared by the North West Regional Assembly (NWRA). RPG13 reflects the effective working that was achieved between the NWRA, local authorities and other stakeholders, all of which have made valuable contributions to refine and enhance the original draft guidance through public consultation. It builds on the inclusive process for preparing RPG that the Government have put in place.

 The Government is today publishing as CM 5793 a draft Housing Bill for consultation. This aims to tackle some of the most pressing difficulties in private sector housing. The draft Bill will ensure action against unacceptably low housing standards, the impact bad landlords can have on some local communities and the stress in buying and selling a home. These proposals are part of our drive to deliver sustainable communities as set out in the Deputy Prime Minister's long-term action programme <i>"Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future"</i> published in February this year.
<P>

<a name="30331m02.html_para7">The draft Bill sets out specific legislation in five main areas:

<BR>
improving the controls on Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs), including a mandatory national licensing scheme, to tackle poor physical and management standards;
<P>

giving local authorities powers to license all landlords in areas of low housing demand or similar areas where the growth and poor management of the private rented sector frustrates efforts to create sustainable communities;
<P>
<BR>
requiring anyone marketing a home to assemble a home information pack (HIP), so that the information needed by buyers and sellers is available when the property is marketed, and abortive costs on the buyer are reduced;
<P>
<BR>
modernising the Right to Buy scheme by tackling profiteering and emphasising purchasers' responsibilities so that it contributes more effectively to the supply of affordable housing.

</FONT></UL>
<a name="30331m02.html_para8">There are additionally clauses introducing a new office of Social Housing Ombudsman for Wales to investigate complaints against registered social landlords in Wales.

<P>

<a name="30331m02.html_para9">The consultation period will run until 9 June. The draft Bill, together with the explanatory notes, Regulatory Impact Assessments and issues for consultation, has been published as a Command Paper and will also be available on the website for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.

<P>
<a name="30331m02.html_spmin3"><B>The Secretary of State for the Home Department   (Mr. David Blunkett): </B> 
 I am today, together with US Attorney General John Ashcroft, signing a new bilateral extradition treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States of America.
<P>

<a name="30331m02.html_para11">The current UK-USA extradition treaty was agreed in 1972 and ratified in 1976 with supplementary provisions from 1986. It is outdated and can be significantly improved.
<P>

<a name="30331m02.html_para12">The new treaty reflects best modern practice in extradition. In particular, it provides that any crime attracting a maximum sentence of 12 months' imprisonment or more in both the requesting and the requested state is extraditable rather than containing a list of offences which are extraditable, as the present treaty does. The advantage of that is that it encompasses offences, such as computer related crime, which did not exist when the 1972 treaty was drawn up.




<P>
<P>31 Mar 2003 : Column 42WS<P>

<P>

<a name="30331m02.html_para13">The new treaty brings the evidential rules for requests from the United States into line with those for European countries and simplifies the procedures for the authentication of documents.
<P>

<a name="30331m02.html_para14">As with the existing treaty, the new treaty provides that in death penalty cases, extradition may be refused unless an assurance has been received that no death sentence will be carried out.
<P>

<a name="30331m02.html_para15">The new treaty also maintains the present position that political motivation cannot be used to block extradition in the case of terrorist or other violent crimes. The treaty stipulates that neither nationality nor statutes of limitations will be a bar to extradition. The treaty also provides the standard speciality protection against onward extradition or surrender, and we have confirmed our understanding that this covers surrender to the International Criminal Court.
<P>

<a name="30331m02.html_para16">Before the treaty can come into force it needs to be ratified by the United States Senate. It will be brought into force in the United Kingdom by Order in Council. Such an order will be made under the existing Extradition Act 1989 and will carry over when the Extradition Bill, which is currently before Parliament, comes into force. At that point the United States, like all of our extradition partners, will benefit from the new streamlined extradition procedures which the Bill seeks to put in place.
<P>

<a name="30331m02.html_para17">The United States is one of our key extradition partners and there is a significant volume of extradition business between the two countries. It is therefore important that our bilateral extradition treaty should be as effective as possible. I am pleased that it has been possible to reach agreement on the new treaty and that I have the opportunity in person to affirm our commitment to the closest possible co-operation in the fight against terrorism and other serious crime.

Given the importance the UK attaches to stability and peace in the Mano River region, we intend to open a one-person office in Monrovia later this year, and upgrade our office in Conakry to an Embassy.

<a name="30331m04.html_spmin0"><B>The Minister for Rural Affairs and Urban Quality of Life   (Alun Michael): </B> 
 Following the Better Quality Service (BQS) review of the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS), published in November 2000, Ministers announced that they would be looking carefully at how BCMS could best work with the paying agencies in England, Scotland and Wales, to ensure effective interfaces with each other and with their farming customers. The 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease epidemic deferred action.
<P>

<a name="30331m04.html_para0">Since then we have learnt lessons from the first year of operating the bovine premium schemes on the basis of cross-checks by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) and the other GB paying agencies with the BCMS Cattle Tracing System database. These cross-checks threw up a significant level of inconsistencies which adversely affected payment of premium to a large number of farmer customers. This experience highlighted the need for close working between the GB paying agencies and 



<P>
<P>31 Mar 2003 : Column 48WS<P>
BCMS and raised the question whether potential synergies between BCMS and RPA systems are being fully exploited to provide a better service to all those who use the database.
<P>

<a name="30331m04.html_para1">Having examined the options we concluded that there are strong strategic and organisational advantages for Defra's customers in having similar systems run under single management and providing a single point of customer contact through the merger of RPA and BCMS as from 1 April 2003. This would, in turn, ensure that BCMS is in a good position to meet the requirements of all its GB stakeholders. At the same time merger will help both organisations meet their respective business objectives by drawing on each others skills and experiences in improving services and efficiency through investment in significant e-government initiatives. Full realisation of these benefits however, will require a high degree of integration and consolidation over time.
<P>

<a name="30331m04.html_para2">This outcome is consistent with the findings from the BQS review which concluded that BCMS: should assume Agency status; should be retained within the public sector; should achieve efficiency gains through internal restructuring; and should remain on the Workington site.
