<a name="40224m01.html_para2">The change in the resource element of the DEL arises from transfers of &#163;1,200,000 and &#163;250,000 to the Scottish Executive and National Assembly for Wales respectively. This transfer is required to fund functions transferred from the Forestry Commission Westminster Vote (which covers activities in England and those functions which it carries out on a GB-wide basis), to Forestry Commission Scotland and Wales following the recommendations of the Forestry Devolution Review.

<a name="40224m01.html_spmin2"><B>The Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality   (Alun Michael): </B> 
 In my statement of 11 November 2003 on the rural delivery review, I accepted Lord Haskins' broad recommendation to bring together elements of the work done by English Nature, the Countryside Agency and Defra's rural development service into an integrated agency. It is important to me that the integrated agency should have a strong and authoritative voice commanding respect both within and outside Government. It is equally important that the advice I receive from the integrated agency is not only independent, but is seen to be independent. I have therefore decided that this new agency will be established as an executive non-departmental public body.

The clause requires that in doing so, planning authorities must have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State. PPS1 will be a key document underpinning this requirement.
<P>

<a name="40224m02.html_para7">PPS1 is based on three themes:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Planning for sustainable communities and sustainable development;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The new approach to planning we are promoting as part of planning culture change (the spatial planning approach); and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Community involvement in planning.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40224m02.html_para8"><i>Sustainable development</i>
<P>

<a name="40224m02.html_para9">Our legislation will make contributing to the achievement of sustainable development the key purpose of the planning system. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister should expect planning policies to pursue proactively the four aims of sustainable development&#151;economic development; social inclusion; environmental protection; and prudent use of natural resources&#151;in an integrated way, in line with the Government's overall strategy for sustainable development.
<P>

<a name="40224m02.html_para10"><i>Spatial Planning</i>
<P>

<a name="40224m02.html_para11">The new regional and local plans provided for in the Bill are based on the philosophy of spatial planning. Spatial planning goes beyond traditional land use planning to bring together and integrate policies for the development and use of land with other policies and programmes which influence the nature of places and how they function.




<P>
<P>24 Feb 2004 : Column 15WS<P>

<P>

<a name="40224m02.html_para12">PPS1 sets out the spatial planning approach that will be adopted in the new planning system. These planning tools will reflect real geographies and real community issues, and are thus a flexible approach to planning and sustainable development.
<P>

<a name="40224m02.html_para13"><i>Community involvement</i>
<P>

<a name="40224m02.html_para14">Effective community involvement is a vital element in delivering sustainable communities. Our aim should be to develop effective community involvement processes which enable a better understanding of the sometimes difficult choices which have to be made in considering development and more ownership of the accompanying decisions.
<P>

<a name="40224m02.html_para15">We need of course to strike a balance between promoting effective community involvement without allowing the system to be bogged down by endless consultation exercises. I want the reformed system to emphasise community involvement as a way of helping resolve problems early in the process and secure ownership, so that when plans and proposals are put forward, there are fewer objections.
<P>

<a name="40224m02.html_para16">The paper makes clear that community involvement should be based on a real understanding of the community's needs, should be fit for purpose, and should be "front loaded" ie involvement early in the process.
<P>

<a name="40224m02.html_para17">PPS1 can only set out the key policy principles for community involvement in planning. To put these in context, the community involvement paper sets out our general philosophy on community involvement in planning, and puts this in the broader context of policy.
<P>

<a name="40224m02.html_para18">Copies of the two documents will be available in the Libraries of the House.

 The Government have today published a consultation paper setting out its proposals for draft Regulations under section 66 of the Local Government Act 2000. These proposals will make provision for local government monitoring officers in England, in cases where ethical standards officers of the Standards Board for England deem it appropriate, to investigate allegations that local authority members have breached their code of conduct. The Government are consulting on this issue over the next three months, and at the same time the Standards Board for England is consulting on draft guidance for monitoring officers on how they can best undertake their duties under the proposed Regulations.
<P>

<a name="40224m02.html_para19">We need to ensure the highest possible ethical standards in local government. But we need a system, which is efficient and workable. This approach is a sensible, effective and proportionate way of handling allegations of misconduct at a local level.

<P>
<a name="40224m04.html_spmin0"><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister   (Yvette Cooper): </B> 
 On Friday the Government tabled amendments to the Housing Bill, which is currently being considered by the House in Committee. These amendments meet a number of the recommendations of the Park Homes Working Party and aim to deal with some of the key concerns about the existing legislation.
<P>

<a name="40224m04.html_para0">They amend the Mobile Homes Act 1983 to require a written statement of terms to be given to a prospective occupier 28 days before the agreement to station a park home on a site is entered into. At present Written statements may be given up to three months after the agreement has commenced.
<P>

<a name="40224m04.html_para1">In the event of the owner failing to produce the written statement in advance, any express terms contained in the agreement will not be enforceable at the suit of the owner. This is to encourage the site owner to produce the written statement in advance, and is not likely to hold up the process of a sale.
<P>

<a name="40224m04.html_para2">The amendments create a power by which the Secretary of State (in Wales the National Assembly for Wales) can add additional terms to be implied into the agreement, and repeal and vary those in the Mobile Homes Act 1983. This power might be used, for example, to give an occupier the right to quiet enjoyment of their home, whereas currently an occupier would have to go to court to have this term implied into their agreement.
<P>

<a name="40224m04.html_para3">Because existing agreements are of infinite duration, we need to be able to amend the statutory implied terms for existing agreements, where these are clearly inadequate. Provision has therefore been made for the first exercise of the power to have retrospective effect, i.e. to allow amendment of the implied terms operating as part of existing agreements. Future exercises of the power will be non-retrospective. Any order made under the power is subject to affirmative resolution by both Houses of Parliament, and the clause contains a consultation requirement for the Secretary of State to consult interested parties as to the proposed amendments. Representatives of both site owners and occupiers will therefore be consulted about the terms of any order to be made.
<P>

<a name="40224m04.html_para4">Site owners will in future have a time limit of 28 days for giving or withholding approval of a prospective purchaser. By the end of this time limit a decision must have been given in writing. If not, the occupier can apply to the court for an order giving approval to that purchaser, which if given would involve the site owner in costs.




<P>
<P>24 Feb 2004 : Column 20WS<P>

<P>

<a name="40224m04.html_para5">The age of a home is removed as a relevant criterion for ending an agreement. Currently a site owner may terminate an agreement on grounds of 'age and condition' of the unit. The amendment will remove the reference to age from the 1983 Act, as the age of a unit is irrelevant. The amendment will enable courts to consider the condition of the unit and to allow time for appropriate repairs (if reasonably practicable).
<P>

<a name="40224m04.html_para6">The amendments increase the protection of occupiers of park homes against harassment and illegal eviction by amending the Caravan Sites Act 1968 to mirror the wording in the Protection from Eviction Act 1977, which governs the protection given to occupiers of conventional housing against eviction and harassment. The wording for the existing offence for a site owner doing "acts calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort" of the occupier which cause him to abandon his home, has been relaxed to "acts likely to interfere" with such peace or comfort, which is obviously an easier test to satisfy. A new offence has been introduced which does not require specific intent by a site owner or his agent to cause an occupier to abandon his home. This will increase the protection available to occupiers and the chances of successful prosecutions.
<P>

<a name="40224m04.html_para7">The remaining recommendations of the Working Party need further work to ensure that when fully implemented they will work effectively in practice. To that end, we have recently commissioned consultants to develop proposals on the implementation of the recommendations in relation to site licensing.

<a name="40224m07.html_spmin1"><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs   (Mr. David Lammy): </B> 
 The Government has today published its response to the Joint Committee on the Draft Mental Incapacity Bill report which was published on 17 November 2003 (HL189&#150;1 and HC 1083&#150;1). Copies of the response have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses (Command Paper 6121).
<P>

<a name="40224m07.html_para6">The Government would like to thank the Committee for publishing such a comprehensive report in a short period of time, and in obtaining such a wide range of evidence on the Bill. We are pleased that the Committee 



<P>
<P>24 Feb 2004 : Column 35WS<P>
agrees this new statutory framework is needed and that it endorses the principles and general direction of the draft Bill.
<P>

<a name="40224m07.html_para7">The Committee suggested that the Bill, being about how to maximise mental capacity, should be renamed the Mental Capacity Bill and we agree with this recommendation.
<P>

<a name="40224m07.html_para8">The Bill will reform the law in order to improve and clarify the decision making process for those aged 16 and over who are unable to make decisions for themselves. It will also offer, to people who have capacity, the choice to decide how they are cared for in the future by introducing new ways to plan ahead for a time when they might lose capacity.
<P>

<a name="40224m07.html_para9">Over 2 million adults in England and Wales are currently affected by a lack of capacity. Many more care for someone who may need help with decision making. With increasing ageing most of us will face the risk of losing mental capacity at some point in our lives. The Bill therefore has the potential to help a high proportion of the population.
<P>

<a name="40224m07.html_para10">The Department of Constitutional Affairs is working closely with the Department of Health on a revised Bill. We plan to introduce the revised Bill later in this Parliamentary session. We will also have a draft outline of the codes of practice for Parliament to see at Committee stage.
