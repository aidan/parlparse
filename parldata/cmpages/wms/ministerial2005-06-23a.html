 The Chief of the Defence Staff and I have today signed an agreement with the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) setting out measures to prevent and deal with sexual harassment in the armed forces.

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50623m02.html_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence  (Mr. Adam Ingram): </b> 
 In line with our policy of employing reservists as an integral component of the armed forces, we shall shortly begin mobilising approximately 600 of them to replace existing reservists serving in support of our operations in Iraq (Op TELIC).






<br>&nbsp;<br>23 Jun 2005 : Column 44WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m02.html_para0"><a name="stpa_24">Reservists currently deployed in Iraq carry out a range of activities including medical support, force protection duties and providing individual reinforcements to units. We anticipate that most of these tasks will continue. The callout will, however, involve fewer Reservists than our previous callout for Op TELIC announced in December 2004 (which involved 900 Reservists), due to a reduced number of individual reinforcements to regular units, and the replacement of the reserve field hospital with a regular one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m02.html_para1"><a name="stpa_25">We plan to issue the callout notices for Reservists in phases and aim to give individuals 28 days notice of call-up (other than for those who may volunteer to be mobilised at shorter notice). As is customary, to ensure that we successfully mobilise the required number, we will need to issue a greater number of callout notices than the actual requirement. So, while this announcement calls for the mobilisation of about 600 reservists, it is by no means certain that all 600 will be deployed in Iraq.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m02.html_para2"><a name="stpa_26">Mobilisation will be followed by a period of individual, pre-deployment and collective training, integration into receiving units, and then a short period of pre-deployment leave. Deployment to theatre will begin in mid-October. The majority of those called out can expect a deployed tour of six months and a total period of mobilisation, including post-tour leave, of about 10 months, though for a few it may be slightly longer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m02.html_para3"><a name="stpa_27">I would emphasise that this callout is part of our routine management of UK forces deployed on Op TELIC. We continue to consider, with our partners in the multinational force, the levels and dispositions of forces required in Iraq in the months ahead, to build the capability and capacity of the Iraqi Security Forces and support the transitional Government of Iraq through the process leading to the creation of a new constitution and full democratic elections in December 2005.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m02.html_para4"><a name="stpa_28">The next roulement of regular UK forces in Iraq is due to take place during October and November this year. We will make a further announcement covering this roulement once the details have been finalised.

 Following the annual review, the Deputy Prime Minister will today lay regulations to update the home loss payment thresholds in section 30 of the Land Compensation Act 1973 (as amended). Home loss payments are paid at a rate of 10 per cent. of the market value to owner-occupiers who are displaced from their homes as a result of compulsory purchase or certain housing orders. These are subject to maximum and minimum payments. Tenants receive a flat rate equal to the minimum payment to owner-occupiers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m02.html_para23"><a name="stpa_47">With effect from 1 September 2005, the maximum payment to owner-occupiers displaced from their home will be increased from &#163;34,000 to &#163;38,000 and the minimum payment will be increased from &#163;3,400 to &#163;3,800. The flat-rate will be increased from &#163;3,400 to &#163;3,800.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m02.html_para24"><a name="stpa_48">The period of two months between laying the regulations and commencement will give acquiring authorities reasonable notice to revise their budgets for compensation. This is similar to the notice period given in previous years for revisions to the home loss payments thresholds.

 The Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) is a non-departmental public body established as a body corporate under the Police Act of 1997. In January 2004, I commissioned an independent, end-to end review of PITO and its business

processes, including its role in the provision of information technology and communications services to the police service.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m03.html_para0"><a name="stpa_49">I am pleased to announce today the publication of the review&#039;s report. The review has provided a critical analysis of the most appropriate structure and organisation to provide information and communications technology to the police, through PITO and from other sources.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m03.html_para1"><a name="stpa_50">The review recommends that PITO should transfer its non-IT responsibilities and transform itself&#151;either as a separate organisation or as a component of the National Policing Improvement Agency&#151;to become a Police National ICT Group, with responsibility and accountability for ICT to the 43 forces in England and Wales. It recommends that this function should be owned by and professionally managed by the police service, with funding flowing from the police authorities, through the establishment of regional collaborations or combined police delivery groups.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m03.html_para2"><a name="stpa_51">The provision of high quality information and communications technology to the police and the criminal justice system is vital, not only to manage efficiency throughout the system, but also to deliver better equipped front line policing. The Government welcome the review&#039;s analysis of the issues we should address but I do not intend to implement its recommendations wholesale. I intend that those PITO responsibilities that support the core functions of the National Policing Improvement Agency, that were outlined in the White Paper on Police Reform, &quot;Building Communities, Beating Crime&quot; in November last year will be rationalised and will transfer to the agency, along with a wide range of functions currently discharged by other national bodies. The considerable value of this report will be its significant contribution to the planning now under way for the new agency.

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="50623m03.html_spmin2"><b>The Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality  (Mr. Tony McNulty): </b> 
 I am today announcing the findings of the review of the Sectors-Based Scheme (SBS). The scheme, which currently has the status of a pilot, was introduced on 1 May 2003 and provided for the issuance of work permits for low skilled vacancies in the hospitality and the food-processing sectors. The scheme is quota based. The current quotas for 2004&#150;05 are 6,000 permits for food processing and 9,000 permits for hospitality. The main aims of the scheme were to alleviate the recruitment difficulties in the relevant sectors by providing employers with a means of recruiting workers from outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m03.html_para3"><a name="stpa_52">Following the decision to grant free movement of work to nationals of the new accession states and in light of the number of accession state nationals undertaking 





<br>&nbsp;<br>23 Jun 2005 : Column 48WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

low-skilled work, we have undertaken a review of the SBS to establish whether there exists an ongoing need for it. In addition, the review has also assessed evidence of any immigration abuse in connection with the scheme. The aims of the review are in line with the Government&#039;s five-year immigration and asylum strategy, published on 7 February 2005. This contained a commitment to phase out the current low-skilled schemes in light of the additional labour now available from the new EU accession states and after consultation with the sectors.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m03.html_para4"><a name="stpa_53">The findings of the review of the SBS are based upon an extensive consultation with the sectors, which has included an employer questionnaire, as well as meetings with employers, sector representative bodies, trade unions and available management information. The review has looked at each sector separately and the main findings are:

</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m03.html_para5"><a name="stpa_54"><i>Food Processing:</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m03.html_para6"><a name="stpa_55">We have found that the SBS has operated satisfactorily in this sector and that there is a continuing need for the scheme. Employers have been able to use the scheme to meet labour shortages in those areas, particularly Northern Ireland, where tight labour markets and the unattractiveness of the work in question have resulted in a difficulty in recruiting resident labour. There is little evidence of abuse of the scheme in this sector. It does appear that workers admitted under the scheme to work in this sector have returned overseas after one year, with a view to participating again in the scheme, as was originally envisaged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m03.html_para7"><a name="stpa_56">While employers in this sector have indicated a willingness to recruit workers from Accession states they have pointed to a difficulty in retaining workers who are free to engage in other, more attractive employment. The consistent message from employers in this sector has been that if the SBS were discontinued, they would face acute difficulties in recruiting the workforce they require without significantly increasing their costs. The likely consequence of their doing so would be that they would face closure. As such the current pilot scheme will be extended for a further 12 months before undergoing a further evaluation. Based upon current usage the annual quota for 2005&#150;06 will be set at least 3,500 permits, but we will consult further with employers to establish the precise figure.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m03.html_para8"><a name="stpa_57"><i>Hospitality sector:</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m03.html_para9"><a name="stpa_58">By contrast, the findings of the review do not point to a compelling case for continuing to operate such a scheme for the hospitality sector. The review points to evidence of abuse of the scheme and a high level of employment of Accession nationals in this sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m03.html_para10"><a name="stpa_59">There is evidence of abuse of the scheme in relation to this sector. This includes numbers of entry clearance refusals on the basis of submission of fraudulent documentation or where, on examination, it is apparent that the individual does not meet the age criteria of the scheme. There is also evidence that third party representatives have submitted applications for SBS permits in respect of fictitious jobs or without the knowledge of the employer specified on the application form. There is, therefore, a concern that the scheme in this sector is being used as a means of facilitating illegal entry.






<br>&nbsp;<br>23 Jun 2005 : Column 49WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m03.html_para11">In addition, many participants in this scheme have been unable to satisfy immigration criteria designed to test their credibility as temporary entrants. It is a criterion of the scheme that entry clearance may be refused to the holder of an SBS permit if the entry clearance officer is not satisfied that the holder will return overseas upon the expiry of his permit. Many SBS participants in the hospitality sector presenting themselves to the visa issuing authorities have been unable to satisfy this test and hence many of the workers the employers have sought to recruit under the hospitality quota have not been admitted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m03.html_para12"><a name="stpa_60">It is also apparent that the hospitality sector in general has been able to draw upon nationals of Accession states to meet labour shortages following expansion of the EU. The latest published figures for the worker registration scheme show that between 1 May 2004 and 31 March 2005, 42,070 Accession nationals registered to undertake employment in the hospitality sector. This represents 25.5 per cent. of the total number of registered workers and is to be contrasted with 8,665 permits issued under the SBS scheme. Retention of these workers appears to be less of an issue in this sector due to its preferred employment practices and the seasonal variance in demand of labour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m03.html_para13"><a name="stpa_61">In view of the above, the consequences of discontinuing the scheme in relation to the hospitality sector in general do not appear to be acute as employers do appear to be drawing upon alternative sources of labour, such as nationals of the new accession states. Any adverse consequences on discontinuing the scheme for this part of the sector are outweighed by the risk of continuing abuse of the scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m03.html_para14"><a name="stpa_62">Accordingly, the SBS hospitality quota will be terminated. This does not mean that employers in this sector will immediately cease to have the benefit of non-EEA workers with the specific skills that they require. As a transitional measure, we will continue to issue SBS permits under the existing quota for the hospitality sector until 31 July or until the current quota is exhausted, whichever is sooner. In addition, many of those admitted as the holder of a SBS permit issued under the current quota have permission to remain for several more months and may remain in employment here until they are due to leave. I should also emphasise that where employers in the hospitality sector require skilled workers from overseas, they may continue to apply for permits under the main work permit scheme.

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="50623m04.html_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Paul Goggins): </b> 
 Section 21 of the Drugs Act 2005 will come into force on 18 July 2005. Section 21 has amended the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 so that any fungi containing psilocin or an ester of psilocin&#151;commonly known as magic mushrooms&#151;are controlled drugs. Psilocin is already a class A drug&#151;fresh magic mushrooms will be class A too.






<br>&nbsp;<br>23 Jun 2005 : Column 50WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m04.html_para0">Magic mushrooms are a powerful hallucinogen and can cause real harm, especially to vulnerable people and those with mental health problems. The law has not been clear with regard to the status of fresh magic mushrooms and some have tried to exploit this apparent loophole. In the last two years there has been a sudden increase in the amount of magic mushrooms imported into the UK&#151;HM Revenue and Customs estimate the imports for 2004 to be between 8&#150;16,000 kilograms. The Government have acted to close the loophole by making clear that it will not allow the open sale of fresh magic mushrooms. It is now an offence to import, export, produce, supply, possess or possess with intent to supply magic mushrooms whatever form they are in, whether prepared or fresh. This is a clarification of the law not a reclassification. These measures received cross party support during the passage of the Drugs Bill through Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m04.html_para1"><a name="stpa_63">The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs agreed that the law on magic mushrooms would benefit from clarification. Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, Chair of the Council, wrote to me on 2 June stating that &quot;Council members accepted entirely that there should not be easy access to hallucinogenic mushrooms&quot; and &quot;this was a sensible move to clarify the law&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m04.html_para2"><a name="stpa_64">During the Commons Committee stage of the Drugs Bill, the Government undertook to bring in regulations dealing with exceptions from the offence of possession in certain circumstances. The Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2005 are being laid before Parliament today and are due to come into force on 18 July 2005. The regulations amend the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 to provide exceptions from the offence of possession of magic mushrooms. For example, a person will not be committing an offence of possession of magic mushrooms if the mushrooms are growing naturally and uncultivated on their premises.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50623m04.html_para3"><a name="stpa_65">Also to be laid at the same time is the Misuse of Drugs (Designation) (Amendment) Order 2005.
