The new strategy sets out the context for the Government’s approach for trade and investment, including through the recent trade and investment White Paper and growth review. It identifies pathways to balanced growth through trade and investment. It announces the new focus for our trade and investment promotion efforts. Finally, it explains new ways of working for UKTI. It will run from now to 2015. Alongside it a BIS Economics paper is to be published. “Trade and Investment: the Economic Rationale for Government Support”. Copies of the new UKTI strategy have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

 Few things are more important than helping and protecting vulnerable children and young people. I am reminded daily of the immense dedication of professionals and their unstinting efforts to keep children and young people safe. Despite this, the system is not working as well as it should. That is why, in June last year, the Secretary of State for Education, asked Professor Eileen Munro to conduct a wide-ranging independent review to improve child protection.</p>

Discussion by Ministers of priorities for the road map touched on renewables deployment, infrastructure, low-carbon development, the importance of giving the right investment signals and the need for scenarios to be underpinned with robust analysis, including of costs.

            <p>State. The convention has been that retired circuit judges or recorder QC judges who chair the cases must refrain from chairing cases once five years post retirement has passed.

I also recognise that requiring retired circuit judges or recorders to refrain from sitting after five years on the panel, in the absence of other factors to suggest they are not suitable, removes individuals with significant and continuing experience of working in this specialist jurisdiction.
